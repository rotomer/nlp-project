Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition Net Sales The principal factors affecting changes in net sales in the three years ended December 31, 2002 were changes in unit volume (including the added net sales of acquired businesses), changes in product mix and average selling prices and foreign currency translation. Net sales in 2002 increased 4% to $3,204,256,000 compared with $3,067,482,000 for 2001, which were essentially even compared with $3,067,714,000 in 2000. 10 The increase in net sales in 2002 was primarily due to higher unit volume for certain products and, to a lesser extent, the added net sales of acquired businesses, partially offset by unfavorable changes in product price/mix. Foreign currency translation had a modestly favorable impact of approximately $17,000,000 in 2002. Net sales in 2001 were essentially even compared to 2000 due to the net effect of added net sales of acquired businesses, offset by lower unit volume for certain products and the negative effect of foreign currency translation. Foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact of approximately $75,000,000 in 2001. Excluding the negative effect of foreign currency translation, net sales would have increased 2% compared to 2000. The favorable impact of foreign currency translation on net sales in 2002 was primarily due to the strengthening of foreign currencies in Europe and the Asia Pacific region compared with the U.S. dollar, partially offset by the weakness of the Argentine peso and the Brazilian real. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation on net sales in 2001 was primarily due to the weakness of foreign currencies in the Asia Pacific region, Europe and Latin America compared with the U.S. dollar. Net sales from operations in the United States represented approximately 55% of net sales in each of 2002, 2001 and 2000. Net sales from U.S. operations increased approximately 5% in 2002 to $1,758,761,000 compared with $1,680,204,000 for 2001. This increase was primarily due to higher unit volume for certain products and, to a lesser extent, the added net sales of acquired businesses, partially offset by unfavorable changes in product price/mix. Net sales from U.S. operations in 2001 decreased approximately 1% to $1,680,204,000 compared to $1,689,467,000 in 2000. This decrease was primarily due to lower unit volume for certain products, partially offset by the added net sales of acquired businesses. Net sales from foreign operations increased approximately 4% in 2002 to $1,445,495,000 compared with $1,387,278,000 for 2001 primarily due to higher unit volume for certain products and, to a lesser extent, approximately $17,000,000 from the favorable impact of foreign currency translation discussed above. Excluding the positive effect of foreign currency translation, net sales from foreign operations would have increased 3% compared to 2001. Net sales from foreign operations increased 1% in 2001 to $1,387,278,000 compared with $1,378,247,000 in 2000 due primarily to the added net sales of acquired businesses, partially offset by the negative effect of foreign currency translation of approximately $75,000,000 discussed above. Excluding the negative effect of foreign currency translation, net sales from foreign operations would have increased 6% compared to 2000. Net sales of the Companys food packaging segment, which consists primarily of the Companys Cryovac&reg; food packaging products, constituted 61% of net sales in each of 2002 and 2001, and 60% in 2000. Net sales of the Companys protective and specialty packaging segment, which includes the aggregation of the Companys protective packaging products, engineered products and shrink packaging products, all of which are used principally for non food packaging applications, constituted the balance of net sales. Food Packaging Segment Sales Net sales of food packaging products increased 4% in 2002 to $1,958,078,000 compared to $1,880,281,000 in 2001 and increased 2% in 2001 compared to $1,837,294,000 in 2000. The increase in 2002 was primarily due to higher unit volume for certain products. Foreign currency translation had a modestly favorable impact on this segment of approximately $10,000,000 in 2002. The increase in 2001 was due to the added net sales of acquired businesses and, to a lesser extent, higher average selling prices and higher unit volume for certain products, partially offset by approximately $50,000,000 from the negative effect of foreign currency translation. Excluding this negative effect of foreign currency translation, net sales would have increased 5% in 2001 compared to 2000. Early in 2001, this segment experienced disruptions due to reductions in meat supply caused by an outbreak of foot and mouth 11 disease and declines in beef consumption resulting from concerns over bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or "mad cow" disease), principally in Europe. As these concerns abated in the third and fourth quarters of 2001, supply and consumption returned to more normal levels. Among the classes of products in the food packaging segment, in 2002 net sales of flexible packaging materials and related systems increased 4% to $1,657,185,000 compared with $1,592,142,000 for 2001, which were essentially even compared with $1,599,230,000 in 2000. Net sales increased in 2002 primarily due to higher unit volume for certain products. Foreign currency translation had a modestly favorable impact of approximately $6,000,000 in 2002 for flexible materials and related systems. Net sales of these products in 2001 were flat compared to 2000 due to the net effect of higher average selling prices for certain flexible packaging materials, and to a lesser extent, the added net sales of acquired businesses, offset by approximately $44,000,000 from the negative effect of foreign currency translation. Excluding this negative effect of foreign currency translation, net sales of flexible packaging materials and related systems would have increased 2% in 2001. Net sales of rigid packaging and absorbent pads increased 4% to $300,893,000 in 2002 compared with $288,139,000 for 2001 and increased 21% in 2001 compared with $238,064,000 in 2000. The increase in net sales in these products in 2002 was primarily due to favorable changes in product price/mix, and to a lesser extent, a favorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $4,000,000. Excluding the positive effect of foreign currency translation, net sales of rigid packaging and absorbent pads would have increased 3% in 2002. The increase in 2001 was primarily due to the added net sales of the Dolphin Packaging business, which was acquired in 2000, and other smaller businesses, and to a lesser extent, higher unit volume for certain products, partially offset by a negative effect of foreign currency translation of approximately $6,000,000. Excluding the negative effect of foreign currency translation, net sales of rigid packaging and absorbent pads would have increased 23% in 2001. Protective and Specialty Packaging Segment Sales Net sales of protective and specialty packaging products increased 5% to $1,246,178,000 in 2002 compared with $1,187,201,000 in 2001 but decreased 4% in 2001 compared with $1,230,420,000 in 2000. The increase in 2002 was primarily due to higher unit volume for certain products and the added net sales of acquired businesses, partially offset by unfavorable changes in product price/mix. Foreign currency translation had a modestly favorable impact in 2002 of approximately $7,000,000 for the protective and specialty packaging segment. The decrease in net sales in 2001 was due primarily to lower unit volume for certain products due to the recessionary environment and, to a lesser extent, approximately $25,000,000 from the negative effect of foreign currency translation, partially offset by the added net sales of acquired businesses. Excluding this negative effect of foreign currency translation, net sales would have decreased 2% in 2001. Costs and Margins Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 33.0% in 2002, 32.3% in 2001 and 33.7% in 2000. The increase in 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily due to higher unit volumes in both reportable business segments. The decrease in 2001 was primarily due to lower sales volume of certain protective and specialty packaging products as well as changes in product mix compared to the 2000 period and was partially offset by lower costs for certain raw materials. Marketing, administrative and development expenses increased 6% in 2002 but declined 1% in 2001. The increase in 2002 was primarily due to higher expenses for certain corporate projects, insurance costs, the effects of businesses acquired and the impact of foreign currency translation. The decline in 2001 was attributable to cost control measures and the impact of foreign currency translation. Marketing, administrative and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were 16.9% in 2002, 16.7% in 2001 and 16.8% in 2000. 12 Beginning January 1, 2002, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, the Company ceased recording goodwill amortization expense in its consolidated statement of operations. Goodwill amortization expense was $57,005,000 in 2001 and $51,776,000 in 2000. The increase in 2001 compared to 2000 was due to acquisitions. See below under "Recently Issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards" for a discussion of this new standard. 2001 Restructuring Program During 2001, based primarily on weakening economic conditions, especially in the U.S., the Company conducted a review of its business to reduce costs and expenses, simplify business processes and organizational structure, and to refine further the Companys manufacturing operations and product offerings. As a result of such review, which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company announced and began implementing a restructuring program that resulted in charges to operations of $32,805,000 for 2001. Such charges included the following: Year Ended December 31, 2001 Employee termination costs $ 23,877,000 Facility exit costs 1,641,000 Long lived asset impairments 7,287,000 Total $ 32,805,000 The portion of this restructuring charge related to the Companys food packaging segment was $21,116,000 and the portion applicable to the protective and specialty packaging segment was $11,689,000. The Company originally expected to incur $25,518,000 of cash outlays to carry out this restructuring program. Such cash outlays included primarily severance and other personnel related costs as well as lease and other contractual arrangement termination costs. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had made total cash payments of approximately $17,600,000, of which approximately $11,779,000 were made in 2002 and $5,821,000 were made in 2001. The cash restructuring liability recorded in 2001 of $25,518,000 was adjusted in 2002 for a net credit of $1,348,000, discussed below. After such cash outlays and the net credit, the restructuring liability at December 31, 2002 was $6,570,000, representing cash outlays expected to be made in 2003 and future years, primarily for severance related costs. The 2001 restructuring program was substantially completed at December 31, 2002. The long lived asset impairment of $7,287,000 included the following write downs and write offs: Year Ended December 31, 2001 Property, plant and equipment $ 3,877,000 Goodwill 3,342,000 Certain other long lived assets 68,000 Total $ 7,287,000 These long lived asset impairments related to decisions to rationalize and realign production of certain small product lines and to close several manufacturing and warehouse facilities in North America, Europe, South Africa and the Asia Pacific region. The annual reduction of depreciation and amortization expense as a result of such asset impairments was $365,000. The Company has disposed of all of the above property, plant and equipment. During 2002, the Company made an adjustment to the original 2001 restructuring provision, resulting in a net credit to the consolidated statement of operations of $1,348,000. The portion of this net credit 13 related to the Companys food packaging segment amounted to a credit of $2,957,000, while the portion applicable to the protective and specialty packaging segment amounted to a charge of $1,609,000. Such adjustment resulted from the completion of certain actions for amounts different than expected, certain headcount reductions obtained through attrition, and the revision of a plan to shut down one of the Companys manufacturing facilities. As a result of the 2002 adjustments to the 2001 restructuring program, the Company now expects a net reduction in headcount of approximately 440 positions. This program originally estimated a net headcount reduction of approximately 470. The revised net headcount reduction was reduced by approximately 30 positions that were eliminated by attrition. This net reduction consists of the elimination of 677 positions from all geographic areas in which the Company does business but primarily from its manufacturing, sales and marketing functions in North America and Europe. As of December 31, 2002, 657 of these 677 positions had been eliminated. The Company also anticipates the addition of 237 positions in connection with its realignment or relocation of certain manufacturing activities. The Company estimates that approximately $23,000,000 in annualized cost savings (on a full year run rate basis) were realized by the end of 2002. The estimated annual cost savings include the $365,000 non cash annual reduction of depreciation expense discussed above. Although certain cost aspects of the original program have been adjusted, the original cost saving targets have been maintained. Operating Profit Operating profit increased 33% in 2002 but decreased 17% in 2001. The increase in 2002 was primarily due to increased net sales, the discontinuance in 2002 of the amortization of goodwill and the restructuring and other charges incurred in 2001, while a restructuring credit was recorded in 2002. Excluding goodwill amortization in 2001 of $57,005,000 and restructuring and other credits in 2002 of $1,348,000 and restructuring and other charges in 2001 of $32,805,000, operating profit would have increased 8% in 2002. The decrease in 2001 was primarily due to the 2001 restructuring and other charges and the lower gross profit discussed above. As a percentage of net sales, operating profit was 16.1% in 2002, 12.6% in 2001 and 15.3% in 2000. Excluding goodwill amortization and restructuring and other (credits) charges, operating profit as a percentage of net sales was 16.1% in 2002, 15.6% in 2001 and 16.9% in 2000. In 2000, goodwill amortization was $51,776,000 and restructuring and other credits was $1,247,000. The food packaging segment contributed 60%, 58% and 54% of the Companys operating profit in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, before taking into consideration corporate operating expenses and restructuring and other (credits) charges. The Companys protective and specialty packaging segment contributed the balance of operating profit. Corporate operating expenses in 2001 and 2000 consisted primarily of goodwill amortization. Asbestos Settlement and Related Costs On November 27, 2002, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the appropriate parties to resolve all current and future asbestos related claims made against it and its affiliates in connection with the Cryovac Transaction. The settlement will also resolve the fraudulent transfer claims, as well as indemnification claims by Fresenius, that had been made against the Company in connection with the Cryovac Transaction. On December 3, 2002, the agreement in principle was approved by the Companys Board of Directors. The Company was advised that both of the Committees had approved the agreement in principle as of December 5, 2002. For a description of the Cryovac Transaction, asbestos related claims and the parties involved, see "Other Matters Cryovac Transaction" and "Other Matters Contingencies Related to the Cryovac Transaction" below. 14 The Company recorded a charge of $850,118,000 as a result of the asbestos settlement in the consolidated statement of operations as of December 31, 2002. Such expense consisted of the following items: a non cash charge of $512,500,000 covering a cash payment required to be made by the Company upon the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy of New Grace. Because it is uncertain when such a plan of reorganization may become effective, this liability has been recorded as a current liability on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2002. Under the terms of the settlement, this amount accrues interest at a 5.5% annual rate from December 21, 2002 to the date of payment. Such interest through December 31, 2002, amounted to $861,000 and is included in interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations and in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. a non cash charge of $321,480,000 representing the fair market value of 9,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock reserved for issuance pursuant to such settlement upon the effectiveness of New Graces plan of reorganization. Such shares are subject to customary anti dilution provisions (including the effects of stock splits, stock dividends and certain other events affecting the Companys common stock). Such fair market value was $35.72 per common share as of the close of business on December 5, 2002. Such amount has been recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2002 as follows: $900,000 representing the aggregate par value of such shares has been recorded in common stock reserved for issuance related to the asbestos settlement and the remaining $320,580,000, representing the excess of the aggregate fair market value over the aggregate par value of such common shares, has been recorded in additional paid in capital. The shares of common stock reserved for issuance related to the asbestos settlement are not reflected in the 2002 loss per common share calculations since the effect would be anti dilutive (i.e., would reduce the loss per common share). $16,138,000 of legal and related fees. In 2001, other expense in the consolidated statement of operations included $11,995,000 of expense of which $8,149,000 was primarily a result of the Companys guarantee, entered into at the time of the Cryovac Transaction, of certain debt payable by W. R. Grace & Co. Conn., which filed for reorganization along with New Grace, and $3,846,000 of legal and related fees. Interest Expense and Other Income (Expense), net Including 2002 interest expense relating to the asbestos settlement discussed above, interest expense decreased 15% in 2002 but increased 18% in 2001. The decrease in 2002 was primarily due to lower average levels of outstanding debt. The increase in 2001 was primarily due to higher average levels of debt outstanding during 2001 compared to the corresponding 2000 period primarily due to additional borrowings made in 2000 in connection with business acquisitions and stock repurchases made under the Companys stock repurchase program. Other income (expense), net, consisted of income of $7,114,000 in 2002, expense of $1,546,000 in 2001 and income of $9,479,000 in 2000. The change in 2002 compared to 2001 was due to lower net foreign exchange losses during 2002. The change in 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to a one time cash fee of $10,000,000 received in 2000 from a third party for the assignment of a contract. Income Taxes The Companys effective income tax rate was a benefit of 21.1% in 2002 compared to an expense of 47.3% in 2001 and 45.5% in 2000. The effective tax rate in 2002 was lower than 2001 due primarily to the impact of the asbestos settlement and its related costs and the discontinuance of goodwill 15 amortization in 2002. The effective tax rate in 2001 was higher than 2000 due primarily to lower earnings before income taxes. In 2002, the effective tax rate was lower than the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate primarily due to the effect of the estimated tax benefit for the asbestos settlement. In 2001 and 2000, the effective tax rates were higher than the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate primarily due to the non deductibility of goodwill amortization for tax purposes and, to a lesser extent, state income taxes. Net (Loss) Earnings As a result of the asbestos settlement and related costs of $850,118,000 in 2002, the Company had a net loss of $309,069,000 in 2002 compared to net earnings of $156,697,000 in 2001. Net earnings decreased 30% to $156,697,000 in 2001 compared to $225,319,000 in 2000. Excluding goodwill amortization of $57,005,000 and $51,776,000 in 2001 and 2000, respectively, net earnings would have been $213,702,000 in 2001 and $277,095,000 in 2000. Basic (loss) earnings per common share were $(4.20) for 2002, $1.30 for 2001 and $2.47 for 2000. Diluted (loss) earnings per common share were $(4.30) for 2002, $1.22 for 2001 and $1.93 for 2000. Excluding goodwill amortization in 2001 and 2000, basic earnings per common share would have been $1.99 and $3.08, respectively, and diluted earnings per common share would have been $1.89 and $2.52 in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The basic earnings per common share calculations for 2002, 2001 and 2000 include $0.12, $0.09 and $0.54 per share of gains (excess of book value over repurchase price of preferred stock), respectively, attributable to the repurchase of preferred stock in the period. To calculate diluted earnings per common share, the excess of book value over the repurchase price of the Companys Series A Preferred Stock in 2002, 2001 and 2000 of $10,291,000, $7,456,000 and $45,283,000, respectively, were excluded from the calculations. The diluted earnings per common share in each period were calculated assuming conversion of the shares of preferred stock repurchased during each of the respective periods in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D 53 guidance. The effect of the conversion of the Companys outstanding convertible preferred stock was not considered in the calculations of diluted earnings per common share for any of the 2002, 2001 and 2000 periods presented because the effect would be antidilutive, since such assumed conversions may be included only if the resulting impact would dilute earnings per common share. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and amounts available under the Companys existing lines of credit, which are described below. Asbestos Settlement As noted above, the Company recorded a non cash charge of $512,500,000 in 2002 covering a cash payment required to be made by the Company upon the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy of New Grace. No cash was used in 2002 with respect to this liability, and it is currently uncertain when the Company will be required to make this payment. The Company currently expects to fund this payment either by using accumulated cash and future cash flows from operations, from the proceeds of future financings or from a combination of such alternatives. 16  Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $323,939,000 in 2002, $578,693,000 in 2001 and $329,413,000 in 2000. The decrease in 2002 was primarily due to the following: changes in receivables interests sold under the Receivables Facility (described below); at December 31, 2002 the financial institutions participating in the facility held no interests in the Companys U.S. accounts receivable while at December 31, 2001, those institutions held $95,600,000 of such interests; and changes in operating assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of business, as discussed below under "Changes in Working Capital"; partially offset by: increased earnings, excluding the non cash impact of the asbestos settlement. The increase in 2001 was primarily due to the following: changes in operating assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of business, as discussed below under "Changes in Working Capital"; and the implementation of the Receivables Facility in 2001 (described below); partially offset by: the Companys lower net earnings in 2001. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities amounted to $96,888,000 in 2002, $177,932,000 in 2001 and $348,989,000 in 2000. In each year, investing activities consisted primarily of capital expenditures and acquisitions. The decrease in net cash used in these activities in 2002 was due to lower levels of capital expenditures and, to a lesser extent, acquisitions. The decrease in net cash used in 2001 was due to a lower level of acquisition activity, partially offset by a higher level of capital expenditures. In 2002, cash used to complete acquisitions was $10,465,000 compared to $36,007,000 in 2001 and $237,541,000 in 2000. In each year, cash used for acquisitions was net of cash acquired in those acquisitions. Cash acquired in acquisitions was not material in 2002 or 2001 and was $8,589,000 in 2000. The Company did not assume any debt in acquisitions in 2002. In 2001 and 2000, the Company assumed approximately $19,000,000 and $16,600,000, respectively, of debt in acquisitions. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $91,625,000 in 2002, $146,277,000 in 2001 and $114,197,000 in 2000. Capital expenditures for the Companys food packaging segment amounted to $61,823,000, $103,837,000 and $75,773,000 and for the protective and specialty packaging segment amounted to $29,802,000, $42,440,000 and $38,424,000 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The decrease in capital expenditures in 2002 was primarily due to improved productivity of existing assets allowing the Company to defer spending on incremental capacity. The increase in capital expenditures in 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to the management of capital planning and project spending. The Company currently anticipates that capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2003 will be in the range of $125,000,000 to $150,000,000. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities amounted to $101,501,000 in 2002 and $402,583,000 in 2001, while net cash provided by financing activities amounted to $7,671,000 in 2000. The Company continued to 17 reduce outstanding debt in 2002 and made net debt repayments of $35,752,000 compared to $312,907,000 in 2001. During 2001, the Company paid off the predecessor of the 364 Day Facility (defined below) and most of the borrowings under the 2003 Facility (also defined below), which resulted in lower outstanding bank borrowings at December 31, 2001. All remaining borrowings under the 2003 Facility were paid off during 2002. The 2002 period also reflects a timing difference relating to the payment of dividends on the Companys outstanding Series A convertible preferred stock, partially offset by an increase in cash used to repurchase shares of the Companys preferred stock. Such timing difference on the dividends arose from the Companys pre funding in December 2001 of the dividend payable on January 2, 2002. The aggregate dollar amount of that dividend was approximately $13,682,000. The Company funded the remaining dividends payable on such preferred stock in 2002 on the payment dates, which were the first business days of each calendar quarter. The increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2001 reflected primarily net debt repayments of $312,907,000 and the timing difference relating to the payment of dividends on the Companys outstanding Series A convertible preferred stock, discussed above, partially offset by a decrease in cash used to purchase the Companys capital stock. Proceeds from long term debt in 2001 included $295,773,000 of net proceeds from the issuance on June 26, 2001 of $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 8.75% Senior Notes due July 1, 2008 (the "8.75% Senior Notes"). Included in financing activities in 2002, 2001 and 2000 are proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $917,000, $504,000 and $861,000, respectively. These stock options were granted prior to 1998 and were exercised pursuant to plans in which certain employees of the Cryovac packaging business participated. The stock option plans were terminated effective March 31, 1998 in connection with the Cryovac Transaction, except with respect to options that were still outstanding as of such date. Repurchases of Capital Stock During 2002, the Company repurchased 782,500 shares of its preferred stock at a cost of approximately $28,834,000. During 2001, the Company repurchased 524,220 shares of its preferred stock at a cost of approximately $18,754,000. During 2000, the Company repurchased 7,384,637 shares of its preferred stock and 494,737 shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $323,948,000 and $22,873,000, respectively. The average price per share of these preferred stock repurchases was $36.85, $35.78 and $43.87 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The average price per share of the common stock repurchases in 2000 was $46.23. The share repurchases described above were made pursuant to programs previously adopted by the Companys Board of Directors. The currently effective share repurchase program authorizes the repurchase of up to 16,977,000 shares of common stock (including Series A convertible preferred stock on an as converted basis). As of December 31, 2002, approximately 9,452,000 shares of common stock on an as converted basis had been repurchased, and approximately 7,525,000 shares remain authorized for repurchase. Changes in Working Capital At December 31, 2002, the Companys working capital was a net liability of $96,496,000, primarily due to recording as a current liability the $512,500,000 portion of the asbestos settlement liability to be funded in cash, compared to working capital that was a net asset of $149,372,000, or 4% of total assets, at December 31, 2001. The other changes to working capital, excluding the asbestos settlement liability, were primarily the following changes in the ordinary course of business: increase in other current liabilities, primarily due to the timing of payments, which included payroll related costs, customer volume rebates, income taxes payable and the dividend payable 18 on January 2, 2002 on the Companys outstanding Series A convertible preferred stock discussed above, partially offset by a decrease in the restructuring liability due to cash payments of approximately $11,779,000 made during 2002; increase in accounts payable, partially due to the timing of payments to vendors and to a lesser extent, the increased levels of inventory as discussed below; partially offset by: increase in cash; increase of approximately $128,600,000 in notes and accounts receivable primarily due to activities under the Receivables Facility (described below) and, to a lesser extent, increased net sales during the fourth quarter of 2002 compared to the fourth quarter of 2001; increase in inventory, primarily due to increased raw material prices; and decrease in short term borrowings, primarily due to changes in short term liquidity requirements, including the refinancing of certain short term borrowings with long term debt. Current and Quick Ratios The ratio of current assets to current liabilities (current ratio) was 0.9 at December 31, 2002 and 1.2 at December 31, 2001. The ratio of current assets less inventory to current liabilities (quick ratio) was 0.6 at December 31, 2002 and 0.8 at December 31, 2001. Accounts Receivable Facility In December 2001, the Company and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries entered into an accounts receivable securitization program (the "Receivables Facility") with a bank (the "Bank") and an issuer of commercial paper administered by the Bank (the "ICP"). Under the Receivables Facility, the Companys two primary operating subsidiaries, Cryovac, Inc. and Sealed Air Corporation (US) (the "Originators"), sell all of their eligible U.S. accounts receivable to Sealed Air Funding Corporation ("SA Funding Corp."), an indirectly wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that was formed for the sole purpose of entering into the Receivables Facility. SA Funding Corp. in turn may sell undivided ownership interests in these receivables ("Receivables Interests") to the Bank and the ICP, subject to certain conditions, up to a maximum of $125,000,000 of Receivables Interests outstanding from time to time. SA Funding Corp. retains the receivables it purchases from the Originators, except those as to which Receivables Interests are sold by it to the Bank or the ICP. Sales of accounts receivable by the Originators to SA Funding Corp. and sales of Receivables Interests from SA Funding Corp. to the Bank and the ICP have been structured as "true sales" under applicable laws, and the assets of SA Funding Corp. are not available to pay any creditors of the Company or of its subsidiaries or affiliates. These transactions are accounted for as sales of receivables under the provisions of SFAS No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities." In order to secure the performance of their obligations under the Receivables Facility, SA Funding Corp. and the Originators granted a first priority security interest to the Bank, as agent, in certain collateral, including accounts receivable owned by them and proceeds and collections of those receivables. The Bank and the ICP have no recourse to the Companys, the Originators or SA Funding Corp.s other assets for any losses resulting from the financial inability of customers to pay amounts due on the receivables when they become due. As long as a termination event with respect to the Receivables Facility has not occurred, the Originators service, administer and collect the receivables under the Receivables Facility as agent on behalf of SA Funding Corp., the Bank and the ICP. Prior to a termination event under the Receivables Facility, collections of receivables not otherwise required to 19 be paid to the Bank or the ICP are used by SA Funding Corp. to purchase new eligible receivables from the Originators. The Company has undertaken to cause the Originators to perform their obligations under the Receivables Facility. The scheduled expiration date for the Receivables Facility is December 7, 2004. The Bank has extended its commitment to make purchases of Receivables Interests from SA Funding Corp. from December 7, 2002 to January 26, 2004. However, under the terms of the extension, SA Funding Corp. may not sell any Receivables Interests to the Bank or the ICP until a definitive settlement agreement, satisfactory to the Bank, has been entered into relating to the asbestos settlement. Under certain limited circumstances, the Bank and the ICP can terminate purchases of Receivables Interests prior to the above dates. Events that could result in termination of the Receivables Facility include a downgrade of the Companys long term senior unsecured debt to BB or below by Standard & Poors Rating Services ("Standard & Poors") or Ba3 or below by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. ("Moodys"), and failure to comply with interest coverage and debt leverage ratios. In connection with recording the accounting charge in the fourth quarter of 2002 for the asbestos settlement and related costs, the Company requested and received a waiver of compliance with the interest coverage and leverage ratios provided for in the Receivables Facility. After reflecting such waiver, the Company was in compliance with the requirements of the Receivables Facility as of December 31, 2002. Since such waiver was as of December 31, 2002, the Company anticipates that it will request a waiver or amendment for future applicable periods. The Receivables Facility provides for the payment from time to time of program fees which, after the Banks extension of the Facility to January 2004, were 0.45% per annum (0.375% per annum at December 31, 2002) on the Receivables Interests sold by SA Funding Corp. and commitment fees which were 0.40% per annum (0.325% per annum at December 31, 2002) on the unused portion of the $125,000,000 Receivables Facility. During 2002, SA Funding Corp. sold Receivables Interests to the ICP from time to time; however, as of December 31, 2002, neither the Bank nor the ICP held any Receivables Interests. In December 2001, receivables sold by the Originators to SA Funding Corp. amounted to approximately $176,900,000. SA Funding Corp. in turn sold Receivables Interests of $95,600,000 under the Receivables Facility, and this amount was removed from the Companys consolidated balance sheet. This amount was used to pay down certain of the Companys outstanding borrowings. SA Funding Corp. retained the remaining $81,300,000 of receivables that it acquired from the Originators. These retained receivables at December 31, 2001 were included in notes and accounts receivable on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. The carrying amount of the retained receivables approximates fair value because of the relatively short term nature of the receivables. The costs associated with the Receivables Facility are included in other income (expense), net in the Companys consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. These costs primarily relate to the loss on the sale of the Receivables Interests to the Bank or the ICP, which were approximately $409,000 and $75,000 for 2002 and 2001, respectively, and program and commitment fees and other associated costs, which were approximately $400,000 and $343,000 for 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company considers that, when available, the Receivables Facility provides an additional source of short term liquidity to the Company. 20 Outstanding Indebtedness At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Companys total debt outstanding consisted of the amounts set forth on the following table (amounts in table in thousands of dollars): December 31, 2002 December 31, 2001 Short term borrowings and current portion of long term debt: Short term borrowings $ 53,355 $ 135,548 Current portion of long term debt 2,049 1,943 Total current debt 55,404 137,491 Long term debt, less current portion: Revolving Credit Agreement due March 2003 7,539 5.625% Euro Notes due July 2006, less discount of $790 and $844 in 2002 and 2001, respectively(1) 205,228 175,666 8.75% Senior Notes due July 2008, less discount of $1,201 and $3,999 in 2002 and 2001, respectively 298,799 296,001 6.95% Senior Notes due May 2009, less discount of $1,550 and $1,736 in 2002 and 2001, respectively 298,450 298,264 Other 65,553 10,641 Total long term debt, less current portion 868,030 788,111 Total debt $ 923,434 $ 925,602 (1)The carrying value of the Euro Notes increased approximately $29,000, primarily as a result of the strengthening of the euro compared to the U.S. dollar during 2002. In March 2002, the Company refinanced a portion of its short term borrowings in Australia and New Zealand under an Australian dollar 175,000,000 (approximately U.S. $92,300,000 at the then current exchange rate) dual currency revolving credit facility that expires on March 12, 2005 (the "ANZ Facility"). This facility was made available to certain of the Companys Australian and New Zealand subsidiaries by a syndicate of banks, and such borrowings are guaranteed by the Company. The amount outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2002 was approximately $57,500,000. Such amount is included in other long term debt in the table above. Substantially all the Companys short term borrowings of $53,355,000 at December 31, 2002 were outstanding under lines of credit available to various of the Companys U.S. and foreign subsidiaries. Amounts available under these credit lines as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 were approximately $209,000,000 and $326,000,000, respectively, of which approximately $155,000,000 and $190,000,000, respectively, were unused. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company had available committed and uncommitted lines of credit, including the credit lines discussed above, of approximately $832,000,000 and $1,046,000,000, respectively, of which approximately $721,000,000 and $903,000,000 respectively, were unused. Such credit lines include amounts available under the 2003 Facility (defined below), the 364 Day Facility (defined below) at December 31, 2001 and other lines of credit available to the Companys subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2002, the total lines of credit of $832,000,000, include committed lines of credit of approximately $622,000,000 and uncommitted lines of credit of approximately $210,000,000. Such committed lines of credit primarily include the 2003 Facility and the ANZ Facility. The Company is not subject to any material compensating balance requirements in connection with its lines of credit. At December 31, 2002, the Companys principal revolving credit facility was a $525,000,000 facility that expires on March 30, 2003 (the "2003 Facility"). The Company has considered various financing 21 alternatives for the replacement of the 2003 Facility. The Company believes that its current financial resources and cash flows do not require that the Company replace the 2003 Facility, since its net cash provided by operating activities, net of cash used in investing activities, together with its cash on hand and amounts available under other committed lines of credit, are adequate to meet its current operating and investing needs as well as to pay its current debt obligations at December 31, 2002 of $55,404,000. In 2002, the Companys operating activities provided net cash of $323,939,000, and its investing activities used net cash of $96,888,000. While the Company expects it will be able to obtain any additional financing required for general corporate needs, including the funding of the cash payment for the asbestos settlement when it is required to be made upon the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy of New Grace, there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to the Company on commercially favorable terms. As of December 31, 2002, facility fees were payable at the rate of 0.095% per annum under the 2003 Facility on the total amounts available under the credit facility. The obligations under the 2003 Facility bear interest at floating rates. The floating rates are generally determined by adding the applicable borrowing margin to the interbank rate for the relevant currency and time period. The weighted average interest rate for outstanding borrowings under the 2003 Facility was approximately 4.2% at December 31, 2001. There were no borrowings outstanding under the 2003 Facility as of December 31, 2002. The 2003 Facility provides for changes in borrowing margins based on the Companys long term senior unsecured debt ratings and certain financial criteria. The 2003 Facility, the ANZ Facility, the Euro Notes, the 8.75% Senior Notes and the 6.95% Senior Notes impose limitations on the operations of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. These limitations include, depending upon the debt in question, financial covenants relating to interest coverage and debt leverage as well as restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the creation of liens, sale and leaseback transactions, mergers and acquisitions and certain dispositions of assets. In connection with recording the accounting charge in the fourth quarter of 2002 for the asbestos settlement and related costs, the Company requested and received a waiver of compliance with the interest coverage and leverage ratios provided for in the 2003 Facility. After reflecting such waiver, the Company was in compliance with the requirements of each of the above instruments as of December 31, 2002. The Company had a 364 day $194,375,000 revolving credit facility (the "364 Day Facility") that the Company allowed to expire on March 22, 2002. No borrowings were outstanding under this Facility at the time of its expiration or at December 31, 2001. The Companys cost of capital and ability to obtain external financing may be affected by its debt ratings, which are periodically reviewed by the credit rating agencies. The Companys long term senior unsecured debt is currently rated Baa3 (negative outlook) by Moodys and BBB (credit watch with negative implications) by Standard & Poors. These ratings are among the ratings assigned by each of these organizations for investment grade long term senior unsecured debt. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. In June 2002, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements (with a total notional amount of $50,000,000) that were qualified and designated as fair value hedges in accordance with SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138. These agreements were entered into in order to, among other things, convert a portion of the 8.75% Senior Notes fixed rate debt into floating rate debt. During September 2002, the Company terminated these swaps and reflected a basis adjustment to the 8.75% Senior Notes for a portion of the cash received of approximately $2,416,000. Such amount is being amortized and reflected as a component of interest expense over the remaining life of the 8.75% 22 Senior Notes. The Company was not party to any interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2002 or 2001. The following table summarizes the Companys material contractual obligations at December 31, 2002, that require cash outlays in 2003 and future years (amounts in table in thousands of dollars): Payments Due by Period Total 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter Short term borrowings $ 53,355 $ 53,355 $ $ $ Current portion of long term debt 2,049 2,049 Long term debt, exclusive of debt discounts 871,571 61,986 208,302 601,283 Total debt(1) 926,975 55,404 61,986 208,302 601,283 Series A convertible preferred stock(2) 2,136,478 53,080 106,160 106,160 1,871,078 Operating leases 88,383 23,758 32,722 19,780 12,123 Cash portion of the asbestos settlement, including accrued interest as of December 31, 2002(3) 513,361 513,361 Long term equipment purchases for resale 36,000 3,500 8,400 10,500 13,600 Raw material contingent payment 9,500 9,500 Total contractual cash obligations $ 3,710,697 $ 649,103 $ 209,268 $ 344,742 $ 2,507,584 (1)Includes principal maturities only. (2)Assumes dividends are declared and paid each quarter until March 31, 2018, based on shares outstanding at December 31, 2002, and that no shares are converted to common stock or otherwise retired. The total cash outlay of $2,136,478 includes $1,327,005 for the $50.00 per share redemption value and $809,473 for the amount of the dividends assumed to be declared and paid each quarter until March 31, 2018. (3)This liability is reflected as a current liability due to the uncertainty of the timing of payment (as discussed below). Interest accrues on this amount at a rate of 5.5% per annum until it becomes due and payable. In addition to the obligation to pay the principal amount of the debt obligations discussed above, the Company is obligated under the terms of various leases covering many of the facilities that it occupies, substantially all of which are accounted for as operating leases. The contractual operating lease obligations listed in the table above represent estimated future minimum annual rental commitments under non cancelable real property leases as of December 31, 2002. The long term debt shown in the above table excludes unamortized bond discounts as of December 31, 2002 and therefore represents the principal amount of such debt required to be repaid in each period. The Series A convertible preferred stock in the table above is subject to mandatory redemption on March 31, 2018 at $50.00 per share, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends, to the extent these shares remain outstanding. These shares receive a cumulative cash dividend, as declared by the Board of Directors, at an annual rate of $2.00 per share, payable quarterly in arrears, until mandatory redemption on March 31, 2018. See below under "Series A Convertible Preferred Stock" for further discussion. As described above in "Asbestos Settlement and Related Costs", the Company recorded a current liability of $512,500,000 for the cash portion to be paid, plus accrued interest at a 5.5% annual rate, which started on December 21, 2002. The Company is required to make such payment upon the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy of New Grace. Because it is uncertain when such a plan of reorganization may become effective, this liability has been recorded as a current liability on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2002. The Company currently expects to 23 fund this payment either by using accumulated cash and future cash flows from operations, from the proceeds of future financings or from a combination of such alternatives. The Company entered into the following long term commitments during 2002: Approximately $36,000,000 for the purchase of certain equipment over an eight year period beginning in 2003, together with a potential termination fee in an amount to be determined. The Companys obligation is reduced or increased based on market price changes for the equipment and certain indexes. Failure to purchase any of the minimum annual requirements in any year obligates the Company to pay an amount of 45% of such shortfall. Approximately $9,500,000 to a supplier if the Company fails to purchase 142,700,000 pounds of certain raw materials, at the then current market price, over a ten year period that began in May, 2002. The amount of the potential contingent payment declines in proportion to the Companys purchase of minimum quantities required under the contract. At December 31, 2002, the Companys purchases were in line with the minimum quantity requirements under the agreement. Derivative Financial Instruments At December 31, 2002 and 2001 the Company was party to foreign currency forward contracts, which did not have a significant impact on the Companys liquidity. For further discussion about these contracts and other financial instruments, see Item 7A. Other Matters Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Series A Convertible Preferred Stock The Companys Series A preferred stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is convertible at any time into approximately 0.885 of a share of common stock for each share of preferred stock. These shares vote with the common stock on an as converted basis and are entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends, when and as declared by the Board of Directors, at an annual rate of $2.00 per share, payable quarterly in arrears on the first business day of the succeeding calendar quarter. The Series A preferred stock ranks senior to the Companys common stock and junior to the Companys indebtedness. On and after March 31, 2003, the Series A preferred stock is redeemable at the option of the Company at a price of $51.00 per share declining ratably on each March 31 thereafter to $50.00 per share on and after March 31, 2008, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. The Series A preferred stock is subject to mandatory redemption on March 31, 2018 at $50.00 per share, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends, to the extent these shares remain outstanding. Because it is subject to mandatory redemption, the Series A convertible preferred stock is classified outside of the shareholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets. At its date of issuance, the fair value of the Series A preferred stock exceeded its mandatory redemption amount primarily due to the common stock conversion feature. Accordingly, the book value of the Series A preferred stock is reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at its mandatory redemption value. Shareholders Equity The Companys shareholders equity was $812,960,000 at December 31, 2002, $850,152,000 at December 31, 2001 and $753,129,000 at December 31, 2000. 24  Shareholders equity decreased in 2002 due to the following: a reduction in retained earnings arising from the Companys net loss of $309,069,000 and preferred stock dividends of $53,845,000; additional foreign currency translation adjustments of $14,508,000; partially offset by: the $321,480,000 value of the 9,000,000 shares of common stock reserved for issuance related to the asbestos settlement; and the excess of book value over the repurchase price of $10,291,000 recognized in connection with preferred stock repurchases. Shareholders equity increased in 2001 due to the following: net earnings of $156,697,000; the excess of book value over the repurchase price of $7,456,000 recognized in connection with preferred stock repurchases; partially offset by: preferred stock dividends of $55,024,000; and additional foreign currency translation adjustments of $19,931,000. Other Matters Cryovac Transaction On March 31, 1998 the Company completed a multi step transaction (the "Cryovac Transaction"), which brought the Cryovac packaging business and the former Sealed Air Corporation ("old Sealed Air") under the common ownership of the Company. These businesses operate as subsidiaries of the Company, and the Company acts as a holding company. As part of that transaction, the Cryovac packaging business, held by various direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company, was separated from the remaining businesses of the Company. Such remaining businesses were then contributed to a company now known as W. R. Grace & Co. ("New Grace"), whose shares were distributed to the Companys stockholders. As a result, New Grace became a separate publicly owned company. The Company recapitalized its outstanding shares of common stock into a new common stock and a new convertible preferred stock. A subsidiary of the Company then merged into old Sealed Air, which changed its name to Sealed Air Corporation (US). The agreements pursuant to which the Cryovac Transaction was carried out are referred to below as the "Transaction Agreements." Contingencies Related to the Cryovac Transaction In connection with the Cryovac Transaction, New Grace and its subsidiaries retained all liabilities arising out of their operations before the Cryovac Transaction, whether accruing or occurring before or after the Cryovac Transaction, other than liabilities arising from or relating to Cryovacs operations. The liabilities retained by New Grace include, among others, liabilities relating to asbestos containing products previously manufactured or sold by New Graces subsidiaries prior to the Cryovac Transaction, including its primary U.S. operating subsidiary, W. R. Grace & Co. Conn., which has operated for decades and has been a subsidiary of New Grace since the Cryovac Transaction. The Transaction Agreements provided that, should any claimant seek to hold the Company, including any of its subsidiaries, responsible for liabilities of New Grace or its subsidiaries, including such asbestos related liabilities, New Grace and its subsidiaries would indemnify and defend the Company. 25 Since the beginning of 2000, the Company has been served with a number of lawsuits alleging that, as a result of the Cryovac Transaction, the Company is responsible for alleged asbestos liabilities of New Grace and its subsidiaries, certain of which were also named as co defendants in some of these actions. These actions include several purported class actions and a number of personal injury lawsuits. Some plaintiffs seek damages for personal injury or wrongful death, while others seek medical monitoring, environmental remediation or remedies related to an attic insulation product. Neither old Sealed Air nor Cryovac ever produced or sold any of the asbestos containing materials that are the subjects of these cases. None of these cases has been resolved through judgment, settlement or otherwise. All such cases have been stayed in connection with New Graces Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding discussed below. While the allegations in these actions directed to the Company vary, these actions all appear to allege that the transfer of the Cryovac business as part of the Cryovac Transaction was a fraudulent transfer or gave rise to successor liability. Under a theory of successor liability, plaintiffs with claims against New Grace and its subsidiaries may attempt to hold the Company liable for liabilities that arose with respect to activities conducted prior to the Cryovac Transaction by W. R. Grace & Co. Conn. or other New Grace subsidiaries. A transfer would be a fraudulent transfer if the transferor received less than reasonably equivalent value and the transferor was insolvent or was rendered insolvent by the transfer, was engaged or was about to engage in a business for which its assets constitute unreasonably small capital, or intended to incur or believed that it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature. A transfer may also be fraudulent if it was made with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors. If any transfers in connection with the Cryovac Transaction were found by a court to be fraudulent transfers, the Company could be required to return the property or its value to the transferor or could be required to fund certain liabilities of New Grace or its subsidiaries for the benefit of their creditors, including asbestos claimants. The Company has reached an agreement in principle, described below, that will resolve all such claims. Previously, the Company was unable to estimate the loss or range of loss in the event that there had been a finding that the Cryovac Transaction was a fraudulent transfer or gave rise to successor liability. In the Joint Proxy Statement furnished to their respective stockholders in connection with the Cryovac Transaction, both Sealed Air and Grace stated that it was their belief that New Grace and its subsidiaries were adequately capitalized and would be adequately capitalized after the Cryovac Transaction and that none of the transfers contemplated to occur in the Cryovac Transaction would be a fraudulent transfer. They also stated their belief that the Cryovac Transaction complied with other relevant laws. However, if a court applying the relevant legal standards had reached conclusions adverse to the Company, such determination could have had a materially adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial position. On April 2, 2001, New Grace and certain of its subsidiaries filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the District of Delaware. New Grace stated that the filing was made in response to a sharply increasing number of asbestos claims since 1999. In connection with its Chapter 11 filing, New Grace filed an application with the Bankruptcy Court seeking to stay, among others, all actions brought against the Company (including certain of its subsidiaries) related to alleged asbestos liabilities of New Grace and its subsidiaries or alleging fraudulent transfer claims. The court issued an order dated May 3, 2001, which was modified on January 22, 2002, under which all such filed or pending actions against the Company were stayed and all such future actions are stayed upon filing and service on the Company. No further proceedings involving the Company can occur in the actions that have been stayed except upon further order of the Bankruptcy Court. 26 Committees appointed to represent asbestos claimants in New Graces bankruptcy case received the courts permission to pursue fraudulent transfer and other claims against the Company and its subsidiary Cryovac, Inc. and against Fresenius, as discussed below. The claims against Fresenius are based upon a 1996 transaction between Fresenius and W. R. Grace & Co. Conn. Fresenius is not affiliated with the Company. In March 2002, the court ordered that the issues of the solvency of New Grace following the Cryovac Transaction and whether New Grace received reasonably equivalent value in the Cryovac Transaction would be tried on behalf of all creditors of New Grace. The proceeding is pending in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (Adv. No. 02 02210). In June 2002, the court permitted the U.S. government to intervene as a plaintiff in the fraudulent transfer proceeding, so that the U.S. government could pursue allegations that remediation expenses at certain sites were underestimated or omitted in the solvency analyses of New Grace that were conducted at the time of the Cryovac Transaction. The court also permitted New Grace, which asserted that the Cryovac Transaction was not a fraudulent transfer, to intervene in the proceeding. In July 2002, the court issued an interim ruling on the legal standards to be applied in the trial, holding, among other things, that, subject to certain limitations, post 1998 claims should be considered in the solvency analysis of New Grace. The Company believes that only claims and liabilities that were known or reasonably should have been known at the time of the 1998 Cryovac Transaction should be considered pursuant to the applicable standard. The trial was scheduled to commence December 9, 2002. On November 27, 2002, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the Committees prosecuting the claims against the Company and Cryovac, Inc., to resolve all current and future asbestos related claims arising from the Cryovac Transaction. On the same day, the court entered an order confirming that an amicable resolution of the disputes among the parties had been reached and that counsel for the Company and the Committees had agreed and bound the parties to the terms of the agreement in principle. As discussed above, the agreement in principle calls for payment of 9,000,000 shares of Sealed Air common stock and $512,500,000 in cash, plus interest on the cash payment at a 5.5% annual rate starting on December 21, 2002 and ending on the effective date of the New Grace plan of reorganization, when payment must be made. Such shares are subject to customary anti dilution provisions (including the effects of stock splits, stock dividends and certain other events affecting the Companys common stock). Pursuant to the agreement, the Company cannot seek indemnity from New Grace for this payment. On December 3, 2002, the agreement in principle was approved by the Companys Board of Directors. The Company was advised that both of the Committees had approved the agreement in principle as of December 5, 2002. The parties are jointly engaged in the process of drafting a definitive settlement agreement consistent with the terms of the agreement in principle. Once signed by the appropriate parties, the settlement agreement will be presented to the court for approval and will eventually be incorporated into New Graces plan of reorganization and, assuming approval by New Graces creditors as part of the approval of the plan of reorganization, will then be implemented. The settlement, upon approval and implementation in the New Grace bankruptcy, will provide that, upon the effective date of New Graces plan of reorganization and payment of the shares and cash, all present and future asbestos related claims against the Company and its affiliates that arise from alleged asbestos liabilities of New Grace and its affiliates (including former affiliates that became affiliates of the Company through the Cryovac Transaction) will be channeled to and become the responsibility of one or more trusts to be established as part of New Graces plan of reorganization. The settlement will also resolve all fraudulent transfer claims against the Company and its affiliates arising from the Cryovac Transaction as well as the claims of Fresenius described below. The settlement will provide that the Company and its affiliates will receive releases of all such claims. As a condition to the Companys obligation to make the payments required by the settlement, New Graces plan of reorganization must be consistent with the terms of the settlement, including provisions for the trusts and releases referred to above and for an injunction barring the prosecution of any asbestos related 27 claims against the Company and its affiliates. It is expected that the order approving the settlement agreement will also provide that the stay of proceedings involving the Company described above will continue through the effective date of New Graces plan of reorganization, after which the Company will be released from the liabilities asserted in those proceedings and their continued prosecution against the Company will be enjoined. In January 2002, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action against Fresenius Medical Care Holdings, Inc., its parent, Fresenius AG, a German company, and certain of its affiliates (collectively, "Fresenius") in New York State court asking the court to resolve a contract dispute between the parties. Fresenius contended that the Company was obligated to indemnify Fresenius for certain liabilities that Fresenius might incur as a result of the 1996 Fresenius transaction mentioned above. Freseniuss contention was based on its interpretation of the agreements between Fresenius and W. R. Grace & Co. Conn. in connection with the 1996 Fresenius transaction. In February 2002, Fresenius announced that it had accrued a charge of $172,000,000 for such potential liabilities, which include pre transaction tax liabilities of New Grace and the costs of defense of litigation arising from New Graces Chapter 11 filing. The Company believed that it was not responsible to indemnify Fresenius under the 1996 agreements and filed the action in order to proceed to a resolution of Freseniuss claims. In April 2002, Fresenius filed a motion to dismiss the action and for entry of declaratory relief in its favor. The Company opposed the motion, and in June 2002, the court reserved decision after oral argument. No written order has been issued, and the parties have requested the court to defer issuing a ruling pending implementation of the definitive settlement agreement between the Company and the Committees. As noted above, as a result of the November 27, 2002 agreement in principle referred to above, the parties expect that there will be mutual releases exchanged between Fresenius and the Company releasing any and all claims related to the 1996 Fresenius transaction. In view of New Graces Chapter 11 filing, the Company may receive additional claims asserting that the Company is liable for obligations that New Grace had agreed to retain in the Cryovac Transaction and for which the Company may be contingently liable. To date, no material additional claims have been asserted or threatened against the Company. Final determinations and accountings under the Transaction Agreements with respect to matters pertaining to the Cryovac Transaction had not been completed at the time of New Graces Chapter 11 filing. The Company expects to file a claim in the bankruptcy proceeding that will include all of the costs and liabilities that it has incurred or may incur that New Grace agreed to retain or that are subject to indemnification by New Grace under the Transaction Agreements other than payments to be made under the settlement agreement. New Grace alleges that the Company is responsible for certain amounts under the Transaction Agreements. Any amounts for which the Company may be liable to New Grace may be used to offset New Graces liabilities to the Company. Costs and liabilities for which the Company intends to seek indemnification by New Grace will also include certain defense costs related to asbestos and fraudulent transfer litigation and the Fresenius claims, the guaranteed debt paid by the Company described above, and any of the other potential claims against the Company mentioned above. Except to the extent of any potential setoff or similar claim, the Company expects that its claim will be as an unsecured creditor of New Grace. It is not currently possible to determine the amount of the Companys claim against New Grace, the extent to which such claim may be secured by setoff, how much of that claim may be allowed, or the amount of the Companys recovery on such claim, if any, in the bankruptcy proceeding. Environmental Matters The Company is subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations, and it accrues for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. These accruals do not take into account any discounting for the time value of money and are not reduced by potential insurance 28 recoveries, if any. Environmental liabilities are reassessed whenever circumstances become better defined or remediation efforts and their costs can be better estimated. These liabilities are evaluated periodically based on available information, including the progress of remedial investigations at each site, the current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible parties. As some of these issues are decided (the outcomes of which are subject to uncertainties) or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated, the Company adjusts the recorded accruals, as necessary. The Company believes that such exposures are not material to the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial position. The Company believes that it has adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures. Recently Issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" ("SFAS No. 141"), and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS No. 142"). SFAS No. 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 as well as all purchase method business combinations completed after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142. This new standard also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 141 upon issuance and adopted SFAS No. 142 effective January 1, 2002. Any goodwill and any intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life that were acquired in a purchase business combination completed after June 30, 2001 were not amortized, but were evaluated for impairment. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before July 1, 2001 were amortized through the end of 2001. In connection with the transitional impairment evaluation, SFAS No. 142 required the Company to assess whether goodwill and other intangible assets were impaired as of January 1, 2002. As required by this statement, the Company completed its assessment process on a reporting unit basis as of June 30, 2002 and determined that no impairment charge was necessary as of January 1, 2002. A reporting unit is the operating segment unless, at businesses one level below that operating segment (the "component" level), discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management, and such businesses have economic characteristics that are different from the economic characteristics of the other components of the operating segments, in which case such component is the reporting unit. A fair value approach is used to test goodwill for impairment. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount, if any, by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value. An estimate of fair values for the Company as a whole and each of the Companys reporting units was derived by using discounted cash flows, equity market capitalization and comparative market multiples. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company had unamortized goodwill in the amount of $1,926,244,000 and $1,913,000,000, respectively. Amortization expense related to goodwill was $57,005,000 and $51,776,000 in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Beginning January 1, 2002, in accordance with SFAS No. 142, the Company is no longer recording amortization expense related to goodwill. Although goodwill will no longer be systematically amortized, this statement requires that periodic reviews be conducted to assess whether or not the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired. Such reviews could result in future write downs of goodwill which would be reflected as a charge against operating income. As required by SFAS No. 142, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives have to be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142. The 29 Company completed its annual testing for impairment for 2002 during the fourth quarter of 2002 and determined that no impairment charge was necessary on a reporting unit basis. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company had identifiable intangible assets with definite useful lives with a gross carrying value of approximately $69,100,000 and $63,600,000, respectively, less accumulated amortization of approximately $47,700,000 and $40,100,000, respectively. Amortization of identifiable intangible assets was approximately $7,200,000 for 2002. Assuming no change in the gross carrying value of identifiable intangible assets from the value at December 31, 2002, the estimated amortization for the year ended December 31, 2003 and the next four succeeding years is approximately $7,200,000 per year. Such assets are reflected in "other assets" in the Companys consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, there were no identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives as defined by SFAS No. 142. On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 143, "Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS No. 143"), which provides the accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets. This statement requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" ("SFAS No. 144"), which excludes from the definition of long lived assets goodwill and other intangibles that are not amortized in accordance with SFAS No. 142. SFAS No. 144 requires that the disposal of long lived assets by sale be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell, whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations. SFAS No. 144 also expands the reporting of discontinued operations to include components of an entity that have been or will be disposed of rather than limiting such discontinuance to a segment of a business. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" ("SFAS No. 146"). SFAS No. 146 nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)" ("EITF 94 3") and requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred. Under EITF 94 3, a liability for an exit cost was required to be recognized at the date of an entitys commitment to an exit plan. The adoption of SFAS No. 146 is expected to result in delayed recognition for certain types of costs as compared to the provisions of EITF 94 3. SFAS No. 146 is effective for new exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002, and does not affect amounts currently reported in the Companys consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 146 will affect the types and timing of costs included in future restructuring programs, if any. On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure" ("SFAS No. 148"), which provides alternative methods of transition for companies that choose to switch to the fair value method of accounting for stock options. SFAS No. 148 also makes changes in the disclosure requirements for stock based compensation, regardless of which method of accounting is chosen. As discussed above under "Financing Activities", the Company terminated all previously maintained stock option plans effective March 31, 1998 in connection with the Cryovac Transaction, except with respect to options that were still outstanding as of such date. The adoption of SFAS No. 148 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" 30 ("Interpretation No. 45"). Interpretation No. 45 requires the disclosure of certain guarantees existing at December 31, 2002. The Company had no guarantees meeting the requirements of Interpretation No. 45 at December 31, 2002. In addition, Interpretation No. 45 requires the recognition of a liability for the fair value of the obligation of qualifying guarantee activities that are initiated or modified after December 31, 2002. Accordingly, the Company will apply the recognition provisions of Interpretation No. 45 prospectively to applicable guarantee activities initiated after December 31, 2002. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("Interpretation No. 46"). Interpretation No. 46 requires that the assets, liabilities and results of the activity of variable interest entities be consolidated into the financial statements of the company that has the controlling financial interest. Interpretation No. 46 also provides the framework for determining whether a variable interest entity should be consolidated based on voting interests or significant financial support provided to it. Interpretation No. 46 will be effective for the Company on February 1, 2003 for variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and on July 31, 2003 for variable interest entities created prior to February 1, 2003. Based on its preliminary analysis of Interpretation No. 46, the Company does not currently expect the adoption of Interpretation No. 46 to have a material impact on its 2003 consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Companys discussion and analysis of its results of operations and financial condition are based upon its consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("US GAAP"). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, may differ from estimates, and any such differences may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company believes the following accounting policies are critical to its business operations and the understanding of results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements: Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains accounts receivable allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of the Companys customers deteriorates. Commitments and Contingencies Litigation On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against the Company. While it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions, the Company uses its best judgment to determine if it is probable that it will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, the Company makes estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries, if any. The Company accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery, it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that the Company has previously made. Impairment of Long Lived Assets The Company periodically reviews long lived assets, other than goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill, in accordance with SFAS No. 142, is reviewed 31 for possible impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. A review of goodwill may be initiated prior to conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. Assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses, such as future cash flows and disposition costs, may affect the carrying value of long lived assets and possible impairment expense in the Companys consolidated financial statements. Self Insurance The Company retains the obligation for certain claims and losses related to property, casualty, workers compensation and employee benefit claims. The Company accrues for outstanding reported claims, claims that have been incurred but not reported and projected claims based upon managements estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims using historical experience, insurance company estimates and the estimated trends in claim values. Although management believes it has the ability to adequately project and record estimated claim payments, it is possible that actual results could differ significantly from the recorded liabilities. Pensions Although the Company maintains a non contributory profit sharing plan and contributory thrift and retirement savings plans in which most U.S. employees of the Company are eligible to participate, the Company does maintain defined benefit pension plans for certain of its U.S. and non U.S. employees. The Company accounts for such pension plans in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions" ("SFAS No. 87"). Under these accounting standards, assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and performance of plan assets. Certain of these assumptions include the discount rate used to measure future obligations, the expected future rate of return on plan assets, the expected rate of future compensation increases and various other actuarial assumptions. Changes to these assumptions could have a significant impact on costs and liabilities recorded under SFAS No. 87. Income Taxes The Companys deferred tax assets arise from net deductible temporary differences and tax benefit carryforwards. The Company believes that its taxable earnings during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carryforwards may be utilized should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits. For those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax benefit carryforwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely, a valuation allowance is provided. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company estimates future taxable earnings, with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax benefit carryforwards, to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods, the Company may need to adjust the valuation allowance, which could materially impact the Companys consolidated financial statements. Forward Looking Statements Certain statements made by the Company in this report and in the documents incorporated by reference herein, and in future oral and written statements by the Company may be forward looking. These statements include comments as to the Companys beliefs and, expectations as to future events and trends affecting the Companys business, its results of operations and its financial condition. These forward looking statements are based upon managements current expectations concerning future events and discuss, among other things, anticipated future performance and future business plans. Forward looking statements are identified by such words and phrases as "expects," "intends," "believes," "will continue," "plans to," "could be," "estimates" and similar expressions. Forward looking statements are necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the Company, which could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. 32 The Company recognizes that it is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may affect the future performance of the Company, such as: economic, political, business and market conditions in the geographic areas in which it conducts business; the Companys ability to hire, develop and retain talented employees worldwide; factors affecting the customers, industries and markets that use the Companys packaging materials and systems; competitive factors; the Companys development and commercialization of successful new products; the Companys accomplishments in entering new markets and acquiring and integrating new businesses; changes in the Companys relationships with customers and suppliers; acts and effects of war or terrorism; changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar; changes in interest rates, credit availability and ratings; the Companys access to financing and other sources of capital; the success of the Companys key information systems projects; the magnitude and timing of the Companys capital expenditures; the Companys inventory management proficiency; raw material availability and pricing; production capacity; changes in energy related expenses; the effect on the Company of new pronouncements by accounting authorities; the approval and implementation of a definitive settlement agreement with the Official Committee of Asbestos Personal Injury Claimants, the Official Committee of Asbestos Property Damage Claimants and any other appropriate parties in the New Grace bankruptcy proceeding; other effects on the Company of the bankruptcy filing by New Grace and its subsidiaries; other legal proceedings and claims (including environmental matters) involving the Company; the effects of animal and food related health issues (including BSE ("mad cow") and foot and mouth); and changes in domestic or foreign laws or regulations, or governmental or agency actions. 33  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. The Company seeks to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company does not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rates From time to time, the Company may use interest rate swaps, collars or options to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. During September 2002, the Company terminated certain interest rate swaps and reflected a basis adjustment to the 8.75% Senior Notes for a portion of the cash received of approximately $2,416,000. Such amount is being amortized and reflected as a component of interest expense over the remaining life of the 8.75% Senior Notes. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company had no interest rate swaps, collars or options outstanding. The fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt varies with changes in interest rates. Generally, the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. At December 31, 2002, the carrying value of the Companys total debt was $923,434,000 of which approximately $812,569,000 was fixed rate debt. At December 31, 2001, the carrying value of the Companys total debt was $925,602,000 of which $782,517,000 was fixed rate debt. The estimated fair value of the Companys total debt, which includes the cost of replacing the Companys fixed rate debt with borrowings at current market rates, was approximately $958,256,000 at December 31, 2002 compared to $889,434,000 at December 31, 2001. A hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates would result in an increase in the fair value of the total debt balance at December 31, 2002 of approximately $25,656,000. Such changes in the fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt do not alter the Companys obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount of such debt. Foreign Exchange Rates The Company may use other derivative instruments from time to time, such as foreign exchange options to manage exposure due to foreign exchange rates and interest rate and currency swaps to gain access to additional sources of international financing while limiting foreign exchange exposure and limiting or adjusting interest rate exposure by swapping borrowings in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company had no foreign exchange options or interest rate and currency swap agreements outstanding. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to fix the amount payable on certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The terms of such instruments are generally twelve months or less. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of approximately $146,910,000 and $266,900,000, respectively. The estimated fair values of these contracts, which represent the estimated net payments that would be paid or received by the Company in the event of termination of these contracts based on the then current foreign exchange rates, were a net payable of approximately $32,000 and a net receivable of approximately $313,000 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates at December 31, 2002 would have caused the Company to pay approximately $650,000 to terminate these contracts. The Companys foreign subsidiaries had outstanding debt of approximately $322,700,000 and $321,700,000 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Such debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing subsidiary. The Company believes that this enables it to better match operating cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, thereby reducing its need to enter into foreign exchange contracts. 34 Commodities The Company uses various commodity raw material and energy products in conjunction with its manufacturing processes. Generally, the Company acquires such components at market prices and does not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices. As a result, the Company is exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components. 35
