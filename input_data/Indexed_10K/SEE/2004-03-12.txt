Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition The information in "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition" should be read together with the Companys consolidated financial statements and related notes set forth in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. All amounts and percentages are approximate due to rounding. Introduction The Company manufactures and sells a wide range of food, protective and specialty packaging products, operating in the United States and in 49 other countries, with products distributed in those countries and in other parts of the world. The Company operates in two reportable business segments, Food Packaging and Protective and Specialty Packaging. The Companys principal food packaging products are its flexible materials and related systems marketed primarily under the Cryovac&reg; trademark for packaging a broad range of perishable foods and the Companys rigid packaging and absorbent pads. The Company primarily sells the products in this segment to food processors, distributors and food service businesses. The Companys principal protective and specialty packaging products provide cushioning, surface protection and void fill. The Company primarily sells its protective and specialty packaging products and systems to distributors and manufacturers in a wide variety of industries. The Company employs over 2,600 sales and marketing personnel in the countries in which it operates, who market the Companys products through a large number of distributors, fabricators and converters, as well as directly to end users such as food processors, food service businesses, and manufacturers. The Company has no material long term contracts for the distribution of its products. In 2003, no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10% or more of the Companys consolidated net sales. Although net sales of both food packaging products and protective and specialty packaging products have tended to be slightly higher in the fourth quarter, the Company does not consider seasonality to be material to its consolidated business. Competition for most of the Companys packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics, service and price. Competition is also based upon innovations in packaging 10 technology and, as a result, the Company maintains ongoing research and development programs to enable it to maintain technological leadership. The Companys net sales are sensitive to developments in its customers business or market conditions, changes in the global economy, and the effects of foreign currency translation. Its costs can vary significantly with changes in petrochemical related costs, which are not within the Companys control; consequently, the Companys management focuses on reducing those costs that the Company can control and using petrochemical based raw materials as efficiently as possible. The Company also believes that its global presence helps to insulate it from localized changes in business conditions that may more strongly affect some of its competitors. As is discussed below, the Companys business generates substantial cash flow. The Company believes that this cash flow will permit it to continue to invest in research and development at industry leading levels compared with its net sales, to make strategic acquisitions and capital expenditures, and to maintain the flexibility to modify its capital structure as the need or opportunity arises. This cash flow will also keep the Company prepared for the settlement and interest payment it will be required to make upon consummation of a plan of reorganization in the W. R. Grace & Co. bankruptcy, as is discussed below. Net Sales The principal factors affecting changes in net sales in the three years ended December 31, 2003 were changes in unit volume, the added net sales of acquired businesses, changes in product mix and average selling prices and foreign currency translation. Net sales in 2003 increased 10% to $3,531.9 million compared to $3,204.3 million in 2002. The components of the increase in net sales for 2003 were as follows (dollars in millions): Components of Increase in Net Sales (2003 vs. 2002): Food Packaging Segment Protective & Specialty Packaging Segment Total Company Volume Units 2.6 % $ 51.6 0.8 % $ 9.7 1.9 % $ 61.3 Volume Acquired Businesses 0.1 2.4 0.4 5.0 0.2 7.4 Price/Mix 2.5 47.9 1.7 21.5 2.2 69.4 Foreign Currency Translation 6.4 125.7 5.1 63.8 5.9 189.5 Total 11.6 % $ 227.6 8.0 % $ 100.0 10.2 % $ 327.6 Net sales for 2002 increased 4% to $3,204.3 million compared to $3,067.5 million in 2001. The components of the increase in net sales for 2002 were as follows (dollars in millions): Components of Increase in Net Sales (2002 vs. 2001): Food Packaging Segment Protective & Specialty Packaging Segment Total Company Volume Units 4.1 % $ 77.4 3.3 % $ 39.1 3.8 % $ 116.5 Volume Acquired Businesses 3.3 38.9 1.3 38.9 Price/Mix (0.5 ) (9.5 ) (2.2 ) (26.3 ) (1.2 ) (35.8 ) Foreign Currency Translation 0.5 9.9 0.6 7.3 0.6 17.2 Total 4.1 % $ 77.8 5.0 % $ 59.0 4.5 % $ 136.8 Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on net sales of $189.5 million in 2003. Excluding the positive effect of foreign currency translation, net sales would have increased 4% compared to 2002. Foreign currency translation had a modestly favorable effect on net sales of $17.2 million in 2002. 11 The favorable foreign currency translation impact on net sales in 2003 was primarily due to the strengthening of foreign currencies in Europe and the Asia Pacific region against the U.S. dollar, partially offset by the weakness of the Brazilian real. The favorable effect of foreign currency translation on net sales in 2002 was primarily due to the strengthening of foreign currencies in Europe and the Asia Pacific region compared with the U.S. dollar, partially offset by the weakness of the Argentine peso and the Brazilian real. Net sales of the Companys food packaging segment, which consists primarily of the Companys Cryovac&reg; food packaging products, constituted 62%, 61% and 61% of net sales in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Companys protective and specialty packaging segment contributed the balance of net sales. This segment aggregates the Companys protective packaging products, engineered products and shrink packaging products, all of which are used principally for non food packaging applications. Food Packaging Segment Sales Net sales of food packaging products increased 12% in 2003 to $2,185.7 million compared to $1,958.1 million in 2002 and increased 4% in 2002 compared to $1,880.3 million in 2001. Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on this segment of $125.7 million in 2003. Excluding the positive foreign currency translation effect, net sales for this segment would have increased 5% in 2003. Foreign currency translation had a modestly favorable impact on this segment of $9.9 million in 2002. Among the classes of products in the food packaging segment, in 2003 net sales of flexible packaging materials and related systems increased 11% to $1,835.1 million compared to $1,657.2 million in 2002 and increased 4% in 2002 compared with 2001 sales of $1,592.1 million. The components of the increase in net sales for 2003 and 2002 were as follows (dollars in millions): Components of Increase in Net Sales: Flexible Packaging Materials and Related Systems 2003 vs. 2002 2002 vs. 2001 Volume Units 2.3 % $ 38.4 4.8 % $ 75.8 Volume Acquired Businesses Price/Mix 2.0 34.0 (1.0 ) (16.6 ) Foreign Currency Translation 6.4 105.5 0.4 5.9 Total 10.7 % $ 177.9 4.2 % $ 65.1 Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of approximately $105.5 million in 2003 for flexible materials and related systems. Excluding the positive foreign currency translation effect, net sales for flexible packaging materials and related systems would have increased 4% in 2003. Foreign currency translation had a modestly favorable impact of $5.9 million in 2002. 12 Net sales of rigid packaging and absorbent pads increased 17% to $350.6 million compared to $300.9 million in 2002 and increased 4% in 2002 compared with 2001 sales of $288.2 million. The components of the increase in net sales for 2003 and 2002 were as follows (dollars in millions): Components of Increase in Net Sales: Rigid Packaging and Absorbent Pads 2003 vs. 2002 2002 vs. 2001 Volume Units 4.4 % $ 13.2 0.6 % $ 1.6 Volume Acquired Businesses 0.8 2.4 Price/Mix 4.7 13.9 2.4 7.1 Foreign Currency Translation 6.7 20.2 1.4 4.0 Total 16.6 % $ 49.7 4.4 % $ 12.7 Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on this segment of $20.2 million in 2003. Excluding the positive foreign currency translation effect, net sales for rigid packaging and absorbent pads would have increased 10% in 2003. Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on this segment of $4.0 million in 2002. Excluding the positive effect of foreign currency translation, net sales would have increased 3% in 2002. Protective and Specialty Packaging Segment Sales Net sales of protective and specialty packaging products increased 8% to $1,346.2 million in 2003 compared to $1,246.2 million in 2002 and increased 5% in 2002 compared with 2001 sales of $1,187.2 million. Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of $63.8 million in 2003 for this segment. Excluding the positive foreign currency translation effect, net sales for the protective and specialty packaging segment would have increased 3% in 2003. Foreign currency translation had a modestly favorable impact in 2002 of $7.3 million for the protective and specialty packaging segment. Excluding the positive foreign currency translation effect, net sales would have increased 4% in 2002. The classes of products within the protective and specialty packaging segment are cushioning and surface protection products and other products. Net sales of other products were approximately 1% of consolidated net sales in 2003, 2002 and 2001. Sales by Geographic Region The components of the increase in net sales by geographic region for 2003 were as follows (dollars in millions): Components of Increase in Net Sales (2003 vs. 2002): U.S. International Total Company Volume Units 1.5 % $ 27.3 2.4 % $ 34.0 1.9 % $ 61.3 Volume Acquired Businesses 0.2 4.2 0.2 3.2 0.2 7.4 Price/Mix 3.1 54.5 1.0 14.9 2.2 69.4 Foreign Currency Translation 13.1 189.5 5.9 189.5 Total 4.8 % $ 86.0 16.7 % $ 241.6 10.2 % $ 327.6 Net sales from operations in the United States represented 52% and 55% of net sales in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Net sales from U.S. operations increased 5% in 2003 to $1,844.8 million compared with $1,758.8 million in 2002. Net sales from international operations increased 17% in 2003 to $1,687.1 million compared to $1,445.5 million for 2002. Excluding the $189.5 million positive foreign currency translation effect, international net sales would have increased 4% compared to 2002. 13 The components of the increase in net sales by geographic region for 2002 were as follows (dollars in millions): Components of Increase in Net Sales (2002 vs. 2001): U.S. International Total Company Volume Units 4.8 % $ 81.3 2.5 % $ 35.2 3.8 % $ 116.5 Volume Acquired Businesses 2.0 33.5 0.5 5.4 1.3 38.9 Price/Mix (2.1 ) (36.2 ) 0.4 (1.2 ) (35.8 ) Foreign Currency Translation 1.2 17.2 0.6 17.2 Total 4.7 % $ 78.6 4.2 % $ 58.2 4.5 % $ 136.8 Net sales from operations in the United States represented 55% of net sales in 2002 and 2001. Net sales from U.S. operations increased approximately 5% in 2002 to $1,758.8 million compared with $1,680.2 million for 2001. Net sales from international operations increased approximately 4% in 2002 to $1,445.5 million compared with $1,387.3 million for 2001. Excluding the $17.2 million positive effect of foreign currency translation, net sales from international operations would have increased 3% compared to 2001. Costs and Margins Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 31.5% in 2003, 33.0% in 2002 and 32.3% in 2001. The decrease in 2003 compared to the 2002 period was primarily due to increased petrochemical based raw materials costs. The increase in 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily due to higher unit volumes in both reportable business segments. Marketing, administrative and development expenses increased 6% in 2003 and 6% in 2002. The increase in 2003 was primarily due to the impact of foreign currency and the impact of increased sales volumes partially offset by the absence of corporate projects completed during 2002. The increase in 2002 was primarily due to higher expenses for corporate projects, insurance, the effects of businesses acquired and the impact of foreign currency translation. Marketing, administrative and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were 16.3% in 2003, 16.9% in 2002 and 16.7% in 2001. Beginning January 1, 2002, in accordance with SFAS No. 142, the Company stopped recording goodwill amortization expense in its consolidated statement of operations. Goodwill amortization expense was $57.0 million in 2001. See information incorporated by reference below under "Recently Issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, Accounting Guidance and Disclosure Requirements" for a discussion of this standard. 2001 Restructuring Program During 2001, based primarily on weakening economic conditions, especially in the U.S., the Company conducted a review of its business to reduce costs and expenses, simplify business processes and organizational structure, and to refine further the Companys manufacturing operations and product offerings. As a result of this review, which the Company completed in the fourth quarter of 2001, the 14 Company announced and began implementing a restructuring program that resulted in charges to operations of $32.8 million for 2001. These charges consisted of the following (amounts in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2001 Employee termination costs $ 23.9 Facility exit costs 1.6 Long lived asset impairments 7.3 Total $ 32.8 The portion of this restructuring charge related to the Companys food packaging segment was $21.1 million, and the portion applicable to the protective and specialty packaging segment was $11.7 million. The Company originally expected to incur $25.5 million of cash outlays to carry out this restructuring program. These cash outlays primarily consisted of severance and other personnel related costs as well as lease and other contractual arrangement termination costs. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had made total cash payments of approximately $22.9 million ($5.3 million in 2003, $11.8 million in 2002 and $5.8 million in 2001). In 2003 and 2002, the Company adjusted the 2001 cash restructuring accrual for net credits of $0.5 million and $1.3 million respectively, as discussed below. After these cash outlays and the net credits, the restructuring accrual at December 31, 2003 was $0.8 million, representing cash outlays expected to be made in 2004 and future years, primarily for severance related costs. The long lived asset impairment of $7.3 million consisted of the following write downs and write offs (amounts in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2001 Property, plant and equipment $ 3.9 Goodwill 3.3 Other long lived assets 0.1 Total $ 7.3 These long lived asset impairments related to decisions to rationalize and realign production of some of the Companys small product lines and to close several manufacturing and warehouse facilities in North America, Europe, South Africa and the Asia Pacific region. The annual reduction of depreciation and amortization expense as a result of these asset impairments was $0.4 million. The Company has disposed of all of the above property, plant and equipment. During 2003 and 2002, the Company made adjustments to the original 2001 restructuring provision, resulting in net credits to the consolidated statement of operations of $0.5 million and $1.3 million, respectively. These adjustments resulted from the completion of portions of the restructuring program for amounts different than expected, headcount reductions obtained through attrition, and, during 2002, the revision of a plan to shut down one of the Companys manufacturing facilities. The 2003 credit applicable to the Companys food packaging segment was $0.3 million, while the portion attributable to the protective and specialty packaging segment was $0.2 million. The portion of the 2002 net credit applicable to the Companys food packaging segment amounted to a credit of $2.9 million, while the portion applicable to the protective and specialty packaging segment amounted to a charge of $1.6 million. As a result of the 2002 adjustments to the 2001 restructuring program, the Company expected a net reduction in headcount of approximately 440 positions. This program originally estimated a net 15 headcount reduction of approximately 470. The Company reduced the revised net headcount reduction by approximately 30 positions that were eliminated by attrition. This net reduction was based on the elimination of 677 positions from all geographic areas in which the Company does business, primarily from its manufacturing, sales and marketing functions in North America and Europe. As of December 31, 2003, all of the 677 positions estimated to be eliminated under this program had been eliminated. The Company anticipated the addition of 237 positions in connection with its realignment or relocation of manufacturing activities. The Company estimates that it realized approximately $23.0 million in annualized cost savings on a full year run rate basis by the end of 2002. The estimated annual cost savings reflect the $0.4 million non cash annual reduction of depreciation expense discussed above. Although some cost aspects of the original program have been adjusted, the Company has maintained original cost saving targets. Operating Profit Operating profit increased 4% in 2003 and 33% in 2002. Excluding goodwill amortization in 2001 of $57.0 million, operating profit would have increased 16% in 2002. The 4% increase in 2003 was primarily due to increased net sales offset by increased cost and expenses associated with higher sales volumes, increased raw material costs and the impact of foreign currency translation. The 33% increase in 2002 was primarily due to increased net sales, the discontinuance in 2002 of the amortization of goodwill and the restructuring and other charges incurred in 2001, while the Company recorded a restructuring credit in 2002. As a percentage of net sales, operating profit was 15.3% in 2003, 16.1% in 2002 and 12.6% in 2001. Excluding goodwill amortization in 2001, operating profit as a percentage of net sales was 14.4% in 2001. Operating profit by business segment for 2003, 2002 and 2001 was as follows (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Food Packaging Segment $ 361.6 $ 325.3 $ 287.7 Protective and Specialty Packaging Segment 209.5 219.4 211.0 Total segments 571.1 544.7 498.7 Restructuring and other credits 0.5 1.3 (32.8 ) Unallocated corporate operating expenses (32.4 ) (29.6 ) (78.5 ) Total $ 539.2 $ 516.4 $ 387.4 The food packaging segment contributed 63%, 60% and 58% of the Companys operating profit in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, before taking into consideration unallocated corporate operating expenses and restructuring and other credits. The Companys protective and specialty packaging segment contributed the balance of operating profit. Unallocated corporate operating expenses in 2001 consisted primarily of goodwill amortization and also reflected global information technology costs. Unallocated corporate operating expenses in 2003 and 2002 consisted primarily of global information technology costs. Asbestos Settlement and Related Costs On November 27, 2002, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the appropriate parties to resolve all current and future asbestos related claims made against the Company and its affiliates in connection with the Cryovac transaction. The settlement will also resolve the fraudulent transfer claims, as well as indemnification claims by Fresenius Medical Care Holdings, Inc. and affiliated companies, 16 that had been made against the Company in connection with the Cryovac transaction. On December 3, 2002, the Companys Board of Directors approved the agreement in principle. The Company received notice that both of the Committees had approved the agreement in principle as of December 5, 2002. For a description of the Cryovac transaction, asbestos related claims and the parties involved, see Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the captions "Cryovac Transaction" and "Contingencies Related to the Cryovac Transaction." The Company recorded a charge of $850.1 million as a result of the asbestos settlement in its consolidated statement of operations as of December 31, 2002. The charge consisted of the following items: a non cash charge of $512.5 million covering a cash payment that the Company will be required to make upon the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization in the Grace bankruptcy. Because the Company cannot predict when a plan of reorganization may become effective, the Company recorded this liability as a current liability on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2002. Under the terms of the settlement, this amount accrues interest at a 5.5% annual rate from December 21, 2002 to the date of payment. The Company has recorded this interest in interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations and in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. a non cash charge of $321.5 million representing the fair market value of 9 million shares of the Companys common stock expected to be issued under the settlement upon the effectiveness of Graces plan of reorganization. These shares are subject to customary anti dilution provisions that adjust for the effects of stock splits, stock dividends and other events affecting the Companys common stock. The fair market value of the Companys common stock was $35.72 per share as of the close of business on December 5, 2002. The Company recorded this amount in its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2002, as follows: $0.9 million representing the aggregate par value of these shares in common stock reserved for issuance related to the asbestos settlement, and the remaining $320.6 million, representing the excess of the aggregate fair market value over the aggregate par value of common shares, in additional paid in capital. The December 31, 2003 diluted earnings per common share calculation reflects the shares of common stock reserved for issuance related to the asbestos settlement. $16.1 million of legal and related fees as of December 31, 2002. Asbestos settlement and related costs in 2003 reflected legal and related fees for asbestos related matters of $2.8 million. In 2001, asbestos settlement and related costs of $12.0 million included $8.1 million related to the Companys guarantee resulting from the Cryovac transaction of debt payable by W. R. Grace & Co. Conn., which filed for reorganization along with its parent company Grace, and $3.9 million of legal and related fees. Interest Expense and Other Income (Expense), net Interest expense increased in 2003 to $134.4 million compared to $65.3 million in 2002 but decreased 15% in 2002 compared to $76.4 million in 2001. The increase in 2003 was primarily due to additional accrued interest of $27.3 million in 2003 on the cash portion of the asbestos settlement and interest paid or accrued of $44.6 million in 2003 on the senior notes discussed below that were issued in April and July 2003. The decrease in 2002 was primarily due to lower average levels of outstanding debt compared with 2001. Other income (expense), net, consisted of income of $8.4 million in 2003, income of $7.1 million in 2002 and expense of $1.5 million in 2001. The change in 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily due to an increase in interest income of $3.4 million and lower net foreign exchange losses in 2003 compared 17 to the 2002 period of $1.1 million. The change in 2002 compared to 2001 was due to lower net foreign exchange losses during 2002. Income Taxes The Companys effective income tax rate was an expense of 36.2% in 2003, a benefit of 21.1% in 2002 and an expense of 47.3% in 2001. The change in the effective tax rate from 2002 to 2003 was primarily due to the effect of the estimated tax benefit for the asbestos settlement and related costs in 2002 and improved tax efficiency in 2003 resulting from a reorganization of the Companys international subsidiaries during 2002. The 2002 effective tax rate was lower than in 2001 due primarily to the estimated tax benefit of the asbestos settlement and its related costs and the discontinuance of goodwill amortization in 2002. In 2003, the effective tax rate was higher than the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes and non deductible expenses, offset by the lower net effective tax rate on foreign earnings. In 2002, the effective tax rate was lower than the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate primarily due to the effect of the estimated tax benefit for the asbestos settlement. In 2001, the effective tax rate was higher than the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate primarily due to the non deductibility of goodwill amortization for tax purposes and, to a lesser extent, due to state income taxes. The Company expects an effective tax rate of approximately 36.0% for 2004. Net Earnings (Loss) As a result of the factors noted above, net earnings were $240.4 million in 2003 compared to a net loss of $309.1 million in 2002, which reflected the asbestos settlement and related costs of $850.1 million. In 2001, the Company had net earnings of $156.7 million. Excluding goodwill amortization of $57.0 million in 2001, net earnings would have been $213.7 million. Earnings (Loss) per Common Share Basic earnings (loss) per common share were $2.21 for 2003, $(4.20) for 2002 and $1.30 for 2001. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share were $2.00 for 2003, $(4.30) for 2002 and $1.22 for 2001. Excluding goodwill amortization in 2001, basic earnings per common share would have been $1.99 and diluted earnings per common share would have been $1.89 in 2001. On July 18, 2003, the Company redeemed all of the outstanding shares of its Series A convertible preferred stock at a redemption price of $51.00 per share. The Company also paid accrued dividends on the preferred stock from July 1, 2003 through July 17, 2003 in the aggregate amount of $2.40 million. The $51.00 per share redemption price included a $1.00 per share redemption premium, or an aggregate premium of $25.5 million, and is reflected in basic earnings per common share. Gains attributable to the repurchase of preferred stock for 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $0.8, $10.3 and $7.4 million, respectively, and are reflected in basic earnings (loss) per common share for these years. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings (loss) per common share for 2002 and 2001, the Company has adjusted net earnings ascribed to common shareholders to exclude the gains attributable to the repurchase of preferred stock and to add back dividends attributable to such repurchased preferred stock and has adjusted the weighted average common shares outstanding to assume conversion of the shares of preferred stock repurchased during these periods in accordance with the FASBs Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D 53 guidance. In calculating diluted earnings per common share, the Companys calculation of the weighted average number of common shares for 2003 assumes the issuance of nine million shares of common stock 18 reserved for the asbestos settlement (as described in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption "Asbestos Settlement and Related Costs"), and the exercise of dilutive stock options, net of assumed treasury stock repurchases. For 2002 and 2001, the calculation of weighted average number of common shares assumes the effect of the weighted average conversion of repurchased shares of preferred stock. The Company did not assume the outstanding preferred stock had been converted in the calculation of diluted (loss) earnings per common share in 2002 and 2001, because the treatment of the preferred stock as the common stock into which it could have been converted would have been anti dilutive, as conversion would have reduced the loss per common share or increased earnings per common share in those years. The Company did not reflect the shares of common stock reserved for issuance for the asbestos settlement in the 2002 loss per common share calculation since the effect would have been anti dilutive. Liquidity and Capital Resources The discussion that follows contains: a description of the Companys material commitments and contingencies, a description of the Companys principal sources of liquidity, a description of the Companys outstanding indebtedness, an analysis of the Companys historical cash flows, a description of the Companys derivative financial instruments, a description of the Companys Series A convertible preferred stock, which it redeemed in July 2003, a description of the Companys shareholders equity, and a description of the Companys critical accounting policies and estimates. Material Commitments and Contingencies Asbestos Settlement; Contingencies Related to the Cryovac Transaction The Company recorded a charge of $512.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 covering the cash payment that the Company is required to make upon the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy of W. R. Grace & Co. The Company did not use cash in 2003 or 2002 with respect to this liability, and the Company cannot predict when it will be required to make this payment. The Company currently expects to fund this payment by using a combination of accumulated cash and future cash flows from operations, funds available under its $350.0 million unsecured multi currency credit facility or its accounts receivable securitization program, both described below, or a combination of these alternatives. The Company is subject to other contingencies related to the Cryovac transaction. Note 18, "Commitments and Contingencies," of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is contained in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, describes these contingencies under "Contingencies Related to the Cryovac Transaction" and is incorporated herein by reference. 19  Contractual Commitments The following table summarizes the Companys material contractual obligations at December 31, 2003 and sets forth the amounts of required cash outlays in 2004 and future years (amounts in millions): Payments Due by Period Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Short term borrowings $ 18.2 $ 18.2 $ $ $ Current portion of long term debt 2.4 2.4 Long term debt, exclusive of debt discounts 2,268.0 253.2 480.0 1,534.8 Total debt(1) 2,288.6 20.6 253.2 480.0 1,534.8 Operating leases 98.2 27.2 37.6 23.2 10.2 Cash portion of the asbestos settlement, including accrued interest as of December 31, 2003(2) 541.6 541.6 Long term equipment purchases for resale 18.9 3.9 9.5 5.5 Telecommunications and network agreement 12.9 2.4 7.0 3.5 Raw material contingent payment 8.4 8.4 Raw material supply agreement 6.0 6.0 Total contractual cash obligations $ 2,974.6 $ 601.7 $ 307.3 $ 512.2 $ 1,553.4 (1)Includes principal maturities (at face value) only. (2)This liability is reflected as a current liability due to the uncertainty of the timing of payment (as discussed below). Interest accrues on this amount at a rate of 5.5% per annum until it becomes due and payable. The asbestos settlement is described more fully in "Asbestos Settlement; Contingencies Related to the Cryovac Transaction" above. In addition to the obligation to pay the principal amount of the debt obligations discussed above, the Company is obligated under the terms of various leases covering some of the facilities that it occupies and some production equipment, most of which are accounted for as operating leases. The contractual operating lease obligations listed in the table above represent estimated future minimum annual rental commitments under non cancelable real and personal property leases as of December 31, 2003. The long term debt shown in the above table excludes unamortized bond discounts as of December 31, 2003 and, therefore, represents the principal amount of the debt required to be repaid in each period. The Company has the following long term contractual commitments: Approximately $18.9 million for the purchase of equipment over a five year period which began in 2003, together with a potential termination fee in an amount to be determined. The Companys obligation is reduced or increased based on market price changes for the equipment and changes in the Packaging Machinery Manufacturers Index. Failure to purchase any of the minimum annual requirements in any year obligates the Company to pay an amount of 45% of such shortfall. During 2003 the Company did not meet the minimum equipment purchase requirements and recorded a charge of $1.0 million. Approximately $12.9 million minimum commitment for the purchase of telecommunications and network capacity and services over a four year period that began in 2004. Approximately $8.4 million to a supplier if the Company fails to purchase 126.3 million pounds of specified raw materials, at the then current market price, over a ten year period that began in May 2002. The amount of the potential contingent payment declines in proportion to the Companys purchase of minimum quantities required under the contract. At December 31, 2003, 20 the Companys purchases were in line with the minimum quantity requirements under the agreement. Approximately $6.0 million to a raw material supplier under an agreement that provides that the Company commits to purchase a specified quantity of raw materials at a fixed price through 2004. Interest Payments During 2003 and 2002, the Company paid approximately $84.3 million and $72.6 million, respectively, in interest payments. The Company currently expects to pay approximately $110 million to $125 million in interest payments in 2004. The actual interest paid will be different from this amount if the Company repurchases existing indebtedness, issues additional indebtedness, incurs indebtedness under its lines of credit or enters into additional interest rate swap transactions. In addition, such amount does not reflect any accrued interest related to the asbestos settlement. Income Tax Payments During 2003 and 2002, the Company paid approximately $161.3 million and $165.1 million, respectively, in income tax payments. The Company currently expects to pay between $135 million and $150 million in income tax payments in 2004. Contributions to Defined Benefit Pension Plans The Company maintains defined benefit pension plans for a limited number of its U.S. and for many of its non U.S. employees. During 2003 and 2002, the Company paid approximately $9.1 million and $14.8 million, respectively, in employer contributions to these defined benefit pension plans. Environmental Matters The Company is subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations, and it accrues for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. These accruals do not take into account any discounting for the time value of money and are not reduced by potential insurance recoveries, if any. The Company does not believe that it is reasonably possible that its liability in excess of the amounts that it has accrued for environmental matters will be material to its consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets or cash flows. Environmental liabilities are reassessed whenever circumstances become better defined or remediation efforts and their costs can be better estimated. The Company evaluates these liabilities periodically based on available information, including the progress of remedial investigations at each site, the current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible parties. As some of these issues are decided (the outcomes of which are subject to uncertainties) or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated, the Company adjusts the recorded accruals, as necessary. The Company believes that these exposures are not material to its consolidated results of operations and balance sheets. The Company believes that it has adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures. Principal Sources of Liquidity Accumulated Cash and Cash Equivalents As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had accumulated cash and cash equivalents of approximately $365.0 million and $126.8 million, respectively. 21 Cash Flows from Operations The Company expects that it will continue to generate significant cash flows from operations. See "Analysis of Historical Cash Flows" below. Revolving Credit Facilities The 2006 Facility. On December 19, 2003, the Company entered into a new $350.0 million unsecured multi currency revolving credit facility that matures in 2006. The Company did not borrow under the 2006 facility at its inception, and no borrowings were outstanding as of December 31, 2003. The 2006 facility provides that the Company may borrow for working capital and general corporate purposes, including payment of a portion of the $512.5 million cash payment required to be paid upon the effectiveness of an appropriate plan of reorganization in the Grace bankruptcy. See Note 18 for further discussion of this matter. The Company may re borrow amounts repaid under the 2006 facility from time to time prior to the expiration or earlier termination of the facility. As of December 31, 2003, facility fees were payable at the rate of 0.15% per annum on the total amounts available under the 2006 facility. The Companys obligations under the 2006 facility bear interest at floating rates, which are generally determined by adding the applicable borrowing margin to the base rate or the interbank rate for the relevant currency and time period. The 2006 facility provides for changes in borrowing margins based on the Companys long term senior unsecured debt ratings. The 2006 facility provides that, upon the occurrence of specified events that would adversely affect the settlement agreement in the Grace bankruptcy proceedings or would materially increase the Companys liability in respect of the Grace bankruptcy or the asbestos liability arising from the Cryovac transaction, the Company would be required to repay any amounts outstanding under the 2006 facility, or refinance the facility, within 60 days. The 2003 Facility. At December 31, 2002, the Companys principal revolving credit facility was a $525.0 million facility that the Company allowed to expire in accordance with its terms on March 30, 2003. There were no borrowings outstanding under the 2003 facility as of December 31, 2002. ANZ Facility. In March 2002, the Company entered into an Australian dollar 175.0 million, which was equivalent to U.S. $128.4 million at December 31, 2003, dual currency revolving credit facility that expires on March 12, 2005, known as the "ANZ facility." A syndicate of banks made this facility available to a group of the Companys Australian and New Zealand subsidiaries for general corporate purposes and the refinancing of previously outstanding indebtedness. The Company may re borrow amounts repaid under the ANZ facility from time to time prior to the expiration or earlier termination of the facility. No amounts were outstanding under the ANZ facility at December 31, 2003. Accounts Receivable Facility In December 2001, the Company and a group of its U.S. subsidiaries entered into an accounts receivable securitization program with a bank and an issuer of commercial paper administered by the bank. The Company considers that the receivables facility provides a source of short term liquidity. Under the receivables facility, the Companys two primary operating subsidiaries, Cryovac, Inc. and Sealed Air Corporation (US), sell all of their eligible U.S. accounts receivable to Sealed Air Funding Corporation, an indirectly wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that was formed for the sole purpose of entering into the receivables facility. Sealed Air Funding in turn may sell undivided ownership interests in these receivables to the bank and the issuer of commercial paper, subject to specified conditions, up to a maximum of $125.0 million of receivables interests outstanding from time to time. 22 Sealed Air Funding retains the receivables it purchases from the operating subsidiaries, except those as to which it sells receivables interests to the bank or the issuer of commercial paper. The Company has structured the sales of accounts receivable by the operating subsidiaries to Sealed Air Funding, and the sales of receivables interests from Sealed Air Funding to the bank and the issuer of commercial paper, as "true sales" under applicable laws. The assets of Sealed Air Funding are not available to pay any creditors of the Company or of its subsidiaries or affiliates. The Company accounts for these transactions as sales of receivables under the provisions of SFAS No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities." To secure the performance of their obligations under the receivables facility, Sealed Air Funding and the operating subsidiaries granted a first priority security interest to the bank, as agent, in accounts receivable owned by them, proceeds and collections of those receivables and other collateral. The bank and the issuer of commercial paper have no recourse to the Companys, the operating subsidiaries or Sealed Air Fundings other assets for any losses resulting from the financial inability of customers to pay amounts due on the receivables when they become due. As long as a termination event with respect to the receivables facility has not occurred, the operating subsidiaries service, administer and collect the receivables under the receivables facility as agents on behalf of Sealed Air Funding, the bank and the issuer of commercial paper. Prior to a termination event under the receivables facility, Sealed Air Funding uses collections of receivables not otherwise required to be paid to the bank or the issuer of commercial paper to purchase new eligible receivables from the operating subsidiaries. The Company has undertaken to cause the operating subsidiaries to perform their obligations under the receivables facility. The scheduled expiration date for the receivables facility is December 7, 2004. The parties amended the receivables facility on April 2, 2003 to provide that Sealed Air Funding could sell receivables interests aggregating up to $60.0 million, originated only by Sealed Air Corporation (US), to the bank or the issuer of commercial paper until a definitive asbestos settlement agreement, satisfactory to the bank, had been entered into. The receivables facility again became available for the sale of receivables interests originated by Cryovac, Inc. as well as Sealed Air Corporation (US), up to the original maximum of $125.0 million of receivables interests provided for by the receivables facility, on January 26, 2004. The parties also amended the receivables facility on April 2, 2003 to exclude the charge for the asbestos litigation settlement reflected in the Companys consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 from the calculation of the interest coverage and leverage ratios provided for in the receivables facility. The Company must comply with these interest coverage and leverage ratio covenants contained in the receivables facility in order to use the facility. The Company was in compliance with these ratios at December 31, 2003. Under limited circumstances, the bank and the issuer of commercial paper can terminate purchases of receivables interests prior to the above dates. A downgrade of the Companys long term senior unsecured debt to BB or below by Standard & Poors Rating Services or Ba3 or below by Moodys Investors Service, Inc., or failure to comply with interest coverage and debt leverage ratios, could result in termination of the receivables facility. In connection with recording the accounting charge in the fourth quarter of 2002 for the asbestos settlement and related costs, the Company requested and received a waiver of compliance with the interest coverage and leverage ratios provided for in the receivables facility. After reflecting this waiver, the Company was in compliance with the requirements of the receivables facility as of December 31, 2002. The operating subsidiaries did not sell any receivables interests under the receivables facility during 2003 and, therefore, the Company did not remove any related amounts from the consolidated assets reflected on the Companys consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2003. 23 During 2002, Sealed Air Funding sold receivables interests to the issuer of commercial paper from time to time; however, as of December 31, 2002, neither the bank nor the issuer of commercial paper held any receivables interests and no related amounts were removed from the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2002. The receivables facility provides for the monthly payment of program fees which currently are 0.375% per annum (0.45% per annum at December 31, 2003) on the receivables interests sold by Sealed Air Funding and commitment fees which currently are 0.375% per annum (0.40% per annum at December 31, 2003) on the unused portion of the $125.0 million receivables facility. The costs associated with the receivables facility are reflected in other income (expense), net, in the Companys consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. These costs primarily relate to the loss on the sale of the receivables interests to the bank or the issuer of commercial paper, which were approximately zero for 2003, $0.4 million for 2002 and $0.1 million for 2001, and program and commitment fees and other associated costs, which were approximately $0.6 million, $0.4 million and $0.3 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Lines of Credit Substantially all the Companys short term borrowings of $18.2 million and $53.4 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, were outstanding under lines of credit available to various of the Companys U.S. and foreign subsidiaries. Amounts available under these credit lines as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 were approximately $215.3 million and $209.0 million, respectively, of which approximately $197.0 million and $155.0 million, respectively, were unused. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had available committed and uncommitted lines of credit, including the credit lines discussed above, of $693.7 million and $832.0 million, respectively, of which $675.4 million and $721.0 million were unused. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the total available lines of credit included committed lines of credit of $479.2 million and $832.0 million, respectively, and uncommitted lines of credit of $214.5 million and $210.0 million, respectively. The Companys principal credit lines were all committed and consisted of the 2006 facility at December 31, 2003, the 2003 facility at December 31, 2002 and the ANZ facility at both dates. The Company is not subject to any material compensating balance requirements in connection with its lines of credit. Debt Ratings The Companys cost of capital and ability to obtain external financing may be affected by its debt ratings, which are periodically reviewed by the credit rating agencies. The Companys long term senior unsecured debt is currently rated Baa3 (stable outlook) by Moodys Investors Services, Inc. and BBB (negative outlook) by Standard & Poors Rating Services, a division of the McGraw Hill Companies. These ratings are among the ratings assigned by each of these organizations for investment grade long term senior unsecured debt. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 24 Outstanding Indebtedness At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Companys total debt outstanding consisted of the amounts set forth on the following table (amounts in millions): December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 Short term borrowings and current portion of long term debt: Short term borrowings $ 18.2 $ 53.4 Current portion of long term debt 2.4 2.0 Total current debt 20.6 55.4 Long term debt, less current portion: 5.625% Euro Notes due July 2006, less unamortized discount of $0.7 in 2003 and $0.8 in 2002(1) 248.0 205.2 8.75% Senior Notes due July 2008, (plus) less unamortized discount and interest rate swaps of $(4.0) in 2003 and $1.2 in 2002 181.5 298.8 6.95% Senior Notes due May 2009, less unamortized discount of $1.1 in 2003 and $1.6 in 2002 248.9 298.5 5.375% Senior Notes due April 2008, less unamortized discount and interest rate swaps of $7.5 in 2003 292.5 5.625% Senior Notes due July 2013, less unamortized discount of $1.3 in 2003(2) 398.7 6.875% Senior Notes due July 2033, less unamortized discount of $1.6 in 2003(2) 448.4 3% Convertible Senior Notes due June 2033(2) 431.3 ANZ Credit Facility 57.5 Other 10.5 8.0 Total long term debt, less current portion 2,259.8 868.0 Total debt $ 2,280.4 $ 923.4 (1)The carrying value of the euro notes increased approximately $42.5 million in 2003, primarily as a result of the strengthening of the euro compared to the U.S. dollar during 2003. (2)The Company used an aggregate of $1,298.1 million from the proceeds of these offerings and additional cash on hand to redeem the outstanding shares of its Series A convertible preferred stock. Senior Notes Issued in July 2003; Recapitalization In July 2003, the Company issued a total of $1,281.3 million of senior notes in transactions exempt from registration in reliance upon Rule 144A and other available exemptions under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. On July 18, 2003, the Company used the net proceeds from these offerings and additional cash on hand to redeem its Series A convertible preferred stock at the redemption price of $51.00 per share, for which the Company used $1,298.1 million of cash, plus an amount equal to dividends accrued from July 1, 2003 through July 17, 2003, for which the Company used $2.4 million of cash. As discussed in "Analysis of Historical Cash Flows Repurchases of Capital Stock" below and Note 15 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company had previously repurchased an aggregate of 750,600 shares of its Series A convertible preferred stock during 2003, prior to the July 18, 2003 redemption. As discussed in "Analysis of Historical Cash Flows Debt Repurchase" below and Note 12 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company 25 subsequently used net cash of $208.2 million to repurchase an aggregate of $172.5 million of its senior notes and to terminate related interest rate swaps. The senior note offerings consisted of the following: $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior notes due July 15, 2013. Accrued interest on the 5.625% senior notes is payable semi annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing on January 15, 2004. The net proceeds from this issuance, after deducting the initial purchasers discount, unamortized bond discount and other offering expenses, were $395.6 million. The carrying value of these notes at December 31, 2003 was $398.7 million, net of unamortized discount. $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% senior notes due July 15, 2033. Accrued interest on the 6.875% senior notes is payable semi annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing on January 15, 2004. The net proceeds from this issuance, after deducting the initial purchasers discount, unamortized bond discount and other offering expenses, were $444.0 million. The carrying value of these notes at December 31, 2003 was $448.4 million, net of unamortized discount. $431.3 million aggregate principal amount of 3% convertible senior notes due June 30, 2033. Accrued interest on the 3% convertible senior notes is payable semi annually in arrears on June 30 and December 30 of each year, commencing on December 30, 2003. The net proceeds from this issuance, after deducting the initial purchasers discount and other offering expenses, were $421.5 million. The carrying value of these notes at December 31, 2003 was $431.3 million. Holders of the convertible senior notes may convert those notes into shares of the Companys common stock at a conversion rate of 14.2857 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of $70.00 per share, subject to anti dilution adjustments, before the close of business on June 30, 2033. Holders may convert their convertible senior notes only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter, if the closing sale price of the Companys common stock exceeds 120% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter; (2) during any period in which (i) the long term credit rating assigned to the notes by Standard & Poors Rating Services, a division of the McGraw Hill Companies, or Moodys Investors Services, Inc. is lower than BB+ or Ba2, respectively, (ii) either Standard & Poors or Moodys no longer rates the notes or has withdrawn or suspended this rating, or (iii) the notes are not assigned a rating by both Standard & Poors and Moodys; (3) during the five business day period immediately after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each day of that period was less than 98% of the product of the closing sale price of the Companys common stock and the conversion rate; (4) if the notes have been called for redemption; or (5) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. None of these circumstances that would allow for conversion of the notes has arisen at any time since their issuance. The Company has the option to redeem the 3% convertible senior notes beginning July 2, 2007 at a price equal to 101.286% of their aggregate principal amount, declining ratably to 100% of their aggregate principal amount on June 30, 2010. The holders of the 3% convertible senior notes have the option to require the Company to repurchase the 3% convertible senior notes on June 30 of 2010, 2013, 2018, 2023 and 2028, or upon the occurrence of a fundamental change in or a termination of trading of the Companys common stock, at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. 26 In connection with the issuance of the 3% convertible senior notes, on September 5, 2003, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register for resale the 6,160,708 shares of the Companys common stock issuable, subject to anti dilution adjustments, upon conversion of the notes. The registration statement became effective on January 23, 2004. 5.375% Senior Notes On April 14, 2003, the Company issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.375% senior notes due April 2008 in transactions exempt from registration in reliance upon Rule 144A and other available exemptions under the Securities Act. Accrued interest on these senior notes is payable semi annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing on October 15, 2003. The net proceeds from the issuance of these senior notes after deducting the initial purchasers discount, unamortized bond discount and other offering expenses were $296.1 million. The carrying value of these notes at December 31, 2003 was $292.5 million, net of unamortized discount and an adjustment to record a decrease in the fair value of the 5.375% senior notes of $6.1 million due to changes in interest rates related to interest rate swaps the Company has entered into with respect to these notes. The Company may from time to time continue to repurchase or otherwise retire its outstanding indebtedness. Covenants Each issue of the Companys outstanding senior notes and the Companys outstanding euro notes imposes limitations on the Companys operations and those of specified subsidiaries. The principal limitations restrict liens, sale and leaseback transactions and mergers, acquisitions and dispositions. The 2006 facility contains financial covenants relating to interest coverage, debt leverage and minimum liquidity and restrictions on the creation of liens, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, asset sales, and amendments to the asbestos settlement agreement discussed above. The ANZ facility contains financial covenants relating to debt leverage, interest coverage and tangible net worth and restrictions on the creation of liens, the incurrence of additional indebtedness and asset sales. The Company was in compliance with these limitations at December 31, 2003. The 2003 facility had similar covenants to those of the ANZ facility. In connection with recording the accounting charge in the fourth quarter of 2002 for the asbestos settlement and related costs (see Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements), the Company requested and received a waiver of compliance with the interest coverage and leverage ratios provided for in the 2003 facility. After reflecting such waiver, the Company was in compliance with all applicable requirements of each of the above instruments as December 31, 2002. Analysis of Historical Cash Flows Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $469.7 million in 2003, $323.9 million in 2002 and $578.7 million in 2001. The increase in 2003 compared with 2002 was primarily due to the following: changes in the accounts receivable facility, which is described below; and: changes in operating assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of business, as discussed below under "Changes in Working Capital." 27 The decrease in 2002 compared with 2001 was primarily due to the following: changes in the accounts receivable facility, which is described below; and changes in operating assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of business, as discussed below under "Changes in Working Capital;" partially offset by: increased earnings, excluding the non cash impact of the asbestos settlement. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company sold receivables interests totaling $95.6 million to the financial institutions participating in the Companys accounts receivable facility, which is described below. Such receivables interests were not replaced with additional receivables interests in 2002. As a result, the Company recorded cash provided by operating activities totaling $95.6 million in 2001 and an equal and offsetting reduction in the net cash provided by operating activities in 2002. The financial institutions participating in the accounts receivable facility held no receivables interests at the beginning or end of 2003. Therefore, the accounts receivables facility had no effect on net cash provided by operating activities in 2003. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities amounted to $123.4 million in 2003, $96.9 million in 2002 and $177.9 million in 2001. In each year, investing activities consisted primarily of capital expenditures and acquisitions. The increase in net cash used in these activities in 2003 was due to higher capital expenditures. The decrease in net cash used in these activities in 2002 was due to lower levels of capital expenditures and, to a lesser extent, acquisitions. Cash used to complete acquisitions was $2.5 million in 2003, $10.5 million in 2002 and $36.0 million in 2001. In each year, cash used for acquisitions was net of cash acquired in those acquisitions. Cash acquired in acquisitions was not material in 2003, 2002 or 2001. The Company did not assume any debt in acquisitions in 2003 or 2002. In 2001, the Company assumed approximately $19.0 million of debt in acquisitions. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $124.3 million in 2003, $91.6 million in 2002 and $146.3 million in 2001. Capital expenditures for the Companys food packaging segment amounted to $86.2 million, $61.8 million and $103.8 million and for the protective and specialty packaging segment amounted to $38.1 million, $29.8 million and $42.4 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures in 2003 was primarily due to spending related to construction of new plants in the United States and Eastern Europe. The decrease in capital expenditures in 2002 was primarily due to improved productivity of existing assets, which allowed the Company to defer spending on incremental capacity. The Company expects to continue to make capital expenditures as it deems appropriate to expand its business, replace depreciating property, plant and equipment and invest in more efficient capacity and productivity gains. The Company currently anticipates that capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2004 will be in the range of $125 million to $150 million. The Companys projection of capital expenditures for 2004 is based upon its capital expenditure budget for 2004, the status of approved but not yet completed capital projects, anticipated future projects and historic spending trends. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities amounted to $108.9 million in 2003, $101.5 million in 2002 and $402.6 million in 2001. 28 The increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2003 compared with 2002 was primarily due to the following: cash of $1,298.1 million used in 2003 to redeem all of the outstanding shares of Series A convertible preferred stock on July 18, 2003, as discussed above; cash of $208.2 used to repurchase debt in December 2003, as discussed below; an increase of $7.9 million in 2003 compared with 2002 in cash used to purchase the Companys Series A convertible preferred stock, as discussed below; partially offset by: net cash proceeds of $1,557.2 million from issuance of the 5.375% senior notes in April 2003 and of the 5.625% senior notes, the 6.875% senior notes and the 3% convertible senior notes in July 2003, as discussed above; decrease in net debt repayments in the 2003 period of $212.0 million; and net proceeds of $13.9 million in 2003 from the Companys termination of U.S. Treasury lock agreements that were entered into to manage interest rate risks arising from the then planned issuance of the 5.375% senior notes, the 5.625% senior notes and the 6.875% senior notes, as described more fully in "Derivative Financial Instruments" below. The change in financing activities in 2002 compared with 2001 was primarily due to the following: net debt repayments of $35.8 million in 2002 compared to $312.9 million in 2001. During 2001, the Company repaid all amounts outstanding under a former revolving credit facility and most of the borrowings under the 2003 facility, which resulted in lower outstanding bank borrowings at December 31, 2001. All remaining borrowings under the 2003 facility were paid off during 2002; and a timing difference relating to the payment of dividends on the Companys outstanding Series A convertible preferred stock arising from the Companys pre funding in December 2001 of the dividend payable on January 2, 2002; partially offset by: an increase in cash used of $10.1 million to repurchase shares of the Companys preferred stock. Repurchases of Capital Stock During 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company repurchased 750,600 shares of its Series A convertible preferred stock at a cost of $36.7 million, 782,500 shares of its preferred stock at a cost of approximately $28.8 million, and 524,220 shares of its preferred stock at a cost of approximately $18.8 million, respectively. The average price per share of these preferred stock repurchases was $48.94, $36.85 and $35.78 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. As discussed in "Outstanding Indebtedness Senior Notes Issued in July 2003; Recapitalization" above and Notes 12 and 15 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements, in July 2003 the Company issued $1,281.3 million of senior notes. The Company used an aggregate of $1,298.1 million from the proceeds of these offerings and additional cash on hand to redeem the outstanding shares of its Series A convertible preferred stock. The share repurchases described above were made under a program previously adopted by the Companys Board of Directors. The share repurchase program authorized the repurchase of up to approximately 16,977,000 shares of common stock, which included Series A convertible preferred stock on an as converted basis prior to its redemption. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had repurchased approximately 10,116,000 shares of common stock and preferred stock on an as converted 29 basis, and the remaining repurchase authorization covered approximately 6,861,000 shares of common stock. The Company may from time to time continue to repurchase its capital stock. Debt Repurchase In December 2003, the Company used net cash of $208.2 million to repurchase in the open market $122.5 million face amount of its 8.75% senior notes and $50.0 million face amount of its 6.95% senior notes and to terminate interest rate swaps on the 8.75% senior notes with a total notional amount of $100.0 million. The net cash used of $208.2 million consisted of cash used to purchase the senior notes at a premium plus accrued interest and related fees of $208.9 million and cash received of $0.7 million related to the termination of the interest rate swaps. These repurchases were made at premiums to the face amounts of the notes and, therefore, resulted in a loss of $33.6 million, which the Company reflected in the statement of operations as "Loss on debt repurchase." The Company may from time to time continue to repurchase or otherwise retire its outstanding indebtedness. Changes in Working Capital At December 31, 2003, working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was a net asset of $237.4 million compared to a net liability of $96.5 million at December 31, 2002. The net liability position in working capital at the end of December 2002 was primarily due to recording the $512.5 million cash portion of the asbestos settlement liability as a current liability at December 31, 2002. The increase in the Companys net asset for working capital during 2003 arose primarily from the following changes: increase of $41.8 million in inventories, primarily due to $30 million from the effects of foreign currency translation, increased petrochemical based raw materials costs from December 31, 2002 and quantity increases in the ordinary course of business; increase in cash and cash equivalents primarily due to the net cash proceeds of $296.1 million from the April 2003 issuance of the 5.375% senior notes, described above, cash flows generated from operations and the net proceeds of $1,261.1 million from the July 2003 issuance of three series of senior notes, partially offset by $1,298.1 million of cash used for the redemption of the Companys Series A convertible preferred stock; increase of $68.4 million in notes and accounts receivable primarily due to $50.9 million from the positive effects of foreign currency translation and, to a lesser extent, an increase in net sales (excluding foreign exchange) during the fourth quarter of 2003 compared to the fourth quarter of 2002; and decrease in short term borrowings primarily due to net repayments; partially offset by: increase of $24.7 million in accounts payable primarily due to $16.0 million from the effects of foreign currency translation and, to a lesser extent, due to the timing of payments to vendors and the increased levels of inventory as discussed above; and increase in other current liabilities, primarily due to the following: increase in accrued interest of $27.3 million related to the asbestos settlement liability, $9.9 million from the issuance in April 2003 of the 5.375% senior notes and $32.6 million from the July 2003 issuance of senior notes; partially offset by decrease of $13.3 in accrued preferred dividends since all of the outstanding shares of Series A convertible preferred stock were redeemed on July 18, 2003, as discussed above. 30  Current and Quick Ratios The ratio of current assets to current liabilities, known as the current ratio, was 1.2 at December 31, 2003 and 0.9 at December 31, 2002. The ratio of current assets less inventory to current liabilities, known as the quick ratio, was 0.9 at December 31, 2003 and 0.6 at December 31, 2002. Derivative Financial Instruments U.S. Treasury Lock Agreements During the three months ended June 30, 2003, the Company entered into U.S. Treasury lock agreements with a total notional amount of $700.0 million that qualified and were designated as cash flow hedges. U.S. Treasury lock agreements are instruments used to manage the risks associated with movements in U.S. Treasury rates. The Company entered into these agreements to manage interest rate risks arising from the planned issuance of the 5.375% senior notes in April 2003 and the planned issuance of the 5.625% senior notes and the 6.875% senior notes in July 2003 (see Note 12). The Company terminated these U.S. Treasury lock agreements prior to June 30, 2003 and received net cash proceeds of $13.9 million. The Company has reflected this amount in other comprehensive income and is amortizing and reflecting it as a net reduction of interest expense over the lives of the respective senior notes. At December 31, 2003, the Company was not party to any U.S. Treasury lock agreements. Interest Rate Swaps During 2003, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $500.0 million that qualify and were designated as fair value hedges. The interest rate swaps were entered into in order to convert a portion of the 5.375% senior notes and the 8.75% senior notes into floating rate debt. In connection with the Companys repurchase of a portion of the 8.75% senior notes in December 2003, the Company terminated interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $100.0 million and received net cash proceeds of $0.7 million. At December 31, 2003, the Company recorded the following adjustments to long term debt: an adjustment to record a decrease in the fair value of the 5.375% senior notes due to changes in interest rates of $6.1 million and an offsetting adjustment to other liabilities to record the fair value of the related interest rate swaps; and an adjustment to record an increase in the fair value of the 8.75% senior notes due to changes in interest rates of $3.8 million and an offsetting adjustment to other assets to record the fair value of the related interest rate swaps. The Company also reduced interest expense $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, due to the impact of interest rate swaps that were outstanding during the year. Foreign Currency Forward Contracts At December 31, 2003, the Company was party to foreign currency forward contracts, which did not have a significant impact on the Companys liquidity. For further discussion about these contracts and other financial instruments, see Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk." Series A Convertible Preferred Stock Prior to its redemption in July 2003, the Companys Series A convertible preferred stock was listed on the New York Stock Exchange and was convertible at any time into approximately 0.885 of a share of 31 common stock for each share of preferred stock. The holders of these shares voted with the holders of the common stock on an as converted basis and were entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends, when and as declared by the Board of Directors, at an annual rate of $2.00 per share, payable quarterly in arrears on the first business day of the succeeding calendar quarter. The Series A convertible preferred stock ranked senior to the Companys common stock and junior to the Companys indebtedness. Because it was subject to mandatory redemption, the Series A convertible preferred stock was classified outside of the shareholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheet. At its date of issuance, the fair value of the Series A convertible preferred stock exceeded its mandatory redemption amount primarily due to the common stock conversion feature. Accordingly, the book value of the Series A convertible preferred stock was reflected in the consolidated balance sheet at its mandatory redemption value. Shareholders Equity The Companys shareholders equity was $1,123.6 million at December 31, 2003, $813.0 million at December 31, 2002, and $850.2 million at December 31, 2001. Shareholders equity increased in 2003 principally due to the following: net earnings of $240.4 million; reduction of foreign currency translation adjustment of $75.2 million; conversion of preferred stock into common stock of $16.9 million; the net effect of transactions under the Companys contingent stock plan of $8.3 million; the exercise of stock options granted prior to the Cryovac transaction under the Companys stock option plans of $4.7 million; unrecognized gain on derivative instruments of $8.0 million, net of income tax, related to the termination of the Companys U.S. Treasury lock agreements discussed above; and the Companys contribution of its common stock to its profit sharing plan of $9.8 million; partially offset by: the Companys redemption of its Series A convertible preferred stock at its redemption price of $51.00 per share, which included a $1.00 per share redemption premium, or $25.5 million in the aggregate; and Series A convertible preferred stock dividends of $28.6 million. Shareholders equity decreased in 2002 principally due to the following: a reduction in retained earnings arising from the Companys net loss of $309.1 million and the payment of preferred stock dividends of $53.8 million; and foreign currency translation adjustments of $14.5 million; partially offset by: the net effect of transactions under the Companys contingent stock plan of $7.3 million; the $321.5 million value of the 9,000,000 shares of common stock reserved for issuance related to the asbestos settlement; and the excess of book value over the repurchase price of $10.3 million recognized in connection with preferred stock repurchases. 32 Recently Issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, Accounting Guidance and Disclosure Requirements The Company is subject to numerous recently issued statements of financial accounting standards, accounting guidance and disclosure requirements. Note 19, "New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, Accounting Guidance and Disclosure Requirements," of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is contained in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, describes these new accounting pronouncements and is incorporated herein by reference. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Companys discussion and analysis of its results of operations and financial condition are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, known as US GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, may differ from estimates, and while any differences may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements, the Company does not believe that the differences, taken as a whole, will be material. The Company believes the following accounting policies are critical to its business operations and the understanding of results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements: Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains accounts receivable allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of the Companys customers deteriorates. Commitments and Contingencies Litigation On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against the Company. While it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions, the Company uses its best judgment to determine if it is probable that it will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, the Company makes estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries, if any. The Company accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery, it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that the Company has previously made. Impairment of Long Lived Assets The Company periodically reviews long lived assets, other than goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill, in accordance with SFAS No. 142, is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. A review of goodwill may be initiated prior to conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. Assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses, such as future cash flows and disposition costs, may affect the carrying value of long lived assets and possible impairment expense in the Companys consolidated financial statements. 33 Self Insurance The Company retains the obligation for specified claims and losses related to property, casualty, workers compensation and employee benefit claims. The Company accrues for outstanding reported claims, claims that have been incurred but not reported, and projected claims based upon managements estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims using historical experience, insurance company estimates and the estimated trends in claim values. Although management believes it has the ability to adequately project and record estimated claim payments, actual results could differ significantly from the recorded liabilities. Pensions Although the Company maintains a non contributory profit sharing plan and contributory thrift and retirement savings plans in which most U.S. employees of the Company are eligible to participate, the Company does maintain defined benefit pension plans for a limited number of its U.S. employees and for many of its non U.S. employees. The Company accounts for these pension plans in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions." Under these accounting standards, assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and performance of plan assets. The principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure future obligations, the expected future rate of return on plan assets, the expected rate of future compensation increases and various other actuarial assumptions. Changes to these assumptions could have a significant impact on costs and liabilities recorded under SFAS No. 87. Income Taxes The Companys deferred tax assets arise from net deductible temporary differences and tax benefit carryforwards. The Company believes that its taxable earnings during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carryforwards may be utilized should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits. For those foreign jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax benefit carryforwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely, a valuation allowance is provided. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company estimates future taxable earnings, with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax benefit carryforwards, to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods, the Company may need to adjust the valuation allowance, which could materially impact the Companys consolidated financial statements. Forward Looking Statements Some of the statements made by the Company in this report, in documents incorporated by reference herein, and in future oral and written statements by the Company, may be forward looking. These statements reflect the Companys beliefs and expectations as to future events and trends affecting the Companys business, its results of operations and its financial condition. These forward looking statements are based upon the Companys current expectations concerning future events and discuss, among other things, anticipated future performance and future business plans. Forward looking statements are identified by such words and phrases as "anticipates," "believes," "could be," "estimates," "expects," "intends," "plans to," "will" and similar expressions. Forward looking statements are necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the Company, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. The Company recognizes that it is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may affect the future performance of the Company, such as: economic, political, business and market conditions in the geographic areas in which it conducts business; 34 factors affecting the customers, industries and markets that use the Companys packaging materials and systems; competitive factors; production capacity; raw material availability and pricing; changes in energy related expenses; disruptions in energy supply or communications; changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar; changes in interest rates, credit availability and ratings; the effect on the Company of new pronouncements by accounting authorities; the Companys ability to hire, develop and retain talented employees worldwide; the Companys development and commercialization of successful new products; the Companys accomplishments in entering new markets and acquiring and integrating new businesses; the Companys access to financing and other sources of capital; the success of the Companys key information systems projects; the magnitude and timing of the Companys capital expenditures; the Companys inventory management proficiency; changes in the Companys relationships with customers and suppliers; the approval and implementation of the settlement agreement with the Official Committee of Asbestos Personal Injury Claimants and the Official Committee of Asbestos Property Damage Claimants in the Grace bankruptcy proceeding; other effects on the Company of the bankruptcy filing by Grace and its subsidiaries; other legal and environmental proceedings, claims and matters involving the Company; the effects of animal and food related health issues, such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, also known as BSE or "mad cow" disease, avian influenza, also known as "bird flu," and foot and mouth disease; as well as other health issues affecting trade; acts and effects of war or terrorism; and changes in domestic or foreign laws, rules or regulations, or governmental or agency actions, including the effects of proposed federal asbestos legislation, if enacted. Except as required by the federal securities laws, the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. The Company seeks to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed 35 appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company does not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rates From time to time, the Company may use interest rate swaps, collars or options to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. 2003 Interest Rate Swaps: During 2003, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $500.0 million that qualify and were designated as fair value hedges. The interest rate swaps were entered into in order to convert a portion of the 5.375% senior notes and the 8.75% senior notes into floating rate debt. In connection with the Companys repurchase of a portion of the 8.75% senior notes in December 2003, the Company terminated interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $100.0 million and received net cash proceeds of $0.7 million. At December 31, 2003, the Company recorded the following adjustments to long term debt: an adjustment to record a decrease in the fair value of the 5.375% senior notes due to changes in interest rates of $6.1 million and an offsetting adjustment to other liabilities to record the fair value of the related interest rate swaps; and an adjustment to record an increase in the fair value of the 8.75% senior notes due to changes in interest rates of $3.8 million and an offsetting adjustment to other assets to record the fair value of the related interest rate swaps. The Company also reduced interest expense $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, due to the impact of interest rate swaps that were outstanding during the year. 2002 Interest Rate Swaps: In June 2002, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements (with a total notional amount of $50.0 million) that were qualified and designated as fair value hedges in accordance with SFAS No. 133. These agreements were entered into in order to convert a portion of the 8.75% senior notes fixed rate debt into floating rate debt. During September 2002, the Company terminated these swaps and reflected a basis adjustment to the 8.75% senior notes for a portion of the cash received of approximately $2.4 million. The Company is amortizing this amount and reflecting it as a component of interest expense over the remaining life of the 8.75% senior notes. The Company was not party to any interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had no interest rate collars or options outstanding. The fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt varies with changes in interest rates. Generally, the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. At December 31, 2003, the carrying value of the Companys total debt, giving effect to the impact of the interest rate swaps, was $2,280.4 million, of which $2,262.2 million was fixed rate debt. At December 31, 2002, the carrying value of the Companys total debt was $923.4 million, of which approximately $812.6 million was fixed rate debt. The estimated fair value of the Companys total debt, giving effect to the impact of the interest rate swaps, which reflects the cost of replacing the Companys fixed rate debt with borrowings at current market rates, was $2,445.3 million at December 31, 2003 compared to $958.3 million at December 31, 2002. A hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates would result in an increase in the fair value of the total debt balance at December 31, 2003 of $101.2 million. These changes in the fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt do not alter the Companys obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount of this debt. 36 Foreign Exchange Rates The Company may use other derivative instruments from time to time, such as foreign exchange options to manage exposure due to foreign exchange rates and interest rate and currency swaps to gain access to additional sources of international financing, while limiting foreign exchange exposure and limiting or adjusting interest rate exposure by swapping borrowings in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had no foreign exchange options or interest rate and currency swap agreements outstanding. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to fix the amount payable on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The terms of these instruments are generally twelve months or less. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of approximately $161.9 million and $146.9 million, respectively. The estimated fair values of these contracts, which represent the estimated net payments that would be paid or received by the Company in the event of termination of these contracts based on the then current foreign exchange rates, was a net payable of $0.2 million and zero at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates at December 31, 2003 would have caused the Company to pay approximately $0.4 million to terminate these contracts. The Companys foreign subsidiaries had outstanding debt of approximately $22.7 million and $322.7 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. This debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing subsidiary. The Company believes that this enables it to better match operating cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, thereby reducing its need to enter into foreign exchange contracts. Commodities The Company uses various commodity raw material and energy products in conjunction with its manufacturing processes. Generally, the Company acquires these components at market prices and does not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices. As a result, the Company is exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components. 37
