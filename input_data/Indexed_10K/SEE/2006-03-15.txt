Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The information in "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" should be read together with the Companys consolidated financial statements and related notes set forth in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. All amounts and percentages are approximate due to rounding. Introduction The Company manufactures and sells a wide range of food and protective packaging products, operating in the United States and in 50 other countries, with products distributed in those countries and in other parts of the world. The Company operates in two reportable business segments, Food Packaging and Protective Packaging. The Companys principal food packaging products are flexible materials, associated packaging equipment systems, rigid containers and absorbent pads. These products, many of which bear the Cryovac trademark, package a broad range of perishable foods. The Company primarily sells the products in this segment to food processors, distributors, supermarket retailers and food service businesses. The Companys principal protective packaging products provide cushioning, surface protection and void fill. The Company primarily sells its protective packaging products and systems to distributors and manufacturers in a wide variety of industries. The Companys global sales and marketing staff numbered approximately 2,600 employees in the countries in which it operates, who sell and market the Companys products through a large number of distributors, fabricators and converters, as well as directly to end users such as food processors, food service businesses, and manufacturers. The Company has no material long term contracts for the distribution of its products. In 2005, no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10% or more of the Companys consolidated net sales. Although net sales of both food packaging products and protective packaging products have tended to be slightly higher in the fourth quarter, the Company does not consider seasonality to be material to its consolidated business or to either reportable business segment. Competition for most of the Companys packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics, service and price. Competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology and, as a result, the Company maintains ongoing research and development programs to enable it to maintain technological leadership. The Companys net sales are sensitive to developments in its customers business or market conditions, changes in the global economy, and the effects of foreign currency translation. Its costs can vary significantly with changes in petrochemical related costs, which are not within the Companys control. Consequently, the Companys management focuses on reducing those costs that the Company can control and using petrochemical based raw materials as efficiently as possible. The Company also believes that its global presence helps to insulate it from localized changes in business conditions that may more strongly affect some of its competitors. As is discussed below, the Companys businesses are managed to generate substantial cash flow. The Company believes that its strong cash flow will permit it to continue to spend significantly on innovative research and development and to invest in its business by means of acquisitions and capital expenditures for property and equipment. Moreover, its ability to generate substantial cash flow should provide the Company with the flexibility to modify its capital structure as the need or opportunity arises. The Company also believes that this cash flow, along with accumulated cash and funds available under its credit facilities, will enable the Company to make the settlement payment, including interest, that is expected to be required of the Company upon consummation of a plan of reorganization in the 20 W. R. Grace & Co. bankruptcy, as discussed below. In addition to investing in its business, the Company uses its cash flow to reduce debt and to return value to its shareholders. On January 30, 2006, the Company announced that it is initiating payment of a quarterly cash dividend. The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per common share payable on March 17, 2006 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 3, 2006. Highlights for the Companys year 2005 compared with 2004 and 2003 were: 2005 2004 2003 2005 vs. 2004 % Change 2004 vs. 2003 % Change (dollars in millions) U.S. $ 1,972.9 $ 1,851.8 $ 1,844.8 6.5 % 0.4 % % of total net sales 48 % 49 % 52 % International 2,112.2 1,946.3 1,687.1 8.5 % 15.4 % % of total net sales 52 % 51 % 48 % Total net sales $ 4,085.1 $ 3,798.1 $ 3,531.9 7.6 % 7.5 % Gross profit $ 1,158.0 $ 1,162.1 $ 1,112.8 % 4.4 % % of total net sales 28.3 % 30.6 % 31.5 % Marketing, administrative and development expenses $ 645.9 $ 626.1 $ 572.4 3.2 % 9.4 % % of total net sales 15.8 % 16.5 % 16.2 % Restructuring and other charges (credits) $ 1.7 $ 33.0 $ (0.5 ) (94.8 )% NA Operating profit $ 510.4 $ 503.0 $ 540.9 1.5 % (7.0 )% % of total net sales 12.5 % 13.2 % 15.3 % Net Sales The principal factors contributing to changes in net sales in the three years ended December 31, 2005 were changes in unit volume, changes in product mix and average selling prices, and foreign currency translation. Net sales in 2005 increased 8% to $4,085.1 million compared with $3,798.1 million in 2004. The components of the increase in net sales for 2005 were as follows (dollars in millions): Components of Increase in Net Sales (2005 vs. 2004): Food Packaging Segment Protective Packaging Segment Total Company Volume Units 2.8 % $ 64.8 2.7 % $ 39.7 2.8 % $ 104.5 Volume Acquired Businesses, net of dispositions (0.2 ) (4.6 ) 0.7 9.6 0.1 5.0 Price/Mix 3.5 82.7 2.6 37.5 3.2 120.2 Foreign Currency Translation 1.8 42.3 1.0 15.0 1.5 57.3 Total 7.9 % $ 185.2 7.0 % $ 101.8 7.6 % $ 287.0 21 Net sales for 2004 increased 8% to $3,798.1 million compared with $3,531.9 million in 2003. The components of the increase in net sales for 2004 were as follows (dollars in millions): Components of Increase in Net Sales (2004 vs. 2003): Food Packaging Segment Protective Packaging Segment Total Company Volume Units 0.7 % $ 15.7 5.6 % $ 73.7 2.5 % $ 89.4 Volume Acquired Businesses, net of dispositions 0.1 2.0 0.3 3.7 0.2 5.7 Price/Mix 0.8 0.8 10.9 0.3 11.7 Foreign Currency Translation 5.0 109.8 3.8 49.6 4.5 159.4 Total 5.8 % $ 128.3 10.5 % $ 137.9 7.5 % $ 266.2 Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on net sales of $57.3 million in 2005. Excluding the positive effect of foreign currency translation, net sales would have increased 6% compared with 2004. The favorable foreign currency translation impact on net sales for the full year of 2005 was primarily due to the strengthening of foreign currencies in the Asia Pacific region, Brazil and Europe against the U.S. dollar. The full year favorable impact of $57.3 million includes an unfavorable fourth quarter impact of $10.9 million, primarily due to the weakness of foreign currencies in Europe against the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on net sales of $159.4 million in 2004. Excluding the positive effect of foreign currency translation, net sales would have increased 3% compared with 2003. The favorable foreign currency translation impact on net sales in 2004 was primarily due to the strengthening of foreign currencies in Europe and the Asia Pacific region against the U.S. dollar, partially offset by the weakness of the Brazilian real. Net sales of the Companys food packaging segment, which consists primarily of the Companys Cryovac&reg; food packaging products, constituted 62% of net sales in 2005 and 2004 and 63% of net sales in 2003. The Companys protective packaging segment contributed the balance of net sales. This segment aggregates the Companys protective packaging products and shrink packaging products, all of which are used principally for non food packaging applications. Food Packaging Segment Sales Net sales of food packaging products increased 8% in 2005 to $2,532.1 million compared with $2,346.9 million in 2004 and increased 6% in 2004 compared with $2,218.6 million in 2003. Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on this segment of $42.3 million in 2005. Excluding the positive foreign currency translation effect, net sales for this segment would have increased 6% in 2005. Excluding the positive foreign currency translation effect of $109.8 million, net sales for this segment would have increased 1% in 2004. In 2005, unit volumes increased in all regions of the world, with the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions having the primary impact. The segment also benefited from price/mix due in part to selling price increases. In 2004, unit volumes increased in Latin America and to a lesser extent, in Asia Pacific and Europe, partially offset by a decrease in North America. The decrease in North America was due to import restrictions imposed by several countries on U.S. beef products, which adversely affected the sales of food packaging products to the Companys customers that process U.S. beef for export. 22  Among the classes of products in the food packaging segment, net sales of flexible packaging materials and related systems increased 7% to $2,122.8 million in 2005 compared with $1,976.5 million in 2004 and increased 6% in 2004 compared with 2003 net sales of $1,868 million. Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of $37.3 million in 2005 for flexible packaging materials and related systems. Excluding the positive foreign currency translation effect, net sales for flexible packaging materials and related systems would have increased 6% in 2005. Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of $90.5 million in 2004 for flexible packaging materials and related systems. Excluding the positive foreign currency translation effect, net sales for flexible packaging materials and related systems would have increased 1% in 2004. The components of the increase in net sales for 2005 and 2004 were as follows (dollars in millions): Components of Increase in Net Sales: Flexible Packaging Materials and Related Systems 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 Volume Units 3.0 % $ 59.4 1.5 % $ 27.1 Volume Acquired Businesses Price/Mix 2.5 49.6 (0.5 ) (9.1 ) Foreign Currency Translation 1.9 37.3 4.8 90.5 Total 7.4 % $ 146.3 5.8 % $ 108.5 Net sales of rigid packaging and absorbent pads, the other class of products in the food packaging segment, increased 11% to $409.3 million compared with $370.4 million in 2004 and increased 6% in 2004 compared with 2003 net sales of $350.6 million. Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of $5.1 million in 2005 for rigid packaging and absorbent pads. Excluding the positive effect of foreign currency translation, net sales of rigid packaging and absorbent pads would have increased 9% in 2005. Excluding the $19.3 million positive foreign currency translation effect, net sales of rigid packaging and absorbent pads would have remained flat in 2004 compared with 2003. The components of the increase in net sales for 2005 and 2004 were as follows (dollars in millions): Components of Increase in Net Sales: Rigid Packaging and Absorbent Pads 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 Volume Units 1.5 % $ 5.4 (3.3 )% $ (11.4 ) Volume Acquired Businesses, net of dispositions (1.3 ) (4.7 ) 0.6 2.0 Price/Mix 8.9 33.1 2.8 9.9 Foreign Currency Translation 1.4 5.1 5.5 19.3 Total 10.5 % $ 38.9 5.6 % $ 19.8 The Company sells foam and solid plastic trays and containers that customers use to package a wide variety of food products. The Company manufactures such products in its own facilities in various regions or has them fabricated by other manufacturers. The Companys net sales of such products fabricated by other manufacturers were $110.4 million, $83.5 million and $70.8 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Protective Packaging Segment Sales Net sales of protective packaging products increased 7% to $1,553 million in 2005 compared with $1,451.2 million in 2004 and increased 11% in 2004 compared with 2003 sales of $1,313.3 million. Sales growth in this segment was balanced between unit volume of $39.7 million, primarily in North America, and a positive price/mix impact of $37.5 million, primarily in North America and to a lesser extent in Europe, in part due to selling price increases. Unit volumes increased in 2004 in all regions of the world with the U.S and Europe having the primary impact. 23 Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of $15 million in 2005 for this segment. Excluding the positive foreign currency translation effect, net sales for the protective packaging segment would have increased 6% in 2005. Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of $49.6 million in 2004 for this segment. Excluding the positive foreign currency translation effect, net sales for the protective packaging segment would have increased 7% in 2004. The classes of products within the protective packaging segment are cushioning and surface protection products and other products. Other products within the protective packaging segment represented approximately 1% of consolidated net sales in 2005, 2004 and 2003. Sales by Geographic Region Net sales from operations in the United States represented 48% and 49% of net sales in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Net sales from U.S. operations increased 7% in 2005 to $1,972.9 million compared with $1,851.8 million in 2004. Net sales from international operations increased 9% in 2005 to $2,112.2 million compared with $1,946.3 million in 2004. Excluding the $57.3 million positive foreign currency translation effect, international net sales would have increased 6% compared with 2004. The components of the increase in net sales by geographic region for 2005 were as follows (dollars in millions): Components of Increase in Net Sales (2005 vs. 2004): U.S. International Total Company Volume Units 2.2 % $ 40.0 3.3 % $ 64.5 2.8 % $ 104.5 Volume Acquired Businesses, net of dispositions 0.1 1.4 0.2 3.6 0.1 5.0 Price/Mix 4.2 79.7 2.1 40.5 3.2 120.2 Foreign Currency Translation 2.9 57.3 1.5 57.3 Total 6.5 % $ 121.1 8.5 % $ 165.9 7.6 % $ 287.0 Net sales from operations in the United States represented 49% and 52% of net sales in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Net sales from U.S. operations remained flat in 2004 at $1,851.8 million compared with $1,844.8 million in 2003. Net sales from international operations increased 15% in 2004 to $1,946.3 million compared with $1,687.1 million in 2003. Excluding the $159.4 million positive foreign currency translation effect, international net sales would have increased 6% compared with 2003. The components of the increase in net sales by geographic region for 2004 were as follows (dollars in millions): Components of Increase in Net Sales (2004 vs. 2003): U.S. International Total Company Volume Units (0.5 )% $ (9.4 ) 5.9 % $ 98.8 2.5 % $ 89.4 Volume Acquired Businesses, net of dispositions (1.2 ) 0.4 6.9 0.2 5.7 Price/Mix 0.9 17.6 (0.3 ) (5.9 ) 0.3 11.7 Foreign Currency Translation 9.4 159.4 4.5 159.4 Total 0.4 % $ 7.0 15.4 % $ 259.2 7.5 % $ 266.2 Costs and Margins Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 28.3% in 2005, 30.6% in 2004 and 31.5% in 2003. The principal cause for the reduction since 2003 was significantly higher petrochemical based raw materials and other energy related costs. Between 2003 and 2005, the prices of crude oil and natural gas, which serve as feedstocks utilized in the production of many of the resins the Company buys, have approximately doubled. Although changes in prices of crude oil and natural gas are not perfect benchmarks, they are indicative of the variations in raw material and energy related costs faced by the Company. The decrease in gross profit in 2005 compared with 2004 was also caused in part by an 24 unfavorable shift in product mix, which was partially offset by increases in selling prices. The decrease in 2004 compared with 2003 was also due to a reduction in sales volumes in the North America food packaging business due to import restrictions on U.S. beef products imposed by certain foreign governments. Marketing, administrative and development expenses increased 3% in 2005 and 9% in 2004. The increase in 2005 was due to the impact of foreign currency translation, higher professional fees, and, to a lesser extent, expenses for research and development related projects, partially offset by a reduction in management incentive compensation since the Company did not meet earnings growth objectives for 2005 and partial year savings from restructuring activities initiated in the fourth quarter of 2004, as discussed below. The increase in 2004 was primarily due to the effects of foreign currency translation, expenses associated with the upgrade of the Companys information technology platform, and expenses to support the higher volume of net sales. Marketing, administrative and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were 15.8% in 2005, 16.5% in 2004 and 16.2% in 2003. 2004 Restructuring Program During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company announced a series of separate profit improvement plans in various geographic regions in order to complement the Companys long term growth programs and financial goals, improve the Companys operating efficiencies and lower its overall cost structure. The plans principally reduced the number of employees and consolidated or relocated operations in both of the Companys reportable business segments. At December 31, 2004, the Company expected to eliminate 473 full time positions, and during 2005 the Company revised the number of positions to be eliminated to 475. During 2004, 65 positions were eliminated, and 379 positions were eliminated during 2005 for a total of 444 positions eliminated by the end of 2005. As an element of the program, the Company expects to add approximately 100 positions in connection with the Companys realignment or relocation of some of its manufacturing activities, so that the net reduction in positions is expected to be approximately 375. These actions affected principally production workers and members of the Companys sales force, primarily in Europe. The Company expects to substantially complete this reduction in headcount by March 2006. The charges for the year ended December 31, 2004 consisted of the following: Year Ended December 31, 2004 Food Packaging Protective Packaging Total Cost Employee termination costs $ 17.5 $ 4.1 $ 21.6 Long lived asset impairments 10.2 0.1 10.3 Facility exit costs 1.1 1.1 FAS 88 curtailment and settlements 0.3 0.3 Total $ 29.1 $ 4.2 $ 33.3 The long lived asset impairment of $10.3 million consisted of write downs and write offs of property and equipment. The impairments related to decisions to rationalize and realign production of some of the Companys smaller product lines and to close several smaller European manufacturing facilities. Since the undiscounted cash flows associated with these asset groups, including estimated salvage value, were less than the carrying values of these asset groups, they were written down to their estimated fair value. The Company plans to dispose of these facilities and much of the equipment during the first six months of 2006. 25 The components of the restructuring charges, spending and other activity through December 31, 2005 and the remaining accrual balance at December 31, 2005 were as follows: Employee Termination Costs Facility Exit Costs Total Cost Original provision in 2004 $ 21.6 $ 1.1 $ 22.7 Cash payments during 2004 (0.6 ) (0.6 ) Effect of changes in currency rates 0.2 0.2 Restructuring accrual at December 31, 2004 21.2 1.1 22.3 Cash payments during 2005 (16.5 ) (0.3 ) (16.8 ) Adjustment to restructuring liability, net 0.4 0.4 Effect of changes in currency rates (0.4 ) (0.1 ) (0.5 ) Restructuring accrual at December 31, 2005 $ 4.7 $ 0.7 $ 5.4 The Company expects to pay $5.0 million of the remaining accrual balance at December 31, 2005 in 2006 and $0.4 million in 2007 and thereafter. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded $1.7 million of additional charges related to the 2004 restructuring program. This amount includes $1.3 million of costs incurred in 2005 related to the relocation of assets and employees from facilities that were closed as part of the restructuring program. The Company also recorded a net charge of $0.4 million related to the employee termination costs that were accrued as part of the 2004 restructuring program. The modifications to the originally recorded amounts were due to increases in the amounts due to terminated employees ($0.9 million) and reductions based upon certain employees no longer being eligible for the termination benefits ($0.5 million). The Company estimates that the cost savings realized in 2005 were $18 to $20 million and estimates that it will realize approximately $25 to $30 million in annualized cost savings on a full year run rate basis by the end of 2006. Operating Profit Operating profit increased 1.5% in 2005 and decreased 7.0% in 2004. The increase in 2005 was due to an increase in net sales and a decrease of $31.3 million in restructuring and other charges, partially offset by higher petrochemical based raw materials and other energy related costs and an increase of $19.8 million in marketing, administrative and development expenses. The decrease in operating profit in 2004 was due to $33 million of restructuring and other charges, $53.7 million of higher marketing, administrative and development expenses, an increase in petrochemical related raw material costs, and reduced sales volumes in the Companys North American food packaging business, offset by an increase in total net sales, all of which are discussed above. As a percentage of net sales, operating profit was 12.5% in 2005, 13.2% in 2004 and 15.3% in 2003. Operating profit by business segment for 2005, 2004 and 2003 was as follows (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Food Packaging Segment $ 324.1 $ 319.3 $ 349.2 Protective Packaging Segment 189.0 217.6 191.8 Total segments 513.1 536.9 541.0 Restructuring and other (charges) credits (1.7 ) (33.0 ) 0.5 Unallocated corporate operating expenses (1.0 ) (0.9 ) (0.6 ) Total $ 510.4 $ 503.0 $ 540.9 The food packaging segment contributed 63%, 59% and 65% of the Companys operating profit in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, before taking into consideration restructuring and other (charges) 26 credits and unallocated corporate operating expenses. The Companys protective packaging segment contributed the balance of operating profit. Food packaging operating profit was 12.8%, 13.6% and 15.7% of food packaging net sales in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decline in operating profit as a percentage of net sales in 2005 compared with 2004 was due to higher raw material and energy related costs combined with an unfavorable shift in product mix, partially offset by selling price increases. The decline in operating profit as a percentage of net sales in 2004 compared with 2003 was due to higher raw material costs and reduced sales volumes in North America due to import restrictions on U.S. beef products. Protective packaging operating profit was 12.2%, 15.0% and 14.6% of protective packaging net sales in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decline in operating profit as a percentage of net sales in 2005 compared with 2004 was due to higher raw material and energy related costs combined with an unfavorable shift in product mix, partially offset by selling price increases. The increase in operating profit as a percentage of net sales in 2004 compared with 2003 was due to higher unit volumes, benefits from ongoing productivity initiatives and price increases implemented to help offset rising raw material costs, partially offset by higher raw material costs. Interest Expense and Other Income, net Interest expense (which includes the effects of interest rate swaps and the amortization of capitalized debt issuance costs, bond discount and terminated treasury locks) was $149.7 million in 2005, $153.7 million in 2004, and $136 million in 2003. The decrease in interest expense in 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily due to the following: a $12.5 million decrease due to the redemption of the entire outstanding principal amount, $177.5 million, of the Companys 8.75% senior notes due July 2008, the repurchase of $22.7 million face amount of its 6.95% senior notes due May 2009, and the termination of related interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $150 million, all in the fourth quarter of 2004; partially offset by; an increase of $4.7 million due to the impact of higher interest rates on the Companys $300 million of outstanding interest rate swaps entered into to effectively convert its 5.375% senior notes due April 2008 into floating rate debt; an increase of $1.6 million caused by additional expense related to the compounding of interest on the amount payable pursuant to the asbestos settlement agreement; and an increase of $1.4 million related to lower capitalized interest during the construction of capital investment projects in 2005 compared with the 2004 period. The increase in interest expense in 2004 compared with 2003 was primarily due to the following: an increase of $37.2 million of interest expense in 2004 due to the Companys issuance of approximately $300 million of senior notes in April 2003 and $1.3 billion of senior notes and convertible senior notes in July 2003 as discussed below; partially offset by; a decrease of $16.4 million of interest expense due to the repurchase of $172.5 million face amount of senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2003 and the senior note redemption and repurchases completed in the fourth quarter of 2004. Other income, net, was $15.9 million in 2005, $5.8 million in 2004, and $5.6 million in 2003. Included in these amounts are primarily interest and dividend income of $11.1 million, $7.7 million and $6.8 million and net foreign exchange transaction losses of $4.7 million, $9.0 million and $2.8 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 27 Loss on debt redemption and repurchases In 2004 and 2003 the Company incurred losses of $32.2 million and $33.6 million, respectively, due to debt redemptions and repurchases. These losses were reflected in the statement of operations in "Loss on debt redemption and repurchases." See below under the caption "Analysis of Historical Cash Flows Debt Redemption and Repurchases" for further discussion of these transactions. Income Taxes The Companys effective income tax rate was 32.1% in 2005, 33.3% in 2004 and 36.2% in 2003. The decrease in the 2005 effective income tax rate compared with 2004 was primarily due to the reversal of reserves for tax matters for periods that have closed in the relevant jurisdictions. The Company currently expects an effective income tax rate of approximately 33.3% for 2006. The decrease in the 2004 effective income tax rate compared with 2003 was primarily due to improved tax efficiencies resulting from reorganizing the Companys international subsidiaries, tax effects from debt retirement, state taxes and a change in foreign tax law, partially offset by some of the 2004 business restructuring expenses which the Company could not recognize for tax purposes. In 2005 and 2004, the effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35.0% primarily due to the lower net effective income tax rate on foreign earnings, partially offset by the effect of state income taxes. In 2003, the effective income tax rate was higher than the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes and non deductible expenses, partially offset by the lower net effective tax rate on foreign earnings. The American Jobs Creation Act, known as the AJCA, provided for a deduction of 85% of qualifying foreign earnings that the Company could have repatriated in 2005. After considering global cash management objectives, its overall tax position and restrictions on the use of repatriated cash, the Company did not repatriate any qualifying foreign earnings in 2005. The AJCA also provided for a deduction in 2005 for qualified production activities. This deduction did not have a material impact on the Companys 2005 effective income tax rate. Net Earnings As a result of the factors noted above, net earnings were $255.8 million in 2005, $215.6 million in 2004 and $240.4 million in 2003. Earnings per Common Share Basic earnings per common share were $3.09 for 2005, $2.56 for 2004 and $2.21 for 2003. Diluted earnings per common share were $2.69 for 2005, $2.25 for 2004 and $1.97 for 2003. The diluted earnings per common share for 2003 includes a $0.26 per common share charge related to the Companys redemption of all of its outstanding shares of Series A convertible preferred stock on July 18, 2003. The Company redeemed all of the outstanding shares of its Series A convertible preferred stock at a redemption price of $51.00 per share. The Company also paid accrued dividends on the preferred stock from July 1, 2003 through July 17, 2003 in the aggregate amount of $2.4 million. The $51.00 per share redemption price included a $1.00 per share redemption premium, or an aggregate premium of $25.5 million. The Company also reflected this redemption price in basic earnings per common share in 2003. The basic earnings per common share calculations for 2003 include gains of $0.8 million attributable to the repurchase of preferred stock. The Company did not recognize any such gains for 2005 and 2004 since it had redeemed all shares of its outstanding preferred stock during the third quarter of 2003. In calculating diluted earnings per common share, the Companys calculation of the weighted average number of common shares for 2005, 2004 and 2003 provides for the conversion of the Companys 3% convertible senior notes due June 2033 due to the application of EITF Issue No. 04 08, "The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share," the assumed issuance of 28 nine million shares of common stock reserved for the Companys previously announced asbestos settlement referred to in Note 16, "Commitments and Contingencies" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is contained in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, under the caption "Asbestos Settlement and Related Costs," and the exercise of dilutive stock options, net of assumed treasury stock repurchases. Liquidity and Capital Resources The discussion that follows contains: a description of the Companys material commitments and contingencies, a description of the Companys principal sources of liquidity, a description of the Companys outstanding indebtedness, an analysis of the Companys historical cash flows, a description of the Companys derivative financial instruments, a description of the Companys shareholders equity, and a description of the Companys global manufacturing strategy. Material Commitments and Contingencies Asbestos Settlement; Commitments Related to the Cryovac Transaction The Company recorded a charge of $850.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, of which $512.5 million covers a cash payment that the Company is required to make upon the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy of W. R. Grace & Co. The Company did not use cash in 2005, 2004 or 2003 with respect to this liability, and the Company cannot predict when it will be required to make this payment. The Company currently expects to fund this payment by using a combination of accumulated cash and future cash flows from operations and funds available under its $500 million senior unsecured multi currency credit facility or its accounts receivable securitization program, both described below, or a combination of these alternatives. The cash payment of $512.5 million accrues interest at a 5.5% annual rate, which is compounded annually, from December 21, 2002 to the date of payment. The Company has recorded this accrued interest in other current liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets, and these amounts were $90.3 million and $58.9 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company is subject to other contingencies related to the Cryovac transaction. Note 16, "Commitments and Contingencies," of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is contained in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, describes these contingencies under "Contingencies Related to the Cryovac Transaction" and is incorporated herein by reference. Compliance Matters In late 2005, the Company identified travel and related expenses that had been paid by certain of the Companys foreign subsidiaries for trips by government officials who oversee the regulation of the Companys medical products in a foreign country. Although these expenses were accurately recorded as travel and entertainment expenses in the Companys books and records, these activities appeared to have breached the Companys Code of Conduct. More importantly, the Company was concerned that these payments may have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and therefore outside counsel was retained and promptly began an internal investigation. In March 2006, the Company voluntarily disclosed to the United States Department of Justice, or the DOJ, and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, the factual information obtained to date in the Companys internal investigation, including that these payments were made between 2003 and 2005 and totaled less than $0.2 million. The internal investigation is ongoing, and the Company is cooperating with the DOJ and the SEC. The Company cannot predict when this matter will be resolved or the terms upon which this matter will be resolved, although the Company currently does not expect this matter to be material to its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In connection with the 29 investigation, the Company is evaluating remedial measures and will take timely and appropriate action where necessary. Contractual Commitments The following table summarizes the Companys principal contractual obligations and sets forth the amounts of required cash outlays in 2006 and future years (amounts in millions): Payments Due by Period Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Short term borrowings $ 21.8 $ 21.8 $ $ $ Current portion of long term debt exclusive of debt discounts 241.5 241.5 Long term debt, exclusive of debt discounts and interest rate swap adjustments 1,829.6 307.0 666.6 856.0 Total debt(1)(2) 2,092.9 263.3 307.0 666.6 856.0 Operating leases 102.3 26.2 36.1 16.7 23.3 Cash portion of the asbestos settlement, including accrued interest as of December 31, 2005(3) 602.8 602.8 Acquisition of Nelipak Holdings B.V. 41.2 41.2 Declared 2006 first quarter quarterly cash dividend 12.2 12.2 Other principal contractual obligations 40.1 15.7 18.0 6.4 Total contractual cash obligations $ 2,891.5 $ 961.4 $ 361.1 $ 683.3 $ 885.7 (1)Includes principal maturities (at face value) only. (2)The 2010 period includes the 3% convertible senior notes since the holders of these notes have the option to require the Company to repurchase the senior notes on June 30 of 2010, 2013, 2018, 2023 and 2028. See Note 10, "Debt and Credit Facilities," to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (3)This liability is reflected as a current liability due to the uncertainty of the timing of payment. Interest accrues on this amount at a rate of 5.5% per annum, compounded annually, until it becomes due and payable. Current Portion of Long Term Debt and Long Term Debt The debt shown in the above table excludes unamortized bond discounts and interest rate swap adjustments as of December 31, 2005 and, therefore, represents the principal amount of the debt required to be repaid in each period. Operating Leases In addition to the obligation to pay the principal amount of the debt obligations discussed above, the Company is obligated under the terms of various operating leases covering some of the facilities that it occupies and some production equipment, most of which are accounted for as operating leases. The contractual operating lease obligations listed in the table above represent estimated future minimum annual rental commitments under non cancelable real and personal property leases as of December 31, 2005. Asbestos Settlement The asbestos settlement is described more fully in "Asbestos Settlement; Commitments Related to the Cryovac Transaction," above. Acquisition of Nelipak Holdings B.V. On January 3, 2006, the Company acquired Nelipak Holdings B.V. for cash in the amount of $41.2 million and assumed debt of approximately $9.5 million. Such acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. This acquisition is not material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. Cash Dividend The Companys Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per common share, which is payable on March 17, 2006 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 3, 2006. The estimate of this liability was calculated using the 81,476,998 shares of common stock that were issued and outstanding as of January 31, 2006. 30  The Company has the following other principal contractual obligations: $10.5 million remaining obligation for the purchase of equipment over a five year period which began in 2003, together with a potential termination fee in an amount to be determined. The Companys obligation is reduced or increased based on market price changes for the equipment and changes in the Packaging Machinery Manufacturers Index. Estimated future minimum annual commitments are as follows: 2006 $5.0 million; and 2007 $5.5 million. Failure to purchase any of the minimum annual requirements in any year obligates the Company to pay an amount of 45% of such shortfall. During 2005 and 2004, the Company did not meet the minimum equipment purchase requirements and recorded a charge of $1 million and $0.9 million, respectively. $7 million minimum remaining commitment for the purchase of telecommunications and network capacity and services over a four year period that began in 2004. $6.4 million to a supplier if the Company fails to purchase an additional 95.5 million pounds of specified raw materials, at the then current market price, over a ten year period that ends in May 2012. The amount of the potential contingent payment declines in proportion to the Companys purchase of minimum quantities required under the contract. At December 31, 2005, the Companys purchases satisfied the minimum quantity requirements under the agreement. $1.2 million to a supplier of equipment and consumables (declining to $0.3 million over the remaining four year term of the commitment) if the Company fails to purchase approximately $6.5 million of consumables per year over a five year period that began in 2004. 1.5 million euros ($1.7 million at December 31, 2005) to a supplier of electricity over a two year period that began in 2004. 11.1 million euros ($13.3 million at the current exchange rate) to a supplier of storage and transportation service over a four year period, with the Company having a right to terminate on six months notice under certain circumstances. Interest Payments During 2005 and 2004, the Company paid $117 million and $141.3 million, respectively, in interest payments. The Company currently expects to pay from $118 million to $126 million in interest payments in 2006, including the impact of interest rate swap transactions. The actual interest paid in 2006 may be different from this amount if interest rates change or if the Company repurchases existing indebtedness or incurs indebtedness under its existing lines of credit or otherwise. This 2006 expected interest payment does not reflect payment of any accrued interest related to the asbestos settlement. Income Tax Payments During 2005 and 2004, the Company paid $152.2 million and $141.9 million, respectively, in income taxes. The Company currently expects to pay between $165 million and $175 million in income taxes in 2006, assuming it does not make the asbestos settlement payment in that year. Contributions to Defined Benefit Pension Plans The Company maintains defined benefit pension plans for a limited number of its U.S. employees and for some of its non U.S. employees. During 2005 and 2004, the Company paid $8.6 million and $15 million, respectively, in employer contributions to these defined benefit pension plans. The Company currently expects employer contributions to be $4.4 million in 2006. 31 Environmental Matters The Company is subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations, and it accrues for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. These accruals do not take into account any discounting for the time value of money and are not reduced by potential insurance recoveries, if any. The Company does not believe that it is reasonably possible that its liability in excess of the amounts that it has accrued for environmental matters will be material to its consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets or cash flows. The Company reassesses environmental liabilities whenever circumstances become better defined or it can better estimate remediation efforts and their costs. The Company evaluates these liabilities periodically based on available information, including the progress of remedial investigations at each site, the current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible parties. As some of these issues are decided (the outcomes of which are subject to uncertainties) or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated, the Company adjusts the recorded accruals, as necessary. The Company believes that these exposures are not material to its consolidated results of operations, balance sheets and cash flows. The Company believes that it has adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures. Principal Sources of Liquidity The Companys principal sources of liquidity are accumulated cash and short term investments, cash flows from operations and amounts available under its existing lines of credit described below, including the 2010 facility (which replaced the 2006 facility), the ANZ facility and its accounts receivable securitization program. Accumulated Cash and Cash Equivalents and Short Term Investments As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had accumulated cash and cash equivalents of $455.8 million and $358 million, respectively, and short term investments of $44.1 million and $54.1 million, respectively. The Companys short term investments consist of auction rate securities, all of which are classified as available for sale securities. See Note 4, "Short Term Investments Available for Sale Securities," to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements, which describes these short term investments. Cash Flows from Operations The Company expects that it will continue to generate significant cash flows from operations. See "Analysis of Historical Cash Flows" below. Lines of Credit Revolving Credit Facilities The 2010 Facility In July 2005, the Company entered into a $500 million senior unsecured multi currency revolving credit facility due 2010, known as the 2010 facility. The 2010 facility replaced the Companys $350 million revolving credit facility due 2006, known as the 2006 facility. The 2010 facility is available for general corporate purposes including the payment of a portion of the $512.5 million cash payment, plus accrued interest (which was $90.3 million at December 31, 2005), required to be paid upon the effectiveness of an appropriate plan of reorganization in the W. R. Grace & Co. bankruptcy. The Company may re borrow amounts repaid under the 2010 32 facility from time to time prior to the expiration or earlier termination of the 2010 facility. Facility fees are payable at the rate of 0.125% per annum on the total amounts available under the 2010 facility. The 2010 facility provides for changes in facility fees based on the Companys long term senior unsecured debt ratings. The Companys obligations under the 2010 facility bear interest at floating rates, which are generally determined by adding the applicable borrowing margin to the base rate or the interbank rate for the relevant currency and time period. The 2010 facility provides for changes in borrowing margins based on the Companys long term senior unsecured debt ratings. The 2010 facility contains other terms and conditions that are substantially the same as those contained in the 2006 facility. The terms include a requirement that, upon the occurrence of specified events that would adversely affect the settlement agreement in the Grace bankruptcy proceedings or would materially increase the Companys liability in respect of the Grace bankruptcy or the asbestos liability arising from the Cryovac transaction, the Company would be required to repay any amounts outstanding under the 2010 facility, or refinance the facility, within 60 days. See Note 16, "Commitments and Contingencies," of the Notes to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements under the captions "Asbestos Settlement and Related Costs" and "Cryovac Transaction; Contingencies Related to the Cryovac Transaction" for further discussion of this matter. The Company has not borrowed under the 2010 facility, and no borrowings were outstanding under the 2006 facility prior to its termination. ANZ Facility The Company has an Australian dollar 170 million, dual currency revolving credit facility, known as the ANZ facility, equivalent to U.S. $124.7 million at December 31, 2005. This credit facility was to expire on March 12, 2005 and the Company amended and extended the facility for a 5 year period expiring March 2010 with substantially equivalent terms and conditions. A syndicate of banks made this facility available to a group of the Companys Australian and New Zealand subsidiaries for general corporate purposes including refinancing of previously outstanding indebtedness. The Company may re borrow amounts repaid under the ANZ facility from time to time prior to the expiration or earlier termination of the facility. The Company did not borrow under the ANZ facility during 2005, and no amounts were outstanding under this facility during the year. The Companys obligations under the ANZ facility bear interest at floating rates, which are generally determined by adding the applicable borrowing margin to the base rate or the interbank rate for the relevant currency and time period. The ANZ facility provides for changes in borrowing margins based on the Companys long term senior unsecured debt ratings. Other Lines of Credit Substantially all the Companys short term borrowings of $21.8 million and $19.8 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, were outstanding under lines of credit available to several of the Companys foreign subsidiaries. The weighted average interest rate on these outstanding lines of credit was 12.3% and 11.4% at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Amounts available under these credit lines as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 were approximately $200.1 million and $237.9 million, respectively, of which approximately $178.3 million and $218.1 million, respectively, were unused. 33 The following table summarizes the Companys available lines of credit and committed and uncommitted lines of credit, including the credit lines discussed above, at December 31, 2005 and 2004: December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 Used lines of credit $ 27.2 $ 23.4 Unused lines of credit 797.6 694.2 Total available lines of credit $ 824.8 $ 717.6 Available lines of credit committed $ 624.7 $ 479.7 Available lines of credit uncommitted 200.1 237.9 Total available lines of credit $ 824.8 $ 717.6 The Companys principal credit lines were all committed and consisted of the 2010 facility in 2005, the 2006 facility in 2004, and the ANZ facility in 2005 and 2004. The Company is not subject to any material compensating balance requirements in connection with its lines of credit. Accounts Receivable Securitization Program The Companys $125 million receivables program has an expiration date of December 7, 2007. The receivables program contains financial covenants relating to interest coverage and debt leverage. The Company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2005. During 2005, the Companys receivables funding subsidiary sold an undivided ownership interest in $35 million of eligible receivables under the receivables program. Payments on the Companys receivables that were applied to these receivables interests in accordance with the terms of the program reduced the amount of receivables interests held by the bank or the issuer of commercial paper that are parties to the program to zero during 2005. Therefore, as of December 31, 2005, neither the bank nor the issuer of commercial paper held any receivables interests, and the Company did not remove any related amounts from the assets reflected on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2005. The operating subsidiaries did not sell any receivables interests under the receivables program during 2004, and therefore the Company did not remove any related amounts from the consolidated assets reflected on the Companys consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2004. See Note 5, "Accounts Receivable Securitization," of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning this program. Debt Ratings The Companys cost of capital and ability to obtain external financing may be affected by its debt ratings, which the credit rating agencies review periodically. The Companys long term senior unsecured debt is currently rated Baa3 (stable outlook) by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. and BBB (negative outlook) by Standard & Poors, a division of The McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. These ratings are among the ratings assigned by each of these organizations for investment grade long term senior unsecured debt. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 34  Outstanding Indebtedness At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Companys total debt outstanding consisted of the amounts set forth on the following table: December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 Short term borrowings and current portion of long term debt: Short term borrowings $ 21.8 $ 19.8 Current portion of long term debt 241.4 3.8 Total current debt 263.2 23.6 Long term debt, less current portion: 5.625% Euro Notes due July 2006, less unamortized discount of $0.5 in 2004(1) 267.5 6.95% Senior Notes due May 2009, less unamortized discount of $0.7 in 2005 and $0.9 in 2004(1) 226.6 226.4 5.375% Senior Notes due April 2008, less unamortized discount and fair value adjustment of $13.3 in 2005 and $8.7 in 2004(1)(2) 286.7 291.3 5.625% Senior Notes due July 2013, less unamortized discount of $1.1 in 2005 and $1.2 in 2004(1) 398.9 398.8 6.875% Senior Notes due July 2033, less unamortized discount of $1.6 in 2005 and $1.6 in 2004(1) 448.4 448.4 3% Convertible Senior Notes due June 2033(1)(3) 431.3 431.3 Other 21.1 24.3 Total long term debt, less current portion 1,813.0 2,088.0 Total debt $ 2,076.2 $ 2,111.6 (1)Interest is payable semiannually in arrears, except for interest on the 5.625% euro notes, which is paid annually. (2)Amounts include adjustments due to interest rate swaps. See Note 11, "Derivatives and Hedging Activities," of the Notes to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. (3)Note 10, "Debt," of the Notes to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements describes the conversion, redemption, put and other special provisions applicable to the 3% convertible senior notes. 5.625% Euro Notes Included in the current portion of long term debt at December 31, 2005 are the 5.625% euro notes with a face value of &euro;200 million, equivalent to U.S. $238.3 million at December 31, 2005. The 5.625% euro notes were classified as a current liability on the Companys consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2005 since the notes mature in July 2006. The Company intends to use available cash to retire this debt when it matures. The carrying value of the 5.625% euro notes at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $238.1 million and $267.5 million, respectively. The carrying value of the 5.625% euro notes decreased $29.7 million during 2005 as a result of the weakening of the euro compared with the U.S. dollar. Senior Notes Issued in July 2003; Recapitalization In July 2003, the Company issued a total of $1,281.3 million principal amount of its 5.625% senior notes, 6.875% senior notes and 3% convertible senior notes in transactions exempt from registration in 35 reliance upon Rule 144A and other available exemptions under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The total net proceeds from the July 2003 issuances were $1,261.1 million after deducting the initial purchasers discount, unamortized bond discount (except for the 3% convertible senior notes) and other offering expenses. The net proceeds consisted of $395.6 million from the 5.625% senior notes, $444.0 million from the 6.875% senior notes and $421.5 million from the 3% convertible senior notes. On July 18, 2003, the Company used the net proceeds from these offerings and additional cash on hand to redeem its Series A convertible preferred stock at the redemption price of $51.00 per share or $1,298.1 million of cash, plus an amount equal to dividends accrued from July 1, 2003 through July 17, 2003, for which the Company used $2.4 million of cash. As discussed in "Analysis of Historical Cash Flows Repurchases of Capital Stock" below and Note 17 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company had repurchased an aggregate of 750,600 shares of its Series A convertible preferred stock during 2003 prior to the July 18, 2003 redemption. Covenants Each issue of the Companys outstanding senior notes and the Companys outstanding euro notes imposes limitations on the Companys operations and those of specified subsidiaries. The principal limitations restrict liens, sale and leaseback transactions and mergers, acquisitions and dispositions. The 2010 facility contains financial covenants relating to interest coverage, debt leverage and minimum liquidity and restrictions on the creation of liens, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, asset sales, and amendments to the asbestos settlement agreement discussed above. The ANZ facility contains financial covenants relating to debt leverage, interest coverage and tangible net worth and restrictions on the creation of liens, the incurrence of additional indebtedness and asset sales, in each case relating to the Australian and New Zealand subsidiaries of the Company that are borrowers under the facility. The Company was in compliance with these limitations at December 31, 2005. Analysis of Historical Cash Flows Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $358.2 million in 2005, $436.2 million in 2004 and $469.7 million in 2003. The reduction in cash provided from operating activities in 2005 was due to various factors: a reduction in cash generated from accounts payable balances. The cash generated in 2005 was $16.7 million compared with $48.5 million in 2004; cash used of $16.8 million in 2005 compared with cash used of $0.6 million in 2004 for employee termination and facility exit cost payments related to its 2004 restructuring program; an increase in cash used for income tax payments in 2005. The Company made cash payments of $152.2 million in 2005 compared with $141.9 million in 2004; and an increase in notes and accounts receivable due to higher net sales in 2005, partially offset by an increase in cash collections during 2005; partially offset by; a reduction in cash used for inventory due to higher inventory turnover in the 2005 period, partially offset by higher raw material costs; and a change in accrued interest of $11.3 million. Accrued interest increased $31.8 million in 2005 compared with an increase of $20.5 million in 2004. The increase in the 2005 period was primarily due to an increase of $31.4 million due to additional accrued interest related to the 36 Companys liability under the asbestos settlement agreement, which is compounded annually. The increase in 2004 was primarily due to an increase in accrued interest of $29.8 million related to the asbestos settlement agreement, partially offset by a reduction of $6.3 million in accrued interest related to the 8.75% senior notes, which were repurchased in 2003. The decrease in 2004 compared with 2003 was primarily due to lower net earnings after adjustments for non cash items, and the following changes: a change in accrued interest of $35 million. Accrued interest increased $20.5 million in 2004 compared with an increase of $55.5 million in 2003. The increase in 2004 was primarily due to an increase in accrued interest of $29.8 million related to the asbestos settlement agreement, partially offset by a reduction of $6.3 million in accrued interest related to the 8.75% senior notes, which were repurchased in 2003. The increase in 2003 was due to the 2003 period including the impact of the senior notes issued in July 2003, as discussed above, and an increase of $28.2 million related to the asbestos settlement. an increase in cash used for inventory in 2004 compared with 2003 due to increased petrochemical based raw material costs and quantity increases in the ordinary course of business; and an increase in cash payments related to the Companys defined benefit plans. The Company made cash payments of $15 million in 2004 compared with $9.1 million in 2003. partially offset by; an increase in the restructuring liability due to the charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004 related to the 2004 restructuring program; and an increase in cash generated from accounts payable balances. The cash generated in 2004 was $48.5 million compared with $9.2 million in 2003. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities amounted to $83.8 million in 2005, $91 million in 2004 and $190.6 million in 2003. In each year, investing activities consisted primarily of capital expenditures and purchases and sales of available for sale securities. The decrease in net cash used in 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily due to lower capital expenditures and lower levels of cash used for businesses acquired, partially offset by lower net proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities. See Note 4, "Short Term Investments Available for Sale Securities," of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is contained in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, which describes these available for sale securities. The decrease in net cash used in 2004 compared with 2003 was primarily due to net cash proceeds in 2004 of $13.1 million from the sale of available for sale securities compared with net cash used of $67.2 million from the net purchases of available for sale securities in 2004, and, to a lesser extent, lower levels of capital expenditures in the 2004 period. Cash used to complete acquisitions was $0.2 million in 2005, $6.4 million in 2004 and $2.5 million in 2003. In each year, cash used for acquisitions was net of cash acquired in those acquisitions and was immaterial. The Company did not assume any debt in acquisitions in 2005, 2004 or 2003. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $96.9 million in 2005, $102.7 million in 2004 and $124.3 million in 2003. Capital expenditures for the Companys food packaging segment amounted to $80.7 million, 37 $81.3 million and $95.5 million and for the protective packaging segment amounted to $16.2 million, $21.4 million and $28.8 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decrease in capital expenditures in 2005 and 2004 from the $124.3 million incurred in 2003 was primarily due to the completion of two new production facilities, one in the United States and one in Hungary, which the Company initiated in 2003 and completed in the early part of 2004. The improved productivity of existing assets allowed the Company to defer spending on incremental capacity in 2005 and 2004. The Company expects to continue to make capital expenditures as it deems appropriate to expand its business, to replace depreciating property, plant and equipment and to improve productivity. The Company currently anticipates that capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2006 will be in the range of $125 million to $150 million. This estimate includes costs related to new facilities in China that will supply both food packaging and protective packaging products to meet the growing needs of the Chinese market. The Company does not expect this range to change as it initiates projects related to its global manufacturing strategy, described below. This projection is also based upon the Companys capital expenditure budget for 2006, the status of approved but not yet completed capital projects, anticipated future projects and historic spending trends. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities amounted to $118.4 million in 2005, $300.3 million in 2004 and $108.9 million in 2003. The decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily due to the following: $232.3 million of cash used in 2004 for the debt repurchases and redemptions made in the fourth quarter of 2004, partially offset by; an increase in 2005 of $30.2 million in net cash used to repurchase shares of the Companys common stock, as discussed below. In 2005, the Company used $116.4 million to repurchase its common stock compared with $86.2 million in 2004; and a decrease of $20.3 million in proceeds from long term debt in 2005 compared with 2004. The increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2004 compared with 2003 was primarily due to the following: a decrease in proceeds from long term debt in 2004 due to the receipt of net cash proceeds of $1,557.2 million from the issuance of the 5.375% senior notes in April 2003 and the 5.625% senior notes, the 6.875% senior notes and the 3% convertible senior notes in July 2003, as discussed above; an increase of $49.5 million in cash used to repurchase the Companys capital stock. In 2004, the Company used $86.2 million to purchase its common stock, compared with $36.7 million used in 2003 to purchase its Series A convertible preferred stock; partially offset by; $1,298.1 million of cash used to redeem all of the outstanding shares of Series A convertible preferred stock on July 18, 2003, as discussed above; $41.9 million of cash used in 2003 to pay dividends on the Companys Series A convertible preferred stock, prior to its redemption in July 2003; 38 an increase of $37.9 million in net proceeds from short term borrowings, as the Company had net proceeds of $0.6 million in 2004 compared with net payments in 2003 of $37.3 million; and a decrease of $38.9 million for the payment of long term debt, as the Company used $237.8 million of cash in 2004 compared with $276.7 million in 2003; the amounts in both periods include the cash used to redeem and repurchase long term debt as discussed below. Repurchases of Capital Stock The Company repurchased 2,430,200 shares of its common stock at a cost of $116.4 million in 2005 and 1,781,000 shares of its common stock at a cost of $86.2 million in 2004. In 2003, prior to redeeming all outstanding shares, the Company repurchased 750,600 shares of its Series A convertible preferred stock at a cost of $36.7 million. The average price per share of the common stock repurchases in 2005 and 2004 was $47.88 and $48.38, respectively, and the average price per share for the preferred stock repurchases in 2003 was $48.94. As discussed in "Outstanding Indebtedness Senior Notes Issued in July 2003; Recapitalization" above, in July 2003 the Company issued $1,281.3 million of senior notes. The Company used an aggregate of $1,298.1 million from the proceeds of these offerings and additional cash on hand to redeem the outstanding shares of its Series A convertible preferred stock. The share repurchases described above were made under a program previously adopted by the Companys Board of Directors. The share repurchase program authorized the repurchase of up to approximately 16,977,000 shares of common stock, which included the Series A convertible preferred stock on an as converted basis prior to its redemption. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had repurchased approximately 14,327,000 shares of common stock and preferred stock on an as converted basis, and the remaining repurchase authorization covered approximately 2,650,000 shares of common stock. The Company may from time to time continue to repurchase its common stock. Debt Redemption and Repurchases 2004 Debt Redemption: On November 26, 2004, the Company used net cash of $211.8 million to redeem the entire outstanding aggregate principal amount, $177.5 million, of its 8.75% senior notes due July 1, 2008 and terminated interest rate swaps on the 8.75% senior notes having a total notional amount of $150 million. The Company issued the senior notes on June 26, 2001 under Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933. The Company determined the redemption price in accordance with the indenture governing the notes. The net cash used of $211.8 million consisted of cash used to purchase the senior notes at a premium plus accrued interest of $213.4 million and cash received of $1.6 million related to the termination of the interest rate swaps. The Company completed the redemption, funded with available cash, at a premium to the face amount of the notes, which resulted in a loss of $29.6 million, which the Company reflected in the statement of operations as "Loss on debt redemption and repurchases." The annual interest expense on the redeemed notes was approximately $15.5 million, without giving effect to any interest rate swaps and the amortization of amounts related to the senior notes. 2004 and 2003 Debt Repurchases: In November and December 2004, the Company used available cash of $25.2 million to repurchase in the open market $22.7 million face amount of its 6.95% senior notes due May 2009, which included accrued interest and related fees. Since the Company completed these repurchases at a premium to the face amount of the notes, it incurred a loss of $2.6 million, which the Company reflected in the statement of operations as "Loss on debt redemption and repurchases." 39 In December 2003, the Company used net cash of $208.2 million to repurchase in the open market $122.5 million face amount of its 8.75% senior notes and $50 million face amount of its 6.95% senior notes and terminated interest rate swaps on the 8.75% senior notes with a total notional amount of $100 million. The net cash used of $208.2 million consisted of cash used to purchase the senior notes at a premium plus accrued interest and related fees of $208.9 million and cash received of $0.7 million related to the termination of the interest rate swaps. The Company completed these repurchases at premiums to the face amounts of the notes, which resulted in a loss of $33.6 million, which the Company reflected in the statement of operations as "Loss on debt redemption and repurchases." The Company may from time to time continue to repurchase or otherwise retire its outstanding indebtedness. Changes in Working Capital At December 31, 2005, working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $161.9 million compared with $307.4 million at December 31, 2004. The $145.5 million decrease in the Companys working capital during 2005 arose primarily from the following changes: an increase of $237.6 million in the current portion of long term debt primarily due to the carrying value of the Companys 5.625% euro notes due July 2006 of $238.1 million now being classified as a current liability on the balance sheet as discussed above in "Outstanding Indebtedness"; an increase in accrued interest of $30.9 million primarily due to an additional $31.4 million of accrued interest during 2005 related to the Companys liability under the asbestos settlement agreement; and a decrease of $8.8 million in inventories primarily due to a decrease of $12.9 million from the effects of foreign currency translation, partially offset by quantity increases consistent with the growth of the business and an increase in intra company shipments primarily to support the growth of the business in the Asia Pacific region and Latin America; partially offset by; an increase of $87.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments due to cash flow generated from operations; an increase of $11.5 million in notes and accounts receivable. This increase was due to an increase in net sales in 2005 compared with 2004, partially offset by a decrease of $27.6 million from the effects of foreign currency translation; a decrease in accrued payroll of $10.2 million. This decrease was primarily due to reduced payroll related costs, including a reduction in management incentive compensation in 2005, and $6.1 million from the effects of foreign currency translation; a decrease of $12.7 million in current accrued restructuring costs due to the payment of employee termination and facility exit costs during 2005 related to the 2004 restructuring program; and a decrease of $10.9 million in income taxes payable primarily due to income tax payments during 2005, partially offset by higher income tax expense on 2005 earnings. 40 Current and Quick Ratios The ratio of current assets to current liabilities, known as the current ratio, was 1.1 at December 31, 2005 and 1.2 at December 31, 2004. The ratio of current assets less inventory to current liabilities, known as the quick ratio, was 0.8 at December 31, 2005 and 0.9 at December 31, 2004. Derivative Financial Instruments Interest Rate Swaps At December 31, 2005, the Company had outstanding interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $300 million that qualified and were designated as fair value hedges. The Company entered into these interest rate swaps to effectively convert its 5.375% senior notes due April 2008 into floating rate debt. At December 31, 2005, the Company recorded a mark to market adjustment to record a decrease of $12.5 million in the fair value of the 5.375% senior notes due April 2008 due to changes in interest rates and an offsetting increase to other liabilities to record the fair value of the related interest rate swaps. There was no ineffective portion of the hedges recognized in earnings during the period. In 2005, under the terms of the $300 million outstanding interest rate swap agreements, the Company received interest at a fixed rate and paid interest at variable rates that were based on six month London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR. As a result, interest expense increased by $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 due to increases in six month LIBOR. Foreign Currency Forward Contracts At December 31, 2005, the Company was party to foreign currency forward contracts, which did not have a significant impact on the Companys liquidity. For further discussion about these contracts and other financial instruments, see Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk." Shareholders Equity The Companys shareholders equity was $1,392.1 million at December 31, 2005, $1,333.5 million at December 31, 2004 and $1,123.6 million at December 31, 2003. Shareholders equity increased in 2005 primarily due to the following: net earnings of $255.8 million; partially offset by; repurchases of the Companys common stock, at a cost of $116.4 million; and an increase in foreign currency translation adjustment of $91.9 million. Shareholders equity increased in 2004 principally due to the following: net earnings of $215.6 million; a reduction of foreign currency translation adjustment of $69.2 million; and the net effect of transactions under the Companys contingent stock plan of $9.8 million; partially offset by; repurchases of the Companys common stock in 2004 at a cost of $86.2 million. 41 Global Manufacturing Strategy The Company will begin the first phase of a new global manufacturing strategy. This strategy will include an expansion of its global production capabilities in developing markets around the world, as well as a realignment of its existing production into manufacturing centers of excellence. The goal of this multi year program is to further improve the Companys operating efficiencies, lower the overall cost structure and implement new technologies more effectively. This program, combined with the supply chain initiative, is expected to produce meaningful savings for the Company in future years. By taking advantage of new technologies and streamlining production on a global scale, the Company will continue to enhance profitable growth and its global leadership position. Recently Issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, Accounting Guidance and Disclosure Requirements The Company is subject to numerous recently issued statements of financial accounting standards, accounting guidance and disclosure requirements. Note 20, "New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, Accounting Guidance and Disclosure Requirements," of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is contained in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, describes these new accounting pronouncements and is incorporated herein by reference. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, known as US GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, may differ from estimates, and while any differences may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements, the Company does not believe that the differences, taken as a whole, will be material. The Company believes the following accounting policies are critical to its business operations and the understanding of results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements: Notes and Accounts Receivable In the normal course of business, the Company extends credit to customers that satisfy pre defined credit criteria. Notes and accounts receivable, as shown on the consolidated balance sheets, are net of allowances for doubtful accounts. The Company maintains accounts receivable allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of the Companys customers deteriorates. Commitments and Contingencies Litigation On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against it. While it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions, the Company uses its best judgment to determine if it is probable that it will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, the Company makes estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries, if any. The Company accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be 42 reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery, it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that the Company has previously made. The Company expenses legal costs, including those legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred. Impairment of Long Lived Assets The Company periodically reviews long lived assets, other than goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Goodwill, in accordance with SFAS No. 142, is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. A review of goodwill may be initiated prior to conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. Assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses, such as future cash flows and disposition costs, may affect the carrying value of long lived assets and possible impairment expense in the Companys consolidated financial statements. Self Insurance The Company retains the obligation for specified claims and losses related to property, casualty, workers compensation and employee benefit claims. The Company accrues for outstanding reported claims, claims that have been incurred but not reported, and projected claims based upon managements estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims using historical experience, insurance company estimates and the estimated trends in claim values. Although management believes it has the ability to adequately project and record estimated claim payments, actual results could differ significantly from the recorded liabilities. Pensions The Company maintains a non contributory profit sharing plan and contributory thrift and retirement savings plan in which most U.S. employees of the Company are eligible to participate. For a limited number of its U.S. employees and for some of its non U.S. employees, the Company maintains defined benefit pension plans. The Company accounts for these pension plans in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions." Under these accounting standards, the Company makes assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and performance of plan assets. The principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure future obligations, the expected future rate of return on plan assets, the expected rate of future compensation increases and various other actuarial assumptions. In general, changes to these assumptions could have a significant impact on the costs and liabilities recorded under SFAS No. 87. Since only a limited number of employees are covered by these plans, such impact is not considered material to the Company. Income Taxes The Companys deferred tax assets arise from net deductible temporary differences and tax benefit carry forwards. The Company evaluates whether its taxable earnings during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carry forwards may be utilized should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits. For those jurisdictions where the expiration dates of tax benefit carry forwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely, the Company provides a valuation allowance. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company estimates future taxable earnings, with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax benefit carry forwards, to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods, the Company may need to adjust the valuation allowance, which could materially impact the Companys consolidated financial statements. In calculating its worldwide provision for income taxes, the Company also evaluates its tax positions for years where the statutes of limitations have not expired. Based on this review, the Company may establish reserves for additional taxes and interest that could be assessed upon examination by relevant tax authorities. The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, including the results of tax audits and changes in tax law. 43  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which may adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. The Company seeks to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company does not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rates From time to time, the Company may use interest rate swaps, collars or options to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. The Companys interest rate swaps are described in Note 11, "Derivatives and Hedging Activities," of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is contained in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Under the terms of the Companys outstanding interest rate swap agreements in each year, the Company received interest at a fixed rate and paid interest at variable rates that were based on six month London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR. As a result, under the terms of the outstanding interest rate swap agreements in each year, interest expense increased $1.6 million, decreased $6.2 million and decreased $4.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, due to changes in six month LIBOR. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had no collars or options outstanding. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the carrying value of the Companys total debt, which includes the impact of outstanding interest rate swaps, was $2,076.2 million and $2,111.6 million, respectively. The Companys fixed rate debt at December 31, 2005 and 2004, including the impact of interest rate swaps, was $1,767.7 million and $1,800.5 million, respectively. The fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt varies with changes in interest rates. Generally, the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The estimated fair value of the Companys total debt, including the impact of outstanding interest rate swaps, was $2,135.7 million at December 31, 2005 compared with $2,231.6 million at December 31, 2004. A hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates would result in an increase in the fair value of the total debt balance at December 31, 2005 of $73.4 million. These changes in the fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt do not alter the Companys obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount of such debt. Foreign Exchange Rates The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to fix the amount payable on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The terms of these instruments are generally twelve months or less. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of approximately $309.3 million and $342.3 million, respectively. The estimated fair values of these contracts, which represent the estimated net payments that would be paid or received by the Company in the event of termination of these contracts based on the then current foreign exchange rates, was a net receivable at December 31, 2005 of $0.6 million and zero at December 31, 2004. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates at December 31, 2005 would have caused the Company to pay approximately $20.8 million to terminate these contracts. The Company may use other derivative instruments from time to time, such as foreign exchange options to manage exposure due to foreign exchange rates and interest rate and currency swaps related to access to additional sources of international financing. These instruments can potentially limit 44 foreign exchange exposure and limit or adjust interest rate exposure by swapping borrowings denominated in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had no foreign exchange options or interest rate and currency swap agreements outstanding. The Companys outstanding debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing subsidiary. The amount of outstanding debt denominated in a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar was $262.9 million and $292.0 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company believes that this enables it to better match operating cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match the currency of assets and liabilities. Commodities The Company uses various commodity raw materials such as plastic resins and energy products such as electric power and natural gas in conjunction with its manufacturing processes. Generally, the Company acquires these components at market prices and does not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices. Moreover, the Companys supply chain team seeks to maintain appropriate levels of commodity raw material inventories thus minimizing the expense and risks of carrying excess inventories. The Company does not typically purchase substantial quantities in advance of production requirements. As a result, the Company is exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components. 45
