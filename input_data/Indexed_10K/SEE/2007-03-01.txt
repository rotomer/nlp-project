Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The information in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read together with the Companys consolidated financial statements and related notes set forth in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. All amounts and percentages are approximate due to rounding. Introduction The Company manufactures and sells a wide range of food and protective packaging products, operating in the United States and in 50 other countries, with products distributed in those countries and in other parts of the world. The Company operates in two reportable business segments, Food Packaging and Protective Packaging. The Companys principal food packaging products are flexible materials, associated packaging equipment systems, rigid containers and absorbent pads. These products, many of which bear the Cryovac trademark, package a broad range of perishable foods. The Company primarily sells the products in this segment to food processors, distributors, supermarket retailers and food service businesses. The Companys principal protective packaging products provide cushioning, surface protection and void fill. The Company primarily sells its protective packaging products and systems to distributors and manufacturers in a wide variety of industries. The products in this segment enable end users to provide a high degree of protection in packaging their items. They also aid product display and merchandising. The Companys global sales and marketing staff numbered approximately 2,500 employees in the countries in which it operates, who sell and market the Companys products through a large number of distributors, fabricators and converters, as well as directly to end users such as food processors, food service businesses, and manufacturers. The Company has no material long term contracts for the distribution of its products. In 2006, no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10% or more of the Companys consolidated net sales. Although net sales of both food packaging products and protective packaging products have tended to be slightly higher in the fourth quarter, the Company does not consider seasonality to be material to its consolidated business or to either reportable business segment. Competition for most of the Companys packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics, service and price. Competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology and, as a result, the Company maintains ongoing research and development programs to enable it to maintain technological leadership. The Companys net sales are sensitive to developments in its customers business or market conditions, changes in the global economy, and the effects of foreign currency translation. Its costs can vary with changes in petrochemical related costs, which are not within the Companys control. Consequently, the Companys management focuses on reducing those costs that the Company can control and using petrochemical based raw materials as efficiently as possible. The Company also believes that its global presence helps to insulate it from localized changes in business conditions that may more strongly affect some of its competitors. As is discussed below, the Companys businesses are managed to generate substantial cash flow. The Company believes that its strong cash flow will permit it to continue to spend on innovative research and development and to invest in its business by means of acquisitions and capital expenditures for property and equipment. Moreover, its ability to generate substantial cash flow should provide the Company with the flexibility to modify its capital structure as the need or opportunity arises. This cash flow, along with accumulated cash and funds available under its credit facilities, should enable the Company to make the 22 settlement payment, including interest, that is expected to be required of the Company upon consummation of a plan of reorganization in the W. R. Grace & Co. bankruptcy, as discussed below. In addition to investing in its business, the Company uses its cash flow to reduce debt and to return value to its shareholders. On January 30, 2006, the Company announced that it was initiating payment of a quarterly cash dividend. The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per common share that was payable on March 17, June 16, September 15, and December 15, 2006. On February 16, 2007, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had declared a two for one stock split to be effected in the form of a stock dividend payable on March 16, 2007 to stockholders of record of outstanding shares of its common stock at the close of business on March 2, 2007. The Companys Board of Directors also increased the Companys quarterly cash dividend by 33% to $0.20 per common share, declaring a quarterly cash dividend payable on the pre split shares of the Companys common stock on March 16, 2007 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 2, 2007. In addition, on July 19, 2006, the Companys 5.625% euro notes with a face value of 200.0 million matured. The Company used available cash of $251.7 million to retire this debt. Highlights for the Companys year 2006 compared with 2005 and 2004 were: 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 % Change 2005 vs. 2004 % Change (dollars in millions) U.S. $ 2,066.3 $ 1,972.9 $ 1,851.8 5 % 7 % % of total net sales 48 % 48 % 49 % International 2,261.6 2,112.2 1,946.3 7 % 9 % % of total net sales 52 % 52 % 51 % Total net sales $ 4,327.9 $ 4,085.1 $ 3,798.1 6 % 8 % Gross profit $ 1,240.1 $ 1,158.0 $ 1,162.1 7 % % of total net sales 28.7 % 28.3 % 30.6 % Marketing, administrative and development expenses $ 701.1 $ 645.9 $ 626.1 9 % 3 % % of total net sales 16.2 % 15.8 % 16.5 % Restructuring and other charges $ 12.9 $ 1.7 $ 33.0 N M N M Operating profit $ 526.1 $ 510.4 $ 503.0 3 % 1 % % of total net sales 12.2 % 12.5 % 13.2 % Net Sales The principal factors contributing to changes in net sales in the three years ended December 31, 2006 were changes in unit volume, changes in product mix and increases in average selling prices. In addition, the 2006 period had increased volumes from acquired businesses. The 2005 period was impacted by the effects of foreign currency translation while the impact in 2006 was minimal. 23 Net sales in 2006 increased 6% to $4,327.9 million compared with $4,085.1 million in 2005. The components of the increase in net sales for 2006 were as follows (dollars in millions): Components of Increase in Net Sales (2006 vs. 2005): Food Packaging Segment Protective Packaging Segment Total Company Volume Units 2.5 % $ 63.2 0.8 % $ 13.1 1.9 % $ 76.3 Volume Acquired Businesses, net of dispositions 2.6 66.7 0.6 1.6 67.3 Price/Mix 1.5 38.5 3.9 59.3 2.4 97.8 Foreign Currency Translation 0.1 2.4 (0.1 ) (1.0 ) 1.4 Total 6.7 % $ 170.8 4.6 % $ 72.0 5.9 % $ 242.8 In 2006, foreign currency translation had a negligible impact on net sales. During the first six months of 2006, net sales had an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation primarily from the weakness of foreign currencies in Europe which were offset in the second half of 2006 by their strengthening against the U.S. dollar. In addition, the Brazilian real and the Canadian dollar strengthened all year against the U.S. dollar offset by the weakness of foreign currencies in Asia Pacific. Net sales for 2005 increased 8% to $4,085.1 million compared with $3,798.1 million in 2004. The components of the increase in net sales for 2005 were as follows (dollars in millions): Components of Increase in Net Sales (2005 vs. 2004): Food Packaging Segment Protective Packaging Segment Total Company Volume Units 2.8 % $ 64.8 2.7 % $ 39.7 2.8 % $ 104.5 Volume Acquired Businesses, net of dispositions (0.2 ) (4.6 ) 0.7 9.6 0.1 5.0 Price/Mix 3.5 82.7 2.6 37.5 3.2 120.2 Foreign Currency Translation 1.8 42.3 1.0 15.0 1.5 57.3 Total 7.9 % $185.2 7.0 % $101.8 7.6 % $287.0 Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on net sales of $57.3 million in 2005. Excluding the positive effect of foreign currency translation, net sales would have increased 6% compared with 2004. The favorable foreign currency translation impact on net sales for the full year of 2005 was primarily due to the strengthening of foreign currencies in the Asia Pacific region, Brazil and Europe against the U.S. dollar. The full year favorable impact of $57.3 million includes an unfavorable fourth quarter impact of $10.9 million, primarily due to the weakness of foreign currencies in Europe against the U.S. dollar. Net sales of the Companys food packaging segment, which consists primarily of the Companys Cryovac food packaging products, constituted 62% of net sales in 2006, 2005 and 2004. The Companys protective packaging segment contributed the balance of net sales. This segment aggregates the Companys protective packaging products and shrink packaging products, all of which are used principally for non food packaging applications. Food Packaging Segment Sales Net sales of food packaging products increased 7% in 2006 to $2,702.9 million compared with $2,532.1 million in 2005 and increased 8% in 2005 compared with $2,346.9 million in 2004. Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on this segment of $2.4 million in 2006 and when this impact is excluded, it would not have changed the net sales increase over the prior year. When compared with 2004, excluding the positive foreign currency translation effect of $42.3 million, net sales for this segment in 2005 would have increased 6% compared with 2004. 24 During 2006, strong unit volume growth, primarily in Latin America, the positive impact of the Companys 2006 acquisitions and selling price increases in North America added to sales growth during the year. In 2005 unit volumes increased in all regions of the world, with the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions having the primary impact. The segment also benefited in 2005 from price/mix due in part to selling price increases. Flexible Packaging Materials and Related Systems Among the classes of products in the food packaging segment, net sales of flexible packaging materials and related systems increased 6% to $2,247.6 million in 2006 compared with $2,122.8 million in 2005 and increased 7% in 2005 compared with 2004 net sales of $1,976.5 million. Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of $3.0 million in 2006 for flexible packaging materials and related systems. Excluding the positive foreign currency translation effect, the increase in net sales for flexible packaging materials and related systems would have remained the same at 6% compared with 2005. Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of $37.3 million in 2005 for flexible packaging materials and related systems. Excluding the positive foreign currency translation effect, net sales for flexible packaging materials and related systems would have increased 6% compared with 2004. The components of the increase in net sales for 2006 and 2005 were as follows (dollars in millions): Components of Increase in Net Sales: Flexible Packaging Materials and Related Systems 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 Volume Units 1.8 % $ 38.1 3.0 % $ 59.4 Volume Acquired Businesses 3.2 67.6 Price/Mix 0.8 16.1 2.5 49.6 Foreign Currency Translation 0.1 3.0 1.9 37.3 Total 5.9 % $ 124.8 7.4 % $ 146.3 Rigid Packaging and Absorbent Pads Net sales of rigid packaging and absorbent pads, the other class of products in the food packaging segment, increased 11% to $455.3 million compared with $409.3 million in 2005 and increased 11% in 2005 compared with 2004 net sales of $370.4 million. Foreign currency translation had a minimal unfavorable impact of $0.6 million in 2006 for rigid packaging and absorbent pads. Excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation, the increase in net sales in 2006 would have remained the same at 11% compared with 2005. Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of $5.1 million in 2005 for rigid packaging and absorbent pads. Excluding the positive effect of foreign currency translation, net sales of rigid packaging and absorbent pads would have increased 9% compared with 2004. The components of the increase in net sales for 2006 and 2005 were as follows (dollars in millions): Components of Increase in Net Sales: Rigid Packaging and Absorbent Pads 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 Volume Units 6.1 % $ 25.1 1.5 % $ 5.4 Volume Acquired Businesses, net of dispositions (0.2 ) (0.9 ) (1.3 ) (4.7 ) Price/Mix 5.4 22.4 8.9 33.1 Foreign Currency Translation (0.1 ) (0.6 ) 1.4 5.1 Total 11.2 % $ 46.0 10.5 % $ 38.9 25 The Company sells foam and solid plastic trays and containers that customers use to package a wide variety of food products. The Company manufactures such products in its own facilities in various regions or has them fabricated by other manufacturers. The Companys net sales of such products fabricated by other manufacturers were $157.3 million, $119.4 million and $83.5 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Protective Packaging Segment Sales Net sales of protective packaging products increased 5% to $1,625.0 million in 2006 compared with $1,553.0 million in 2005 and increased 7% in 2005 compared with 2004 sales of $1,451.2 million. During 2006, the positive impact of selling price increases in North America helped drive sales growth. In 2005, sales growth in this segment was balanced between unit volume growth of $39.7 million, primarily in North America, and a positive price/mix impact of $37.5 million, primarily in North America and to a lesser extent in Europe, in part due to selling price increases. Foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact of $1.0 million in 2006 for this segment,which would not have changed the net sales growth compared with 2005. In 2005, foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of $15 million for this segment. Excluding the positive foreign currency translation effect, net sales in 2005 for the protective packaging segment would have increased 6% compared with 2004. The classes of products within the protective packaging segment are cushioning and surface protection products and other products. Other products within the protective packaging segment represented approximately 1% of consolidated net sales in 2006, 2005 and 2004. Sales by Geographic Region Net sales from operations in the United States represented 48% of net sales in 2006 and 2005. Net sales from U.S. operations increased 5% in 2006 to $2,066.3 million compared with $1,972.9 million in 2005. Net sales from international operations increased 7% in 2006 to $2,261.6 million compared with $2,112.2 million in 2005. Excluding the $1.4 million positive foreign currency translation effect, the increase in international net sales would have remained the same at 7% compared with 2005. The components of the increase in net sales by geographic region for 2006 were as follows (dollars in millions): Components of Increase in Net Sales (2006 vs. 2005): U.S. International Total Company Volume Units 0.3 % $ 5.6 3.3 % $ 70.7 1.9 % $ 76.3 Volume Acquired Businesses, net of dispositions 0.6 3.2 66.7 1.6 67.3 Price/Mix 4.4 87.2 0.5 10.6 2.4 97.8 Foreign Currency Translation 0.1 1.4 1.4 Total 4.7 % $ 93.4 7.1 % $ 149.4 5.9 % $ 242.8 26 Net sales from operations in the United States represented 48% and 49% of net sales in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Net sales from U.S. operations increased 7% in 2005 to $1,972.9 million compared with $1,851.8 million in 2004. Net sales from international operations increased 9% in 2005 to $2,112.2 million compared with $1,946.3 million in 2004. Excluding the $57.3 million positive foreign currency translation effect, international net sales would have increased 6% compared with 2004. The components of the increase in net sales by geographic region for 2005 were as follows (dollars in millions): Components of Increase in Net Sales (2005 vs. 2004): U.S. International Total Company Volume Units 2.2 % $ 40.0 3.3 % $ 64.5 2.8 % $ 104.5 Volume Acquired Businesses, net of dispositions 0.1 1.4 0.2 3.6 0.1 5.0 Price/Mix 4.2 79.7 2.1 40.5 3.2 120.2 Foreign Currency Translation 2.9 57.3 1.5 57.3 Total 6.5 % $ 121.1 8.5 % $ 165.9 7.6 % $ 287.0 Costs and Margins Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 28.7% in 2006, 28.3% in 2005 and 30.6% in 2004. The increase in gross profit in 2006 was due to the positive impact of selling price increases combined with improved operating efficiencies that helped offset higher average petrochemical based raw material and other energy related costs compared with the prior year. During the first three quarters of 2006, petrochemical based raw material and other energy related costs were higher than in the corresponding 2005 quarter. During the fourth quarter of 2006, certain petrochemical based commodity raw material prices moderated but most speciality resin costs were at or above 2005 levels. The principal cause for the reduction in 2005 compared with 2004 was significantly higher petrochemical based raw material and other energy related costs. Over this time frame, the prices of crude oil and natural gas, which serve as feedstocks utilized in the production of many of the resins the Company buys, increased significantly. Although changes in prices of crude oil and natural gas are not perfect benchmarks, they are indicative of the variations in raw material and energy related costs faced by the Company. In addition, the decrease in gross profit was also caused in part by an unfavorable shift in product mix, which was partially offset by increases in selling prices. Marketing, administrative and development expenses increased 9% in 2006 and 3% in 2005. The increase in 2006 was due to higher year on year management incentive compensation of approximately $11.0 million as the Company met most of its performance objectives in 2006, incremental spending related to the upgrade of the Companys information technology platform of approximately $10.0 million, operating expenses of businesses acquired during the year including Nelipak Holdings B.V. in January 2006 and Biosphere Industries, LLC in October 2006 of approximately $12.0 million in the aggregate and expenses to support the higher volume in net sales. The increase in 2005 was due to the impact of foreign currency translation, higher professional fees, and, to a lesser extent, expenses for research and development related projects, partially offset by a reduction in management incentive compensation as the Company did not meet certain performance objectives for 2005 and partial year savings from restructuring activities initiated in the fourth quarter of 2004, as discussed below. Marketing, administrative and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were 16.2% in 2006, 15.8% in 2005 and 16.5% in 2004. 27 Global Manufacturing Strategy and Restructuring Charges Global Manufacturing Strategy The Companys global manufacturing strategy, when implemented, will expand production in countries where demand for the Companys products and services has been growing significantly. At the same time, the Company intends to realign certain manufacturing capacity in North America and Europe into centers of excellence. The goals of this multi year program are to expand capacity in growing markets, further improve the Companys operating efficiencies, and implement new technologies more effectively. The Company expects this program, combined with the Companys supply chain initiative, to produce meaningful savings in future years. By taking advantage of new technologies and streamlining production on a global scale, the Company expects to continue to enhance its profitable growth and its global leadership position. In July 2006, the Company announced the first phase of this multi year global manufacturing strategy. The financial scope of this phase is expected to be as follows: Expected Range Incurred through December 31, 2006 Capital Expenditures $ 130.0150.0 $ 14.2 Associated Costs $ 90.0100.0 $ 15.6 The associated costs include such items as equipment relocation, facility start up and severance. The Company expects the capital expenditures and charges for associated costs to occur between 2007 and 2008, although the actual timing of these expenditures is subject to change due to a variety of factors. The Companys estimated savings resulting from implementing this strategy are expected to range from $55 to $65 million annually starting in 2009. A portion of these savings will be realized starting in 2007. During 2006, all charges for the associated costs related to the food packaging segment and consisted of the following: Employee termination costs $ 11.6 FAS 88 curtailment and settlements 0.2 Equipment relocations and facility start up 3.8 Total $ 15.6 The components of the associated costs appear in the 2006 consolidated statement of operations on the following line items: Restructuring charges $ 11.8 Cost of sales 3.8 Total $ 15.6 The Company has accrued $11.6 million in severance costs in connection with this strategy. These costs will be future cash expenditures that will be incurred for one time termination benefits. At the time the severance was accrued, the Company expected to eliminate 242 full time positions. Since that time, the Company revised the number of positions to be eliminated to 245. During 2006, 36 positions were eliminated and the remaining positions are expected to be eliminated in 2007. The Company expects these benefits will be paid out before the end of 2009. The Company expects to add approximately 120 full time employees at other facilities as production is transferred, so the net reduction in positions is expected to be 125. The Company reflected the $11.6 million of severance costs in its consolidated statement of operations for 2006 in restructuring charges. 28 The components of the restructuring charges, spending and other activity through December 31, 2006 and the remaining accrual balance at December 31, 2006 were as follows: Employee Termination Costs Original provision in 2006 $ 11.6 Cash payments during 2006 (0.4 ) Effect of changes in currency rates (0.3 ) Restructuring accrual at December 31, 2006 $ 10.9 The Company expects to pay $5.7 million of the remaining accrual balance at December 31, 2006 in 2007. This amount is reflected in other current liabilities on the Companys consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2006. The remaining accrual of $5.2 million is expected to be paid in 2008 and 2009 and is reflected in other liabilities on the Companys consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2006. Other 2006 Restructuring Activities During 2006, the Company accrued severance costs of $0.6 million related to the Companys consolidation of its food packaging customer service activities in Canada. Such amount was reflected in the consolidated statement of operations on the restructuring charges line. The Company expects to eliminate 9 full time positions. No cash payments were made during 2006 related to this accrual. The accrual balance at December 31, 2006 was $0.6 million which was reflected in other current liabilities on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. 2004 Restructuring Program During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company announced a series of separate profit improvement plans in various geographic regions in order to complement the Companys long term growth programs and financial goals, improve the Companys operating efficiencies and lower its overall cost structure. The plans principally reduced the number of employees and consolidated or relocated operations in both of the Companys reportable business segments. At December 31, 2004, the Company expected to eliminate 473 full time positions, which was increased to 475 during 2005. As an element of the program, the Company expected to add approximately 100 positions in connection with the Companys realignment or relocation of some of its manufacturing activities, so that the net reduction in positions was approximately 375. These actions affected principally production workers and members of the Companys sales force, primarily in Europe. The Company has completed its reduction in headcount related to its 2004 restructuring program. The charges for the year ended December 31, 2004 consisted of the following: Year Ended December 31, 2004 Food Packaging Protective Packaging Total Cost Employee termination costs $ 17.5 $ 4.1 $ 21.6 Long lived asset impairments 10.2 0.1 10.3 Facility exit costs 1.1 1.1 FAS 88 curtailment and settlements 0.3 0.3 Total $ 29.1 $ 4.2 $ 33.3 The long lived asset impairment of $10.3 million consisted of write downs and write offs of property and equipment. The impairments related to decisions to rationalize and realign production of some of the Companys smaller product lines and to close several smaller European manufacturing facilities. Since the undiscounted cash flows associated with these asset groups, including estimated salvage value, were less 29 than the carrying values of these asset groups, they were written down to their estimated fair value. The Company disposed of these facilities and much of the equipment during the first six months of 2006. The components of the restructuring charges, spending and other activity through December 31, 2006 and the remaining accrual balance at December 31, 2006 were as follows: Employee Termination Costs Facility Exit Costs Total Cost Original provision in 2004 $ 21.6 $ 1.1 $ 22.7 Cash payments during 2004 (0.6 ) (0.6 ) Effect of changes in currency rates 0.2 0.2 Restructuring accrual at December 31, 2004 21.2 1.1 22.3 Cash payments during 2005 (16.5 ) (0.3 ) (16.8 ) Adjustment to restructuring liability, net 0.4 0.4 Effect of changes in currency rates (0.4 ) (0.1 ) (0.5 ) Restructuring accrual at December 31, 2005 4.7 0.7 5.4 Cash payments during 2006 (3.8 ) (0.3 ) (4.1 ) Adjustment to restructuring liability, net (0.1 ) (0.1 ) Effect of changes in currency rates 0.2 0.2 Restructuring accrual at December 31, 2006 $ 1.0 $ 0.4 $ 1.4 The Company expects to pay $1.3 million of the remaining $1.4 million accrual balance in 2007 and $0.1 million in 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company recorded in its consolidated statement of operations an additional restructuring charge of $0.6 million which was related to the 2004 program. This amount includes additional costs related to the relocation of employees and assets from closed facilities which were completed in 2006. The Company also recorded in its consolidated statement of operations a net credit of $0.1 million related to employee termination costs that were accrued as part of the 2004 restructuring program. The modifications to the originally recorded amounts resulted from increases in the amounts due to terminated employees of $0.1 million and reductions based upon certain employees no longer being eligible for the termination benefits of $0.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded $1.7 million of additional charges related to the 2004 restructuring program. This amount includes $1.3 million of costs incurred in 2005 related to the relocation of assets and employees from facilities that were closed as part of the restructuring program. The Company also recorded a net charge of $0.4 million related to the employee termination costs that were accrued as part of the 2004 restructuring program. The modifications to the originally recorded amounts resulted from increases in the amounts due to terminated employees of $0.9 million and reductions based upon certain employees no longer being eligible for the termination benefits of $0.5 million. The Company estimates that the cost savings realized in 2006 were $25.0 to $30.0 million. Operating Profit Operating profit increased 3% in 2006 and 1% in 2005. The increase in 2006 was due to an increase in net sales partially offset by higher petrochemical based raw material and other energy related costs, an increase of $55.2 million in marketing, administrative and development expenses and an increase of $11.2 million in restructuring charges in 2006. The increase in 2005 was due to an increase in net sales and a decrease of $31.3 million in restructuring and other charges, partially offset by higher petrochemical based raw material and other energy related costs and an increase of $19.8 million in marketing, administrative and development expenses. As a percentage of net sales, operating profit was 12.2% in 2006, 12.5% in 2005 and 13.2% in 2004. 30 Operating profit by business segment for 2006, 2005 and 2004 was as follows (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Food Packaging Segment $ 311.0 $ 324.1 $ 319.3 Protective Packaging Segment 228.7 189.0 217.6 Total segments 539.7 513.1 536.9 Restructuring and other charges (12.9 ) (1.7 ) (33.0 ) Unallocated corporate operating expenses (0.7 ) (1.0 ) (0.9 ) Total $ 526.1 $ 510.4 $ 503.0 The food packaging segment contributed 58%, 63% and 59% of the Companys operating profit in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, before taking into consideration restructuring and other (charges) credits and unallocated corporate operating expenses. The Companys protective packaging segment contributed the balance of operating profit. Food Packaging Operating Profit Food packaging operating profit was 11.5%, 12.8% and 13.6% of food packaging net sales in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decline in operating profit as a percentage of net sales in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily due to higher raw material costs, particularly specialty resins, higher energy related costs, the higher marketing, administrative and development expenses referenced above and expenses related to the implementation of the Companys global manufacturing strategy also referenced above, offset by the improved contribution from increased net sales. The decline in operating profit as a percentage of net sales in 2005 compared with 2004 was due to higher raw material and energy related costs combined with an unfavorable shift in product mix, partially offset by selling price increases. Protective Packaging Operating Profit Protective packaging operating profit was 14.1%, 12.2% and 15.0% of protective packaging net sales in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in operating profit as a percentage of net sales in 2006 compared with 2005 was due to selling price increases, primarily in North America and to a lesser extent in Europe, and improved performance in North America and Europe based on management actions taken to improve profitability, which helped offset higher raw material and energy related costs. The decline in operating profit as a percentage of net sales in 2005 compared with 2004 was due to higher raw material and energy related costs combined with an unfavorable shift in product mix, partially offset by selling price increases. Interest Expense Interest expense includes the effects of interest rate swaps and the amortization of capitalized senior debt issuance costs, bond discounts and terminated treasury locks. These expenses were $148.0 million in 2006, $149.7 million in 2005, and $153.7 million in 2004. The decrease in interest expense in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily due to the following: a $7.5 million decrease due to the retirement of the Companys 5.625% euro notes in July 2006 discussed below; and a decrease of $1.8 million related to higher capitalized interest during the construction of capital investment projects in 2006 compared with the 2005 period; 31 partially offset by; $5.0 million due to the impact of higher interest rates on the Companys $300.0 million of outstanding interest rate swaps entered into to effectively convert its 5.375% senior notes due April 2008 into floating rate debt; and an increase of $1.7 million caused by additional expense related to the compounding of interest on the amount payable pursuant to the asbestos settlement agreement. The decrease in interest expense in 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily due to the following: a $12.5 million decrease due to the redemption of the entire outstanding principal amount, $177.5 million, of the Companys 8.75% senior notes due July 2008, the repurchase of $22.7 million face amount of its 6.95% senior notes due May 2009, and the termination of related interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $150 million, all in the fourth quarter of 2004; partially offset by; an increase of $4.7 million due to the impact of higher interest rates on the Companys $300.0 million of outstanding interest rate swaps entered into to effectively convert its 5.375% senior notes due April 2008 into floating rate debt; an increase of $1.6 million caused by additional expense related to the compounding of interest on the amount payable pursuant to the asbestos settlement agreement; and an increase of $1.4 million related to lower capitalized interest during the construction of capital investment projects in 2005 compared with the 2004 period. Other Income, Net Other income, net, was $22.0 million in 2006, $15.9 million in 2005, and $5.8 million in 2004. Included in these amounts are primarily interest and dividend income of $16.8 million, $11.1 million and $7.7 million and net foreign exchange transaction losses of $4.1 million, $4.7 million and $9.0 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Loss On Debt Redemption and Repurchases In 2004 the Company incurred losses of $32.2 million due to debt redemptions and repurchases. These losses were reflected in the statement of operations in Loss on debt redemption and repurchases. See below under the caption Analysis of Historical Cash Flows Debt Redemption and Repurchases for further discussion of these transactions. Income Taxes The Companys effective income tax rate was 31.5% in 2006, 32.1% in 2005 and 33.3% in 2004. The decrease in the 2006 effective income tax rate compared with 2005 was primarily due to a shift in the mix of foreign earnings. The Company currently expects an effective income tax rate of approximately 31.5% for 2007. The decrease in the 2005 effective income tax rate compared with 2004 was primarily due to the reversal of reserves for tax matters for periods that closed in the relevant jurisdictions. In 2006 and 2005 the effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35.0% primarily due to the lower net effective income tax rate on foreign earnings, partially offset by the effect of state income taxes. 32 Net Earnings As a result of the factors noted above, net earnings were $274.1 million in 2006, $255.8 million in 2005 and $215.6 million in 2004. Earnings per Common Share Basic earnings per common share were $3.38 for 2006, $3.09 for 2005 and $2.56 for 2004. Diluted earnings per common share were $2.93 for 2006, $2.69 for 2005 and $2.25 for 2004. In calculating diluted earnings per common share, the Companys calculation of the weighted average number of common shares for 2006, 2005 and 2004 provides for the conversion of the Companys 3% convertible senior notes due June 2033, the assumed issuance of nine million shares of common stock reserved for the Companys previously announced asbestos settlement and the exercise of dilutive stock options, net of assumed treasury stock repurchases. See Note 18, Earnings Per Common Share, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is contained in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and is incorporated herein by reference. Liquidity and Capital Resources The discussion that follows contains: a description of the Companys material commitments and contingencies, a description of the Companys principal sources of liquidity, a description of the Companys outstanding indebtedness, an analysis of the Companys historical cash flows, a description of the Companys derivative financial instruments, and a description of the Companys shareholders equity. Material Commitments and Contingencies Asbestos Settlement; Commitments Related to the Cryovac Transaction The Company recorded a charge of $850.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, of which $512.5 million covers a cash payment that the Company is required to make upon the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy of W. R. Grace & Co. The Company did not use cash in any period with respect to this liability, and the Company cannot predict when it will be required to make this payment. The Company currently expects to fund this payment by using a combination of accumulated cash and future cash flows from operations and funds available under its $500 million senior unsecured multi currency credit facility or its accounts receivable securitization program, both described below, or a combination of these alternatives. The cash payment of $512.5 million accrues interest at a 5.5% annual rate, which is compounded annually, from December 21, 2002 to the date of payment. The Company has recorded this accrued interest in other current liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets, and these amounts were $123.5 million and $90.3 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company is subject to other contingencies related to the Cryovac transaction. Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is contained in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, describes these contingencies under Contingencies Related to the Cryovac Transaction and is incorporated herein by reference. 33 Compliance Matters The information set forth in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption Compliance Matters is incorporated herein by reference. Contractual Commitments The following table summarizes the Companys principal contractual obligations and sets forth the amounts of required cash outlays in 2007 and future years (amounts in millions): Payments Due by Period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Short term borrowings $ 20.2 $ 20.2 $ $ $ Current portion of long term debt exclusive of debt discounts 5.5 5.5 Long term debt, exclusive of debt discounts and interest rate swap adjustments 1,839.0 547.1 441.3 850.6 Total debt(1)(2) 1,864.7 25.7 547.1 441.3 850.6 Operating leases 103.6 25.6 31.3 19.4 27.3 Cash portion of the asbestos settlement, including accrued interest as of December 31, 2006(3) 636.0 636.0 Declared 2007 first quarter quarterly cash dividend 16.1 16.1 Other principal contractual obligations 168.5 79.4 65.3 18.3 5.5 Total contractual cash obligations $2,788.9 $ 782.8 $ 643.7 $ 479.0 $ 883.4 (1) Includes principal maturities (at face value) only. (2) The 2010 period includes the 3% convertible senior notes since the holders of these notes have the option to require the Company to repurchase the senior notes on June 30 of 2010, 2013, 2018, 2023 and 2028. See Note 10, Debt and Credit Facilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) This liability is reflected as a current liability due to the uncertainty of the timing of payment. Interest accrues on this amount at a rate of 5.5% per annum, compounded annually, until it becomes due and payable. Current Portion of Long Term Debt and Long Term Debt The debt shown in the above table excludes unamortized bond discounts and interest rate swap adjustments as of December 31, 2006 and therefore represents the principal amount of the debt required to be repaid in each period. Operating Leases In addition to the obligation to pay the principal amount of the debt obligations discussed above, the Company is obligated under the terms of various operating leases covering some of the facilities that it occupies and some production equipment, most of which are accounted for as operating leases. The contractual operating lease obligations listed in the table above represent estimated future minimum annual rental commitments under non cancelable real and personal property leases as of December 31, 2006. Asbestos Settlement The asbestos settlement is described more fully in Asbestos Settlement; Commitments Related to the Cryovac Transaction, above. Cash Dividend On February 16, 2007, the Companys Board of Directors increased the Companys quarterly cash dividend by 33% to $0.20 per common share, declaring a quarterly cash dividend payable on the pre split shares of the Companys common stock on March 16, 2007 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 2, 2007. The estimate of this liability is $16.1 million and was calculated using 80,672,810 shares of common stock that were issued and outstanding as of January 31, 2006. 34 Other Principal Contractual Obligations Other principal contractual obligations include agreements to purchase an estimated amount of goods, including raw materials, or services in the normal course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the purchase. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has reviewed its off balance sheet arrangements and has determined that none of those arrangements have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. For a discussion of one such arrangement that may have a future effect that is material to investors, see Accounts Receivable Securitization Program, below. Interest Payments During 2006 and 2005, the Company paid $121.9 million and $117.0 million, respectively, in interest payments. The Company currently expects to pay from $105.0 million to $115.0 million in interest payments in 2007, including the impact of interest rate swap transactions. The actual interest paid in 2007 may be different from this amount if interest rates change or if the Company repurchases existing indebtedness or incurs indebtedness under its existing lines of credit or otherwise. This 2007 expected interest payment does not reflect payment of any accrued interest related to the asbestos settlement. Income Tax Payments During 2006 and 2005, the Company paid $152.6 million and $152.2 million, respectively, in income taxes. The Company currently expects to pay between $187.0 million and $197.0 million in income taxes in 2007, assuming it does not make the asbestos settlement payment in that year. Contributions to Defined Benefit Pension Plans The Company maintains defined benefit pension plans for a limited number of its U.S. employees and for some of its non U.S. employees. During 2006 and 2005, the Company paid $7.8 million and $8.6 million, respectively, in employer contributions to these defined benefit pension plans. The Company currently expects employer contributions to be $6.8 million in 2007. Environmental Matters The Company is subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations, and it accrues for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. These accruals do not take into account any discounting for the time value of money and are not reduced by potential insurance recoveries, if any. The Company does not believe that it is reasonably possible that its liability in excess of the amounts that it has accrued for environmental matters will be material to its consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets or cash flows. The Company reassesses environmental liabilities whenever circumstances become better defined or it can better estimate remediation efforts and their costs. The Company evaluates these liabilities periodically based on available information, including the progress of remedial investigations at each site, the current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible parties. As some of these issues are decided (the outcomes of which are subject to uncertainties) or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated, the Company adjusts the recorded accruals, as necessary. The Company believes that these exposures are not material to its consolidated results of operations, balance sheets and cash flows. The Company believes that it has adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures. 35 Principal Sources of Liquidity The Companys principal sources of liquidity are accumulated cash and short term investments, cash flows from operations and amounts available under its existing lines of credit described below, including the credit facility, the ANZ facility and its accounts receivable securitization program. Accumulated Cash and Cash Equivalents and Short Term Investments As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had accumulated cash and cash equivalents of $373.1 million and $455.8 million, respectively, and short term investments of $33.9 million and $44.1 million, respectively. The Companys short term investments consist of auction rate securities, all of which are classified as available for sale securities. See Note 4, Short Term Investments Available for Sale Securities, to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements, which describes these short term investments. Cash Flows from Operations The Company expects that it will continue to generate significant cash flows from operations. See Analysis of Historical Cash Flows below. Lines of Credit The following table summarizes the Companys available lines of credit and committed and uncommitted lines of credit, including the credit facity and the ANZ facility discussed below, at December 31, 2006 and 2005: December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 Used lines of credit $ 30.4 $ 27.2 Unused lines of credit 810.6 797.6 Total available lines of credit $ 841.0 $ 824.8 Available lines of credit committed $ 632.9 $ 624.7 Available lines of credit uncommitted 208.1 200.1 Total available lines of credit $ 841.0 $ 824.8 The Companys principal credit lines were all committed and consisted of the credit facility and the ANZ facility. The Company is not subject to any material compensating balance requirements in connection with its lines of credit. Revolving Credit Facilities The Credit Facility The Company has not borrowed under its $500.0 million unsecured multi currency revolving credit facility since its inception in July 2005. This facility contains a provision under which the Company may request, prior to each of the first and second anniversaries of the facility, a one year extension of the termination of the facility. The Company requested an extension effective on the first anniversary, July 26, 2006, and lenders with commitments for $457.0 million under the facility consented to the extension. Accordingly, on July 26, 2006 this extension became effective, as a result of which $43.0 million of the facility will terminate on July 26, 2010, and $457.0 million of the facility will terminate on July 26, 2011. The credit facility is available for general corporate purposes including the payment of a portion of the $512.5 million cash payment, plus accrued interest (which was $123.5 million at December 31, 2006), required to be paid upon the effectiveness of an appropriate plan of reorganization in the 36 W. R. Grace & Co. bankruptcy. See Note 10, Debt and Credit Facilities of the Notes to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on this credit facility. ANZ Facility The Company has an Australian dollar 170 million, dual currency revolving credit facility, known as the ANZ facility, equivalent to U.S. $132.9 million at December 31, 2006, due March 2010. A syndicate of banks made this facility available to a group of the Companys Australian and New Zealand subsidiaries for general corporate purposes including refinancing of previously outstanding indebtedness. The Company may re borrow amounts repaid under the ANZ facility from time to time prior to the expiration or earlier termination of the facility. The Company borrowed under the ANZ facility during the second quarter of 2006, but it repaid those amounts in full and did not borrow further under the ANZ facility during 2006. There were no amounts outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2006 or at December 31, 2005. See Note 10, Debt and Credit Facilities of the Notes to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on this facility. Other Lines of Credit Substantially all the Companys short term borrowings of $20.2 million and $21.8 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, were outstanding under lines of credit available to several of the Companys foreign subsidiaries. The weighted average interest rate on these outstanding lines of credit was 12.5% and 12.3% at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Amounts available under these credit lines as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 were approximately $198.0 million and $200.1 million, respectively, of which approximately $177.8 million and $178.3 million, respectively, were unused. Accounts Receivable Securitization Program The Companys $125.0 million receivables program has an expiration date of December 7, 2007. The receivables program contains financial covenants relating to interest coverage and debt leverage. The Company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2006. The Companys receivables funding subsidiary did not sell any receivables interests under the receivables program during 2006, and therefore the Company did not remove any related amounts from the consolidated assets reflected on the Companys consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2006. During 2005, the Companys receivables funding subsidiary sold an undivided ownership interest in $35 million of eligible receivables under the receivables program. Payments on the Companys receivables that were applied to these receivables interests in accordance with the terms of the program reduced the amount of receivables interests held by the bank or the issuer of commercial paper that are parties to the program to zero during 2005. Therefore, as of December 31, 2005, neither the bank nor the issuer of commercial paper held any receivables interests, and the Company did not remove any related amounts from the assets reflected on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2005. See Note 5, Accounts Receivable Securitization Program, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning this program. Debt Ratings The Companys cost of capital and ability to obtain external financing may be affected by its debt ratings, which the credit rating agencies review periodically. The Companys long term senior unsecured debt is currently rated Baa3 (stable outlook) by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. and BBB (negative outlook) by Standard & Poors, a division of The McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. These ratings are among the ratings assigned by each of these organizations for investment grade long term senior unsecured debt. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or 37 withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Outstanding Indebtedness At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Companys total debt outstanding consisted of the amounts set forth on the following table: December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 Short term borrowings $ 20.2 $ 21.8 Current portion of long term debt 5.5 241.4 Total current debt 25.7 263.2 Total long term debt, less current portion 1,826.6 1,813.0 Total debt $ 1,852.3 $ 2,076.2 5.625% Euro Notes On July 19, 2006, the Companys 5.625% euro notes with a face value of 200.0 million matured. These notes were included in the current portion of long term debt at December 31, 2005. The Company used available cash of $251.7 million to retire this debt. Interest on the 5.625% euro notes was payable annually in arrears, with the final payment of $14.2 million made upon maturity of the euro notes. Senior Notes Included in the Companys long term debt is approximately $1,796.2 million of senior notes with various maturities. The next maturity will be the Companys 5.375% senior notes which mature in April 2008. See Note 10, Debt and Credit Facilities of the Notes to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Companys debt. Analysis of Historical Cash Flows Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $432.9 million in 2006, $363.3 million in 2005 and $436.2 million in 2004. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2006 was due to various factors: an increase in cash generated from accounts receivable in 2006 compared with 2005 due to an increase in cash collections during 2006 that exceeded the increase in net sales. In addition, during the 2006 period there was increased cash received from vendor rebates receivable; an increase in accrued restructuring costs in 2006 due to the recording of $11.8 million of restructuring charges related to the global manufacturing strategy, partially offset by $4.5 million in cash payments in 2006 related to the 2004 restructuring program and 2006 global manufacturing charge. Cash payments related to the 2004 restructuring program made in 2005 were $16.8 million; an increase in income taxes payable in the 2006 period due to higher income tax expense; an increase in accrued payroll in the 2006 period partially due to higher management incentive compensation; and the timing of other receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business; 38 partially offset by; an increase in cash used for inventory in the 2006 period due to higher resin costs affecting all categories of inventory and higher raw material quantities in the 2006 period. Raw material inventory quantities were lower in the 2005 period in part due to the storm related depletion of the Companys resin supplies. In addition, higher inventories were needed in 2006 to support the Companys global manufacturing strategy as projects got underway to shift production consistent with the Companys centers of excellence approach. The reduction in net cash provided by operating activities in 2005 compared with 2004 was due to various factors: a reduction in cash generated from accounts payable balances. The cash generated in 2005 was $16.7 million compared with $48.5 million in 2004; cash used of $16.8 million in 2005 compared with cash used of $0.6 million in 2004 for employee termination and facility exit cost payments related to its 2004 restructuring program; an increase in cash used for income tax payments in 2005. The Company made cash payments of $152.2 million in 2005 compared with $141.9 million in 2004; and an increase in notes and accounts receivable due to higher net sales in 2005, partially offset by an increase in cash collections during 2005; partially offset by; a reduction in cash used for inventory due to higher inventory turnover in the 2005 period, partially offset by higher raw material costs; and a change in accrued interest of $11.3 million. Accrued interest increased $31.8 million in 2005 compared with an increase of $20.5 million in 2004. The increase in the 2005 period was primarily due to an increase of $31.4 million due to additional accrued interest related to the Companys liability under the asbestos settlement agreement, which is compounded annually. The increase in 2004 was primarily due to an increase in accrued interest of $29.8 million related to the asbestos settlement agreement, partially offset by a reduction of $6.3 million in accrued interest related to the 8.75% senior notes, which were repurchased in 2003. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities amounted to $202.5 million in 2006, $88.9 million in 2005 and $91.0 million in 2004. The increase in net cash used for investing activities in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily due to the following: $53.3 million of cash used to complete acquisitions in 2006 of which $41.2 million was for the previously announced acquisition of Nelipak Holdings B.V. on January 3, 2006; and an increase of $71.0 million in capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were $167.9 million in 2006 compared with $96.9 million in 2005. The decrease in net cash used in 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily due to the following: a decrease in capital expenditures. Capital expenditures in 2005 were $96.9 million compared with $102.7 million in 2004; and lower levels of cash used for businesses acquired. In 2005 cash used was $0.2 million compared with $6.4 million in 2004; 39 partially offset by; lower net proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities in 2005 compared with 2004. See Note 4, Short Term Investments Available for Sale Securities, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is contained in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, which describes these available for sale securities. Acquisitions Cash used to complete acquisitions was $53.3 million in 2006, $0.2 million in 2005 and $6.4 million in 2004. In each year, cash used for acquisitions was net of cash acquired in those acquisitions. The cash acquired in those acquisitions was immaterial. The Company assumed $9.6 million of debt related to the Nelipak Holdings B.V. acquisition in 2006. In 2005 and 2004, the Company did not assume any debt related to acquisitions. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $167.9 million in 2006, $96.9 million in 2005 and $102.7 million in 2004. Capital expenditures for the Companys food packaging segment amounted to $142.4 million, $80.7 million and $81.3 million and for the protective packaging segment amounted to $25.5 million, $16.2 million and $21.4 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures in 2006 compared with 2005 was due to investments in capacity expansion and in new technologies related to the Companys centers of excellence approach as well as global manufacturing capital expenditures of $14.2 million. The decrease in capital expenditures in 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily due to the completion of two new production facilities, one in the United States and one in Hungary, which the Company initiated in 2003 and completed in the early part of 2004. The improved productivity of existing assets allowed the Company to defer spending on incremental capacity in 2005. The Company expects to continue to invest capital as it deems appropriate to expand its business, to replace depreciating property, plant and equipment, to acquire new manufacturing technology and to improve productivity. Taking into account capital expenditures in 2007 of $60.0 to $80.0 million on the Companys global manufacturing strategy, the Company expects total capital expenditures in 2007 to range between $175.0 million and $200.0 million. This projection is based upon the Companys capital expenditure budget for 2007, the status of approved but not yet completed capital projects, anticipated future projects including the implementation of the Companys global manufacturing strategy and historic spending trends. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities amounted to $350.0 million in 2006, $118.4 million in 2005 and $300.3 million in 2004. The increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily due to the following: $251.7 million of cash used to retire the Companys 5.625% euro notes on July 19, 2006; and $48.6 million of cash used in 2006 to pay dividends on the Companys common stock; partially offset by; a decrease in cash used in 2006 for the repurchase of shares of the Companys common stock, as discussed in Repurchases of Capital Stock below. Cash used in 2006 was $52.4 million compared with $116.4 million of cash used in 2005. 40 The decrease in net cash used in financing activities in 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily due to the following: $232.3 million of cash used in 2004 for the debt repurchases and redemptions made in the fourth quarter of 2004; partially offset by; an increase in 2005 of $30.2 million in net cash used to repurchase shares of the Companys common stock, as discussed below. In 2005, the Company used $116.4 million to repurchase its common stock compared with $86.2 million in 2004; and a decrease of $20.3 million in proceeds from long term debt in 2005 compared with 2004. Repurchases of Capital Stock In 2006, the Company repurchased 1,049,200 shares of its common stock, par value $0.10 per share, in open market purchases at a cost of $52.4 million. The average price per share of these common stock repurchases in 2006 was $49.90. In 2005, the Company repurchased 2,430,200 shares of its common stock, par value $0.10 per share, in open market purchases at a cost of $116.4 million in 2005. The average price per share of these common stock repurchases in 2005 was $47.88. In 2004, the Company repurchased 1,781,000 shares of its common stock, par value $0.10 per share, in open market purchases, at a cost of $86.2 million in 2004. The average price per share of the common stock repurchases in 2004 was $48.38. The share repurchases described above were made under a program previously adopted by the Companys Board of Directors. The share repurchase program authorized the repurchase of up to 16,977,147 shares of common stock, which included the Series A convertible preferred stock on an as converted basis prior to its redemption. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had repurchased 15,376,571 shares of common stock and preferred stock on an as converted basis, and the remaining repurchase authorization covered 1,600,576 shares of common stock. The Company may from time to time continue to repurchase its common stock. Debt Redemption and Repurchases 2004 Debt Redemption: On November 26, 2004, the Company used net cash of $211.8 million to redeem the entire outstanding aggregate principal amount, $177.5 million, of its 8.75% senior notes due July 1, 2008 and terminated interest rate swaps on the 8.75% senior notes having a total notional amount of $150.0 million. The Company issued the senior notes on June 26, 2001 under Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933. The Company determined the redemption price in accordance with the indenture governing the notes. The net cash used of $211.8 million consisted of cash used to purchase the senior notes at a premium plus accrued interest of $213.4 million and cash received of $1.6 million related to the termination of the interest rate swaps. The Company completed the redemption, funded with available cash, at a premium to the face amount of the notes, which resulted in a loss of $29.6 million, which the Company reflected in the statement of operations as Loss on debt redemption and repurchases. The annual interest expense on the redeemed notes was approximately $15.5 million, without giving effect to any interest rate swaps and the amortization of amounts related to the senior notes. 2004 Debt Repurchases In November and December 2004, the Company used available cash of $25.2 million to repurchase in the open market $22.7 million face amount of its 6.95% senior notes due May 2009, which included accrued interest and related fees. Since the Company completed these repurchases at a premium to the face amount of the notes, it incurred a loss of $2.6 million, which the Company reflected in the statement of operations as Loss on debt redemption and repurchases. 41 The Company may from time to time continue to repurchase or otherwise retire its outstanding indebtedness. Changes in Working Capital At December 31, 2006, working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $350.6 million compared with $161.9 million at December 31, 2005. The $188.7 million increase in the Companys working capital during 2006 arose primarily from the following changes: an increase of $100.3 million in inventory. This increase was due to various factors which included the following: $46.6 million from the Companys application on January 1, 2006 of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements, known as SAB 108. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on this new accounting standard; $16.1 million from the effects of foreign currency translation; an increase in raw materials inventory due to lower raw material inventory quantities in the 2005 period in part due to the storm related depletion of the Companys resin supplies; and higher inventories in 2006 needed to support the Companys global manufacturing strategy for projects began during 2006 to shift production consistent with the centers of excellence approach. a decrease of $235.9 million in the current portion of long term debt of which $251.7 million was due to the retirement of the 5.625% euro notes in July 2006; an increase of $47.3 million in accounts receivable. This increase was primarily due to $30.9 million from the effects of foreign currency translation and, to a lesser extent, due to an increase in net sales in 2006, partially offset by increased cash collections which includes cash received from vendor rebates receivable; partially offset by; a decrease of $92.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments due to $251.7 million of cash used to retire the Companys 5.625% euro notes as noted above, $48.6 million of cash used in 2006 to pay dividends on the Companys common stock, $53.3 million of cash used in 2006 for businesses acquired of which $41.2 million was due to the the previously announced acquisition of Nelipak Holdings B.V. on January 3, 2006, and $52.4 million of cash used to repurchase the Companys common stock discussed above, partially offset by cash flow generated from operations; an increase of $33.6 million in accounts payable, which includes $10.9 million from the effects of foreign currency. The balance of the increase was primarily due to the increased levels of inventory; an increase of $28.1 million in accrued interest primarily due to an additional $33.2 million of accrued interest during 2006 related to the Companys liability under the asbestos settlement agreement, partially offset by a decrease of $6.7 million due to the retirement of the Companys 5.625% euro notes in July 2006; and an increase of $25.5 million in accrued payroll. This increase was primarily due to increased payroll related costs, including an increase in the accrual for management incentive compensation in 2006 since the Company met most of its 2006 performance objectives and $6.2 million from the effects of foreign currency translation. 42 Current and Quick Ratios The ratio of current assets to current liabilities, known as the current ratio, was 1.2 at December 31, 2006 and 1.1 at December 31, 2005. The ratio of current assets less inventory to current liabilities, known as the quick ratio, was 0.9 at December 31, 2006 and 0.8 at December 31, 2005.

Recently Issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, Accounting Guidance and Disclosure Requirements The Company is subject to numerous recently issued statements of financial accounting standards, accounting guidance and disclosure requirements. Note 22, New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, Accounting Guidance and Disclosure Requirements, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is contained in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, describes these new accounting pronouncements and is incorporated herein by reference. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, known as US GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, may differ from estimates, and while any differences may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements, the Company does not believe that the differences, taken as a whole, will be material. The Company believes the following accounting policies are critical to its business operations and the understanding of results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements: Accounts Receivable In the normal course of business, the Company extends credit to customers that satisfy pre defined credit criteria. Accounts receivable, as shown on the consolidated balance sheets, are net of allowances for doubtful accounts. The Company maintains accounts receivable allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of the Companys customers deteriorates. Commitments and Contingencies Litigation On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against it. While it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions, the Company uses its best judgment to determine if it is probable that it will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, the Company makes estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries, if any. The Company accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery, it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that the Company has previously made. The Company expenses legal costs, including those legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred. Impairment of Long Lived Assets The Company periodically reviews long lived assets, other than goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Goodwill, in accordance with SFAS No. 142, is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. A review of goodwill 44 may be initiated prior to conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. Assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses, such as future cash flows and disposition costs, may affect the carrying value of long lived assets and possible impairment expense in the Companys consolidated financial statements. Self Insurance The Company retains the obligation for specified claims and losses related to property, casualty, workers compensation and employee benefit claims. The Company accrues for outstanding reported claims, claims that have been incurred but not reported, and projected claims based upon managements estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims using historical experience, insurance company estimates and the estimated trends in claim values. Although management believes it has the ability to adequately project and record estimated claim payments, actual results could differ significantly from the recorded liabilities. Pensions The Company maintains a non contributory profit sharing plan and contributory thrift and retirement savings plan in which most U.S. employees of the Company are eligible to participate. For a limited number of its U.S. employees and for some of its non U.S. employees, the Company maintains defined benefit pension plans. The Company accounts for these pension plans in accordance with SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans. Under this accounting standard, the Company makes assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and performance of plan assets. The principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure future obligations, the expected future rate of return on plan assets, the expected rate of future compensation increases and various other actuarial assumptions. The measurement date used to determine the benefit obligations and the plan assets is December 31. In general, changes to these assumptions could have a significant impact on the costs and liabilities recorded under SFAS No. 158. Income Taxes The Companys deferred tax assets arise from net deductible temporary differences and tax benefit carry forwards. The Company evaluates whether its taxable earnings during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carry forwards may be utilized should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits. For those jurisdictions where the expiration dates of tax benefit carry forwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely, the Company provides a valuation allowance. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company estimates future taxable earnings, with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax benefit carry forwards, to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods, the Company may need to adjust the valuation allowance, which could materially impact the Companys consolidated financial statements. In calculating its worldwide provision for income taxes, the Company also evaluates its tax positions for years where the statutes of limitations have not expired. Based on this review, the Company may establish reserves for additional taxes and interest that could be assessed upon examination by relevant tax authorities. The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, including the results of tax audits and changes in tax law. Educational Donation During the second quarter of 2006, the Company donated $1.5 million to the Harvard Business School in partial funding of a professorship in the name of T. J. Dermot Dunphy. Mr. Dunphy, a director of the Company, was Chief Executive Officer of the Company from March 1971 until his retirement in February 2000. He received a Masters degree in Business Administration from the school in 1956. 45 Non GAAP Information The Companys management from time to time presents information that does not conform to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, including changes in net sales excluding the effects of foreign currency translation. The Companys management uses changes in net sales excluding the effects of foreign currency translation to measure the performance of the Companys operations. Thus, management believes that this information may be useful to investors. Such measures are also among the criteria upon which performance based compensation may be determined. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which may adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. The Company seeks to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company does not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rates From time to time, the Company may use interest rate swaps, collars or options to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. The Companys interest rate swaps are described in Note 11, Derivatives and Hedging Activities, of the Notes to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements, which is contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Derivative Financial Instruments Interest Rate Swaps contained in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had no collars or options outstanding. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the carrying value of the Companys total debt, which includes the impact of outstanding interest rate swaps, was $1,852.3 million and $2,076.2 million, respectively. The Companys fixed rate debt at December 31, 2006 and 2005, including the impact of interest rate swaps, was $1,531.4 million and $1,767.7 million, respectively. The fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt varies with changes in interest rates. Generally, the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The estimated fair value of the Companys total debt, including the impact of outstanding interest rate swaps, was $1,885.9 million at December 31, 2006 compared with $2,135.7 million at December 31, 2005. A hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates would result in an increase in the fair value of the total debt balance at December 31, 2006 of $81.6 million. These changes in the fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt do not alter the Companys obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount of such debt. Foreign Exchange Rates The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to fix the amount payable on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates at December 31, 2006 would have caused the Company to pay approximately $20.7 million to terminate these contracts. The Companys foreign currency forward contracts are described in Note 11, Derivatives and Hedging Activities, of the Notes to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements, which is contained in Part II, Item 8 and in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Derivative Financial Instruments Foreign Currency Forward Contracts contained in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 46 The Company may use other derivative instruments from time to time, such as foreign exchange options to manage exposure due to foreign exchange rates and interest rate and currency swaps related to access to additional sources of international financing. These instruments can potentially limit foreign exchange exposure and limit or adjust interest rate exposure by swapping borrowings denominated in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had no foreign exchange options or interest rate and currency swap agreements outstanding. The Companys outstanding debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing subsidiary. The Company believes that this enables it to better match operating cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match the currency of assets and liabilities. The amount of outstanding debt denominated in a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar was $34.4 million and $262.8 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in 2006 compared with 2005 was due to the maturity of the Companys 5.625% euro notes with a face value of 200.0 million as discussed above. Commodities The Company uses various commodity raw materials such as plastic resins and energy products such as electric power and natural gas in conjunction with its manufacturing processes. Generally, the Company acquires these components at market prices and does not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices. Moreover, the Companys supply chain team seeks to maintain appropriate levels of commodity raw material inventories thus minimizing the expense and risks of carrying excess inventories. The Company does not typically purchase substantial quantities in advance of production requirements. As a result, the Company is exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components. 47
