Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The information in "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" should be read together with the Companys consolidated financial statements and related notes set forth in Part II, Item 8, as well as the discussion included in Item 1A "Risk Factors" of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. All amounts and percentages are approximate due to rounding. The Company has reclassified prior period amounts presented in this discussion and analysis to conform to the 2007 presentation. See "Expanded Segment Reporting; New Structure," below for discussion of the Companys new segment reporting structure. Overview The Company is a leading global innovator and manufacturer of a wide range of packaging and performance based materials and equipment systems that serve an array of food, industrial, medical and consumer applications. The Company employs approximately 2,100 sales, marketing and customer service personnel throughout the world who sell and market the Companys products through a large number of distributors, fabricators and converters, as well as directly to end users such as food processors, food service businesses, and manufacturers. The Company has no material long term contracts for the distribution of its products. In 2007, no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10% or more of the Companys consolidated net sales. Although net sales of the Companys food packaging, food solutions and protective packaging products tend to be slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher in the fourth quarter, the Company does not consider seasonality to be material to its consolidated financial position or results of operations or to its reportable business segments. Competition for most of the Companys packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics, service and price. Competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology and, as a result, the Company maintains ongoing research and development programs to enable it to maintain technological leadership. The Companys net sales are sensitive to developments in its customers business or market conditions, changes in the global economy, and the effects of foreign currency translation. The Companys costs can vary with changes in petrochemical related costs, which are not within the Companys control. Consequently, the Companys management focuses on reducing those costs that the Company can control and using petrochemical based raw materials as efficiently as possible. The Company also believes that its global presence helps to insulate it from localized changes in business conditions. The Companys businesses are managed to generate substantial operating cash flow. The Company believes that its strong operating cash flow will permit it to continue to spend on innovative research and development and to invest in its business by means of capital expenditures for property and equipment and acquisitions. Moreover, its ability to generate substantial operating cash flow should provide the Company with the flexibility to modify its capital structure as the need or opportunity arises. The Companys operating cash flow, along with accumulated cash and funds available under its credit facilities, should enable the Company to make the settlement payment, including interest that is expected to be required of the Company upon consummation of a plan of reorganization in the W. R. Grace & Co. bankruptcy. See, "Asbestos Settlement and Related Costs," of Note 16, "Commitments and Contingencies," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Recent Events Acquisitions and Investments in Joint Ventures During 2007 and 2006, the Company completed the following transactions using aggregate cash of $78.2 million in 2007 and $53.3 million in 2006. 2007: January; the Company acquired Pack Tiger GmbH and a majority interest in NanoPore Insulation LLC; 21 August; the Company acquired Alga Plastics Company; September; the Company acquired a 50% interest in Teknik Plastik; and November; the Company acquired certain assets relating to the Ethafoam&reg; and related polyethylene foam product lines. 2006: January; the Company acquired Nelipak Holding B.V; July; the Company acquired Entapack Pty Ltd; and; October; the Company acquired a majority interest in Biosphere Industries LLC. See Note 20, "Acquisitions and Divestiture," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the transactions described above. Expanded Segment Reporting; New Structure During 2007, the Company expanded and realigned its segment reporting to reflect its growth strategies in core markets and in new business opportunities. This new structure reflects the way management now makes operating decisions and manages the growth and profitability of the business. It also corresponds with managements current approach to allocating resources and assessing the performance of the Companys segments. As a result, the Company now reports business segment information as described below. The Companys business segment information is reported in accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Statement No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information," or SFAS No. 131. The Companys New Reportable Segments In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 131, the Company now reports publicly in four parts, three reportable segments and an "other" category. The new reportable segments are: 1.Food Packaging 2.Food Solutions 3.Protective Packaging The products reported in the Companys new Food Packaging and Food Solutions reportable segments were previously reported in the Companys former Food Packaging segment. The Companys new Protective Packaging reportable segment continues to include the aggregation of the Companys protective packaging products and shrink packaging products, as permitted under the provisions of SFAS No. 131. The Other category includes specialty materials, medical applications and new ventures, which includes renewable products. The Company previously included specialty materials and renewable products in both the Food Packaging and Protective Packaging segments, whereas medical applications were previously included in the Food Packaging segment. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 131, the Companys segment information has been recast from amounts previously reported to reflect the Companys new reportable segments. Accordingly, there has been no change in the Companys consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets previously reported in total for the Company. See Note 3, "Business Segment Information," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for further discussion of the Companys new reportable segments. Two for One Common Stock Split On February 16, 2007, the Companys Board of Directors declared a two for one stock split of the Companys common stock that was effected in the form of a stock dividend. The stock dividend was paid on March 16, 2007 at the rate of one additional share of the Companys common stock for each share of the Companys common stock issued and outstanding to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 2, 2007. In addition, nine million additional shares of common stock were reserved related to the 22 asbestos settlement. The stock dividend was not paid on treasury shares. The par value of the Companys common stock remains at $0.10 per share. All share and per share amounts have been restated to reflect the two for one stock split, except for shareholders equity. Quarterly Cash Dividends On February 16, 2007, the Companys Board of Directors increased the Companys quarterly cash dividend by 33% to $0.20 per common share, declaring a quarterly cash dividend that was paid on the pre split shares of the Companys common stock on March 16, 2007. During 2007, the Company declared and paid quarterly cash dividends on post split shares of the Companys common stock of $0.10 per common share. The Company used cash of $64.6 million to pay these quarterly cash dividends. During 2006, the Company used cash of $48.6 million to pay quarterly dividends. On February 19, 2008, the Companys Board of Directors increased the Companys quarterly cash dividend by 20.0% to $0.12 per common share, declaring a quarterly cash dividend payable on March 21, 2008 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 7, 2008. The estimated amount of the dividend payment is approximately $19.4 million based on approximately 161.6 million shares of the Companys common stock issued and outstanding as of January 31, 2008. Highlights Highlights for 2007 compared with 2006 and 2005 were as follows (dollars in millions except per common share amounts): 2007 2006 2005 2007 vs. 2006 % Change 2006 vs. 2005 % Change Net sales: U.S. $ 2,118.2 $ 2,066.3 $ 1,972.9 2.5 % 4.7 % % of total net sales 45.5 % 47.7 % 48.3 % International 2,533.0 2,261.6 2,112.2 12.0 7.1 % of total net sales 54.5 % 52.3 % 51.7 % Total net sales $ 4,651.2 $ 4,327.9 $ 4,085.1 7.5 % 5.9 % Gross profit $ 1,301.1 $ 1,240.1 $ 1,158.0 4.9 % 7.1 % % of total net sales 28.0 % 28.7 % 28.3 % Marketing, administrative and development expenses $ 750.2 $ 701.1 $ 645.9 7.0 % 8.5 % % of total net sales 16.1 % 16.2 % 15.8 % Restructuring and other charges 1.6 12.9 1.7 # # Operating profit $ 549.3 $ 526.1 $ 510.4 4.4 % 3.1 % % of total net sales 11.8 % 12.2 % 12.5 % Net earnings $ 353.0 $ 274.1 $ 255.8 28.8 % 7.2 % Net earnings per common share(1): Basic $ 2.21 $ 1.70 $ 1.56 30.0 % 9.0 % Diluted $ 1.89 $ 1.47 $ 1.35 28.6 % 8.9 % #Denotes a variance greater than 100.0% (1)Earnings per common share for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 have been revised. See Note 18, "Net Earnings Per Common Share," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for the reconciliation of the basic and diluted earnings per common share computations and discussion of the 2006 and 2005 revisions. 23 Net Sales The principal factors contributing to changes in net sales in the three years ended December 31, 2007 were changes in unit volume, product mix and average selling prices. In addition, 2007 and 2006 had increased volumes from acquired businesses, net of dispositions. Furthermore, the change in net sales in 2007 compared with 2006 was favorably impacted by the effects of foreign currency translation while the impact of foreign currency translation in 2006 compared with 2005 was minimal. 2007 compared with 2006 Net sales for 2007 increased 7.5% to $4,651.2 million compared with $4,327.9 million in 2006. The components of the increase in net sales for 2007 compared with 2006 were as follows (dollars in millions): Food Packaging Food Solutions Protective Packaging Other Total Company Volume Units 3.6 % $ 63.3 4.9 % $ 41.0 (0.1 )% $ (1.8 ) 4.8 % $ 13.0 2.7 % $ 115.5 Volume Acquired businesses, net of dispositions 0.7 5.7 (1.1 ) (15.7 ) 6.1 16.3 0.1 6.3 Price/Mix 0.8 12.1 1.1 9.3 0.1 0.6 1.2 3.0 0.6 25.0 Foreign currency translation 3.8 66.9 5.4 45.7 3.2 47.7 6.0 16.2 4.1 176.5 Total 8.2 % $ 142.3 12.1 % $ 101.7 2.1 % $ 30.8 18.1 % $ 48.5 7.5 % $ 323.3 Excluding the favorable effect of foreign currency translation, net sales would have increased 3.4% compared with 2006. The strengthening of foreign currencies primarily in Europe and the Asia Pacific region against the U.S. dollar contributed $156.3 million of the $176.5 million favorable foreign currency translation impact on net sales in 2007 compared with 2006. 2006 compared with 2005 Net sales for 2006 increased 5.9% to $4,327.9 million compared with $4,085.1 million in 2005. The components of the increase in net sales for 2006 compared with 2005 were as follows (dollars in millions): Food Packaging Food Solutions Protective Packaging Other Total Company Volume Units 1.4 % $ 23.1 3.9 % $ 30.9 0.7 % $ 10.3 5.0 % $ 9.1 1.8 % $ 73.4 Volume Acquired businesses, net of dispositions 0.6 4.7 0.6 33.9 62.0 1.6 67.3 Price/Mix 1.2 20.1 2.5 19.7 3.4 47.7 7.3 13.2 2.5 100.7 Foreign currency translation 0.1 2.3 (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (1.6 ) 0.3 0.8 1.4 Total 2.7 % $ 45.5 7.0 % $ 55.2 4.0 % $ 57.0 46.5 % $ 85.1 5.9 % $ 242.8 Foreign currency translation had a minimal impact on net sales in 2006. During the first half of 2006, foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact on net sales primarily from the weakness of foreign currencies in Europe, which was offset in the second half of 2006 by their strengthening against the U.S. dollar. In addition, the Brazilian real and the Canadian dollar strengthened all year against the U.S. dollar, which was offset by the weakness of foreign currencies in the Asia Pacific region. 24 Net Sales by Business Segment and Other The following table shows the Companys net sales by business segment and other (dollars in millions): 2007 2006 2005 2007 vs. 2006 % Change 2006 vs. 2005 % Change Net sales: Food Packaging $ 1,882.9 $ 1,740.6 $ 1,695.1 8.2 % 2.7 % As a % of total net sales 40.5 % 40.2 % 41.5 % Food Solutions 944.7 843.0 787.8 12.1 7.0 As a % of total net sales 20.3 % 19.5 % 19.3 % Protective Packaging 1,506.9 1,476.1 1,419.1 2.1 4.0 As a % of total net sales 32.4 % 34.1 % 34.7 % Other 316.7 268.2 183.1 18.1 46.5 As a % of total net sales 6.8 % 6.2 % 4.5 % Total $ 4,651.2 $ 4,327.9 $ 4,085.1 7.5 % 5.9 % Food Packaging Segment Net Sales 2007 compared with 2006 The Companys Food Packaging segment net sales increased $142.3 million, or 8.2% in 2007 compared with 2006. Excluding the $66.9 million favorable effect of foreign currency translation, Food Packaging segment net sales would have increased 4.4%, which was primarily due to: increases in both unit volume and product price/mix of 4.2% in North America; increases in unit volume in Latin America of 11.9% and in the Asia Pacific region of 4.9%; an increase in product price/mix in Europe of 1.5%; partially offset by; unfavorable product price/mix in the Asia Pacific region of 1.9%. The increases in unit volume in North America, Latin America and the Asia Pacific region were primarily due to positive trends in red meat and pork production in North and Latin America and strong beef export rates in Brazil and Australia. Positive trends in red meat production also contributed to the increase in product price/mix in North America. The increase in product price/mix was also impacted by price increases implemented for select food packaging products in September 2006. The increase in product price/mix in Europe was primarily due to improved product price/mix in developing European countries, as well as improved product mix of flexible packaging materials in Western Europe. The unfavorable product price/mix in the Asia Pacific region was primarily due to the impact of lower average selling prices. 2006 compared with 2005 The Companys Food Packaging segment net sales increased $45.5 million, or 2.7%, in 2006 compared with 2005. This increase was primarily due to: increases in unit volume in Latin America of 14.1% and North America of 0.4%; and an increase in product price/mix in North America of 2.4%; partially offset by; decreases in unit volume in both Europe and the Asia Pacific region of 1.6%. The increases in unit volume in Latin America and, to a lesser extent, in North America were primarily attributable to positive trends in domestic red meat production and strong beef export rates in Brazil. The increase in product price/mix in North America was primarily attributable to average selling price increases implemented in September 2006 for select food packaging products. 25  The decrease in unit volume in Europe was primarily attributable to negative trends in the processed meat and cheese markets which were partially offset by positive trends in poultry and red meat production. Lower equipment sales also contributed to this decrease. The decrease in unit volume in the Asia Pacific region was primarily attributable to a decline in domestic red meat production, mainly lamb, and lower equipment sales. Food Solutions Segment Net Sales 2007 compared with 2006 The Companys Food Solutions segment net sales increased $101.7 million, or 12.1% in 2007 compared with 2006. Excluding the $45.7 million favorable effect of foreign currency translation, Food Solutions segment net sales would have increased 6.7%, which was primarily due to: increases in both unit volume and product price/mix of 6.1% in North America; and increases in both unit volume and product price/mix of 4.6% in Europe. The increases in unit volume and product price/mix in North America and the increase in unit volume in Europe were primarily due to steady red meat production and continued product adoption by existing and new customers, which benefited sales of the Companys case ready products. Additionally, strength in domestic crop yields and strong equipment sales benefited sales of the Companys vertical pouch packaging products in North America. 2006 compared with 2005 The Companys Food Solutions segment net sales increased $55.2 million, or 7.0%, compared with 2005. In 2006, the Company acquired Entapack, which contributed $5.7 million of net sales in this segment. The remainder of the increase was primarily due to: increases in unit volume in North America of 6.3% and Latin America of 24.0%; and increases in product price/mix in North America of 4.6% and Europe of 1.3%. The increase in unit volume in North America and Latin America was primarily attributable to steady red meat production and continued case ready product adoption by both new and existing customers. The increase in product price/mix in North America and Europe was primarily attributable to favorable product mix and, to a lesser extent, selling price increases implemented during 2006 for select food solutions products. Outsourced Products Included in this segment are net sales from products produced in the Companys facilities as well as products fabricated by other manufacturers, or outsourced products. Outsourced products include, among others, foam and solid plastic trays and containers fabricated in various regions and absorbent pads fabricated in Europe. Net sales of outsourced products included in this segment amounted to $180.7 million in 2007, $165.3 million in 2006 and $119.4 million in 2005. Protective Packaging Segment Net Sales 2007 compared with 2006 The Companys Protective Packaging segment net sales increased $30.8 million, or 2.1%, in 2007 compared with 2006. Excluding the $47.7 million favorable effect of foreign currency translation and the $19.2 million impact of the sale of a small product line in 2007, Protective Packaging segment net sales would have been relatively flat, which was primarily due to: a decrease in unit volume in North America of 1.7%; partially offset by; an increase in unit volume in the Asia Pacific region of 9.0%. The decrease in unit volume in North America was primarily due to challenging economic conditions in 2007, which slowed the pace of customer orders. Additionally, unit volume was also negatively impacted by 26 the effects of a net increase in average selling prices for select protective packaging products in 2006 and 2007, which were implemented to address rising costs of raw materials. The increase in unit volume in the Asia Pacific region was principally due to an increase in sales to new and existing customers of inflatables, shrink films and Instapak&reg; foam in place products. 2006 compared with 2005 The Companys Protective Packaging segment net sales increased $57.0 million, or 4.0%, in 2006 compared with 2005. This increase was primarily due to: increases in unit volume in Europe of 1.6% and the Asia Pacific region of 4.9%; and increases in product price/mix in North America of 3.9%, Europe of 2.7% and Latin America of 4.1%. The increases in unit volume in Europe and in the Asia Pacific region were primarily attributable to increased sales to both new and existing customers of Instapak&reg; foam in place products in both regions and protective mailer products in Europe. The increases in product price/mix in North America, Europe and Latin America were primarily attributable to the net effect of average selling price increases for select protective packaging products implemented during 2006. Other Net Sales 2007 compared with 2006 The Companys Other net sales increased $48.5 million, or 18.1%, in 2007 compared with 2006. Excluding the $16.2 million favorable effect of foreign currency translation and $15.7 million from the acquisitions of Alga Plastics and of certain assets relating to polyethylene foam product lines in 2007, Other net sales would have increased 6.0%, which was primarily due to: an increase in unit volume in the Asia Pacific region of 44.4% and Europe of 4.3%, predominately due to an increase in medical applications products sales to new and existing customers; an increase in product price/mix in North America of 6.0%, primarily resulting from average selling price increases in the second half of 2006 related to the Companys specialty materials products, including special density foams; partially offset by; a decrease in unit volume in North America of 8.3%, principally due to lower net sales of specialty materials products including foams and composite materials as a result of challenging economic conditions, which slowed the pace of customer orders; and a decrease in product price/mix in Europe of 1.5%, primarily relating to the Companys specialty materials products, including special density foams. 2006 compared with 2005 The Companys Other net sales increased $85.1 million, or 46.5%, in 2006 compared with 2005. In 2006 the Company acquired Nelipak as part of its medical applications business. This acquisition contributed $62.0 million of net sales in Europe in 2006. The remainder of the increase in Other net sales was primarily attributable to favorable product price/mix in North America, which was predominately due to average selling price increases on select specialty foam products implemented during 2006. 27 Net Sales by Geographic Region The following table shows net sales by geographic region (dollars in millions). 2007 2006 2005 2007 vs. 2006 % Change 2006 vs. 2005 % Change Net sales: U.S. $ 2,118.2 $ 2,066.3 $ 1,972.9 2.5 % 4.7 % As a % of total net sales 45.5 % 47.7 % 48.3 International 2,533.0 2,261.6 2,112.2 12.0 7.1 As a % of total net sales 54.5 % 52.3 % 51.7 Total net sales $ 4,651.2 $ 4,327.9 $ 4,085.1 7.5 % 5.9 % 2007 compared with 2006 By geographic region, the components of the $323.3 million increase in net sales for 2007 compared with 2006 were as follows (dollars in millions): U.S. International Total Company Volume Units 1.0 % $ 21.1 4.2 % $ 94.4 2.7 % $ 115.5 Volume Acquired businesses, net of dispositions 0.1 2.4 0.2 3.9 0.1 6.3 Price/Mix 1.4 28.3 (0.2 ) (3.3 ) 0.6 25.0 Foreign Currency Translation 7.8 176.5 4.1 176.5 Total 2.5 % $ 51.8 12.0 % $ 271.5 7.5 % $ 323.3 See "Net Sales by Business Segment and Other" above for details of the factors and regions that contributed to this net increase. 2006 compared with 2005 By geographic region, the components of the $242.8 million increase in net sales for 2006 compared with 2005 were as follows (dollars in millions): U.S. International Total Company Volume Units 0.7 % $ 14.7 2.8 % $ 58.7 1.8 % $ 73.4 Volume Acquired businesses, net of dispositions 0.6 3.2 66.7 1.6 67.3 Price/Mix 4.0 78.1 1.0 22.6 2.5 100.7 Foreign Currency Translation 0.1 1.4 1.4 Total 4.7 % $ 93.4 7.1 % $ 149.4 5.9 % $ 242.8 See "Segments," of Part I, Item 1. Business Segment Information, for an expanded discussion of the products included in each of the Companys segments and other category. Cost of Sales The Companys primary input costs include resins, direct and indirect labor, other raw materials and other energy related costs (including transportation costs.) The prices of crude oil and natural gas, which serve as feedstock utilized in the production of many of the resins the Company purchases, and energy related costs have increased significantly over the past few years. In the fourth quarter of 2007, prices for these feedstocks and resins rose to unprecedented levels. Although changes in prices of crude oil and natural gas are not perfect benchmarks, they are indicative of the variations in raw materials and energy related costs faced by the Company. Recent resin price increases for some of the Companys raw materials were realized in the fourth quarter of 2007. The Company has taken pricing actions as appropriate to lessen the impact of these raw material price increases when they occur. The most recent pricing actions taken by the Company are expected to have an impact beginning in the first quarter of 2008. 28  The following table shows the Companys cost of sales for the three years ended December 31, 2007 (dollars in millions): 2007 2006 2005 2007 vs. 2006 % Change 2006 vs. 2005 % Change Cost of sales $ 3,350.1 $ 3,087.8 $ 2,927.1 8.5 % 5.5 % As a % of net sales 72.0 % 71.3 % 71.7 % 2007 compared with 2006 The $262.3 million increase in cost of sales for 2007 compared with 2006 was primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation of $129.9 million, higher input costs to support the increase in unit volume of product sales, and unfavorable average petrochemical based raw material costs of approximately $19.0 million. Expenses included in cost of sales related to the implementation of the Companys global manufacturing strategy were $11.1 million in 2007 compared with $3.8 million in 2006. These expenses are discussed in further detail below. 2006 compared with 2005 The $160.7 million increase in cost of sales in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily due to higher input costs to support the higher unit volume of product sales and unfavorable average petrochemical based raw material costs of approximately $62.7 million. Also contributing to this increase were expenses related to the implementation of the Companys global manufacturing strategy of $3.8 million in 2006. Marketing, Administrative and Development Expenses The following table shows the Companys marketing, administrative and development expenses for the three years ended December 31, 2007 (dollars in millions): 2007 2006 2005 2007 vs. 2006 % Change 2006 vs. 2005 % Change Marketing, administrative and development expenses $ 750.2 $ 701.1 $ 645.9 7.0 % 8.5 % As a % of net sales 16.1 % 16.2 % 15.8 % 2007 compared with 2006 The $49.1 million increase in marketing, administrative and development expenses in 2007 compared with 2006 was primarily attributable to the impact of foreign currency translation of $27.2 million, an increase in expenses of $6.9 million related to innovation and new product introductions, including spending related to renewable products, and additional expenses related to the upgrade of the Companys information technology platforms of $2.8 million. The Company also opened a new state of the art North American customer service center in 2007, which resulted in $2.6 million of incremental expenses. The remainder of the increase was to support the operations of the Company, including the higher volume of net sales in 2007. The Company had expected its marketing, administrative and development expenses for the full year of 2007 to be at or below 16.0% of net sales. However, as a result of the additional expenses related to innovation and new product introductions, including spending related to renewable products, and additional expenses related to the upgrade of the Companys information technology platforms noted above, the Companys marketing, administrative and administrative expenses were 16.1% of net sales in 2007. 2006 compared with 2005 The $55.2 million increase in marketing, administrative and development expenses in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily attributable to higher management incentive compensation expenses of approximately $11.0 million as the Company achieved most of its performance objectives in 2006, incremental spending related to the upgrade of the Companys information technology platforms of approximately $10.0 million, operating expenses of businesses acquired during 2006 including Nelipak and Biosphere of approximately $12.0 million and increased expenses to support the higher volume of net sales in 2006. 29 Global Manufacturing Strategy and Restructuring Charges The Companys global manufacturing strategy, when fully implemented, will expand production in countries where demand for the Companys products and services has been growing significantly. At the same time, the Company intends to optimize certain manufacturing capacity in North America and Europe into centers of excellence. The goals of this multi year program are to expand capacity in growing markets, further improve the Companys operating efficiencies, and implement new technologies more effectively. The Company expects this program to produce meaningful savings in future years. By taking advantage of new technologies and streamlining production on a global scale, the Company expects to continue to enhance its profitable growth and its global leadership position. In July 2006, the Company announced the first phase of this multi year global manufacturing strategy. The financial scope of this phase is expected to be as follows (dollars in millions): Original Expected Range Revised Expected Range(1) Incurred During 2006 Incurred During 2007 Total Incurred in 2007 and 2006 Capital expenditures $130.0 $150.0 $ 14.2 $ 58.5 $ 72.7 Associated costs and restructuring charges $90.0 $100.0 $55.0 $60.0 $ 15.6 $ 12.1 $ 27.7 (1)In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company revised the expected range of associated costs and restructuring charges as shown above. The Company also revised the estimated annual savings resulting from implementing this strategy to approximately $45.0 million starting in 2009 and approximately $55.0 million starting in 2010. The Company currently expects capital expenditures to be approximately $70.0 million and associated costs and restructuring charges to be approximately $30.0 million in 2008. The actual timing of these expenditures, costs and charges is subject to change due to a variety of factors. Capital expenditures, associated costs and restructuring charges in connection with this strategy for 2007 and 2006 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2007 2006 Capital expenditures $ 58.5 $ 14.2 Associated costs(1) 11.4 3.8 Restructuring charges(2) 0.7 11.8 (1)The associated costs principally include equipment relocation and facility start up costs, which are primarily included in cost of sales on the consolidated statements of operations. These charges by business segment and other were as follows (dollars in millions): 2007 2006 Food Packaging $ 10.2 $ 3.5 Protective Packaging 0.9 Other 0.3 0.3 Total $ 11.4 $ 3.8 (2)The restructuring charges were primarily for severance costs, the majority of which are related to the Food Packaging segment. These charges were included in restructuring and other charges on the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 3, "Business Segment Information," for restructuring and other charges by business segment and other. A reconciliation of the restructuring accrual is included below. 30 The components of the restructuring accrual, spending and other activity through December 31, 2007 and the accrual balance remaining at December 31, 2007 were as follows (dollars in millions): Employee Termination Costs Original restructuring accrual in 2006 $ 11.6 Cash payments during 2006 (0.4 ) Effect of changes in currency rates (0.3 ) Restructuring accrual at December 31, 2006 10.9 Cash payments during 2007 (4.5 ) Additional accruals for new projects or modifications to previously accrued projects 0.2 Effect of changes in currency rates 1.6 Restructuring accrual at December 31, 2007 $ 8.2 The Company expects to pay $5.5 million of the accrual balance remaining at December 31, 2007 within the next twelve months. This amount is included in other current liabilities on the Companys consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2007. The remaining accrual of $2.7 million is expected to be paid in 2010 and 2011 and is included in other liabilities on the Companys consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2007. In connection with this strategy the Company expects to eliminate 280 full time positions and add approximately 120 full time positions at other facilities as production is transferred. As a result, the net reduction in full time positions is expected to be 160. Other Restructuring Charges In 2007, the Company recorded $0.9 million of restructuring charges, net, primarily for severance costs incurred in connection with the Companys consolidation of its customer service activities in North America. In 2006, the Company recorded $1.1 million of restructuring charges of which $0.6 million related to severance costs incurred in connection with the Companys consolidation of its food packaging customer service activities in Canada and $0.5 million was related to a series of profit improvement plans in various geographic regions of its food packaging segment implemented in 2004. In 2005, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $1.7 million also related to the profit improvement plans implemented in 2004. 31 Operating Profit by Business Segment and Other As previously discussed, management evaluates the performance of each reportable segment based on its operating profit. Operating profit by business segment and other for the three years ended December 31, 2007 was as follows (dollars in millions): 2007 2006 2005 2007 vs. 2006 % Change 2006 vs. 2005 % Change Operating Profit Food Packaging $ 228.2 $ 214.6 $ 231.2 6.3 % (7.2 )% As a % of Food Packaging net sales 12.1 % 12.3 % 13.6 % As a % of total operating profit(1) 41.4 % 39.8 % 45.1 % Food Solutions $ 86.1 $ 87.3 $ 85.2 (1.4 )% 2.5 % As a % of Food Solutions net sales 9.1 % 10.4 % 10.8 % As a % of total operating profit(1) 15.6 % 16.2 % 16.6 % Protective Packaging $ 208.6 $ 206.7 $ 176.8 0.9 % 16.9 % As a % of Protective Packaging net sales 13.8 % 14.0 % 12.5 % As a % of total operating profit(1) 37.9 % 38.3 % 34.5 % Other $ 28.0 $ 30.4 $ 18.9 (7.9 )% 60.9 % As a % of Other net sales 8.8 % 11.3 % 10.3 % As a % of total operating profit(1) 5.1 % 5.7 % 3.8 % Total segments and other $ 550.9 $ 539.0 $ 512.1 2.2 % 5.3 % Restructuring and other charges(2) 1.6 12.9 1.7 Total $ 549.3 $ 526.1 $ 510.4 4.4 % 3.1 % As a % of total net sales 11.8 % 12.2 % 12.5 % (1)Before taking into consideration restructuring and other charges. (2)Restructuring charges of $0.7 million in 2007 and $11.8 in 2006 were related to the Companys global manufacturing strategy. See "Global Manufacturing Strategy and Restructuring Charges," previously discussed for further details. The restructuring and other charges by business segment were as follows: 2007 2006 2005 Food Packaging $ 0.5 $ 13.0 $ 0.7 Food Solutions 0.1 0.3 Protective Packaging 1.0 (0.1 ) 0.6 Other 0.1 Total $ 1.6 $ 12.9 $ 1.7 Food Packaging Segment Operating Profit 2007 compared with 2006 The decrease in operating profit as a percentage of this segments net sales in 2007 compared with 2006 was primarily due to higher input costs including unfavorable average petrochemical based raw material costs of approximately $8.0 million incurred to support the increased volume of product sales and an increase in marketing, administrative and development expenses. Expenses in this segment related to the implementation of the Companys global manufacturing strategy were $10.2 million in 2007 compared with $3.5 million in 2006. 2006 compared with 2005 The decrease in operating profit as a percentage of this segments net sales in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily attributable to higher input costs, including unfavorable average petrochemical based raw material costs of approximately $33.8 million, expenses related to the implementation of the Companys global manufacturing strategy of $3.5 million and the impact of higher marketing, administrative and 32 development expenses previously discussed. The increases in expenses were partially offset by the improved contribution from increased net sales. Food Solutions Segment Operating Profit 2007 compared with 2006 The decrease in operating profit as a percentage of this segments net sales in 2007 compared with 2006 was primarily due to the impact of higher marketing, administrative and development expenses discussed above, including expenses related to new product development. This segment experienced higher input costs in 2007 compared with 2006, but this was offset by the improved contribution from increased net sales, including favorable product/mix. 2006 compared with 2005 The decrease in operating profit as a percentage of this segments net sales in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily attributable to higher input costs, including unfavorable average petrochemical based raw material costs of approximately $12.5 million, and the impact of higher marketing, administrative and development expenses previously discussed, including expenses related to new product development. These increases were partially offset by the improved contribution from increased net sales. Protective Packaging Segment Operating Profit 2007 compared with 2006 This segments operating profit as a percentage of this segments net sales in 2007 compared with 2006 remained relatively flat, which was primarily attributable to selling price increases implemented in 2007 and 2006, which helped offset higher input costs, including unfavorable average petrochemical based raw material costs of approximately $3.0 million, and the impact of higher marketing, administrative and development expenses discussed above. 2006 compared with 2005 The increase in operating profit as a percentage of this segments net sales in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily attributable to selling price increases implemented in 2006 on select products, primarily in North America and, to a lesser extent, Europe, and improved performance in North America and Europe based on management actions taken to improve profitability, which helped offset higher input costs. Other Operating Profit 2007 compared with 2006 The decrease in operating profit as a percentage of Other net sales in 2007 compared with 2006 was primarily due to higher marketing, administrative and development expenses discussed above, of which $1.7 million was associated with the Companys majority ownership in Biosphere. 2006 compared to 2005 The increase in operating profit as a percentage of Other net sales in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales previously discussed, which offset higher input costs, including unfavorable petrochemical based raw material costs of approximately $3.0 million. Interest Expense Interest expense includes the stated interest rate on the Companys outstanding debt, as well as the effects of interest rate swaps and the amortization of capitalized senior debt issuance costs, bond discounts and terminated treasury locks. Interest expense for the three years ended December 31, 2007 was as follows (dollars in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Interest expense $ 140.6 $ 148.0 $ 149.7 33 2007 compared with 2006 The decrease in interest expense in 2007 compared with 2006 was primarily due to the following: a $7.2 million decrease due to the retirement of the Companys 5.625% euro notes in July 2006; a decrease of $4.3 million related to higher capitalized interest during the construction of capital investment projects in 2007 compared with 2006; partially offset by; an increase of $1.8 million as a result of additional expense related to the compounding of interest on the amount payable pursuant to the asbestos settlement agreement; and an increase of $1.2 million due to the impact of higher interest rates on the Companys $300.0 million of outstanding interest rate swaps entered into to effectively convert its 5.375% senior notes due April 2008 into floating rate debt. 2006 compared with 2005 The decrease in interest expense in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily due to the following: a $7.5 million decrease due to the retirement of the Companys 5.625% euro notes in July 2006, and a decrease of $1.8 million related to higher capitalized interest during the construction of capital investment projects in 2006 compared with 2005; partially offset by; an increase of $5.0 million due to the impact of higher interest rates on the Companys $300.0 million of outstanding interest rate swaps entered into to effectively convert its 5.375% senior notes due April 2008 into floating rate debt; and an increase of $1.7 million caused by additional expense related to the compounding of interest on the amount payable pursuant to the asbestos settlement agreement. Gain on Sale of Equity Method Investment On February 9, 2007, the Company sold its 50% investment in PolyMask Corporation to its joint venture partner, 3M Company (the "PolyMask transaction"). The joint venture was formed in 1991 between the Company and 3M to produce and sell non packaging surface protection films. Prior to the sale, the Company accounted for this joint venture under the equity method of accounting. The Company received an aggregate cash amount of $36.0 million for the transaction and other related assets and recorded a pre tax gain of $35.3 million ($22.4 million after tax) in the first quarter of 2007. This gain was reflected as a gain on sale of equity method investment on the Companys consolidated statements of operations. The Companys proportionate share of PolyMask Corporations net income was $0.4 million in 2007, $3.9 million in 2006 and $2.6 million in 2005 and was included in other income, net, on the consolidated statements of operations. The Companys investment in this joint venture was not material to the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. Other Income, Net The following table provides details of the Companys other income, net: 2007 2006 2005 Interest and dividend income $ 19.9 $ 16.8 $ 11.1 Net foreign exchange transaction loss (6.4 ) (4.1 ) (4.7 ) Asbestos settlement and related costs (0.7 ) (1.6 ) (2.2 ) Advisory expenses incurred prior to ceasing work on an acquisition (7.5 ) Loss on sale of small product line (6.8 ) Gain on termination of forward starting interest rate swaps 3.7 Other, net 9.8 10.9 11.7 Other income, net $ 12.0 $ 22.0 $ 15.9 Interest and dividend income increased in 2007 compared with 2006 and 2005 primarily due to higher interest rates on the Companys investments and to a lesser extent higher cash balances. See Note 12, 34 "Derivatives and Hedging Activities," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the gain on termination of forward starting interest rate swaps. Income Taxes The Companys effective income tax rate was 22.6% for 2007, 31.5% for 2006 and 32.1% for 2005. The Company expects an effective income tax rate of approximately 31.0% for 2008. The Companys income tax expense in 2007 includes the impact of a net reversal of tax accruals of $42.2 million including $13.2 million for related interest, for uncertainties that did not materialize following the completion of tax audits and the expiration of relevant statutes of limitations. This reversal includes multiple jurisdictions and multiple tax years up to and including the year 2003. This reversal reduced the Companys effective income tax rate by 9.3%. For 2007, the effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35.0% primarily due to the reversal of the tax accruals and related interest noted above and, to a lesser extent, the lower net effective income tax rate on foreign earnings, partially offset by state income taxes. For 2006 and 2005, the effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35.0% primarily due to the lower net effective income tax rate on foreign earnings, partially offset by the effect of state income taxes. On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes." As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the Company recognized no change in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. At December 31, 2007, the Company classified $8.1 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet, which were previously classified as income taxes payable before the adoption of FIN 48. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the future period or periods of cash settlement of these liabilities. See Note 15, "Income Taxes," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Liquidity and Capital Resources The discussion that follows contains: a description of the Companys material commitments and contingencies, a description of the Companys principal sources of liquidity, a description of the Companys outstanding indebtedness, an analysis of the Companys historical cash flows and changes in working capital, a description of the Companys derivative financial instruments, and a description of changes in the Companys shareholders equity. Material Commitments and Contingencies Asbestos Settlement; Commitments Related to the Cryovac Transaction The Company recorded a charge of $850.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, of which $512.5 million is to be utilized for a cash payment that the Company is required to make upon the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy of W. R. Grace & Co. The Company did not use cash in any period with respect to this liability, and the Company cannot predict when it will be required to make this payment. The Company currently expects to fund this payment by using a combination of accumulated cash and future cash flows from operations and funds available under its $500.0 million senior unsecured multi currency credit facility or its accounts receivable securitization program, both described below, or a combination of these alternatives. The cash payment of $512.5 million accrues interest at a 5.5% annual rate, which is compounded annually, from December 21, 2002 to the date of payment. The Company has recorded this accrued interest in other current liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets, and these amounts were $158.4 million at December 31, 2007 and $123.5 million at December 31, 2006. 35  The Company is subject to other contingencies related to the Cryovac transaction. Note 16, "Commitments and Contingencies," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, describes these contingencies under "Contingencies Related to the Cryovac Transaction" and is incorporated herein by reference. Compliance Matters The information set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K in Note 16, "Commitments and Contingencies," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption "Compliance Matters" is incorporated herein by reference. Contractual Commitments The following table summarizes the Companys principal contractual obligations and sets forth the amounts of required cash outlays in 2008 and future years (amounts in millions): Payments Due by Year Contractual Obligations Total 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Short term borrowings $ 36.5 $ 36.5 $ $ $ Current portion of long term debt exclusive of debt discounts and interest rate swap adjustments 305.9 305.9 Long term debt, exclusive of debt discounts and interest rate swap adjustments 1,534.3 678.3 5.5 850.5 Total debt(1)(2) 1,876.7 342.4 678.3 5.5 850.5 Operating leases 125.3 28.8 41.2 27.3 28.0 Cash portion of the asbestos settlement, including accrued interest at December 31, 2007(3) 670.9 670.9 First quarter 2008 quarterly cash dividend declared 19.4 19.4 Other principal contractual obligations 178.6 115.0 52.5 11.1 Total contractual cash obligations $ 2,870.9 $ 1,176.5 $ 772.0 $ 43.9 $ 878.5 (1)Includes principal maturities (at face value) only. (2)The 2010 period includes the 3% convertible senior notes since the holders of these notes have the option to require the Company to repurchase the senior notes on June 30 of 2010, 2013, 2018, 2023 and 2028. See Note 11, "Debt and Credit Facilities," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (3)This liability is reflected as a current liability due to the uncertainty of the timing of payment. Interest accrues on this amount at a rate of 5.5% per annum, compounded annually, until it becomes due and payable. Current Portion of Long Term Debt and Long Term Debt The debt shown in the above table excludes unamortized bond discounts and interest rate swap adjustments as of December 31, 2007 and therefore represents the principal amount of the debt required to be repaid in each period. Operating Leases The Company is obligated under the terms of various operating leases covering some of the facilities that it occupies and some production equipment. The contractual operating lease obligations listed in the table above represent estimated future minimum annual rental commitments under non cancelable real and personal property leases as of December 31, 2007. Asbestos Settlement The asbestos settlement is described more fully in "Asbestos Settlement; Commitments Related to the Cryovac Transaction," above. Other Principal Contractual Obligations Other principal contractual obligations include agreements to purchase an estimated amount of goods, including raw materials, or services in the normal course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the purchase. 36 Liability for Unrecognized Tax Benefits At December 31, 2007, the Company had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest of $8.1 million, which is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2007, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the future period or periods of cash settlement of these liabilities. See Note 15, "Income Taxes," for further discussion. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has reviewed its off balance sheet arrangements and has determined that none of those arrangements have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Interest Payments The Company currently expects to pay from $97.0 million to $107.0 million in interest payments in 2008, including the impact of interest rate swap transactions. The actual interest paid in 2008 may be different from this amount if interest rates change or if the Company repurchases existing indebtedness or incurs indebtedness under its existing lines of credit or otherwise. These 2008 expected interest payments do not reflect payment of any accrued interest related to the asbestos settlement. Income Tax Payments The Company currently expects to pay between $171.0 million and $181.0 million in income taxes in 2008, assuming it does not make the asbestos settlement payment in 2008. Contributions to Defined Benefit Pension Plans The Company maintains defined benefit pension plans for a limited number of its U.S. employees and for some of its non U.S. employees. The Company currently expects employer contributions to be $8.1 million in 2008. Environmental Matters The Company is subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations, and it accrues for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. These accruals do not take into account any discounting for the time value of money and are not reduced by potential insurance recoveries, if any. The Company does not believe that it is reasonably possible that its liability in excess of the amounts that it has accrued for environmental matters will be material to its consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets or cash flows. The Company reassesses environmental liabilities whenever circumstances become better defined or it can better estimate remediation efforts and their costs. The Company evaluates these liabilities periodically based on available information, including the progress of remedial investigations at each site, the current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible parties. As some of these issues are decided (the outcomes of which are subject to uncertainties) or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated, the Company adjusts the recorded accruals, as necessary. The Company believes that these exposures are not material to its consolidated results of operations, balance sheets or cash flows. The Company believes that it has adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures. Principal Sources of Liquidity The Companys principal sources of liquidity are accumulated cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, cash flows from operations and amounts available under its existing lines of credit described below, including the credit facility, the ANZ facility and its accounts receivable securitization program. 37 Cash and Cash Equivalents and Short Term Investments Available for Sale Securities The following table summarizes the Companys accumulated cash and cash equivalents and short term investments (dollars in millions): December 31, % Change 2007 2006 Cash and cash equivalents $ 430.3 $ 373.1 15.3 % Short term investments available for sale securities(1) 33.9 100.0 % Total $ 430.3 $ 407.0 5.7 % (1)See Note 5, "Available for Sale Investments," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which describes the change in the Companys available for sale investments. Cash Flows from Operations The Company generates substantial cash flows from operations and expects that it will continue to generate substantial cash flows from operations. See "Analysis of Historical Cash Flows" below. Lines of Credit The following table summarizes the Companys available lines of credit and committed and uncommitted lines of credit, including the credit facility and the ANZ facility discussed below, at December 31, 2007 and 2006: December 31, 2007 2006 Used lines of credit $ 46.4 $ 30.4 Unused lines of credit 823.8 810.6 Total available lines of credit $ 870.2 $ 841.0 Available lines of credit committed $ 646.0 $ 632.9 Available lines of credit uncommitted 224.2 208.1 Total available lines of credit $ 870.2 $ 841.0 The Companys principal credit lines were committed and consisted of the credit facility and the ANZ facility. The Company is not subject to any material compensating balance requirements in connection with its lines of credit. Revolving Credit Facilities The Credit Facility The Company has not borrowed under its $500.0 million unsecured multi currency revolving credit facility since its inception in July 2005. This facility contains a provision under which the Company was permitted to request, prior to each of the first and second anniversaries of the facility, a one year extension of the termination of the facility. The Company requested and obtained extensions effective on the facilitys first two anniversaries. Accordingly, effective July 26, 2007, the expiration date of the facility was extended to July 24, 2012. On June 13, 2007, the Company entered into a letter amendment to the credit facility. As a result of this amendment, amounts outstanding under the credit facility are no longer guaranteed by the Companys principal U.S. operating subsidiaries. The release of the subsidiary guarantees under the credit facility resulted in the contractual release of subsidiary guarantees of the Companys senior notes and amounts outstanding under the ANZ Facility. The credit facility is available for general corporate purposes including the payment of a portion of the $512.5 million cash payment, plus accrued interest (which was $158.4 million at December 31, 2007), required to be paid upon the effectiveness of an appropriate plan of reorganization in the W. R. 38 Grace & Co. bankruptcy. See Note 11, "Debt and Credit Facilities," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on this credit facility. ANZ Facility The Company has an Australian dollar 170 million, dual currency revolving credit facility, known as the ANZ facility, equivalent to U.S. $146 million at December 31, 2007, due March 2010. A syndicate of banks made this facility available to a group of the Companys Australian and New Zealand subsidiaries for general corporate purposes including refinancing of previously outstanding indebtedness. The Company may re borrow amounts repaid under the ANZ facility from time to time prior to the expiration or earlier termination of the facility. The Company borrowed under the ANZ facility during the second quarter of 2006, but it repaid those amounts in full and did not borrow further under the ANZ facility during 2006 or 2007. There were no amounts outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2007 or at December 31, 2006. See Note 11, "Debt and Credit Facilities," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this facility. Other Lines of Credit Substantially all the Companys short term borrowings of $36.5 million at December 31, 2007 and $20.2 million at December 31, 2006 were outstanding under lines of credit available to several of the Companys foreign subsidiaries. The weighted average interest rate on these outstanding lines of credit was 11.0% at December 31, 2007 and 12.5% at December 31, 2006. Amounts available under these credit lines were $214.2 million ($177.8 million unused) at December 31, 2007 and $198.0 million ($177.8 million unused) at December 31, 2006. Accounts Receivable Securitization Program In December 2001, the Company and a group of its U.S. subsidiaries entered into an accounts receivable securitization program with a bank and an issuer of commercial paper administered by the bank. This program had an original expiration date of December 31, 2004, which was extended on that date for an additional three years. On December 7, 2007, the parties (including an additional party in 2007) extended this program for an additional term of five years ending December 7, 2012. This receivables program contains financial covenants relating to interest coverage and debt leverage. The Company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2007. The Companys receivables funding subsidiary did not sell any receivables interests under the receivables program during 2007, and therefore the Company did not remove any related amounts from the consolidated assets reflected on the Companys consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2007. See Note 6, "Accounts Receivable Securitization Program," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning this receivables program. Debt Ratings The Companys cost of capital and ability to obtain external financing may be affected by its debt ratings, which the credit rating agencies review periodically. The Companys long term senior unsecured debt is currently rated Baa3 (stable outlook) by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. and BBB (negative outlook) by Standard & Poors, a division of The McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. These ratings are among the ratings assigned by each of these organizations for investment grade long term senior unsecured debt. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 39 Outstanding Indebtedness At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Companys total debt outstanding consisted of the amounts set forth in the following table: December 31, 2007 2006 Short term borrowings $ 36.5 $ 20.2 Current portion of long term debt 303.7 5.5 Total current debt 340.2 25.7 Total long term debt, less current portion 1,531.6 1,826.6 Total debt $ 1,871.8 $ 1,852.3 The Companys current portion of long term debt increased at December 31, 2007 due to the reclassification of the 5.375% senior notes with a face value of $300.0 million as a current liability, since these senior notes mature in April 2008. The Company intends to use available cash and other committed liquidity sources to retire this debt when it matures. Senior Notes Included in the Companys long term debt is approximately $1,505.8 million of senior notes with various maturities. The next maturity will be the Companys 5.375% senior notes that mature in April 2008. See Note 11, "Debt and Credit Facilities," of Notes to Financial Statements for additional information on the Companys debt. Analysis of Historical Cash Flows The following table summarizes the Companys changes in cash flows for the three years ended December 31, 2007 (dollars in millions): 2007 2006 2005 2007 vs. 2006 % Change 2006 vs. 2005 % Change Net cash provided by operating activities $ 378.1 $ 432.9 $ 363.3 (12.7 )% 19.2 % Net cash used in investing activities (274.1 ) (202.5 ) (88.9 ) (35.4 )% # Net cash used in financing activities (59.5 ) (350.0 ) (118.4 ) (83.0 )% # #Denotes a variance greater than 100.0% Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 2007 compared with 2006 The $54.8 million decrease in cash provided from operating activities was primarily due to the following factors: a decrease in cash generated from receivables, net, of $13.5 million primarily due to the increase in international net sales and the generally longer trade payment cycles outside the U.S. The decrease in cash generated from receivables was also due to an increase of $8.6 million for value added tax receivables related to the Companys international business; an increase in cash used for inventory of $15.7 million primarily due to higher inventory levels to support international sales growth; and an increase in cash used for other current liabilities of $77.7 million, primarily due to $49.2 million of cash used for income tax payments. Income tax payments were $201.8 million in 2007 compared with $152.6 million in 2006; partially offset by; an increase in net earnings adjusted for non cash activity of $67.7 million. 40  2006 compared with 2005 The $69.6 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily attributable to the following: an increase in cash generated from accounts receivable, net, of $29.3 million in 2006 primarily due to higher cash collections during 2006 that exceeded the increase in net sales. In addition, during 2006 there was increased cash received from vendor rebates receivable; an increase in accrued restructuring costs in 2006 due to the recording of $11.8 million of restructuring charges related to the global manufacturing strategy, partially offset by $4.5 million in cash payments in 2006 related to the 2004 restructuring program and the 2006 global manufacturing strategy charge. Cash payments related to the 2004 restructuring program made in 2005 were $16.8 million; an increase in income taxes payable in 2006 due to a higher income tax provision; an increase in accrued payroll in 2006 partially due to higher management incentive compensation; and the timing of other receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business; These increases were partially offset by an increase in cash used for inventory in 2006 due to higher resin costs affecting all categories of inventory and higher raw material quantities purchased in 2006. Raw material inventory quantities were lower in 2005 in part due to the storm related depletion of the Companys resin supplies. In addition, higher inventories were needed in 2006 to support the Companys global manufacturing strategy as projects began to shift production consistent with the Companys centers of excellence approach. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 2007 compared with 2006 The $71.6 million increase in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to the following: an increase of $42.9 million in capital expenditures in 2007. Capital expenditures were $210.8 million in 2007, which included $58.5 million related to the Companys global manufacturing strategy. Capital expenditures were $167.9 million in 2006, which included $14.2 million related to the Companys global manufacturing strategy; $43.3 million of cash used for acquisitions of intangible assets primarily consisting of certain assets relating to polyethylene foam product lines; an increase in net purchases of available for sale securities of $20.9 million in 2007; and an increase of $7.2 million of cash used in other investing activities, primarily due to the Companys investment in the Teknik Plastik joint venture in September 2007; partially offset by; $36.0 million of cash received in 2007 for the PolyMask transaction; and a reduction in cash used for businesses acquired of $20.4 million in 2007, primarily due to the Company using an aggregate of $32.9 million of cash to acquire Alga Plastics in August 2007 and Pack Tiger in January 2007 and $51.7 million of cash to acquire Nelipak in January 2006 and Entapack in July 2006. 2006 compared with 2005 The $113.6 million increase in net cash used for investing activities in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily due to the following: $53.3 million of cash used to complete acquisitions in 2006 of which $41.2 million was for the acquisition of Nelipak on January 3, 2006; and 41 an increase of $71.0 million in capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were $167.9 million in 2006 compared with $96.9 million in 2005. The increase in capital expenditures in 2006 compared with 2005 was due to investments in capacity expansion and in new technologies related to the Companys centers of excellence approach as well as global manufacturing strategy capital expenditures of $14.2 million. The Company expects to continue to invest capital as it deems appropriate to expand its business, to replace depreciating property, plant and equipment, to acquire new manufacturing technology and to improve productivity. Taking into account expected capital expenditures in 2008 of approximately $70.0 million for the Companys global manufacturing strategy, the Company expects total capital expenditures in 2008 to be approximately $200.0 million. This projection is based upon the Companys capital expenditure budget for 2008, the status of approved but not yet completed capital projects, anticipated future projects including the implementation of the Companys global manufacturing strategy and historic spending trends. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities 2007 compared with 2006 The $290.5 million decrease in cash used for financing activities was primarily due to the following: net debt proceeds of $11.4 million in 2007 compared with net debt repayments of $251.8 million in 2006. Net debt proceeds in 2007 include net proceeds from short term borrowings of $15.8 million, partially offset by the net repayment of $4.4 million of long term debt. The net debt repayments in 2006 primarily consist of $251.7 million due to the retirement of the 5.625% Euro notes in July 2006 and repayment of $8.0 million of the debt assumed in the Nelipak acquisition, partially offset by net proceeds from long term debt of $23.6 million; a decrease in cash used in 2007 for the repurchase of the Companys common stock, as discussed in "Repurchases of Capital Stock" below. Cash used was $6.8 million in 2007, compared with $52.4 million in 2006; partially offset by; higher cash payments for dividends on the Companys common stock of $16.0 million in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily due to the increase in the cash dividend per common share in 2007 as previously discussed in "Recent Events." The Company used cash of $64.6 million in 2007 to pay its quarterly cash dividends compared with $48.6 million in 2006. 2006 compared with 2005 The $231.6 million increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily due to the following: $251.7 million of cash used to retire the Companys 5.625% euro notes on July 19, 2006; and $48.6 million of cash used in 2006 to pay dividends on the Companys common stock; partially offset by; a decrease in cash used in 2006 for the repurchase of shares of the Companys common stock, as discussed in "Repurchases of Capital Stock" below. Cash used in 2006 was $52.4 million compared with $116.4 million of cash used in 2005. Repurchases of Capital Stock During 2007, the Company repurchased 216,000 shares of its common stock, par value $0.10 per share, in open market purchases at a cost of $6.8 million. The average price per share of these common stock repurchases was $31.58. During 2006, the Company repurchased 2,098,400 shares of its common stock in open market purchases at a cost of $52.4 million. The average price per share of these common stock repurchases was $24.95. In 2005, the Company repurchased 4,860,400 shares of its common stock, par value $0.10 per share, in open market purchases at a cost of $116.4 million in 2005. The average price per share of 42 these common stock repurchases in 2005 was $23.94. All repurchases have been adjusted for the two for one stock split in March 2007. Share repurchases were made under a program previously adopted by the Companys Board of Directors. The share repurchase program authorized the repurchase of up to 33,954,294 shares (as adjusted for the two for one stock split) of common stock, which included the Companys Series A convertible preferred stock on an as converted basis prior to its redemption in 2003. Prior to the programs termination on August 9, 2007 described below, the Company had repurchased 30,969,142 shares (as adjusted for the two for one stock split) of common stock and preferred stock on an as converted basis, and the remaining repurchase authorization covered 2,985,152 shares (as adjusted for the two for one stock split) of common stock. On August 9, 2007, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had approved a new share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to repurchase in the aggregate up to 20 million shares of its issued and outstanding common stock. The new program replaced the Companys prior share repurchase program discussed above, which was terminated. Through December 31, 2007, the Company had not repurchased any shares of the Companys common stock under the new program, leaving the entire 20 million shares of common stock authorized for repurchase under the program. The new program has no set expiration date, and the Company may from time to time continue to repurchase its common stock. Changes in Working Capital At December 31, 2007, working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $194.5 million compared with $350.6 million at December 31, 2006. The $156.1 million, or 44.5%, decrease in the Companys working capital during 2007 resulted primarily from the following: the reclassification of the outstanding balance of the 5.375% senior notes with a face value of $300.0 million as a current liability due to the senior notes maturing in April 2008; the reclassification of available for sale securities of $40.8 million to non current assets in 2007. See Note 5, "Available for Sale Investments," for further discussion; an increase in accrued interest of $34.2 million during 2007 related to the Companys liability under the asbestos settlement agreement; an increase in accounts payable of $32.4 million during 2007, primarily due to the timing of payments and foreign currency translation of $12.2 million; and an increase in short term borrowings of $16.3 million in 2007; partially offset by; an increase in inventory of $72.3 million in 2007 primarily due to higher inventory levels of $46.4 million to support international sales growth and foreign currency translation of $42.9 million. In the first nine months of 2007, inventory levels increased $73.6 million to support international sales growth. This increase was partially offset by a reduction of $22.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, which was attributable to the Companys supply chain initiative to improve cash to cash cycle time and reduce logistics costs; an increase in receivables, net, of $68.5 million in 2007 primarily due to foreign currency translation of $39.6 million and $27.0 million from the Companys international sales growth including generally longer trade payment cycles outside the U.S. The increase also includes $8.6 million related to the Companys value added tax receivables reflecting the Companys international presence; an increase of $57.2 million in cash and cash equivalents in 2007 primarily due to cash flow generated from operations; and a decrease in income taxes payable of $78.2 million in 2007 principally due to the following factors: income tax payments of $201.8 million in 2007; and the classification of $11.8 million of tax liabilities in non current liabilities, of which $8.1 million was due to the required adoption of FIN 48. See Note 15, "Income Taxes," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information; 43 partially offset by; the current year income tax provision of $131.5 million. Current and Quick Ratios The ratio of current assets to current liabilities, known as the current ratio, was 1.1 at December 31, 2007 and 1.2 at December 31, 2006. The ratio of current assets less inventory to current liabilities, known as the quick ratio, was 0.8 at December 31, 2007 and 0.9 at December 31, 2006. Derivative Financial Instruments Interest Rate Swaps The information set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K in Note 12, "Derivatives and Hedging Activities," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption "Interest Rate Swaps" is incorporated herein by reference. Foreign Currency Forward Contracts At December 31, 2007, the Company was party to foreign currency forward contracts, which did not have a significant impact on the Companys liquidity. The information set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K in Note 12, "Derivatives and Hedging Activities," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption "Foreign Currency Forward Contracts" is incorporated herein by reference. For further discussion about these contracts and other financial instruments, see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." Shareholders Equity The Companys shareholders equity was $2,019.6 million at December 31, 2007 and $1,654.8 million at December 31, 2006. Shareholders equity increased $364.8 million, or 22.0%, in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to the following: net earnings of $353.0 million in 2007; and positive foreign currency translation of $66.7 million in 2007; partially offset by; dividends paid on common stock of $64.6 million in 2007. Recently Issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, Accounting Guidance and Disclosure Requirements The Company is subject to numerous recently issued statements of financial accounting standards, accounting guidance and disclosure requirements. Note 21, "Recent Accounting Pronouncements," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, describes these new accounting pronouncements and the Companys application of the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 and is incorporated herein by reference. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Companys discussion and analysis of its consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on all available evidence, including historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. To derive these estimates and assumptions, management draws from those available sources that can best contribute to its efforts. These sources include the Companys officers and other employees, outside 44 consultants and legal counsel, experts and actuaries. In addition, the Company uses internally generated reports and statistics, such as aging of accounts receivable, as well as outside sources such as government statistics, industry reports and third party research studies. The results of these estimates and assumptions may form the basis of the carrying value of assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from estimates under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, and any such differences may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company believes the following accounting policies are critical to its business operations and the understanding of its consolidated results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. The critical accounting policies discussed below should be read together with the Companys significant accounting policies set forth in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts In the normal course of business, the Company extends credit to its customers if they satisfy pre defined credit criteria. The Company maintains an accounts receivable allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of its customers to make required payments. An additional allowance may be required if the financial condition of the Companys customers deteriorates. The allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that management assesses to be appropriate to absorb estimated losses in the accounts receivable portfolio. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed quarterly, and changes to the allowance are made through the provision for bad debts, which is included in marketing, administrative and development expenses on the Companys consolidated statements of operations. These changes may reflect changes in economic, business and market conditions. The allowance is increased by the provision for bad debts and decreased by the amount of charge offs, net of recoveries. The provision for bad debts charged against operating results is based on several factors including, but not limited to, a regular assessment of the collectibility of specific customer balances, the length of time a receivable is past due and the Companys historical experience with its customers. In circumstances where a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations is known, the Company records a specific provision for bad debt against amounts due thereby reducing the receivable to the amount the Company reasonably assesses will be collected. If circumstances change, such as higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customers ability to pay, the Companys estimates of recoverability could be reduced by a material amount. Commitments and Contingencies Litigation On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses the potential liabilities and costs related to any lawsuits or claims brought against it. The Company accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Litigation proceedings are evaluated on a case by case basis considering the available information, including that received from internal and outside legal counsel, to assess potential outcomes. While it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions, the Company uses its best judgment to determine if it is probable that it will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, the Company considers insurance recoveries, if any. The Company expenses legal costs, including those legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred. The Company has in the past adjusted existing accruals as proceedings have continued, been settled or otherwise provided further information on which the Company could review the likelihood of outflows of resources and their measurability, and the Company expects to do so in future periods. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery, it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that the Company has previously made. Impairment of Long Lived Assets The determination of the value of long lived assets requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company periodically reviews long lived assets, other than goodwill, for impairment whenever there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Goodwill, in accordance with SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangibles," is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. A review of goodwill may be initiated prior to conducting the annual analysis if there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. 45 Assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses, such as future cash flows, which are based on operational performance, market conditions, and other factors, and disposition costs, may affect the carrying value of long lived assets and possible impairment expense in the Companys consolidated financial statements. If assumptions and estimates change in the future, the Company may be required to record an impairment charge. Self Insurance The Company retains the obligation for specified claims and losses related to property, casualty, workers compensation and employee benefit claims. The Company accrues for outstanding reported claims and claims that have been incurred but not reported based upon managements estimates of the aggregate liability for retained losses using historical experience, insurance company estimates and the estimated trends in claim values. The Companys estimates include managements and independent insurance companies assumptions regarding economic conditions, the frequency and severity of claims and claim development patterns and settlement practices. These estimates and assumptions are monitored and evaluated on a periodic basis by management and are adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances. Although management believes it has the ability to adequately project and record estimated claim payments, actual results could differ significantly from the recorded liabilities. Pensions The Company maintains a non contributory profit sharing plan and a contributory thrift and retirement savings plan in which most U.S. employees of the Company are eligible to participate. For a limited number of its U.S. employees and for some of its international employees, the Company maintains defined benefit pension plans. The Company accounts for these pension plans in accordance with SFAS No. 158, "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans." Under this accounting standard, the Company makes assumptions regarding the valuation of projected benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. The projected benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost are based on third party actuarial assumptions and estimates that are reviewed by management on an annual basis. The principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation, the expected future rate of return on plan assets and the expected rate of future compensation increases. The Company revises these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of long term trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits. In determining the discount rate, the Company utilizes market conditions and other data sources management considers reasonable based upon the profile of the remaining service life of eligible employees. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration the weighted average expected return on the Companys asset allocation, asset return data, historical return data, and the current economic environment. The Company believes these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions of the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. The rate of compensation increase is based on the Companys long term plans for such increases. The measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is December 31. At December 31, 2007, the projected benefit obligation for U.S. pension plans was $44.5 million and the net periodic benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $2.9 million. At December 31, 2007, the projected benefit obligation for international pension plans was $306.6 million and the net periodic benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $12.1 million. In general, material changes to the principal assumptions could have a material impact on the costs and liabilities recorded under SFAS No. 158. A 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate and a 100 basis point change in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in the following increases (decreases) on the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 and the expected net periodic benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 2008 (in millions). 25 Basis Point Increase 25 Basis Point Decrease United States Discount Rate Effect on projected benefit obligation $ (1.5 ) $ 1.5 Effect on net periodic benefit cost (0.2 ) 0.2 46 100 Basis Point Increase 100 Basis Point Decrease Return on Assets Effect on net periodic benefit cost $ (0.4 ) $ 0.4 25 Basis Point Increase 25 Basis Point Decrease International Discount Rate Effect on projected benefit obligation $ (18.9 ) $ 20.9 Effect on net periodic benefit cost (1.2 ) 1.4 100 Basis Point Increase 100 Basis Point Decrease Return on Assets Effect on net periodic benefit cost $ (2.4 ) $ 2.4 Income Taxes Estimates and judgments are required in the calculation of tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets. The Companys deferred tax assets arise from net deductible temporary differences and tax benefit carry forwards. The Company evaluates whether its taxable earnings during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carry forwards may be utilized should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits. For those jurisdictions where the expiration dates of tax benefit carry forwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely, the Company provides a valuation allowance. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company estimates future taxable earnings, with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax benefit carry forwards and past operating results, to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future. Changes to tax laws, statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings can have an impact on valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods, the Company may need to adjust the valuation allowance, which could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In calculating its worldwide provision for income taxes, the Company also evaluates its tax positions for years where the statutes of limitations have not expired. Based on this review, the Company may establish reserves for additional taxes and interest that could be assessed upon examination by relevant tax authorities. The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, including the results of tax audits and changes in tax law. If the payment of additional taxes and interest ultimately proves unnecessary, the reversal of the reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the reserves are no longer necessary. If an estimate of tax reserves proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to income tax provision would result. These adjustments to reserves and related expenses could materially affect the Companys consolidated financial statements. 47  On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48. Under FIN 48, the Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with tax authorities. See Note 15, "Income Taxes," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Educational Donation During the second quarter of 2006, the Company donated $1.5 million to the Harvard Business School in partial funding of a professorship in the name of T. J. Dermot Dunphy. Mr. Dunphy, a director of the Company, was Chief Executive Officer of the Company from March 1971 until his retirement in February 2000. He received a Masters degree in Business Administration from the school in 1956. Non GAAP Information The Companys management from time to time presents information that does not conform to U.S. GAAP, including changes in net sales excluding the effects of foreign currency translation, the sale of a small product line and certain sales related to acquisitions. The Companys management uses changes in net sales excluding the effects of foreign currency translation, the sale of a minor product line and certain sales related to acquisitions to measure the performance of the Companys operations and to aid in the comparison of results. Thus, management believes that this information may be useful to investors. Such measures are also among the criteria upon which performance based compensation may be determined. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which may adversely affect its consolidated financial condition and results of operations. The Company seeks to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company does not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rates From time to time, the Company may use interest rate swaps, collars or options to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. The Companys interest rate swaps are described in Note 12, "Derivatives and Hedging Activities," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and in "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Derivative Financial Instruments Interest Rate Swaps" contained in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had no collars or options outstanding. The carrying value of the Companys total debt, which includes the impact of outstanding interest rate swaps, was $1,871.8 million at December 31, 2007 and $1,852.3 million at December 31, 2006. The Companys fixed rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, was $1,526.1 million at December 31, 2007 and $1,531.4 million at December 31, 2006. The fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt varies with changes in interest rates. Generally, the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The estimated fair value of the Companys total debt, including the impact of outstanding interest rate swaps, was $1,818.4 million at December 31, 2007 compared with $1,885.9 million at December 31, 2006. A hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates would result in an increase of $77.0 million in the fair value of the total debt balance at December 31, 2007. These changes in the fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt do not alter the Companys obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount of such debt. 48 Foreign Exchange Rates The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to fix the amount payable on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates at December 31, 2007 would have caused the Company to pay approximately $20.1 million to terminate these contracts. The Companys foreign currency forward contracts are described in Note 12, "Derivatives and Hedging Activities," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is contained in Part II, Item 8 and in "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Derivative Financial Instruments Foreign Currency Forward Contracts" contained in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The Company may use other derivative instruments from time to time, such as foreign exchange options to manage exposure due to foreign exchange rates and interest rate and currency swaps related to access to additional sources of international financing. These instruments can potentially limit foreign exchange exposure and limit or adjust interest rate exposure by swapping borrowings denominated in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had no foreign exchange options or interest rate and currency swap agreements outstanding. The Companys outstanding debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing subsidiary. The Company believes that this enables it to better match operating cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match the currency of assets and liabilities. The amount of outstanding debt denominated in a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar was $49.2 million at December 31, 2007 and $34.4 million at December 31, 2006. Investments The Companys available for sale investments are exposed to market risk related to changes in conditions in the U.S. financial markets. As a result of liquidity conditions affecting capital markets, particularly in the U.S., specifically for asset backed securities, every auction for the auction rate securities held by the Company over the last several months of 2007 failed. The Company believes that this is indicative of the severe pressure from the sub prime lending collapse that began in 2007, rather than specific concerns with respect to the issuers of the auction rate securities or the securities themselves. The Companys available for sale investments are described in Note 5, "Available for Sale Investments," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Commodities The Company uses various commodity raw materials such as plastic resins and energy products such as electric power and natural gas in conjunction with its manufacturing processes. Generally, the Company acquires these components at market prices and does not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices. Moreover, the Companys supply chain team seeks to maintain appropriate levels of commodity raw material inventories thus minimizing the expense and risks of carrying excess inventories. The Company does not typically purchase substantial quantities in advance of production requirements. As a result, the Company is exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components. 49
