(2)In February 2007, the Companys Board of Directors declared a two for one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend. All per share data has been restated to reflect the two for one stock split except shareholders equity. See Note 18, "Net Earnings Per Common Share," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for the reconciliation of the basic and diluted earnings per common share computations. (3)In January 2006, the Company initiated the payment of quarterly cash dividends. In February 2007, the Companys Board of Directors increased the Companys quarterly cash dividend by 33% to $0.20 per common share, declaring a quarterly cash dividend payable on the pre split shares of the Companys common stock. In February of 2008, the Companys Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend by 20.0% to $0.12 per common share. See Note 17, "Shareholders Equity," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for further discussion. (4)In December 2008, the Company purchased $90.6 million of aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 6.95% Senior Notes due May 2009 in a tender offer, representing approximately 40% of the $227.3 million outstanding 6.95% Senior Notes due May 2009. The Company utilized funds from committed liquidity and available cash to pay the full tender offer consideration, plus accrued interest. Following the purchase, there was a total of $136.7 million in principal amount of these senior notes outstanding. In April 2008, the Companys 5.375% Senior Notes with a face value of $300 million matured. The Company utilized funds from committed liquidity and available cash to retire this debt. Interest on these senior notes was payable semi annually in arrears, with final payment of $8.0 million made upon maturity. In July 2006, the Companys 5.625% euro notes with a face value of &euro;200.0 million matured. The Company used available cash of $251.7 million to repay the euro notes. Interest on the euro notes was payable annually in arrears, with the final payment of $14.2 million made upon maturity. 21 Table of Contents (5)EBIT is defined as earnings before interest expense and income tax provision. EBITDA is defined as EBIT plus depreciation and amortization. EBIT and EBITDA do not purport to represent net earnings or net cash provided by operating activities as those terms are defined under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to such measurements or as indicators of the Companys performance. The Companys definitions of EBIT and EBITDA may not be comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies. EBIT and EBITDA are among the indicators used by the Companys management to measure the performance of the Companys operations, and thus the Companys management believes such information may be useful to investors. Such measures are also among the criteria upon which performance based compensation may be based. The following is a reconciliation of net earnings to EBIT and EBITDA (in millions of dollars): 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 Net earnings $ 179.9 $ 353.0 $ 274.1 $ 255.8 $ 215.6 Add: Interest expense 128.1 140.6 148.0 149.7 153.7 Income tax provision 42.4 103.0 126.0 120.8 107.3 EBIT $ 350.4 $ 596.6 $ 548.1 $ 526.3 $ 476.6 Add: depreciation and amortization 171.5 166.3 168.0 174.6 179.5 EBITDA $ 521.9 $ 762.9 $ 716.1 $ 700.9 $ 656.1 22  Table of Contents  Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The information in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read together with the Companys consolidated financial statements and related notes set forth in Part II, Item 8, as well as the discussion included in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. All amounts and percentages are approximate due to rounding. Overview The Company is a leading global innovator and manufacturer of a wide range of packaging and performance based materials and equipment systems that serve an array of food, industrial, medical and consumer applications. At December 31, 2008, the Company employed approximately 2,600 sales, marketing and customer service personnel throughout the world who sell and market the Companys products through a large number of distributors, fabricators and converters, as well as directly to end users such as food processors, food service businesses, supermarket retailers and manufacturers. The Company has no material long term contracts for the distribution of its products. In 2008, no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10% or more of the Companys consolidated net sales. Although historically net sales of the Companys food packaging, food solutions and protective packaging products have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher in the fourth quarter, the Company does not consider seasonality to be material to its consolidated financial position or results of operations or to its reportable business segments. Competition for most of the Companys packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics, service and price. Competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology and, as a result, the Company maintains ongoing research and development programs to enable it to maintain technological leadership. The Companys net sales are sensitive to developments in its customers business or market conditions, changes in the global economy, and the effects of foreign currency translation. The Companys costs can vary with changes in input costs, including petrochemical related costs, which are not within the Companys control. Consequently, the Companys management focuses on reducing those costs that the Company can control and using petrochemical based raw materials as efficiently as possible. The Company also believes that its global presence helps to insulate it from localized changes in business conditions. The Companys businesses are managed to generate substantial operating cash flow. The Company believes that its operating cash flow will permit it to continue to spend on innovative research and development and to invest in its business by means of capital expenditures for property and equipment and acquisitions. Moreover, its ability to generate substantial operating cash flow should provide the Company with the flexibility to modify its capital structure as the need or opportunity arises. The Companys consolidated results of operations have been unfavorably impacted by the downturn in global economic conditions that began in the U.S. in late 2007 and spread globally through 2008. The combination of a reduction in customers manufacturing output, a decline in retail sales and a rise in customer inventory contraction in the fourth quarter of 2008 have negatively affected the Companys Protective Packaging segments unit volume demand globally through early 2009. The Company currently anticipates that these conditions will persist globally through at least the first half of 2009. Recent Events Senior Notes Issuance In February 2009, the Company completed a private offering of $300.0 million of 12% senior unsecured notes due 2014. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering, in addition to the Companys existing financing facilities and its cash flow from operations, to provide for its 2009 debt obligations, as well the cash payment under the Settlement agreement, if such payment is required in 2009. The Company expects to incur approximately $33.0 million of additional interest expense in 2009 related to these senior notes. Cash Tender Offer for 6.95% Senior Notes In December 2008, the Company announced a cash tender offer to purchase any and all of its outstanding 6.95% Senior Notes due May 15, 2009. The Company completed the purchase of $90.6 million 23 Table of Contents in aggregate principal amount of these notes, representing approximately 40.0% of the outstanding face value of $227.3 million. The Company paid the full tender offer consideration (100% of the principal amount), plus accrued interest, utilizing funds available from the Companys accounts receivable securitization program and available cash. Following this purchase there was a total of $136.7 million in principal amount of the notes outstanding. Cost Reduction and Productivity Program In September 2008, the Company implemented a cost reduction and productivity program. As a result, during 2008 the Company recorded $65.8 million of pre tax charges primarily for termination benefits. The Company expects to incur additional modest costs associated with this program in 2009. Cash payments primarily related to termination benefits began in 2008 with the majority to occur in 2009. Global Manufacturing Strategy In December 2008, in connection with the Companys global manufacturing strategy, the Company announced that it will close its manufacturing facility located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. This facilitys manufacturing operations will be moved to existing Company facilities in North America. The Company plans to complete this project in the second half of 2009, at which time all manufacturing operations at the Cedar Rapids facility will cease. In connection with this project, in December 2008, the Company recorded $12.2 million of pre tax charges primarily related to termination benefits. The Company expects to incur additional associated charges in 2009 and 2010. Quarterly Cash Dividends On February 19, 2009, the Companys Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per common share. This dividend is payable on March 20, 2009 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 6, 2009. The estimated amount of this dividend payment is $18.9 million based on 157.9 million shares of the Companys common stock issued and outstanding as of January 31, 2009. During 2008, the Company paid quarterly cash dividends of $76.4 million from available cash. Highlights of Financial Performance Highlights for 2008 compared with 2007 and 2006 were as follows (dollars in millions except per common share amounts): 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 % Change 2007 vs. 2006 % Change Net sales: U.S. $ 2,185.2 $ 2,118.2 $ 2,066.3 3 % 3 % % of total net sales 45.1 % 45.5 % 47.7 % International 2,658.3 2,533.0 2,261.6 5 12 % of total net sales 54.9 % 54.5 % 52.3 % Total net sales $ 4,843.5 $ 4,651.2 $ 4,327.9 4 % 8 % Gross profit $ 1,236.6 $ 1,301.1 $ 1,240.1 (5 )% 5 % % of total net sales 25.5 % 28.0 % 28.7 % Marketing, administrative and development expenses $ 755.0 $ 750.2 $ 701.1 1 % 7 % % of total net sales 15.6 % 16.1 % 16.2 % Restructuring and other charges. $ 85.1 $ 1.6 $ 12.9 # # Operating profit $ 396.5 $ 549.3 $ 526.1 (28 )% 4 % % of total net sales 8.2 % 11.8 % 12.2 % Net earnings $ 179.9 $ 353.0 $ 274.1 (49 )% 29 % Net earnings per common share: Basic $ 1.14 $ 2.21 $ 1.70 (48 )% 30 % Diluted. $ 0.99 $ 1.89 $ 1.47 (48 )% 29 % #Denotes a change equal to or greater than 100% 24 Table of Contents See below for further details about the changes in net sales by the Companys segment reporting structure and by geographic region and operating profit by the Companys segment reporting structure, and the material factors that contributed to these changes. See "Segments" and "Descriptions of the Reportable Segments and Other" of Part I, Item 1. "Business," for an expanded discussion of the products included in each of the Companys reportable segments and Other. Net Sales The principal factors contributing to changes in net sales in the three years ended December 31, 2008 were changes in unit volume, product mix, average selling prices and the effects of foreign currency translation. In addition, 2008 and 2007 had increased volumes from acquired businesses, net of dispositions. 2008 compared with 2007 Net sales for 2008 increased 4% to $4,843.5 million compared with $4,651.2 million in 2007. The components of the increase in net sales for 2008 compared with 2007 were as follows (dollars in millions): Food Packaging Food Solutions Protective Packaging Other Total Company Volume Units (0.6 )% $ (11.2 ) (1.2 )% $ (11.2 ) (5.4 )% $ (81.6 ) 1.4 % $ 4.5 (2.1 )% $ (99.5 ) Volume Acquired businesses, net of dispositions 0.6 19.4 61.5 1.3 62.1 Product Price/Mix 3.3 62.4 3.1 29.3 1.4 21.4 2.2 7.0 2.5 120.1 Foreign currency translation 1.9 35.3 2.7 25.5 2.2 33.0 5.0 15.8 2.4 109.6 Total 4.6 % $ 86.5 4.6 % $ 43.6 (1.8 )% $ (26.6 ) 28.0 % $ 88.8 4.1 % $ 192.3 Excluding the favorable effect of foreign currency translation, net sales would have increased 2% compared with 2007. The strengthening of most foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar contributed to the favorable foreign currency translation impact on net sales in 2008 compared with 2007. However, this impact includes an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of $65.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most foreign currencies. 2007 compared with 2006 Net sales for 2007 increased 8% to $4,651.2 million compared with $4,327.9 million in 2006. The components of the increase in net sales for 2007 compared with 2006 were as follows (dollars in millions): Food Packaging Food Solutions Protective Packaging Other Total Company Volume Units 3.6 % $ 63.3 4.9 % $ 41.0 (0.1 )% $ (1.8 ) 4.8 % $ 13.0 2.7 % $ 115.5 Volume Acquired businesses, net of dispositions 0.7 5.7 (1.1 ) (15.7 ) 6.1 16.3 0.1 6.3 Product Price/Mix 0.8 12.1 1.1 9.3 0.1 0.6 1.2 3.0 0.6 25.0 Foreign currency translation 3.8 66.9 5.4 45.7 3.2 47.7 6.0 16.2 4.1 176.5 Total 8.2 % $ 142.3 12.1 % $ 101.7 2.1 % $ 30.8 18.1 % $ 48.5 7.5 % $ 323.3 Excluding the favorable effect of foreign currency translation, net sales would have increased 3% compared with 2006. The strengthening of foreign currencies primarily in Europe and the Asia Pacific region against the U.S. dollar contributed $156.3 million of the $176.5 million favorable foreign currency translation impact on net sales in 2007 compared with 2006. 25 Table of Contents Net Sales by the Companys Segment Reporting Structure The following table shows the Companys net sales by the Companys segment reporting structure (dollars in millions): 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 % Change 2007 vs. 2006 % Change Net sales: Food Packaging $ 1,969.4 $ 1,882.9 $ 1,740.6 5 % 8 % As a % of total net sales 40.6 % 40.5 % 40.2 % Food Solutions 988.3 944.7 843.0 5 12 As a % of total net sales 20.4 % 20.3 % 19.5 % Protective Packaging 1,480.3 1,506.9 1,476.1 (2 ) 2 As a % of total net sales 30.6 % 32.4 % 34.1 % Other 405.5 316.7 268.2 28 18 As a % of total net sales 8.4 % 6.8 % 6.2 % Total $ 4,843.5 $ 4,651.2 $ 4,327.9 4 % 8 % Food Packaging Segment Net Sales 2008 compared with 2007 The Companys Food Packaging segment net sales increased $86.5 million, or 5%, in 2008 compared with 2007. Excluding the $35.3 million favorable effect of foreign currency translation, Food Packaging segment net sales would have increased $51.2 million, or 3%, which was primarily due to: favorable impact of product price/mix in Latin America of 8% and in the United States of 4%; and increases in unit volume in the United States of 1% and in Europe of 2%; partially offset by: a decrease in unit volume in Latin America of 8%. The favorable impacts of product price/mix in Latin America and the United States were primarily due to the positive impact of selling price increases implemented in December 2007 and during 2008 for most Food Packaging products. The increase in unit volume in the United States was primarily attributed to higher pork slaughter rates during the first half of 2008, which in turn resulted in higher sales of the Companys fresh meat packaging products. The increase in unit volume in Europe was primarily attributed to net positive trends in this region during the first half of 2008 in the fresh red meat and cheese markets, which in turn resulted in higher sales of the Companys fresh meat and dairy packaging products. The decrease in unit volume in Latin America was primarily due to market factors in Brazil. Throughout 2008, Brazilian meat exports to Europe were halted due to Brazilian meat processors lack of compliance with previously issued European food traceability and safety standards. By late 2008, the majority of Brazilian meat processors had complied with the standards, but by this time, end market demand in Europe had slowed due to a decline in meat consumption, attributable to weak economic conditions in Europe. 2007 compared with 2006 The Companys Food Packaging segment net sales increased $142.3 million, or 8%, in 2007 compared with 2006. Excluding the $66.9 million favorable effect of foreign currency translation, Food Packaging segment net sales would have increased $75.4 million, or 4%, which was primarily due to: increase in unit volume of 2% and a favorable impact of product price/mix of 2% in North America; increases in unit volume in Latin America of 12% and in the Asia Pacific region of 5%; and a favorable impact of product price/mix in Europe of 2%; partially offset by: unfavorable impact of product price/mix in the Asia Pacific region of 2%. 26 Table of Contents The increases in unit volume in North America, Latin America and the Asia Pacific region were primarily due to positive trends in red meat and pork production in North and Latin America and strong beef export rates in Brazil and Australia. Positive trends in red meat production also contributed to the favorable impact of product price/mix in North America. The favorable impact of product price/mix was also impacted by price increases implemented for select Food Packaging products in September 2006. The favorable impact of product price/mix in Europe was primarily due to improved product price/mix in developing European countries, as well as improved product mix of flexible packaging materials in Western Europe. The unfavorable impact of product price/mix in the Asia Pacific region was primarily due to the impact of lower average selling prices on some of the Companys Food Packaging products in this region. Food Solutions Segment Net Sales 2008 compared with 2007 The Companys Food Solutions segment net sales increased $43.6 million, or 5%, in 2008 compared with 2007. Excluding the $25.5 million favorable effect of foreign currency translation, Food Solutions segment net sales would have increased $18.1 million, or 2%, which was primarily due to: favorable impact of product price/mix in the United States of 6% and in Europe of 2%; and an increase in unit volume in the Asia Pacific region of 7%; partially offset by: decreases in unit volume in Europe of 4% and in the United States of 3%. The favorable impacts of product price/mix in both the United States and Europe were primarily attributed to the positive impact of selling price increases implemented in December 2007 and in 2008 for most Food Solutions products. The increase in unit volume in the Asia Pacific region was primarily attributed to product adoption by new and existing customers of the Companys case ready products. The decrease in unit volume in Europe was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of lower consumption of meats and cheeses in certain countries resulting from the deteriorating economic conditions in this region and, to a lesser extent, certain low margin business the Company decided to withdraw from in the first quarter of 2008. The decrease in unit volume in the United States was primarily due to a previously announced change by a large retailer in November 2007 opting to move from a case ready packaging format to an alternative packaging format for a portion of its meat packaging. This decrease was partially offset by increased flexible food film and vertical pouch packaging products sales to existing customers in this region. 2007 compared with 2006 The Companys Food Solutions segment net sales increased $101.7 million, or 12%, in 2007 compared with 2006. Excluding the $45.7 million favorable effect of foreign currency translation, Food Solutions segment net sales would have increased $56.0 million, or 7%, which was primarily due to: an increase in unit volume of 5% and a favorable impact of product price/mix of 1% in North America; and an increase in unit volume of 4% and a favorable impact of product price/mix of 1% in Europe. The increase in unit volume and the favorable impact of product price/mix in North America and the increase in unit volume in Europe were primarily due to steady red meat production in these regions and continued product adoption by existing and new customers, which benefited sales of the Companys case ready products. Additionally, strength in domestic crop yields and strong equipment sales benefited sales of the Companys vertical pouch packaging products in North America. Outsourced Products Included in this segment are net sales from products produced in the Companys facilities as well as products fabricated by other manufacturers, or outsourced products. Outsourced products include, among others, foam and solid plastic trays and containers fabricated in various regions and absorbent pads fabricated primarily in North America and in Europe. The Company has strategically opted to use third party manufacturers for technically less complex products as part of its business model to offer customers a 27 Table of Contents broader range of solutions. The Company has benefited from this strategy with increased net sales and operating profit requiring minimal capital expenditures. Net sales of outsourced products included in this segment amounted to $170.0 million in 2008, $180.7 million in 2007 and $165.3 million in 2006. The Companys total net sales of outsourced products were $240.0 million in 2008, $246.4 million in 2007 and $206.0 million in 2006. Protective Packaging Segment Net Sales 2008 compared with 2007 The Companys Protective Packaging segment net sales decreased $26.6 million, or 2%, compared with 2007. Excluding the $33.0 million favorable effect of foreign currency translation and a $0.6 million net impact of a business acquisition in 2008, Protective Packaging segment net sales would have decreased $60.2 million, or 4%. This decrease was primarily the result of lower unit volume in the United States of 6% and in Europe of 4%, which was principally attributable to weakening regional economic conditions and was consistent with manufacturing output, shipping and retail indicators. Partially offsetting this decrease in unit volume was the favorable impact of product price/mix in the United States of 2%, primarily attributed to the positive impact of selling price increases implemented in December 2007 and during 2008 for most Protective Packaging products. 2007 compared with 2006 The Companys Protective Packaging segment net sales increased $30.8 million, or 2%, in 2007 compared with 2006. Excluding the $47.7 million favorable effect of foreign currency translation and the $19.2 million impact of the sale of a small product line in 2007, Protective Packaging segment net sales would have been relatively flat, which was primarily due to: a decrease in unit volume in North America of 2%; partially offset by: an increase in unit volume in the Asia Pacific region of 9%. The decrease in unit volume in North America was primarily due to challenging economic conditions in 2007, which slowed the pace of customer orders. Additionally, unit volume was also negatively impacted by the effects of a net increase in average selling prices for select Protective Packaging products in 2006 and 2007, which were implemented to address rising costs of raw materials. The increase in unit volume in the Asia Pacific region was principally due to an increase in sales to new and existing customers of inflatables, shrink films and Instapak&reg; foam in place products. Other Net Sales 2008 compared with 2007 The Companys Other net sales increased $88.8 million, or 28%, in 2008 compared with 2007. Excluding $61.5 million in net sales resulting from the November 2007 acquisition of certain assets relating to Ethafoam&reg; and related polyethylene foam product lines and the August 2007 acquisition of Alga Plastics and the $15.8 million favorable effect of foreign currency translation, Other net sales would have increased $11.5 million, or 4%, primarily due to: a favorable impact of product price/mix in North America of 10%, primarily attributed to the positive impact of selling price increases for most of the Companys Specialty Materials products; and an increase in unit volume in Asia of 18%, primarily due to adoption of medical applications products by new and existing customers primarily in the first half of 2008. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in unit volume in the United States of 3%, primarily attributed to lower unit volume in some of the Companys Specialty Materials products, which was principally the result of weakening regional economic conditions and was consistent with manufacturing output indicators. 28 Table of Contents 2007 compared with 2006 The Companys Other net sales increased $48.5 million, or 18%, in 2007 compared with 2006. Excluding the $16.2 million favorable effect of foreign currency translation and $15.7 million from the acquisitions of Alga Plastics and of certain assets relating to Ethafoam&reg; and related polyethylene foam product lines in 2007, Other net sales would have increased $16.6 million, or 6%, which was primarily due to: an increase in unit volume in the Asia Pacific region of 44% and Europe of 4%, predominately due to an increase in medical applications products sales to new and existing customers; and a favorable impact of product price/mix in North America of 6%, primarily resulting from average selling price increases in the second half of 2006 related to the Companys specialty materials products, including special density foams; partially offset by: a decrease in unit volume in North America of 8%, principally due to lower net sales of specialty materials products including foams and composite materials as a result of challenging economic conditions, which slowed the pace of customer orders; and an unfavorable impact of product price/mix in Europe of 2%, primarily relating to the Companys specialty materials products, including special density foams.

The Company utilizes petrochemical based resins in the manufacture of many of its products. The costs for these raw materials are impacted by the rise and fall in crude oil and natural gas prices, since those items serve as feedstocks utilized in the production of most resins. The prices for these feedstocks have been particularly volatile in recent years. Although changes in the prices of crude oil and natural gas are not perfect benchmarks, they are indicative of the variations in raw materials and other input costs faced by the Company. The Company continues to monitor the changes in raw material and energy related costs as they occur and takes pricing actions as appropriate to lessen the impact of cost increases when they occur. The following table shows the Companys cost of sales for the three years ended December 31, 2008 (dollars in millions): 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 % Change 2007 vs. 2006 % Change Cost of sales $ 3,606.9 $ 3,350.1 $ 3,087.8 8 % 9 % As a % of net sales 74.5 % 72.0 % 71.3 % 2008 compared with 2007 The $256.8 million increase in cost of sales in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to unfavorable average petrochemical based raw material costs of approximately $125.0 million, which was experienced in the first nine months of 2008, the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $72.6 million and higher input costs, including unfavorable freight and energy related costs in 2008 of approximately $26.0 million. Incremental expenses included in cost of sales in 2008, which related to the 2007 acquisitions of Ethafoam&reg; and related polyethylene foam product lines and Alga Plastics, amounted to approximately $54.0 million. Expenses included in cost of sales related to the implementation of the Companys global manufacturing strategy were $7.4 million in 2008, compared with $11.1 million in 2007. These items were partially offset by the impact of expense control initiatives in 2008. 30 Table of Contents 2007 compared with 2006 The $262.3 million increase in cost of sales in 2007 compared with 2006 was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $129.9 million, higher input costs to support the increase in unit volume of product sales, and unfavorable average petrochemical based raw material costs of approximately $19.0 million. Expenses included in cost of sales related to the implementation of the Companys global manufacturing strategy were $11.1 million in 2007 compared with $3.8 million in 2006. Marketing, Administrative and Development Expenses The following table shows the Companys marketing, administrative and development expenses for the three years ended December 31, 2008 (dollars in millions): 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 % Change 2007 vs. 2006 % Change Marketing, administrative and development expenses $ 755.0 $ 750.2 $ 701.1 1 % 7 % As a % of net sales 15.6 % 16.1 % 16.2 % 2008 compared with 2007 Marketing, administrative and development expenses increased $4.8 million in 2008 compared with 2007. These expenses increased due to the following: the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $18.9 million; additional expenses of $5.4 million in 2008 related to businesses acquired in the second half of 2007; an increase in provision for bad debt expense of $5.3 million (substantially all in the fourth quarter of 2008), primarily related to current credit conditions affecting some of the Companys Food Packaging and Protective Packaging customers; and additional operating expenses of $3.4 million in 2008 related to the Companys New Ventures businesses, which includes spending related to innovation and new product introductions including spending related to renewable products. These increases were largely offset by: lower management incentive compensation expenses of $22.0 million, of which $14.1 million occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008, resulting from the Company not meeting some of its 2008 financial performance goals; and a decrease in information systems expenses of $6.3 million, primarily due to expense control initiatives in 2008. 2007 compared with 2006 Marketing, administrative and development expenses increased $49.1 million in 2007 compared with 2006. This increase was primarily due to: the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $27.2 million; additional expenses of $6.9 million in 2007 related to innovation and new product introductions including spending related to renewable products; additional expenses of $2.8 million in 2007 related to the upgrade of the Companys information technology platforms; and additional expenses of $2.6 million in 2007 of incremental expenses related to the new state of the art North American customer service center opened in 2007. 31 Table of Contents Cost Reduction and Productivity Program and Global Manufacturing Strategy Cost Reduction and Productivity Program In 2008, the Company implemented its cost reduction and productivity program. As a result, the Company recorded $65.8 million of pre tax charges primarily for termination benefits. See below for further details on the restructuring charges related to this program. These charges were included in restructuring and other charges on the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 3, "Business Segment Information," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for restructuring and other charges by the Companys segment reporting structure. The Company expects to incur additional modest costs associated with this program in 2009. The Company expects to achieve annual savings from this program of approximately $50.0 million to $60.0 million beginning in 2009. These savings will appear in both cost of sales and marketing, administrative and development expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. The restructuring and other charges related to this program consisted of the following: Termination benefits $ 62.7 SFAS No. 88 curtailment charge 1.6 Other associated costs 1.5 Total $ 65.8 The components of the restructuring accrual through December 31, 2008 and the accrual balance remaining at December 31, 2008 related to this program were as follows: Original restructuring accrual $ 59.9 Additional accrual for termination benefits of $2.9 million and other associated costs of $1.5 million 4.4 Cash payments made during 2008 (18.1 ) Effect of changes in foreign currency rates (2.5 ) Restructuring accrual at December 31, 2008 $ 43.7 The Company expects to pay $41.2 million of the accrual balance remaining at December 31, 2008 within the next year. This amount is included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2008. The remaining accrual of $2.5 million is expected to be paid in 2010 and is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2008. Global Manufacturing Strategy The Companys global manufacturing strategy, when fully implemented, will expand production in regions where demand for the Companys products and services has been growing significantly. At the same time, the Company intends to optimize certain manufacturing capacity in North America and Europe into centers of excellence. The goals of this multi year program are to expand capacity in growing markets, further improve the Companys operating efficiencies, and implement new technologies more effectively. The Company expects this program to produce meaningful savings. By taking advantage of new technologies and streamlining production on a global scale, the Company expects to continue to enhance its profitable growth and its global leadership position. In July 2006, the Company announced the first phase of this multi year global manufacturing strategy. At the end of 2008, the construction phase of the program was substantially complete. The capital expenditures and associated costs and related restructuring charges for this strategy in 2008, 2007 and 2006 are included in the table below. The combined capital expenditures and related costs to implement this program are expected to total approximately $220.0 million. The Company has realized approximately $25.0 million in benefits from this program in 2008, and these benefits are expected to increase to annual benefits of $45.0 million in 2009 and to $55.0 million in 2010 and thereafter. The actual timing of future 32 Table of Contents capital expenditures and related costs is subject to change due to a variety of factors that may cause a portion of the spending and resulting benefits to occur in future periods. Year Ended December 31, Cumulative Through December 31, 2008 2008 2007 2006 Capital expenditures $ 59.5 $ 58.5 $ 14.7 $ 132.7 Associated costs(1) 7.4 11.4 3.8 22.6 Restructuring and other charges(2) 19.3 0.7 11.8 31.8 (1)The associated costs principally include equipment relocation and facility start up costs, which are primarily included in cost of sales on the consolidated statements of operations. These charges by segment and Other were as follows: 2008 2007 2006 Food Packaging $ 4.0 $ 10.2 $ 3.5 Food Solutions 0.6 Protective Packaging 2.6 0.9 Other 0.2 0.3 0.3 Total $ 7.4 $ 11.4 $ 3.8 (2)The restructuring and other charges were primarily for termination benefits, the majority of which were related to the Food Packaging segment. These charges were included in restructuring and other charges on the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 3, "Business Segment Information," for restructuring and other charges by reportable segment and Other. A reconciliation of the restructuring accrual is included below. The restructuring and other charges of $19.3 million related to this program in 2008 were primarily related to the Companys decision to close its manufacturing facility in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. This facilitys manufacturing operations will be moved to existing Company facilities in North America. The Company plans to complete this project within the second half of 2009, at which time all manufacturing operations at the Cedar Rapids facility will cease. The Company expects to incur additional associated charges in 2009 and 2010. The restructuring charges recorded in connection with this closure consisted of the following: Termination benefits $ 8.6 SFAS No. 88 curtailment charge 3.6 Total $ 12.2 During 2008, the Company also recorded restructuring and other charges of $7.1 million primarily related to termination benefits incurred in connection with other projects associated with this program. The components of the restructuring accrual through December 31, 2008 and the accrual balance remaining at December 31, 2008 were as follows: Restructuring accrual at December 31, 2007 $ 8.2 Additional accrual for termination benefits 13.3 Cash payments during 2008 (6.3 ) Effect of changes in foreign currency rates (0.8 ) Restructuring accrual at December 31, 2008 $ 14.4 The Company expects to pay $7.5 million of the accrual balance remaining at December 31, 2008 within the next year. This amount is included in other current liabilities on the Companys consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2008. The remaining accrual of $6.9 million is expected to be paid in 2010 and is included in other liabilities on the Companys consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2008. 33 Table of Contents Other Restructuring Activity In 2007, the Company recorded $0.9 million of restructuring charges, net, primarily for termination benefits incurred in connection with the Companys consolidation of its customer service activities in North America. In 2006, the Company recorded $1.1 million of restructuring charges of which $0.6 million related to termination benefits incurred in connection with the Companys consolidation of its Food Packaging customer service activities in Canada and $0.5 million was related to a series of profit improvement plans in various geographic regions for its Food Packaging segment implemented in 2004. Operating Profit by Business Segment and Other As previously discussed, management evaluates the performance of each reportable segment based on its operating profit. Operating profit by business segment and other for the three years ended December 31, 2008 was as follows (dollars in millions): 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007% Change 2007 vs. 2006% Change Operating profit: Food Packaging $ 217.5 $ 228.2 $ 214.6 (5 )% 6 % As a % of Food Packaging net sales 11.0 % 12.1 % 12.3 % As a % of total operating profit (1) 45.2 % 41.4 % 39.8 % Food Solutions $ 80.0 $ 86.1 $ 87.3 (7 )% (1 )% As a % of Food Solutions net sales 8.1 % 9.1 % 10.4 % As a % of total operating profit(1) 16.6 % 15.6 % 16.2 % Protective Packaging $ 169.1 $ 208.6 $ 206.7 (19 )% 1 % As a % of Protective Packaging net sales 11.4 % 13.8 % 14.0 % As a % of total operating profit(1) 35.1 % 37.9 % 38.3 % Other $ 15.0 $ 28.0 $ 30.4 (46 )% (8 )% As a % of Other net sales 3.7 % 8.8 % 11.3 % As a % of total operating profit (1) 3.1 % 5.1 % 5.7 % Total segments and other $ 481.6 $ 550.9 $ 539.0 (13 )% 2 % As a % of total net sales(1) 9.9 % 11.8 % 12.5 % Restructuring and other charges(2) 85.1 1.6 12.9 Total $ 396.5 $ 549.3 $ 526.1 (28 )% 4 % As a % of total net sales 8.2 % 11.8 % 12.2 % (1)Before taking into consideration restructuring and other charges. (2)The restructuring and other charges by the Companys segment reporting structure were as follows: 2008 2007 2006 Food Packaging $ 46.2 $ 0.5 $ 13.0 Food Solutions 15.1 0.1 Protective Packaging 18.8 1.0 (0.1 ) Other 5.0 Total $ 85.1 $ 1.6 $ 12.9 In 2008, the Company implemented a cost reduction and productivity program. The restructuring charges primarily related to termination benefits for this program were $65.8 million in 2008. The remaining $19.3 million of restructuring and other charges in 2008 was related to the Companys global manufacturing strategy. Restructuring and other charges in 2007 were primarily related to termination costs for the consolidation of the Companys customer service activities in North America of $0.8 million and for the global manufacturing strategy of $0.8 million. The restructuring and other charges in 2006 were primarily related to the Companys global manufacturing strategy. See "Cost Reduction and Productivity Program and Global Manufacturing Strategy," above for further discussion. 34 Table of Contents Food Packaging Segment Operating Profit 2008 compared with 2007 The decrease in operating profit as a percentage of this segments net sales in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to higher input costs including unfavorable average petrochemical based raw material costs of approximately $60.0 million and freight and utilities costs of approximately $14.0 million. These items were partially offset by the favorable impact of product price/mix and lower management incentive compensation expenses of approximately $9.0 million, discussed above. Expenses in this segment related to the implementation of the Companys global manufacturing strategy were $4.0 million in 2008 compared with $10.2 million in 2007. 2007 compared with 2006 The decrease in operating profit as a percentage of this segments net sales in 2007 compared with 2006 was primarily due to higher input costs including unfavorable average petrochemical based raw material costs of approximately $10.0 million incurred to support the increased volume of product sales and an increase in marketing, administrative and development expenses. Expenses in this segment related to the implementation of the Companys global manufacturing strategy were $10.2 million in 2007 compared with $3.5 million in 2006. Food Solutions Segment Operating Profit 2008 compared with 2007 The decrease in operating profit as a percentage of this segments net sales in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to higher input costs, including unfavorable average petrochemical based raw material costs of approximately $20.0 million and freight and utilities costs of approximately $4.0 million. These items were partially offset by the favorable product price/mix and lower management incentive compensation expenses of approximately $4.0 million, discussed above. 2007 compared with 2006 The decrease in operating profit as a percentage of this segments net sales in 2007 compared with 2006 was primarily due to the impact of higher marketing, administrative and development expenses discussed above, including expenses related to new product development. This segment experienced higher input costs in 2007 compared with 2006, but this was offset by the improved contribution from increased net sales, including favorable product/mix. Protective Packaging Segment Operating Profit 2008 compared with 2007 The decrease in operating profit as a percentage of this segments net sales in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to higher input costs, including unfavorable average petrochemical based raw material costs of approximately $30.0 million and freight and utilities costs of approximately $5.0 million. Also contributing to this decrease was the decline in unit volume, which was partially offset by the favorable product price/mix and lower management incentive compensation expenses of approximately $7.0 million discussed above. 2007 compared with 2006 This segments operating profit as a percentage of its net sales in 2007 compared with 2006 remained relatively flat, which was primarily attributable to selling price increases implemented in 2007 and 2006, which helped offset higher input costs, including unfavorable average petrochemical based raw material costs of approximately $3.0 million, and the impact of higher marketing, administrative and development expenses discussed above. 35 Table of Contents Other Operating Profit 2008 compared with 2007 The decrease in operating profit as a percentage of Other net sales in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to higher input costs including unfavorable average petrochemical based raw materials costs of approximately $10.0 million and freight and utilities costs of approximately $10.0 million, which included additional freight costs related to the Ethafoam&reg; foam product lines. These higher input costs were partially offset by favorable product price/mix discussed above. This businesss operating profit was also unfavorably impacted by an interim supply and distribution agreement for the Ethafoam&reg; foam product lines. The Company completed the construction of additional capacity in the United States to produce these products prior to the end of this interim agreement. The Company expects margins related to these products to improve in 2009. This businesss operating profit was also unfavorably impacted by the additional expenses related to innovation and new product introductions discussed above. 2007 compared to 2006 The decrease in operating profit as a percentage of Other net sales in 2007 compared with 2006 was primarily due to higher marketing, administrative and development expenses discussed above, of which $1.7 million was associated with the Companys majority ownership in Biosphere. Interest Expense Interest expense includes the stated interest rate on the Companys outstanding debt, as well as the net impact of capitalized interest, the effects of interest rate swaps and the amortization of capitalized senior debt issuance costs, bond discounts, and terminated treasury locks. Interest expense for the three years ended December 31, 2008 was as follows (dollars in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Interest expense $ 91.2 $ 105.6 $ 114.8 Interest expense on the amount payable pursuant to the Settlement agreement 36.9 35.0 33.2 Total interest expense $ 128.1 $ 140.6 $ 148.0 2008 compared with 2007 The $12.5 million decrease in interest expense in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to the following: a $17.7 million decrease due to the retirement of the Companys 5.375% Senior Notes on their maturity date in April 2008; partially offset by: an increase of $2.0 million due to borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facility in 2008; and an increase of $1.9 million as a result of additional expense related to the compounding of interest on the amount payable pursuant to the Settlement agreement. 2007 compared with 2006 The $7.4 million decrease in interest expense in 2007 compared with 2006 was primarily due to the following: a $7.2 million decrease due to the retirement of the Companys 5.625% euro notes in July 2006; a decrease of $4.3 million related to higher capitalized interest during the construction of capital investment projects in 2007 compared with 2006; 36  Table of Contents partially offset by: an increase of $1.8 million as a result of additional expense related to the compounding of interest on the amount payable pursuant to the Settlement agreement; and an increase of $1.2 million due to the impact of higher interest rates on the Companys $300.0 million of outstanding interest rate swaps entered into to effectively convert its 5.375% Senior Notes due April 2008 into floating rate debt. The Company expects to incur approximately $33.0 million of additional interest expense in 2009 related to its 12.0% Senior Notes. However, assuming the Company does not make the payment under the Settlement agreement in 2009, this additional interest expense is expected to be partially offset by a decrease in interest expense related to lower borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facility and a decrease in costs associated with lower utilization of the Companys accounts receivables securitization program. The net unfavorable impact from the above items in 2009 is expected to be approximately $25.0 million. Gain on Sale of Equity Method Investment In the first quarter of 2007, the Company sold its 50 percent investment in PolyMask Corporation to its joint venture partner, 3M Company (the "PolyMask transaction"). The joint venture was formed in 1991 between the Company and 3M to produce and sell non packaging surface protection films. Prior to the sale, the Company accounted for this joint venture under the equity method of accounting. The Company received an aggregate cash amount of $36.0 million for the transaction and other related assets and recorded a pre tax gain of $35.3 million ($22.4 million after tax) in the first quarter of 2007. This gain was included in gain on the sale of equity method investment on the consolidated statement of operations. The Companys investment in this joint venture was not material to the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. Impairment of Available for Sale Securities In 2008, the Company recorded $34.0 million of other than temporary impairment charges, of which $20.3 million occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008. These charges were related to the decline in fair market value of its $44.7 million investments in auction rate securities. See Note 5, "Available for Sale Investments," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys investments in auction rate securities. Other (Expense) Income, Net The following table provides details of the Companys other income, net (dollars in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Interest and dividend income $ 14.1 $ 19.9 $ 16.8 Net foreign exchange transaction losses (16.0 ) (6.4 ) (4.1 ) Settlement agreement and related costs (1.5 ) (0.7 ) (1.6 ) Advisory expenses incurred prior to ceasing work on an acquisition (7.5 ) Loss on sale of small product line (6.8 ) Gain on termination of forward starting interest rate swaps 3.7 Other, net (8.7 ) 9.8 10.9 Other (expense) income, net $ (12.1 ) $ 12.0 $ 22.0 Interest and dividend income decreased in 2008 compared with 2007 and 2006 primarily due to the use of available cash and cash equivalents to retire the 5.375% Senior Notes on the date of their maturity and lower interest rates paid on the Companys invested cash. Net foreign exchange transaction losses increased $9.6 million in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the latter part of 2008, particularly against foreign currencies in developing markets. 37 Table of Contents Other, net, includes the costs associated with the Companys receivables securitization program. These costs primarily relate to the losses on the sale of the undivided ownership interests in 2008, program fees, commitment fees and other associated costs which totaled $3.4 million in 2008. The program and commitment fees and other associated costs were $0.4 million in 2007 and $0.3 million in 2006. There were no costs related to losses on the sale of receivables interests in 2007 and 2006 since the Company did not sell any receivables interests during these years. Income Taxes The Companys effective income tax rate was 19.1% for 2008, 22.6% for 2007 and 31.5% for 2006. The Company expects an effective income tax rate of approximately 27.7% for 2009. The Companys income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the following benefits: $3.6 million due to a change in assertion under Accounting Principles Board Opinion 23, or APB 23, with regard to certain foreign earnings; $2.5 million of income tax benefits recognized related to the utilization of loss carryforwards in a foreign jurisdiction for which no benefit had previously been recognized for financial reporting purposes; $3.2 million of income tax benefits related to a reduction in the estimated cost of repatriating certain foreign earnings; and $6.1 million of income tax benefits related to tax accruals, and related interest, for contingencies that did not materialize primarily due to the expiration of the statutes of limitations. For 2008, the effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35.0% primarily due to the lower net effective income tax rate on foreign earnings, and to a lesser extent, the items noted above. For 2007, the effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35.0% primarily due to the reversal of the tax accruals and related interest and, to a lesser extent, the lower net effective income tax rate on foreign earnings, partially offset by state income taxes. For 2006, the effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35.0% primarily due to the lower net effective income tax rate on foreign earnings, partially offset by the effect of state income taxes. On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes." As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the Company recognized no change in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 15, "Income Taxes," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Liquidity and Capital Resources The discussion that follows contains: a description of the Companys material commitments and contingencies, a description of the Companys principal sources of liquidity, a description of the Companys outstanding indebtedness, an analysis of the Companys historical cash flows and changes in working capital, a description of the Companys derivative financial instruments, and a description of changes in the Companys shareholders equity. 38 Table of Contents Material Commitments and Contingencies Settlement agreement and Related Costs The Company recorded a charge of $850.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, of which $512.5 million represents a cash payment that the Company is required to make (subject to the satisfaction of the terms and conditions of the Settlement agreement) upon the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy of W.R. Grace & Co. The Company did not use cash in any period with respect to this liability. While confirmation hearings on the PI Settlement Plan are currently scheduled for June and September 2009 (with potential pre trial conferences currently scheduled in July), the Company does not know whether or when a final plan of reorganization will become effective or whether the final plan will be consistent with the terms of the Settlement agreement. The Company currently expects to fund this payment by using a combination of accumulated cash and future cash flows from operations and funds available under its revolving credit facility or its accounts receivable securitization program, both described below, as well as funds available from the Companys recently issued 12% Senior Notes. The cash payment of $512.5 million accrues interest at a 5.5% annual rate, which is compounded annually, from December 21, 2002 to the date of payment. The Company has recorded this accrued interest in Settlement agreement and related accrued interest on its consolidated balance sheets, and these amounts were $195.3 million at December 31, 2008 and $158.4 million at December 31, 2007. The information set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K in Note 16, "Commitments and Contingencies," under the caption "Settlement agreement and Related Costs" is incorporated herein by reference. Cryovac Transaction; Contingencies Related to the Cryovac Transaction The information set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K in Note 16, "Commitments and Contingencies," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption "Cryovac Transaction" and Contingencies Related to the Cryovac Transaction" is incorporated herein by reference. Other Litigation The information set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K in Note 16, "Commitments and Contingencies," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption "Other Litigation" is incorporated herein by reference. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the Companys principal contractual obligations and sets forth the amounts of required or contingently required cash outlays in 2009 and future years (amounts in millions): Payments Due by Years Contractual Obligations Total 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Short term borrowings $ 37.6 $ 37.6 $ $ $ Current portion of long term debt exclusive of debt discounts 151.5 151.5 Long term debt, exclusive of debt discounts 1,292.1 441.4 400.6 450.1 Total debt(1)(2) 1,481.2 189.1 441.4 400.6 450.1 Operating leases 151.0 32.6 48.4 28.3 41.7 Cash portion of the Settlement agreement, including accrued interest at December 31, 2008(3) 707.8 707.8 First quarter 2009 quarterly cash dividend declared 18.9 18.9 Accounts receivable securitization program 80.0 80.0 Other principal contractual obligations 162.3 70.1 87.0 5.2 Total contractual cash obligations $ 2,601.2 $ 1,098.5 $ 576.8 $ 434.1 $ 491.8 (1)These amounts include principal maturities (at face value) only. These amounts also include the Companys contractual obligations under capital leases of $5.3 million in 2009, $10.0 million in 2010 2011 and $0.5 million in 2012 2013. 39 Table of Contents (2)The 2010 period includes the Companys 3% convertible Senior Notes since the holders of these notes have the option to require the Company to repurchase the senior notes on June 30 of 2010, 2013, 2018, 2023 and 2028. See Note 11, "Debt and Credit Facilities," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (3)This liability is reflected as a current liability due to the uncertainty of the timing of payment. Interest accrues on this amount at a rate of 5.5% per annum, compounded annually, until it becomes due and payable. Current Portion of Long Term Debt and Long Term Debt The debt shown in the above table excludes unamortized bond discounts as of December 31, 2008 and therefore represents the principal amount of the debt required to be repaid in each period. Operating Leases The Company is obligated under the terms of various operating leases covering some of the facilities that it occupies and some production equipment. The contractual operating lease obligations listed in the table above represent estimated future minimum annual rental commitments under non cancelable real and personal property leases as of December 31, 2008. Cash portion of the Settlement agreement The Settlement agreement is described more fully in "Settlement agreement and Related Costs," of Note 16, "Commitments and Contingencies," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Principal Contractual Obligations Other principal contractual obligations include agreements to purchase an estimated amount of goods, including raw materials, or services, including energy, in the normal course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the purchase. Liability for Unrecognized Tax Benefits At December 31, 2008, the Company had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest of $5.0 million, which is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2008, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the future period or periods of cash settlement of these liabilities. See Note 15, "Income Taxes," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has reviewed its off balance sheet arrangements and has determined that none of those arrangements have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $80.0 million outstanding under its accounts receivable securitization program. See Note 6, "Accounts Receivable Securitization Program," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Interest Payments The Company currently expects to pay from $95.0 million to $105.0 million of interest payments in 2009, including the impact of the Companys recently issued 12% Senior Notes. The actual interest paid in 2009 may be different from this amount if interest rates change or if the Company repurchases existing indebtedness or incurs indebtedness under its existing lines of credit or otherwise. These 2009 expected interest payments do not reflect payment of any accrued interest related to the Settlement agreement. Income Tax Payments The Company currently expects to pay between $85.0 million and $95.0 million in income taxes in 2009, assuming it does not make the Settlement agreement payment in 2009. 40 Table of Contents Contributions to Defined Benefit Pension Plans The Company maintains defined benefit pension plans for a limited number of its U.S. employees and for some of its non U.S. employees. The Company currently expects employer contributions to be approximately $15.0 million to $20.0 million in 2009, primarily due to the decline in fair value of plan assets. Termination Benefit Payments In connection with the cost reduction and productivity program and the global manufacturing strategy, the Company currently expects to pay approximately $48.7 million in 2009 and $9.4 million in 2010 related to termination benefits. Environmental Matters The Company is subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations, and it accrues for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. These accruals do not take into account any discounting for the time value of money and are not reduced by potential insurance recoveries, if any. The Company does not believe that it is reasonably possible that its liability in excess of the amounts that it has accrued for environmental matters will be material to its consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets or cash flows. The Company reassesses environmental liabilities whenever circumstances become better defined or it can better estimate remediation efforts and their costs. The Company evaluates these liabilities periodically based on available information, including the progress of remedial investigations at each site, the current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible parties. As some of these issues are decided (the outcomes of which are subject to uncertainties) or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated, the Company adjusts the recorded accruals, as necessary. The Company believes that these exposures are not material to its consolidated financial position and results of operations. The Company believes that it has adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures. Principal Sources of Liquidity The Company requires cash to fund operating expenses, capital expenditures, interest, taxes and dividends and to pay its debt obligations and other long term liabilities as they come due. The Companys principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, accumulated cash and amounts available under its existing lines of credit described below, including the revolving credit facility and the ANZ facility, and its accounts receivable securitization program. As of December 31, 2008, the following material cash obligations will be due or contingently due within the next 18 months (dollars in millions): 6.95% Senior Notes due May 15, 2009 $ 136.7 Settlement agreement and related accrued interest 707.8 3% Convertible Senior Notes due June 2033 431.3 The holders of the 3% convertible Senior Notes have the option to require the Company to repurchase these notes on June 30, 2010, 2013, 2018, 2023 and 2028, or upon the occurrence of a fundamental change in or a termination of trading of the Companys common stock, at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. With respect to the Settlement agreement and related accrued interest, the Company does not know whether or when a final plan of reorganization for Grace will become effective or whether the final plan will be consistent with the terms of the Settlement agreement. See "Settlement agreement and Related Costs," above for further discussion. Graces PI Settlement Plan is subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions. As part of this plan, Grace has included, as a condition to the plans effectiveness, exit financing in the amount and on terms satisfactory to Grace, adding to the uncertainty as to when the plan might become effective. The Company has considered a variety of options to fund its obligation under the Settlement agreement, depending on when this funding would take place. The Companys existing sources of liquidity are expected to be sufficient to provide for the payment of the Settlement agreement, and the Company will regularly reassess the sufficiency of its funds. 41 Table of Contents The Company expects to have sufficient liquidity from a combination of available cash and cash equivalents, the net proceeds from the issuance of the 12.0% Senior Notes in February 2009 and, subject to availability, funds from the Companys committed lines of credit, including its revolving credit facility and the ANZ facility, and its accounts receivable securitization program to retire the remaining outstanding balance of the 6.95% Senior Notes in May 2009. Similarly, the Company expects to have sufficient liquidity from cash provided by operating activities and from the revolving credit facility to retire its 3% Convertible Senior Notes in June 2010 if the holders exercise their put option. Depending on the timing of the above contingent events, the Companys actual amount of cash flow provided by operations and the availability of funds under the Companys existing lines of credit and the accounts receivable securitization program, the Company may need to raise additional funds from external sources. These funds would be sought at market terms and conditions and could include a combination of short and medium term debt as well as equity offerings. However, there is no assurance as to the future cost or availability of external funds, and the Company may experience difficulty obtaining external funding and could incur increased financing costs. Cash tax benefits resulting from the payment made under the Settlement agreement are expected to increase the cash available to repay any borrowings made to fund the Settlement agreement. These tax benefits, which are recorded as a deferred tax asset, are anticipated to provide approximately $300.0 million of future cash tax benefits from the time the payment under the Settlement agreement is made. However, the amount of future cash tax benefits could vary, depending on the value of the Companys common stock and the Companys tax situation at that time. Lines of Credit The following table summarizes the Companys available lines of credit and committed and uncommitted lines of credit, including the revolving credit facility and the ANZ facility discussed below, at December 31, 2008 and 2007: December 31, 2008 2007 Used lines of credit $ 46.7 $ 46.4 Unused lines of credit 773.4 823.8 Total available lines of credit $ 820.1 $ 870.2 Available lines of credit committed $ 588.8 $ 646.0 Available lines of credit uncommitted 231.3 224.2 Total available lines of credit $ 820.1 $ 870.2 The Companys principal credit lines were committed and consisted of the revolving credit facility and the ANZ facility. The Company is not subject to any material compensating balance requirements in connection with its lines of credit. The Revolving Credit Facility The revolving credit facility is available for general corporate purposes, including the payment of amounts required to be paid upon the effectiveness of the Settlement agreement. The Company may re borrow amounts repaid under the revolving credit facility from time to time prior to the expiration or earlier termination of the revolving credit facility. The Companys obligations under the revolving credit facility bear interest at floating rates, which are generally determined by adding the applicable borrowing margin to the base rate or the interbank rate for the relevant currency and time period. The revolving credit facility provides for changes in borrowing margins based on the Companys long term senior unsecured debt ratings. The facility has an expiration date of July 26, 2012. The terms include a requirement that, upon the occurrence of specified events that would adversely affect the Settlement agreement or would materially increase the Companys liability in respect of the Grace bankruptcy or the asbestos liability arising from the Cryovac transaction, the Company would be required to repay any amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility, or refinance the facility, within 60 days. See "Settlement agreement and Related Costs" and "Cryovac Transaction" and "Contingencies Related to 42 Table of Contents the Cryovac Transaction," of Note 16, "Commitments and Contingencies," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. The revolving credit facility commitments include $28.0 million provided by Lehman Commercial Paper Inc., a subsidiary of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. As a result of the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries in September 2008, Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. is no longer funding borrowing requests under the revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2008, the total amount available under the revolving credit facility was approximately $472.0 million. On December 12, 2008, the parties to the revolving credit facility entered into an amendment that modified some definitions and calculations of the financial covenants in the revolving credit facility, including changes to the definition of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. In addition, while the current total amount available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility is approximately $472.0 million, the amendment also provides a mechanism to increase the total facility size to a maximum of $750.0 million. This does not represent a commitment by the lenders to increase the facility size; rather, it provides the Company with a simplified method of requesting an increase at a later date if desired and market conditions permit. This mechanism is not included in the available lines of credit table above. This amendment provided for up front fees for timely agreement to the amendment, increased facility fees, and increased drawn pricing. Facility fees are payable at the rate of 0.20% per annum on the total amounts available under the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility provides for changes in facility fees based on the Companys long term senior unsecured debt ratings. Also, this amendment provides for springing subsidiary guarantees if the Companys long term senior unsecured debt ratings by both Moodys and Standard & Poors fall below investment grade. See Note 11, "Debt and Credit Facilities," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the revolving credit facility. ANZ Facility The Company has a 170.0 million Australian dollar, dual currency revolving credit facility, known as the ANZ facility, equivalent to U.S. $116.8 million at December 31, 2008, due March 2010. A syndicate of banks made this facility available to a group of the Companys Australian and New Zealand subsidiaries for general corporate purposes, including refinancing of previously outstanding indebtedness. The Company may re borrow amounts repaid under the ANZ facility from time to time prior to the expiration or earlier termination of the facility. The Company plans to renew or replace the ANZ credit facility prior to its expiration date. However, there is no assurance that the syndicate of banks will renew or replace this facility. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had an outstanding balance of 9.4 million Australian dollars, which was equivalent to U.S. $6.5 million. Other Lines of Credit Substantially all of the Companys short term borrowings of $37.6 million at December 31, 2008 and $36.5 million at December 31, 2007 were outstanding under lines of credit available to several of the Companys foreign subsidiaries. The weighted average interest rate on these outstanding lines of credit was 11.2% at December 31, 2008 and 11.0% at December 31, 2007. Amounts available under these credit lines were $222.2 million ($191.1 million unused) at December 31, 2008 and $214.2 million ($177.8 million unused) at December 31, 2007. Accounts Receivable Securitization Program The Company and a group of its U.S. subsidiaries maintain an accounts receivable securitization program with a bank and an issuer of commercial paper administered by the bank. In December 2007, the maximum purchase limit for receivables interests was increased from $125.0 million to $135.0 million and the program expiration date was extended to December 2, 2012. In December 2008, the parties amended the program to increase the maximum purchase limit for receivables interests from $135.0 million to $160.0 million. The amounts available from time to time under the program may be less than $160.0 million subject to the level of the eligible assets included in the U.S. accounts receivable portfolio. The level of eligible assets can be impacted by a number of factors, including but not limited to the Companys net sales, the creditworthiness of the underlying customers accounts receivable balances and the Companys receivables collection experience. 43  Table of Contents The program includes a bank financing commitment that must be renewed annually prior to the expiration date. The bank financing commitment is scheduled to expire on December 4, 2009. The Company plans to seek an additional 364 day renewal of the bank financing commitment prior to its expiration but the bank is not obligated to renew the bank financing commitment. From time to time during 2008, the Company utilized the program and sold eligible U.S. accounts receivables to its indirectly wholly owned subsidiary SA Funding. which in turn sold undivided ownership interests in receivables under the program to an unaffiliated buyer, and these amounts were removed from the assets reflected on the Companys consolidated balance sheet at the time of the sales. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $80.0 million outstanding under the program. SA Funding did not sell any receivables interests under the program during 2007. Therefore, the Company did not remove any related amounts from the assets reflected on the Companys consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2007. See Note 6, "Accounts Receivable Securitization Program," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning this program. Covenants At December 31, 2008, the Company was in compliance with its financial covenants and limitations, as discussed in "Covenants," of Note 11, "Debt and Credit Facilities," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Debt Ratings The Companys cost of capital and ability to obtain external financing may be affected by its debt ratings, which the credit rating agencies review periodically. In January 2009, Standard & Poors revised the Companys long term senior unsecured debt rating from BBB to BB+ and revised the outlook to stable. The revised rating is considered below investment grade. The Companys long term senior unsecured debt rating is currently rated Baa3 (negative outlook) by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. This rating is considered investment grade. If the Companys credit ratings are further downgraded, there could be a negative impact on the Companys ability to access capital markets and borrowing costs could increase. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Outstanding Indebtedness At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Companys total debt outstanding consisted of the amounts set forth in the following table (dollars in millions). See Note 11, "Debt and Credit Facilities," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Companys debt. December 31, 2008 2007 Short term borrowings $ 37.6 $ 36.5 Current portion of long term debt 151.5 303.7 Total current debt 189.1 340.2 Total long term debt, less current portion 1,289.9 1,531.6 Total debt $ 1,479.0 $ 1,871.8 44 Table of Contents Analysis of Historical Cash Flow The following table summarizes the Companys changes in cash flows for the three years ended December 31, 2008 (dollars in millions): 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 % Change 2007 vs. 2006 % Change Net cash provided by operating activities $ 404.4 $ 378.1 $ 432.9 7 % (13 )% Net cash used in investing activities (176.7 ) (274.1 ) (202.5 ) (35 )% 35 % Net cash used in financing activities (562.9 ) (59.5 ) (350.0 ) # (83 )% #Denotes a variance greater than 100.0% Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 2008 compared with 2007 The $26.3 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the following factors: an increase in other current liabilities of $113.9 million in 2008, primarily due to the following: a decrease in cash used for income taxes payable of $93.4 million in 2008. Income tax payments were $90.7 million in 2008 compared with $201.8 million in 2007. The decrease in income tax payments in 2008 primarily resulted from lower estimated taxable income for 2008; and an increase in accrued restructuring costs of $43.6 million in 2008, primarily reflecting additional net accrued termination costs recorded in connection with the Companys cost reduction program and, to a lesser extent, its global manufacturing strategy in 2008; partially offset by: a decrease in accrued payroll of $23.0 million in 2008, primarily reflecting lower management incentive compensation in 2008; and the utilization of $80.0 million available to the Company under its accounts receivable securitization program in 2008 as discussed above. These items were partially offset by: a decrease in net earnings adjusted for non cash items of $118.0 million in 2008; and an increase in cash used for accounts payable of $45.6 million in 2008, primarily due to the timing of payments. 2007 compared with 2006 The $54.8 million decrease in cash provided from operating activities was primarily due to the following factors: a decrease in cash generated from receivables, net, of $13.5 million primarily due to the increase in international net sales and the generally longer trade payment cycles outside the U.S. The decrease in cash generated from receivables was also due to an increase of $8.6 million for value added tax receivables related to the Companys international business; an increase in cash used for inventory of $15.7 million primarily due to higher inventory levels to support international sales growth; and an increase in cash used for other current liabilities of $77.7 million, primarily due to $49.2 million of cash used for income tax payments. Income tax payments were $201.8 million in 2007 compared with $152.6 million in 2006; partially offset by: an increase in net earnings adjusted for non cash activity of $67.7 million. 45 Table of Contents Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 2008 compared with 2007 The $97.4 million decrease in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to the following: a decrease in cash used for acquisitions of $73.3 million in 2008. See Note 20, "Acquisitions and Divestiture," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of the Companys acquisitions in 2008 and 2007; and a decrease of $30.1 million in capital expenditures in 2008, primarily due to the timing of the completion of some new capacity projects in 2008. These items were partially offset by cash received of $36.0 million in 2007 from the Polymask transaction. The Company expects to continue to invest capital as it deems appropriate to expand its business, to maintain or replace depreciating property, plant and equipment, to acquire new manufacturing technology and to improve productivity. Taking into account a reduction of capital expenditures in 2009 for the Companys global manufacturing strategy, as the Company has substantially completed the construction phase associated with this program in 2008 with the completion of three new plants in emerging markets regions, the Company expects total capital expenditures in 2009 to be in the range of $100.0 million to $125.0 million. This projected range is comparable to the level of capital expenditures incurred prior to implementing the Companys global manufacturing strategy in 2006. This projection is based upon the Companys capital expenditure budget for 2009, the status of approved but not yet completed capital projects, anticipated future projects including the implementation of the Companys global manufacturing strategy and historic spending trends. 2007 compared with 2006 The $71.6 million increase in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to the following: an increase of $42.9 million in capital expenditures in 2007. Capital expenditures were $210.8 million in 2007, which included $58.5 million related to the Companys global manufacturing strategy. Capital expenditures were $167.9 million in 2006, which included $14.2 million related to the Companys global manufacturing strategy; $43.3 million of cash used for acquisitions of intangible assets primarily consisting of certain assets relating to polyethylene foam product lines; an increase in net purchases of available for sale securities of $20.9 million in 2007; and an increase of $7.2 million of cash used in other investing activities, primarily due to the Companys investment in the Teknik Plastik joint venture in September 2007; partially offset by: $36.0 million of cash received in 2007 from the PolyMask transaction; and a reduction in cash used for businesses acquired of $20.4 million in 2007, primarily due to the Company using an aggregate of $32.9 million of cash to acquire Alga Plastics in August 2007 and Pack Tiger in January 2007 and $51.7 million of cash to acquire Nelipak in January 2006 and Entapack in July 2006. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities 2008 compared with 2007 The $503.4 million increase in cash used for financing activities was primarily due to the following: an increase in net long term debt repayments of $389.9 million in 2008, primarily due to the retirement of the Companys 5.375% Senior Notes with a face value of $300.0 million in April 2008 and the purchase of $90.6 million in aggregate principal amount of the 6.95% Senior Notes, discussed above; 46 Table of Contents an increase in cash used for the repurchase of the Companys common stock of $88.3 million in 2008, as discussed below; and an increase in cash used for the payment of common stock dividends of $11.8 million in 2008, primarily due to the increase in dividends paid per common share in 2008. 2007 compared with 2006 The $290.5 million decrease in cash used for financing activities was primarily due to the following: net debt proceeds of $11.4 million in 2007 compared with net debt repayments of $251.8 million in 2006. Net debt proceeds in 2007 include net proceeds from short term borrowings of $15.8 million, partially offset by the net repayment of $4.4 million of long term debt. The net debt repayments in 2006 primarily consist of $251.7 million due to the retirement of the 5.625% Euro notes in July 2006 and repayment of $8.0 million of the debt assumed in the Nelipak acquisition, partially offset by net proceeds from long term debt of $23.6 million; and a decrease in cash used in 2007 for the repurchase of the Companys common stock, as discussed below; partially offset by: higher cash payments for dividends on the Companys common stock of $16.0 million in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily due to the increase in the cash dividend per common share in 2007. Repurchases of Capital Stock During 2008, the Company repurchased 4,024,400 shares of its common stock, par value $0.10 per share, in open market purchases at a cost of $95.1 million. The average price per share of these common stock repurchases was $23.64. During 2007, the Company repurchased 216,000 shares of its common stock in open market purchases at a cost of $6.8 million. The average price per share of these common stock repurchases was $31.58. In 2006, the Company repurchased 2,098,400 shares of its common stock, par value $0.10 per share, in open market purchases at a cost of $52.4 million. All repurchases have been adjusted for the two for one stock split in March 2007. The Company made the share repurchases in 2008 under the share repurchase program adopted by the Companys Board of Directors in August 2007. The Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase in the aggregate up to 20 million shares of its issued and outstanding common stock. This program replaced the Companys prior share repurchase program, which was terminated in August 2007. The new program has no set expiration date, and the Company may from time to time continue to repurchase its common stock. See Item 5, "Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities," for further information on the share repurchase program. The 2007 and 2006 share repurchases were made under the Companys prior share repurchase program. Changes in Working Capital At December 31, 2008, working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $50.5 million compared with $194.5 million at December 31, 2007. The $144.0 million decrease in the Companys working capital during 2008 resulted primarily from the following: a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $301.4 million in 2008. See, "Analysis of Historical Cash Flows" above for a discussion of major factors that contributed to this decrease; a decrease in receivables, net, of $107.0 million, primarily due to the sale of undivided ownership interests of $80.0 million under the Companys accounts receivables securitization program and the effect of foreign currency translation of $58.4 million. These items were partially offset by higher receivables balances in North America; an increase in accrued restructuring costs of $42.5 million related to the termination benefits incurred in connection with the Companys cost reduction and productivity program and global manufacturing strategy; and an increase in accrued interest related to the Settlement agreement of $36.9 million. 47 Table of Contents The items above were partially offset by the following items: a decrease in current portion of long term debt of $152.2 million in 2008. This decrease was primarily due to the following: the retirement of the Companys 5.375% Senior Notes with a face value of $300.0 million in April 2008; the repurchase of $90.6 million of the Companys 6.95% Senior Notes in a cash tender offer in December 2008, offset by the reclassification of the Companys 6.95% Senior Notes with a face value of $227.3 million, prior to the repurchase, from long term debt; an increase in current deferred tax assets of $118.1 million, primarily reflecting the reclassification of a portion of the Companys deferred tax asset related to the Settlement agreement from non current deferred tax assets. This reclassification primarily represents the tax benefit that the Company would expect to receive for the carryback of the net operating loss that would be generated assuming the Settlement agreement payment is made in 2009; a decrease in accrued salaries, wages and related costs of $30.4 million, primarily due to the reduction in management incentive compensation discussed above. Current and Quick Ratios The ratio of current assets to current liabilities, known as the current ratio, was 1.0 at December 31, 2008 and 1.1 at December 31, 2007. The ratio of current assets less inventory to current liabilities, known as the quick ratio, was 0.7 at December 31, 2008 and 0.8 at December 31, 2007. Derivative Financial Instruments Interest Rate Swaps The information set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K in Note 12, "Derivatives and Hedging Activities," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption "Interest Rate Swaps" is incorporated herein by reference. Foreign Currency Forward Contracts At December 31, 2008, the Company was party to foreign currency forward contracts, which did not have a significant impact on the Companys liquidity. The information set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K in Note 12, "Derivatives and Hedging Activities," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption "Foreign Currency Forward Contracts" is incorporated herein by reference. For further discussion about these contracts and other financial instruments, see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." Shareholders Equity The Companys shareholders equity was $1,924.6 million at December 31, 2008 and $2,019.6 million at December 31, 2007. Shareholders equity decreased $95.0 million, or 4.7%, in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to the following: negative foreign currency translation of $118.4 million in 2008; repurchases of common stock at a cost of $95.1 million in 2008; and dividends paid on common stock of $76.4 million in 2008; partially offset by: net earnings of $179.9 million in 2008; and the amortization of deferred compensation of $16.1 million related to the Companys contingent stock plan. 48 Table of Contents Recently Issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, Accounting Guidance and Disclosure Requirements The Company is subject to numerous recently issued statements of financial accounting standards, accounting guidance and disclosure requirements. Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, describes these new accounting pronouncements and the Companys application of the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 and is incorporated herein by reference. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Companys discussion and analysis of its consolidated financial position and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on all available evidence, including historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. To derive these estimates and assumptions, management draws from those available sources that can best contribute to its efforts. These sources include the Companys officers and other employees, outside consultants and legal counsel, experts and actuaries. In addition, the Company uses internally generated reports and statistics, such as aging of accounts receivable, as well as outside sources such as government statistics, industry reports and third party research studies. The results of these estimates and assumptions may form the basis of the carrying value of assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from estimates under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, and any such differences may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company believes the following accounting policies are critical to its business operations and the understanding of its consolidated results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. The critical accounting policies discussed below should be read together with the Companys significant accounting policies set forth in "Recent Accounting Pronouncements," of Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts In the normal course of business, the Company extends credit to its customers if they satisfy pre defined credit criteria. The Company maintains an accounts receivable allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of its customers to make required payments. An additional allowance may be required if the financial condition of the Companys customers deteriorates. The allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that management assesses to be appropriate to absorb estimated losses in the accounts receivable portfolio. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed quarterly, and changes to the allowance are made through the provision for bad debts, which is included in marketing, administrative and development expenses on the Companys consolidated statements of operations. These changes may reflect changes in economic, business and market conditions. The allowance is increased by the provision for bad debts and decreased by the amount of charge offs, net of recoveries. The provision for bad debts charged against operating results is based on several factors including, but not limited to, a regular assessment of the collectibility of specific customer balances, the length of time a receivable is past due and the Companys historical experience with its customers. In circumstances where a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations is known, the Company records a specific provision for bad debt against amounts due thereby reducing the receivable to the amount the Company reasonably assesses will be collected. If circumstances change, such as higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customers ability to pay, the Companys estimates of recoverability could be reduced by a material amount. Commitments and Contingencies Litigation On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses the potential liabilities and costs related to any lawsuits or claims brought against it. The Company accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Litigation 49 Table of Contents proceedings are evaluated on a case by case basis considering the available information, including that received from internal and outside legal counsel, to assess potential outcomes. While it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions, the Company uses its best judgment to determine if it is probable that it will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, the Company considers insurance recoveries, if any. The Company expenses legal costs, including those legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred. The Company has in the past adjusted existing accruals as proceedings have continued, been settled or otherwise provided further information on which the Company could review the likelihood of outflows of resources and their measurability, and the Company expects to do so in future periods. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery, it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that the Company has previously made. Impairment of Long Lived Assets The determination of the value of long lived assets requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company periodically reviews long lived assets, other than goodwill, for impairment whenever there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses, such as future cash flows, which are based on operational performance, market conditions and other factors, and disposition costs, may affect the carrying value of long lived assets and result in possible impairment expense in the Companys consolidated financial statements. As assumptions and estimates change in the future, the Company may be required to record an impairment charge. Goodwill In accordance with SFAS No. 142, goodwill is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. A review of goodwill may be initiated prior to or after conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may potentially be no longer recoverable. The Company uses a fair value approach to test goodwill for impairment. The Company must recognize an impairment charge for the amount, if any, by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. The Company derives an estimate of fair values for each of the Companys reporting units using a combination of an income approach and two market approaches, each based on an applicable weighting. The Company assesses the applicable weighting based on such factors as current market conditions and the quality and reliability of the data. Absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transactions, the Company believes that the use of these methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting units fair value. Fair value computed by these methods is arrived at using a number of factors, including projected future operating results, anticipated future cash flows, comparable marketplace data within a consistent industry grouping, and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties, however, related to these factors and to the Companys judgment in applying them to this analysis. Nonetheless, the Company believes that the combination of these methods provides a reasonable approach to estimate the fair value of the Companys reporting units. Assumptions for sales, earnings and cash flows for each reporting unit were consistent among these methods. The income approach is based upon the present value of expected cash flows. Expected cash flows are converted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of the future cash flows. The estimate of cash flows used is prepared on an unleveraged debt free basis. The discount rate reflects a market derived weighted average cost of capital. The Company believes that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units expected long term operating and cash flow performance. The projections are based upon the Companys best estimates of projected economic and market conditions over the related period including growth rates, estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures. Other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates, terminal value margin rates, future capital expenditures and changes in future working capital. The Company uses two market approaches. The first market approach estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by applying EBITDA multiples to the reporting units operating performance. The EBITDA multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar investment characteristics to the reporting unit. The Company believes that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value 50 Table of Contents estimate using multiples from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to its reporting units and the Company. The second market approach is based on the publicly traded common shares of the Company and the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is based on the applicable EBITDA multiples of the Company. The key estimates and assumptions that are used to determine fair value under the two market approaches includes trailing and future 12 month EBITDA results, as applicable. Under both market approaches, a control premium is applied to the calculated equity values to adjust the public trading value upward for a 100% ownership interest, where applicable. See Note 9, "Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the Companys goodwill balance and the goodwill review performed in 2008 and other related information. Self Insurance The Company retains the obligation for specified claims and losses related to property, casualty, workers compensation and employee benefit claims. The Company accrues for outstanding reported claims and claims that have been incurred but not reported based upon managements estimates of the aggregate liability for retained losses using historical experience, insurance company estimates and the estimated trends in claim values. The Companys estimates include managements and independent insurance companies assumptions regarding economic conditions, the frequency and severity of claims and claim development patterns and settlement practices. These estimates and assumptions are monitored and evaluated on a periodic basis by management and are adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances. Although management believes it has the ability to adequately project and record estimated claim payments, actual results could differ significantly from the recorded liabilities. Pensions The Company maintains a non contributory profit sharing plan and a contributory thrift and retirement savings plan in which most U.S. employees of the Company are eligible to participate. For a limited number of its U.S. employees and for some of its international employees, the Company maintains defined benefit pension plans. The Company accounts for these pension plans in accordance with SFAS No. 158, "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans." Under this accounting standard, the Company makes assumptions regarding the valuation of projected benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. The projected benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost are based on third party actuarial assumptions and estimates that are reviewed by management on an annual basis. The principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation, the expected future rate of return on plan assets and the expected rate of future compensation increases. The Company revises these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of long term trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits. In determining the discount rate, the Company utilizes market conditions and other data sources management considers reasonable based upon the profile of the remaining service life of eligible employees. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration the weighted average expected return on the Companys asset allocation, asset return data, historical return data, and the economic environment. The Company believes these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions of the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. The rate of compensation increase is based on the Companys long term plans for such increases. The measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is December 31. At December 31, 2008, the projected benefit obligation for U.S. pension plans was $53.9 million and the net periodic benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $2.9 million. At December 31, 2008, the projected benefit obligation for international pension plans was $237.8 million and the net periodic benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $14.1 million. 51  Table of Contents In general, material changes to the principal assumptions could have a material impact on the costs and liabilities recorded under SFAS No. 158. A 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate and a 100 basis point change in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in the following increases (decreases) on the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2008 and the expected net periodic benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 2009 (in millions). 25 Basis Point Increase 25 Basis Point Decrease United States Discount Rate Effect on 2008 projected benefit obligation $ (1.7 ) $ 1.8 Effect on 2009 expected net periodic benefit cost (0.1 ) 0.1 100 Basis Point Increase 100 Basis Point Decrease Return on Assets Effect on 2009 expected net periodic benefit cost $ (0.3 ) $ 0.3 25 Basis Point Increase 25 Basis Point Decrease International Discount Rate Effect on 2008 projected benefit obligation $ (7.7 ) $ 8.1 Effect on 2009 expected net periodic benefit cost (1.1 ) 0.8 100 Basis Point Increase 100 Basis Point Decrease Return on Assets Effect on 2009 expected net periodic benefit cost $ (1.6 ) $ 1.6 Income Taxes Estimates and judgments are required in the calculation of tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets. The Companys deferred tax assets arise from net deductible temporary differences and tax benefit carry forwards. The Company evaluates whether its taxable earnings during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carry forwards may be utilized should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits. For those jurisdictions where the expiration dates of tax benefit carry forwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely, the Company provides a valuation allowance. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company estimates future taxable earnings, with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax benefit carry forwards and past operating results, to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future. Changes to tax laws, statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings can have an impact on valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods, the Company may need to adjust the valuation allowance, which could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In calculating its worldwide provision for income taxes, the Company also evaluates its tax positions for years where the statutes of limitations have not expired. Based on this review, the Company may establish reserves for additional taxes and interest that could be assessed upon examination by relevant tax authorities. The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, including the results of tax audits and changes in tax law. If the payment of additional taxes and interest ultimately proves unnecessary, the reversal of the reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the reserves are no longer necessary. If an estimate of tax reserves proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to income tax provision would result. These adjustments to reserves and related expenses could materially affect the Companys consolidated financial statements. 52 Table of Contents On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48. Under FIN 48, the Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with tax authorities. See Note 15, "Income Taxes," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Summarized Quarterly Financial Information (Unaudited, in millions, except share data) 2008 First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Net sales $ 1,177.4 $ 1,278.8 $ 1,219.0 $ 1,168.3 Gross profit 305.1 330.2 293.7 307.6 Net earnings 60.8 62.6 9.2 47.3 Basic net earnings per common share $ 0.38 $ 0.40 $ 0.06 $ 0.30 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 0.33 $ 0.34 $ 0.05 $ 0.26 2007 First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Net sales $ 1,094.7 $ 1,145.4 $ 1,160.9 $ 1,250.2 Gross profit 314.2 323.3 320.1 343.5 Net earnings 127.0 73.9 72.4 79.7 Basic net earnings per common share $ 0.79 $ 0.46 $ 0.45 $ 0.50 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 0.67 $ 0.40 $ 0.39 $ 0.43 Non GAAP Information The Companys management from time to time presents information that does not conform to U.S. GAAP, including changes in net sales excluding the effects of foreign currency translation, the net impact of a business acquisition in 2008 and certain sales related to acquisitions. The Companys management uses changes in net sales excluding the items above to measure the performance of the Companys operations and to aid in the comparison of results. Thus, management believes that this information may be useful to investors. Such measures are also among the criteria upon which performance based compensation may be determined.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which may adversely affect its consolidated financial position and results of operations. The Company seeks to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company does not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rates From time to time, the Company may use interest rate swaps, collars or options to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. The Companys interest rate swaps are described in Note 12, "Derivatives and Hedging Activities," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and in "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Derivative Financial Instruments Interest Rate Swaps" contained in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Such information is incorporated herein by reference. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had no interest rate collars or options outstanding. The Company had no interest rate swaps outstanding at December 31, 2008. 53 Table of Contents The carrying value of the Companys total debt, which includes the impact of outstanding interest rate swaps in 2007, was $1,479.0 million at December 31, 2008 and $1,871.8 million at December 31, 2007. The Companys fixed rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps in 2007, was $1,430.9 million at December 31, 2008 and $1,526.1 million at December 31, 2007. The fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt varies with changes in interest rates. Generally, the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The estimated fair value of the Companys total debt, including the impact of outstanding interest rate swaps in 2007, was $1,204.8 million at December 31, 2008 compared with $1,818.4 million at December 31, 2007. A hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates would result in an increase of $74.1 million in the fair value of the total debt balance at December 31, 2008. These changes in the fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt do not alter the Companys obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount of such debt. See Note 13, "Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the methodology and inputs used to determine the fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt in accordance with SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements." Foreign Exchange Rates The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to fix the amount payable on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates at December 31, 2008 would have caused the Company to pay approximately $37.2 million to terminate these contracts. The Companys foreign currency forward contracts are described in Note 12, "Derivatives and Hedging Activities," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is contained in Part II, Item 8 and in "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Derivative Financial Instruments Foreign Currency Forward Contracts" contained in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Such information is incorporated herein by reference. The Company may use other derivative instruments from time to time, such as foreign exchange options to manage exposure due to foreign exchange rates and interest rate and currency swaps related to access to additional sources of international financing. These instruments can potentially limit foreign exchange exposure and limit or adjust interest rate exposure by swapping borrowings denominated in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had no foreign exchange options or interest rate and currency swap agreements outstanding. The Companys outstanding debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing subsidiary. The Company believes that this enables it to better match operating cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match the currency of assets and liabilities. The amount of outstanding debt denominated in a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar was $48.5 million at December 31, 2008 and $49.2 million at December 31, 2007. Available for Sale Investments The Companys available for sale investments, consisting of auction rate securities at December 31, 2008 and 2007, are exposed to market risk related to changes in conditions in the U.S. financial markets and in the financial condition of the issuers of these securities. The Companys investment in auction rate securities at December 31, 2008 and 2007 had an original cost of $44.7 million. These auction rate securities consisted of two contingent capital securities that were converted into perpetual preferred stock of Ambac Assurance Corporation ("AMBAC"), the issuer, in December 2008, and three debt instruments individually issued by Primus Financial Products LLC (maturity date 2021), River Lake Insurance Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Genworth Financial, Inc. (maturity date 2033) and Ballantyne Re Plc (maturity date 2036). These five securities historically were re auctioned every twenty eight days, which had provided a liquid market for them. However, as a result of continuing liquidity concerns affecting capital markets, particularly in the U.S., specifically for asset backed securities, every auction held by the issuers for these auction rate securities in 2008 failed. During 2008, the Company continued to receive all interest and dividend payments, totaling $2.2 million, when due. The Company accounts for these investments as available for sale investments and reviews them for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity 54 Table of Contents Securities," and other related guidance issued by the FASB and the SEC. During its impairment review, the Company has evaluated the following: in the fourth quarter of 2008, the rating agencies lowered the credit rating on all of the issuers; the timeliness and level of interest and dividend payments received from the issuers; the duration and severity in the decline in the estimated fair market value of these securities; the exercise of AMBACs put option, which converted the two contingent capital securities into non cumulative perpetual preferred stock of AMBAC Assurance in December 2008; AMBACs cancellation of dividends on its common stock in December 2008; Ballantynes notification in January 2009 that it was unable to fully fund its upcoming interest payments. As a result, Ballantyne exercised its option to rely on the insurance protection provided to it by AMBAC (UK), the issuer of an insurance wrap on this debt instrument held by the Company; and the ability and intent of the Company to hold these securities for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a recovery of their original cost. Based on the evaluation discussed above, the Company has determined that all of the securities incurred an other than temporary decline in fair market value during 2008. As a result, the Company recorded an other than temporary impairment of the market value of these securities of $34.0 million ($21.8 million, net of taxes) and established a new cost basis of $10.7 million for these securities at December 31, 2008. The Companys available for sale investments are described in more detail in Note 5, "Available for Sale Investments," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Customer Credit The Company is exposed to credit risk from its customers. In the normal course of business the Company extends credit to its customers if they satisfy pre defined credit criteria. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of its customers to make required payments. An additional allowance may be required if the financial condition of the Companys customers deteriorates. The allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that management assesses to be appropriate to absorb estimated losses in the accounts receivable portfolio. The Companys customers may default on their obligations to the Company due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. Despite uncertainties surrounding current global economic conditions and levels of credit risk, as of December 31, 2008, the Company has not experienced a significant change in its customers payment patterns or defaults. The Companys provision for bad debt expense was $9.3 million in 2008 and $2.9 million in 2007. Pensions Recent market conditions have resulted in an unusually high degree of volatility and increased risks and short term liquidity concerns associated with some of the plan assets held by the Companys defined benefit pension plans, which have impacted the performance of some of the plan assets. Based upon the annual valuation of the Companys defined benefit pension plans at December 31, 2008 the Company expects its net periodic benefit costs to increase to approximately $20.0 million in 2009 compared with $17.0 million in 2008. See Note 14, "Employee Benefits and Incentive Programs," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the Companys defined benefit pension plans. Commodities The Company uses various commodity raw materials such as plastic resins and energy products such as electric power and natural gas in conjunction with its manufacturing processes. Generally, the Company acquires these components at market prices in the region in which they will be used and does not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices. Moreover, the Companys supply chain team seeks to maintain appropriate levels of commodity raw material inventories thus minimizing the expense and risks of carrying excess inventories. The Company does not typically purchase substantial quantities in advance of production requirements. As a result, the Company is exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components. 55  Table of Contents  
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The information in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read together with the Companys consolidated financial statements and related notes set forth in Part II, Item 8, as well as the discussion included in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. All amounts and percentages are approximate due to rounding. Overview The Company is a leading global innovator and manufacturer of a wide range of packaging and performance based materials and equipment systems that serve an array of food, industrial, medical and consumer applications. At December 31, 2008, the Company employed approximately 2,600 sales, marketing and customer service personnel throughout the world who sell and market the Companys products through a large number of distributors, fabricators and converters, as well as directly to end users such as food processors, food service businesses, supermarket retailers and manufacturers. The Company has no material long term contracts for the distribution of its products. In 2008, no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10% or more of the Companys consolidated net sales. Although historically net sales of the Companys food packaging, food solutions and protective packaging products have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher in the fourth quarter, the Company does not consider seasonality to be material to its consolidated financial position or results of operations or to its reportable business segments. Competition for most of the Companys packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics, service and price. Competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology and, as a result, the Company maintains ongoing research and development programs to enable it to maintain technological leadership. The Companys net sales are sensitive to developments in its customers business or market conditions, changes in the global economy, and the effects of foreign currency translation. The Companys costs can vary with changes in input costs, including petrochemical related costs, which are not within the Companys control. Consequently, the Companys management focuses on reducing those costs that the Company can control and using petrochemical based raw materials as efficiently as possible. The Company also believes that its global presence helps to insulate it from localized changes in business conditions. The Companys businesses are managed to generate substantial operating cash flow. The Company believes that its operating cash flow will permit it to continue to spend on innovative research and development and to invest in its business by means of capital expenditures for property and equipment and acquisitions. Moreover, its ability to generate substantial operating cash flow should provide the Company with the flexibility to modify its capital structure as the need or opportunity arises. The Companys consolidated results of operations have been unfavorably impacted by the downturn in global economic conditions that began in the U.S. in late 2007 and spread globally through 2008. The combination of a reduction in customers manufacturing output, a decline in retail sales and a rise in customer inventory contraction in the fourth quarter of 2008 have negatively affected the Companys Protective Packaging segments unit volume demand globally through early 2009. The Company currently anticipates that these conditions will persist globally through at least the first half of 2009. Recent Events Senior Notes Issuance In February 2009, the Company completed a private offering of $300.0 million of 12% senior unsecured notes due 2014. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering, in addition to the Companys existing financing facilities and its cash flow from operations, to provide for its 2009 debt obligations, as well the cash payment under the Settlement agreement, if such payment is required in 2009. The Company expects to incur approximately $33.0 million of additional interest expense in 2009 related to these senior notes. Cash Tender Offer for 6.95% Senior Notes In December 2008, the Company announced a cash tender offer to purchase any and all of its outstanding 6.95% Senior Notes due May 15, 2009. The Company completed the purchase of $90.6 million 23 Table of Contents in aggregate principal amount of these notes, representing approximately 40.0% of the outstanding face value of $227.3 million. The Company paid the full tender offer consideration (100% of the principal amount), plus accrued interest, utilizing funds available from the Companys accounts receivable securitization program and available cash. Following this purchase there was a total of $136.7 million in principal amount of the notes outstanding. Cost Reduction and Productivity Program In September 2008, the Company implemented a cost reduction and productivity program. As a result, during 2008 the Company recorded $65.8 million of pre tax charges primarily for termination benefits. The Company expects to incur additional modest costs associated with this program in 2009. Cash payments primarily related to termination benefits began in 2008 with the majority to occur in 2009. Global Manufacturing Strategy In December 2008, in connection with the Companys global manufacturing strategy, the Company announced that it will close its manufacturing facility located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. This facilitys manufacturing operations will be moved to existing Company facilities in North America. The Company plans to complete this project in the second half of 2009, at which time all manufacturing operations at the Cedar Rapids facility will cease. In connection with this project, in December 2008, the Company recorded $12.2 million of pre tax charges primarily related to termination benefits. The Company expects to incur additional associated charges in 2009 and 2010. Quarterly Cash Dividends On February 19, 2009, the Companys Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per common share. This dividend is payable on March 20, 2009 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 6, 2009. The estimated amount of this dividend payment is $18.9 million based on 157.9 million shares of the Companys common stock issued and outstanding as of January 31, 2009. During 2008, the Company paid quarterly cash dividends of $76.4 million from available cash. Highlights of Financial Performance Highlights for 2008 compared with 2007 and 2006 were as follows (dollars in millions except per common share amounts): 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 % Change 2007 vs. 2006 % Change Net sales: U.S. $ 2,185.2 $ 2,118.2 $ 2,066.3 3 % 3 % % of total net sales 45.1 % 45.5 % 47.7 % International 2,658.3 2,533.0 2,261.6 5 12 % of total net sales 54.9 % 54.5 % 52.3 % Total net sales $ 4,843.5 $ 4,651.2 $ 4,327.9 4 % 8 % Gross profit $ 1,236.6 $ 1,301.1 $ 1,240.1 (5 )% 5 % % of total net sales 25.5 % 28.0 % 28.7 % Marketing, administrative and development expenses $ 755.0 $ 750.2 $ 701.1 1 % 7 % % of total net sales 15.6 % 16.1 % 16.2 % Restructuring and other charges. $ 85.1 $ 1.6 $ 12.9 # # Operating profit $ 396.5 $ 549.3 $ 526.1 (28 )% 4 % % of total net sales 8.2 % 11.8 % 12.2 % Net earnings $ 179.9 $ 353.0 $ 274.1 (49 )% 29 % Net earnings per common share: Basic $ 1.14 $ 2.21 $ 1.70 (48 )% 30 % Diluted. $ 0.99 $ 1.89 $ 1.47 (48 )% 29 % #Denotes a change equal to or greater than 100% 24 Table of Contents See below for further details about the changes in net sales by the Companys segment reporting structure and by geographic region and operating profit by the Companys segment reporting structure, and the material factors that contributed to these changes. See "Segments" and "Descriptions of the Reportable Segments and Other" of Part I, Item 1. "Business," for an expanded discussion of the products included in each of the Companys reportable segments and Other. Net Sales The principal factors contributing to changes in net sales in the three years ended December 31, 2008 were changes in unit volume, product mix, average selling prices and the effects of foreign currency translation. In addition, 2008 and 2007 had increased volumes from acquired businesses, net of dispositions. 2008 compared with 2007 Net sales for 2008 increased 4% to $4,843.5 million compared with $4,651.2 million in 2007. The components of the increase in net sales for 2008 compared with 2007 were as follows (dollars in millions): Food Packaging Food Solutions Protective Packaging Other Total Company Volume Units (0.6 )% $ (11.2 ) (1.2 )% $ (11.2 ) (5.4 )% $ (81.6 ) 1.4 % $ 4.5 (2.1 )% $ (99.5 ) Volume Acquired businesses, net of dispositions 0.6 19.4 61.5 1.3 62.1 Product Price/Mix 3.3 62.4 3.1 29.3 1.4 21.4 2.2 7.0 2.5 120.1 Foreign currency translation 1.9 35.3 2.7 25.5 2.2 33.0 5.0 15.8 2.4 109.6 Total 4.6 % $ 86.5 4.6 % $ 43.6 (1.8 )% $ (26.6 ) 28.0 % $ 88.8 4.1 % $ 192.3 Excluding the favorable effect of foreign currency translation, net sales would have increased 2% compared with 2007. The strengthening of most foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar contributed to the favorable foreign currency translation impact on net sales in 2008 compared with 2007. However, this impact includes an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of $65.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most foreign currencies. 2007 compared with 2006 Net sales for 2007 increased 8% to $4,651.2 million compared with $4,327.9 million in 2006. The components of the increase in net sales for 2007 compared with 2006 were as follows (dollars in millions): Food Packaging Food Solutions Protective Packaging Other Total Company Volume Units 3.6 % $ 63.3 4.9 % $ 41.0 (0.1 )% $ (1.8 ) 4.8 % $ 13.0 2.7 % $ 115.5 Volume Acquired businesses, net of dispositions 0.7 5.7 (1.1 ) (15.7 ) 6.1 16.3 0.1 6.3 Product Price/Mix 0.8 12.1 1.1 9.3 0.1 0.6 1.2 3.0 0.6 25.0 Foreign currency translation 3.8 66.9 5.4 45.7 3.2 47.7 6.0 16.2 4.1 176.5 Total 8.2 % $ 142.3 12.1 % $ 101.7 2.1 % $ 30.8 18.1 % $ 48.5 7.5 % $ 323.3 Excluding the favorable effect of foreign currency translation, net sales would have increased 3% compared with 2006. The strengthening of foreign currencies primarily in Europe and the Asia Pacific region against the U.S. dollar contributed $156.3 million of the $176.5 million favorable foreign currency translation impact on net sales in 2007 compared with 2006. 25 Table of Contents Net Sales by the Companys Segment Reporting Structure The following table shows the Companys net sales by the Companys segment reporting structure (dollars in millions): 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 % Change 2007 vs. 2006 % Change Net sales: Food Packaging $ 1,969.4 $ 1,882.9 $ 1,740.6 5 % 8 % As a % of total net sales 40.6 % 40.5 % 40.2 % Food Solutions 988.3 944.7 843.0 5 12 As a % of total net sales 20.4 % 20.3 % 19.5 % Protective Packaging 1,480.3 1,506.9 1,476.1 (2 ) 2 As a % of total net sales 30.6 % 32.4 % 34.1 % Other 405.5 316.7 268.2 28 18 As a % of total net sales 8.4 % 6.8 % 6.2 % Total $ 4,843.5 $ 4,651.2 $ 4,327.9 4 % 8 % Food Packaging Segment Net Sales 2008 compared with 2007 The Companys Food Packaging segment net sales increased $86.5 million, or 5%, in 2008 compared with 2007. Excluding the $35.3 million favorable effect of foreign currency translation, Food Packaging segment net sales would have increased $51.2 million, or 3%, which was primarily due to: favorable impact of product price/mix in Latin America of 8% and in the United States of 4%; and increases in unit volume in the United States of 1% and in Europe of 2%; partially offset by: a decrease in unit volume in Latin America of 8%. The favorable impacts of product price/mix in Latin America and the United States were primarily due to the positive impact of selling price increases implemented in December 2007 and during 2008 for most Food Packaging products. The increase in unit volume in the United States was primarily attributed to higher pork slaughter rates during the first half of 2008, which in turn resulted in higher sales of the Companys fresh meat packaging products. The increase in unit volume in Europe was primarily attributed to net positive trends in this region during the first half of 2008 in the fresh red meat and cheese markets, which in turn resulted in higher sales of the Companys fresh meat and dairy packaging products. The decrease in unit volume in Latin America was primarily due to market factors in Brazil. Throughout 2008, Brazilian meat exports to Europe were halted due to Brazilian meat processors lack of compliance with previously issued European food traceability and safety standards. By late 2008, the majority of Brazilian meat processors had complied with the standards, but by this time, end market demand in Europe had slowed due to a decline in meat consumption, attributable to weak economic conditions in Europe. 2007 compared with 2006 The Companys Food Packaging segment net sales increased $142.3 million, or 8%, in 2007 compared with 2006. Excluding the $66.9 million favorable effect of foreign currency translation, Food Packaging segment net sales would have increased $75.4 million, or 4%, which was primarily due to: increase in unit volume of 2% and a favorable impact of product price/mix of 2% in North America; increases in unit volume in Latin America of 12% and in the Asia Pacific region of 5%; and a favorable impact of product price/mix in Europe of 2%; partially offset by: unfavorable impact of product price/mix in the Asia Pacific region of 2%. 26 Table of Contents The increases in unit volume in North America, Latin America and the Asia Pacific region were primarily due to positive trends in red meat and pork production in North and Latin America and strong beef export rates in Brazil and Australia. Positive trends in red meat production also contributed to the favorable impact of product price/mix in North America. The favorable impact of product price/mix was also impacted by price increases implemented for select Food Packaging products in September 2006. The favorable impact of product price/mix in Europe was primarily due to improved product price/mix in developing European countries, as well as improved product mix of flexible packaging materials in Western Europe. The unfavorable impact of product price/mix in the Asia Pacific region was primarily due to the impact of lower average selling prices on some of the Companys Food Packaging products in this region. Food Solutions Segment Net Sales 2008 compared with 2007 The Companys Food Solutions segment net sales increased $43.6 million, or 5%, in 2008 compared with 2007. Excluding the $25.5 million favorable effect of foreign currency translation, Food Solutions segment net sales would have increased $18.1 million, or 2%, which was primarily due to: favorable impact of product price/mix in the United States of 6% and in Europe of 2%; and an increase in unit volume in the Asia Pacific region of 7%; partially offset by: decreases in unit volume in Europe of 4% and in the United States of 3%. The favorable impacts of product price/mix in both the United States and Europe were primarily attributed to the positive impact of selling price increases implemented in December 2007 and in 2008 for most Food Solutions products. The increase in unit volume in the Asia Pacific region was primarily attributed to product adoption by new and existing customers of the Companys case ready products. The decrease in unit volume in Europe was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of lower consumption of meats and cheeses in certain countries resulting from the deteriorating economic conditions in this region and, to a lesser extent, certain low margin business the Company decided to withdraw from in the first quarter of 2008. The decrease in unit volume in the United States was primarily due to a previously announced change by a large retailer in November 2007 opting to move from a case ready packaging format to an alternative packaging format for a portion of its meat packaging. This decrease was partially offset by increased flexible food film and vertical pouch packaging products sales to existing customers in this region. 2007 compared with 2006 The Companys Food Solutions segment net sales increased $101.7 million, or 12%, in 2007 compared with 2006. Excluding the $45.7 million favorable effect of foreign currency translation, Food Solutions segment net sales would have increased $56.0 million, or 7%, which was primarily due to: an increase in unit volume of 5% and a favorable impact of product price/mix of 1% in North America; and an increase in unit volume of 4% and a favorable impact of product price/mix of 1% in Europe. The increase in unit volume and the favorable impact of product price/mix in North America and the increase in unit volume in Europe were primarily due to steady red meat production in these regions and continued product adoption by existing and new customers, which benefited sales of the Companys case ready products. Additionally, strength in domestic crop yields and strong equipment sales benefited sales of the Companys vertical pouch packaging products in North America. Outsourced Products Included in this segment are net sales from products produced in the Companys facilities as well as products fabricated by other manufacturers, or outsourced products. Outsourced products include, among others, foam and solid plastic trays and containers fabricated in various regions and absorbent pads fabricated primarily in North America and in Europe. The Company has strategically opted to use third party manufacturers for technically less complex products as part of its business model to offer customers a 27 Table of Contents broader range of solutions. The Company has benefited from this strategy with increased net sales and operating profit requiring minimal capital expenditures. Net sales of outsourced products included in this segment amounted to $170.0 million in 2008, $180.7 million in 2007 and $165.3 million in 2006. The Companys total net sales of outsourced products were $240.0 million in 2008, $246.4 million in 2007 and $206.0 million in 2006. Protective Packaging Segment Net Sales 2008 compared with 2007 The Companys Protective Packaging segment net sales decreased $26.6 million, or 2%, compared with 2007. Excluding the $33.0 million favorable effect of foreign currency translation and a $0.6 million net impact of a business acquisition in 2008, Protective Packaging segment net sales would have decreased $60.2 million, or 4%. This decrease was primarily the result of lower unit volume in the United States of 6% and in Europe of 4%, which was principally attributable to weakening regional economic conditions and was consistent with manufacturing output, shipping and retail indicators. Partially offsetting this decrease in unit volume was the favorable impact of product price/mix in the United States of 2%, primarily attributed to the positive impact of selling price increases implemented in December 2007 and during 2008 for most Protective Packaging products. 2007 compared with 2006 The Companys Protective Packaging segment net sales increased $30.8 million, or 2%, in 2007 compared with 2006. Excluding the $47.7 million favorable effect of foreign currency translation and the $19.2 million impact of the sale of a small product line in 2007, Protective Packaging segment net sales would have been relatively flat, which was primarily due to: a decrease in unit volume in North America of 2%; partially offset by: an increase in unit volume in the Asia Pacific region of 9%. The decrease in unit volume in North America was primarily due to challenging economic conditions in 2007, which slowed the pace of customer orders. Additionally, unit volume was also negatively impacted by the effects of a net increase in average selling prices for select Protective Packaging products in 2006 and 2007, which were implemented to address rising costs of raw materials. The increase in unit volume in the Asia Pacific region was principally due to an increase in sales to new and existing customers of inflatables, shrink films and Instapak&reg; foam in place products. Other Net Sales 2008 compared with 2007 The Companys Other net sales increased $88.8 million, or 28%, in 2008 compared with 2007. Excluding $61.5 million in net sales resulting from the November 2007 acquisition of certain assets relating to Ethafoam&reg; and related polyethylene foam product lines and the August 2007 acquisition of Alga Plastics and the $15.8 million favorable effect of foreign currency translation, Other net sales would have increased $11.5 million, or 4%, primarily due to: a favorable impact of product price/mix in North America of 10%, primarily attributed to the positive impact of selling price increases for most of the Companys Specialty Materials products; and an increase in unit volume in Asia of 18%, primarily due to adoption of medical applications products by new and existing customers primarily in the first half of 2008. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in unit volume in the United States of 3%, primarily attributed to lower unit volume in some of the Companys Specialty Materials products, which was principally the result of weakening regional economic conditions and was consistent with manufacturing output indicators. 28 Table of Contents 2007 compared with 2006 The Companys Other net sales increased $48.5 million, or 18%, in 2007 compared with 2006. Excluding the $16.2 million favorable effect of foreign currency translation and $15.7 million from the acquisitions of Alga Plastics and of certain assets relating to Ethafoam&reg; and related polyethylene foam product lines in 2007, Other net sales would have increased $16.6 million, or 6%, which was primarily due to: an increase in unit volume in the Asia Pacific region of 44% and Europe of 4%, predominately due to an increase in medical applications products sales to new and existing customers; and a favorable impact of product price/mix in North America of 6%, primarily resulting from average selling price increases in the second half of 2006 related to the Companys specialty materials products, including special density foams; partially offset by: a decrease in unit volume in North America of 8%, principally due to lower net sales of specialty materials products including foams and composite materials as a result of challenging economic conditions, which slowed the pace of customer orders; and an unfavorable impact of product price/mix in Europe of 2%, primarily relating to the Companys specialty materials products, including special density foams. Net Sales by Geographic Region The following table shows net sales by geographic region (dollars in millions). 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 % Change 2007 vs. 2006 % Change Net sales: U.S. $ 2,185.2 $ 2,118.2 $ 2,066.3 3 % 3 % As a % of total net sales 45.1 % 45.5 % 47.7 % International 2,658.3 2,533.0 2,261.6 5 12 As a % of total net sales 54.9 % 54.5 % 52.3 % Total net sales $ 4,843.5 $ 4,651.2 $ 4,327.9 4 % 8 % 29  Table of Contents 2008 compared with 2007 By geographic region, the components of the $192.3 million increase in net sales for 2008 compared with 2007 were as follows (dollars in millions): U.S. International Total Company Volume Units (2.5 )% $ (52.0 ) (1.9 )% $ (47.5 ) (2.1 )% $ (99.5 ) Volume Acquired businesses, net of dispositions 1.9 40.9 0.8 21.2 1.3 62.1 Product Price/Mix 3.8 78.1 1.7 42.0 2.5 120.1 Foreign currency translation 4.3 109.6 2.4 109.6 Total 3.2 % $ 67.0 4.9 % $ 125.3 4.1 % $ 192.3 2007 compared with 2006 By geographic region, the components of the $323.3 million increase in net sales for 2007 compared with 2006 were as follows (dollars in millions): U.S. International Total Company Volume Units 1.0 % $ 21.1 4.2 % $ 94.4 2.7 % $ 115.5 Volume Acquired businesses, net of dispositions 0.1 2.4 0.2 3.9 0.1 6.3 Product Price/Mix 1.4 28.3 (0.2 ) (3.3 ) 0.6 25.0 Foreign currency translation 7.8 176.5 4.1 176.5 Total 2.5 % $ 51.8 12.0 % $ 271.5 7.5 % $ 323.3 Cost of Sales The Companys primary input costs include resins, direct and indirect labor, other raw materials and other energy related costs (including transportation costs.) The Company utilizes petrochemical based resins in the manufacture of many of its products. The costs for these raw materials are impacted by the rise and fall in crude oil and natural gas prices, since those items serve as feedstocks utilized in the production of most resins. The prices for these feedstocks have been particularly volatile in recent years. Although changes in the prices of crude oil and natural gas are not perfect benchmarks, they are indicative of the variations in raw materials and other input costs faced by the Company. The Company continues to monitor the changes in raw material and energy related costs as they occur and takes pricing actions as appropriate to lessen the impact of cost increases when they occur. The following table shows the Companys cost of sales for the three years ended December 31, 2008 (dollars in millions): 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 % Change 2007 vs. 2006 % Change Cost of sales $ 3,606.9 $ 3,350.1 $ 3,087.8 8 % 9 % As a % of net sales 74.5 % 72.0 % 71.3 % 2008 compared with 2007 The $256.8 million increase in cost of sales in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to unfavorable average petrochemical based raw material costs of approximately $125.0 million, which was experienced in the first nine months of 2008, the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $72.6 million and higher input costs, including unfavorable freight and energy related costs in 2008 of approximately $26.0 million. Incremental expenses included in cost of sales in 2008, which related to the 2007 acquisitions of Ethafoam&reg; and related polyethylene foam product lines and Alga Plastics, amounted to approximately $54.0 million. Expenses included in cost of sales related to the implementation of the Companys global manufacturing strategy were $7.4 million in 2008, compared with $11.1 million in 2007. These items were partially offset by the impact of expense control initiatives in 2008. 30 Table of Contents 2007 compared with 2006 The $262.3 million increase in cost of sales in 2007 compared with 2006 was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $129.9 million, higher input costs to support the increase in unit volume of product sales, and unfavorable average petrochemical based raw material costs of approximately $19.0 million. Expenses included in cost of sales related to the implementation of the Companys global manufacturing strategy were $11.1 million in 2007 compared with $3.8 million in 2006. Marketing, Administrative and Development Expenses The following table shows the Companys marketing, administrative and development expenses for the three years ended December 31, 2008 (dollars in millions): 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 % Change 2007 vs. 2006 % Change Marketing, administrative and development expenses $ 755.0 $ 750.2 $ 701.1 1 % 7 % As a % of net sales 15.6 % 16.1 % 16.2 % 2008 compared with 2007 Marketing, administrative and development expenses increased $4.8 million in 2008 compared with 2007. These expenses increased due to the following: the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $18.9 million; additional expenses of $5.4 million in 2008 related to businesses acquired in the second half of 2007; an increase in provision for bad debt expense of $5.3 million (substantially all in the fourth quarter of 2008), primarily related to current credit conditions affecting some of the Companys Food Packaging and Protective Packaging customers; and additional operating expenses of $3.4 million in 2008 related to the Companys New Ventures businesses, which includes spending related to innovation and new product introductions including spending related to renewable products. These increases were largely offset by: lower management incentive compensation expenses of $22.0 million, of which $14.1 million occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008, resulting from the Company not meeting some of its 2008 financial performance goals; and a decrease in information systems expenses of $6.3 million, primarily due to expense control initiatives in 2008. 2007 compared with 2006 Marketing, administrative and development expenses increased $49.1 million in 2007 compared with 2006. This increase was primarily due to: the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $27.2 million; additional expenses of $6.9 million in 2007 related to innovation and new product introductions including spending related to renewable products; additional expenses of $2.8 million in 2007 related to the upgrade of the Companys information technology platforms; and additional expenses of $2.6 million in 2007 of incremental expenses related to the new state of the art North American customer service center opened in 2007. 31 Table of Contents Cost Reduction and Productivity Program and Global Manufacturing Strategy Cost Reduction and Productivity Program In 2008, the Company implemented its cost reduction and productivity program. As a result, the Company recorded $65.8 million of pre tax charges primarily for termination benefits. See below for further details on the restructuring charges related to this program. These charges were included in restructuring and other charges on the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 3, "Business Segment Information," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for restructuring and other charges by the Companys segment reporting structure. The Company expects to incur additional modest costs associated with this program in 2009. The Company expects to achieve annual savings from this program of approximately $50.0 million to $60.0 million beginning in 2009. These savings will appear in both cost of sales and marketing, administrative and development expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. The restructuring and other charges related to this program consisted of the following: Termination benefits $ 62.7 SFAS No. 88 curtailment charge 1.6 Other associated costs 1.5 Total $ 65.8 The components of the restructuring accrual through December 31, 2008 and the accrual balance remaining at December 31, 2008 related to this program were as follows: Original restructuring accrual $ 59.9 Additional accrual for termination benefits of $2.9 million and other associated costs of $1.5 million 4.4 Cash payments made during 2008 (18.1 ) Effect of changes in foreign currency rates (2.5 ) Restructuring accrual at December 31, 2008 $ 43.7 The Company expects to pay $41.2 million of the accrual balance remaining at December 31, 2008 within the next year. This amount is included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2008. The remaining accrual of $2.5 million is expected to be paid in 2010 and is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2008. Global Manufacturing Strategy The Companys global manufacturing strategy, when fully implemented, will expand production in regions where demand for the Companys products and services has been growing significantly. At the same time, the Company intends to optimize certain manufacturing capacity in North America and Europe into centers of excellence. The goals of this multi year program are to expand capacity in growing markets, further improve the Companys operating efficiencies, and implement new technologies more effectively. The Company expects this program to produce meaningful savings. By taking advantage of new technologies and streamlining production on a global scale, the Company expects to continue to enhance its profitable growth and its global leadership position. In July 2006, the Company announced the first phase of this multi year global manufacturing strategy. At the end of 2008, the construction phase of the program was substantially complete. The capital expenditures and associated costs and related restructuring charges for this strategy in 2008, 2007 and 2006 are included in the table below. The combined capital expenditures and related costs to implement this program are expected to total approximately $220.0 million. The Company has realized approximately $25.0 million in benefits from this program in 2008, and these benefits are expected to increase to annual benefits of $45.0 million in 2009 and to $55.0 million in 2010 and thereafter. The actual timing of future 32 Table of Contents capital expenditures and related costs is subject to change due to a variety of factors that may cause a portion of the spending and resulting benefits to occur in future periods. Year Ended December 31, Cumulative Through December 31, 2008 2008 2007 2006 Capital expenditures $ 59.5 $ 58.5 $ 14.7 $ 132.7 Associated costs(1) 7.4 11.4 3.8 22.6 Restructuring and other charges(2) 19.3 0.7 11.8 31.8 (1)The associated costs principally include equipment relocation and facility start up costs, which are primarily included in cost of sales on the consolidated statements of operations. These charges by segment and Other were as follows: 2008 2007 2006 Food Packaging $ 4.0 $ 10.2 $ 3.5 Food Solutions 0.6 Protective Packaging 2.6 0.9 Other 0.2 0.3 0.3 Total $ 7.4 $ 11.4 $ 3.8 (2)The restructuring and other charges were primarily for termination benefits, the majority of which were related to the Food Packaging segment. These charges were included in restructuring and other charges on the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 3, "Business Segment Information," for restructuring and other charges by reportable segment and Other. A reconciliation of the restructuring accrual is included below. The restructuring and other charges of $19.3 million related to this program in 2008 were primarily related to the Companys decision to close its manufacturing facility in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. This facilitys manufacturing operations will be moved to existing Company facilities in North America. The Company plans to complete this project within the second half of 2009, at which time all manufacturing operations at the Cedar Rapids facility will cease. The Company expects to incur additional associated charges in 2009 and 2010. The restructuring charges recorded in connection with this closure consisted of the following: Termination benefits $ 8.6 SFAS No. 88 curtailment charge 3.6 Total $ 12.2 During 2008, the Company also recorded restructuring and other charges of $7.1 million primarily related to termination benefits incurred in connection with other projects associated with this program. The components of the restructuring accrual through December 31, 2008 and the accrual balance remaining at December 31, 2008 were as follows: Restructuring accrual at December 31, 2007 $ 8.2 Additional accrual for termination benefits 13.3 Cash payments during 2008 (6.3 ) Effect of changes in foreign currency rates (0.8 ) Restructuring accrual at December 31, 2008 $ 14.4 The Company expects to pay $7.5 million of the accrual balance remaining at December 31, 2008 within the next year. This amount is included in other current liabilities on the Companys consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2008. The remaining accrual of $6.9 million is expected to be paid in 2010 and is included in other liabilities on the Companys consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2008. 33 Table of Contents Other Restructuring Activity In 2007, the Company recorded $0.9 million of restructuring charges, net, primarily for termination benefits incurred in connection with the Companys consolidation of its customer service activities in North America. In 2006, the Company recorded $1.1 million of restructuring charges of which $0.6 million related to termination benefits incurred in connection with the Companys consolidation of its Food Packaging customer service activities in Canada and $0.5 million was related to a series of profit improvement plans in various geographic regions for its Food Packaging segment implemented in 2004. Operating Profit by Business Segment and Other As previously discussed, management evaluates the performance of each reportable segment based on its operating profit. Operating profit by business segment and other for the three years ended December 31, 2008 was as follows (dollars in millions): 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007% Change 2007 vs. 2006% Change Operating profit: Food Packaging $ 217.5 $ 228.2 $ 214.6 (5 )% 6 % As a % of Food Packaging net sales 11.0 % 12.1 % 12.3 % As a % of total operating profit (1) 45.2 % 41.4 % 39.8 % Food Solutions $ 80.0 $ 86.1 $ 87.3 (7 )% (1 )% As a % of Food Solutions net sales 8.1 % 9.1 % 10.4 % As a % of total operating profit(1) 16.6 % 15.6 % 16.2 % Protective Packaging $ 169.1 $ 208.6 $ 206.7 (19 )% 1 % As a % of Protective Packaging net sales 11.4 % 13.8 % 14.0 % As a % of total operating profit(1) 35.1 % 37.9 % 38.3 % Other $ 15.0 $ 28.0 $ 30.4 (46 )% (8 )% As a % of Other net sales 3.7 % 8.8 % 11.3 % As a % of total operating profit (1) 3.1 % 5.1 % 5.7 % Total segments and other $ 481.6 $ 550.9 $ 539.0 (13 )% 2 % As a % of total net sales(1) 9.9 % 11.8 % 12.5 % Restructuring and other charges(2) 85.1 1.6 12.9 Total $ 396.5 $ 549.3 $ 526.1 (28 )% 4 % As a % of total net sales 8.2 % 11.8 % 12.2 % (1)Before taking into consideration restructuring and other charges. (2)The restructuring and other charges by the Companys segment reporting structure were as follows: 2008 2007 2006 Food Packaging $ 46.2 $ 0.5 $ 13.0 Food Solutions 15.1 0.1 Protective Packaging 18.8 1.0 (0.1 ) Other 5.0 Total $ 85.1 $ 1.6 $ 12.9 In 2008, the Company implemented a cost reduction and productivity program. The restructuring charges primarily related to termination benefits for this program were $65.8 million in 2008. The remaining $19.3 million of restructuring and other charges in 2008 was related to the Companys global manufacturing strategy. Restructuring and other charges in 2007 were primarily related to termination costs for the consolidation of the Companys customer service activities in North America of $0.8 million and for the global manufacturing strategy of $0.8 million. The restructuring and other charges in 2006 were primarily related to the Companys global manufacturing strategy. See "Cost Reduction and Productivity Program and Global Manufacturing Strategy," above for further discussion. 34 Table of Contents Food Packaging Segment Operating Profit 2008 compared with 2007 The decrease in operating profit as a percentage of this segments net sales in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to higher input costs including unfavorable average petrochemical based raw material costs of approximately $60.0 million and freight and utilities costs of approximately $14.0 million. These items were partially offset by the favorable impact of product price/mix and lower management incentive compensation expenses of approximately $9.0 million, discussed above. Expenses in this segment related to the implementation of the Companys global manufacturing strategy were $4.0 million in 2008 compared with $10.2 million in 2007. 2007 compared with 2006 The decrease in operating profit as a percentage of this segments net sales in 2007 compared with 2006 was primarily due to higher input costs including unfavorable average petrochemical based raw material costs of approximately $10.0 million incurred to support the increased volume of product sales and an increase in marketing, administrative and development expenses. Expenses in this segment related to the implementation of the Companys global manufacturing strategy were $10.2 million in 2007 compared with $3.5 million in 2006. Food Solutions Segment Operating Profit 2008 compared with 2007 The decrease in operating profit as a percentage of this segments net sales in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to higher input costs, including unfavorable average petrochemical based raw material costs of approximately $20.0 million and freight and utilities costs of approximately $4.0 million. These items were partially offset by the favorable product price/mix and lower management incentive compensation expenses of approximately $4.0 million, discussed above. 2007 compared with 2006 The decrease in operating profit as a percentage of this segments net sales in 2007 compared with 2006 was primarily due to the impact of higher marketing, administrative and development expenses discussed above, including expenses related to new product development. This segment experienced higher input costs in 2007 compared with 2006, but this was offset by the improved contribution from increased net sales, including favorable product/mix. Protective Packaging Segment Operating Profit 2008 compared with 2007 The decrease in operating profit as a percentage of this segments net sales in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to higher input costs, including unfavorable average petrochemical based raw material costs of approximately $30.0 million and freight and utilities costs of approximately $5.0 million. Also contributing to this decrease was the decline in unit volume, which was partially offset by the favorable product price/mix and lower management incentive compensation expenses of approximately $7.0 million discussed above. 2007 compared with 2006 This segments operating profit as a percentage of its net sales in 2007 compared with 2006 remained relatively flat, which was primarily attributable to selling price increases implemented in 2007 and 2006, which helped offset higher input costs, including unfavorable average petrochemical based raw material costs of approximately $3.0 million, and the impact of higher marketing, administrative and development expenses discussed above. 35 Table of Contents Other Operating Profit 2008 compared with 2007 The decrease in operating profit as a percentage of Other net sales in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to higher input costs including unfavorable average petrochemical based raw materials costs of approximately $10.0 million and freight and utilities costs of approximately $10.0 million, which included additional freight costs related to the Ethafoam&reg; foam product lines. These higher input costs were partially offset by favorable product price/mix discussed above. This businesss operating profit was also unfavorably impacted by an interim supply and distribution agreement for the Ethafoam&reg; foam product lines. The Company completed the construction of additional capacity in the United States to produce these products prior to the end of this interim agreement. The Company expects margins related to these products to improve in 2009. This businesss operating profit was also unfavorably impacted by the additional expenses related to innovation and new product introductions discussed above. 2007 compared to 2006 The decrease in operating profit as a percentage of Other net sales in 2007 compared with 2006 was primarily due to higher marketing, administrative and development expenses discussed above, of which $1.7 million was associated with the Companys majority ownership in Biosphere. Interest Expense Interest expense includes the stated interest rate on the Companys outstanding debt, as well as the net impact of capitalized interest, the effects of interest rate swaps and the amortization of capitalized senior debt issuance costs, bond discounts, and terminated treasury locks. Interest expense for the three years ended December 31, 2008 was as follows (dollars in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Interest expense $ 91.2 $ 105.6 $ 114.8 Interest expense on the amount payable pursuant to the Settlement agreement 36.9 35.0 33.2 Total interest expense $ 128.1 $ 140.6 $ 148.0 2008 compared with 2007 The $12.5 million decrease in interest expense in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to the following: a $17.7 million decrease due to the retirement of the Companys 5.375% Senior Notes on their maturity date in April 2008; partially offset by: an increase of $2.0 million due to borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facility in 2008; and an increase of $1.9 million as a result of additional expense related to the compounding of interest on the amount payable pursuant to the Settlement agreement. 2007 compared with 2006 The $7.4 million decrease in interest expense in 2007 compared with 2006 was primarily due to the following: a $7.2 million decrease due to the retirement of the Companys 5.625% euro notes in July 2006; a decrease of $4.3 million related to higher capitalized interest during the construction of capital investment projects in 2007 compared with 2006; 36  Table of Contents partially offset by: an increase of $1.8 million as a result of additional expense related to the compounding of interest on the amount payable pursuant to the Settlement agreement; and an increase of $1.2 million due to the impact of higher interest rates on the Companys $300.0 million of outstanding interest rate swaps entered into to effectively convert its 5.375% Senior Notes due April 2008 into floating rate debt. The Company expects to incur approximately $33.0 million of additional interest expense in 2009 related to its 12.0% Senior Notes. However, assuming the Company does not make the payment under the Settlement agreement in 2009, this additional interest expense is expected to be partially offset by a decrease in interest expense related to lower borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facility and a decrease in costs associated with lower utilization of the Companys accounts receivables securitization program. The net unfavorable impact from the above items in 2009 is expected to be approximately $25.0 million. Gain on Sale of Equity Method Investment In the first quarter of 2007, the Company sold its 50 percent investment in PolyMask Corporation to its joint venture partner, 3M Company (the "PolyMask transaction"). The joint venture was formed in 1991 between the Company and 3M to produce and sell non packaging surface protection films. Prior to the sale, the Company accounted for this joint venture under the equity method of accounting. The Company received an aggregate cash amount of $36.0 million for the transaction and other related assets and recorded a pre tax gain of $35.3 million ($22.4 million after tax) in the first quarter of 2007. This gain was included in gain on the sale of equity method investment on the consolidated statement of operations. The Companys investment in this joint venture was not material to the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. Impairment of Available for Sale Securities In 2008, the Company recorded $34.0 million of other than temporary impairment charges, of which $20.3 million occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008. These charges were related to the decline in fair market value of its $44.7 million investments in auction rate securities. See Note 5, "Available for Sale Investments," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys investments in auction rate securities. Other (Expense) Income, Net The following table provides details of the Companys other income, net (dollars in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Interest and dividend income $ 14.1 $ 19.9 $ 16.8 Net foreign exchange transaction losses (16.0 ) (6.4 ) (4.1 ) Settlement agreement and related costs (1.5 ) (0.7 ) (1.6 ) Advisory expenses incurred prior to ceasing work on an acquisition (7.5 ) Loss on sale of small product line (6.8 ) Gain on termination of forward starting interest rate swaps 3.7 Other, net (8.7 ) 9.8 10.9 Other (expense) income, net $ (12.1 ) $ 12.0 $ 22.0 Interest and dividend income decreased in 2008 compared with 2007 and 2006 primarily due to the use of available cash and cash equivalents to retire the 5.375% Senior Notes on the date of their maturity and lower interest rates paid on the Companys invested cash. Net foreign exchange transaction losses increased $9.6 million in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the latter part of 2008, particularly against foreign currencies in developing markets. 37 Table of Contents Other, net, includes the costs associated with the Companys receivables securitization program. These costs primarily relate to the losses on the sale of the undivided ownership interests in 2008, program fees, commitment fees and other associated costs which totaled $3.4 million in 2008. The program and commitment fees and other associated costs were $0.4 million in 2007 and $0.3 million in 2006. There were no costs related to losses on the sale of receivables interests in 2007 and 2006 since the Company did not sell any receivables interests during these years. Income Taxes The Companys effective income tax rate was 19.1% for 2008, 22.6% for 2007 and 31.5% for 2006. The Company expects an effective income tax rate of approximately 27.7% for 2009. The Companys income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the following benefits: $3.6 million due to a change in assertion under Accounting Principles Board Opinion 23, or APB 23, with regard to certain foreign earnings; $2.5 million of income tax benefits recognized related to the utilization of loss carryforwards in a foreign jurisdiction for which no benefit had previously been recognized for financial reporting purposes; $3.2 million of income tax benefits related to a reduction in the estimated cost of repatriating certain foreign earnings; and $6.1 million of income tax benefits related to tax accruals, and related interest, for contingencies that did not materialize primarily due to the expiration of the statutes of limitations. For 2008, the effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35.0% primarily due to the lower net effective income tax rate on foreign earnings, and to a lesser extent, the items noted above. For 2007, the effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35.0% primarily due to the reversal of the tax accruals and related interest and, to a lesser extent, the lower net effective income tax rate on foreign earnings, partially offset by state income taxes. For 2006, the effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35.0% primarily due to the lower net effective income tax rate on foreign earnings, partially offset by the effect of state income taxes. On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes." As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the Company recognized no change in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 15, "Income Taxes," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Liquidity and Capital Resources The discussion that follows contains: a description of the Companys material commitments and contingencies, a description of the Companys principal sources of liquidity, a description of the Companys outstanding indebtedness, an analysis of the Companys historical cash flows and changes in working capital, a description of the Companys derivative financial instruments, and a description of changes in the Companys shareholders equity. 38 Table of Contents Material Commitments and Contingencies Settlement agreement and Related Costs The Company recorded a charge of $850.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, of which $512.5 million represents a cash payment that the Company is required to make (subject to the satisfaction of the terms and conditions of the Settlement agreement) upon the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy of W.R. Grace & Co. The Company did not use cash in any period with respect to this liability. While confirmation hearings on the PI Settlement Plan are currently scheduled for June and September 2009 (with potential pre trial conferences currently scheduled in July), the Company does not know whether or when a final plan of reorganization will become effective or whether the final plan will be consistent with the terms of the Settlement agreement. The Company currently expects to fund this payment by using a combination of accumulated cash and future cash flows from operations and funds available under its revolving credit facility or its accounts receivable securitization program, both described below, as well as funds available from the Companys recently issued 12% Senior Notes. The cash payment of $512.5 million accrues interest at a 5.5% annual rate, which is compounded annually, from December 21, 2002 to the date of payment. The Company has recorded this accrued interest in Settlement agreement and related accrued interest on its consolidated balance sheets, and these amounts were $195.3 million at December 31, 2008 and $158.4 million at December 31, 2007. The information set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K in Note 16, "Commitments and Contingencies," under the caption "Settlement agreement and Related Costs" is incorporated herein by reference. Cryovac Transaction; Contingencies Related to the Cryovac Transaction The information set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K in Note 16, "Commitments and Contingencies," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption "Cryovac Transaction" and Contingencies Related to the Cryovac Transaction" is incorporated herein by reference. Other Litigation The information set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K in Note 16, "Commitments and Contingencies," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption "Other Litigation" is incorporated herein by reference. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the Companys principal contractual obligations and sets forth the amounts of required or contingently required cash outlays in 2009 and future years (amounts in millions): Payments Due by Years Contractual Obligations Total 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Short term borrowings $ 37.6 $ 37.6 $ $ $ Current portion of long term debt exclusive of debt discounts 151.5 151.5 Long term debt, exclusive of debt discounts 1,292.1 441.4 400.6 450.1 Total debt(1)(2) 1,481.2 189.1 441.4 400.6 450.1 Operating leases 151.0 32.6 48.4 28.3 41.7 Cash portion of the Settlement agreement, including accrued interest at December 31, 2008(3) 707.8 707.8 First quarter 2009 quarterly cash dividend declared 18.9 18.9 Accounts receivable securitization program 80.0 80.0 Other principal contractual obligations 162.3 70.1 87.0 5.2 Total contractual cash obligations $ 2,601.2 $ 1,098.5 $ 576.8 $ 434.1 $ 491.8 (1)These amounts include principal maturities (at face value) only. These amounts also include the Companys contractual obligations under capital leases of $5.3 million in 2009, $10.0 million in 2010 2011 and $0.5 million in 2012 2013. 39 Table of Contents (2)The 2010 period includes the Companys 3% convertible Senior Notes since the holders of these notes have the option to require the Company to repurchase the senior notes on June 30 of 2010, 2013, 2018, 2023 and 2028. See Note 11, "Debt and Credit Facilities," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (3)This liability is reflected as a current liability due to the uncertainty of the timing of payment. Interest accrues on this amount at a rate of 5.5% per annum, compounded annually, until it becomes due and payable. Current Portion of Long Term Debt and Long Term Debt The debt shown in the above table excludes unamortized bond discounts as of December 31, 2008 and therefore represents the principal amount of the debt required to be repaid in each period. Operating Leases The Company is obligated under the terms of various operating leases covering some of the facilities that it occupies and some production equipment. The contractual operating lease obligations listed in the table above represent estimated future minimum annual rental commitments under non cancelable real and personal property leases as of December 31, 2008. Cash portion of the Settlement agreement The Settlement agreement is described more fully in "Settlement agreement and Related Costs," of Note 16, "Commitments and Contingencies," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Principal Contractual Obligations Other principal contractual obligations include agreements to purchase an estimated amount of goods, including raw materials, or services, including energy, in the normal course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the purchase. Liability for Unrecognized Tax Benefits At December 31, 2008, the Company had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest of $5.0 million, which is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2008, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the future period or periods of cash settlement of these liabilities. See Note 15, "Income Taxes," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has reviewed its off balance sheet arrangements and has determined that none of those arrangements have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $80.0 million outstanding under its accounts receivable securitization program. See Note 6, "Accounts Receivable Securitization Program," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Interest Payments The Company currently expects to pay from $95.0 million to $105.0 million of interest payments in 2009, including the impact of the Companys recently issued 12% Senior Notes. The actual interest paid in 2009 may be different from this amount if interest rates change or if the Company repurchases existing indebtedness or incurs indebtedness under its existing lines of credit or otherwise. These 2009 expected interest payments do not reflect payment of any accrued interest related to the Settlement agreement. Income Tax Payments The Company currently expects to pay between $85.0 million and $95.0 million in income taxes in 2009, assuming it does not make the Settlement agreement payment in 2009. 40 Table of Contents Contributions to Defined Benefit Pension Plans The Company maintains defined benefit pension plans for a limited number of its U.S. employees and for some of its non U.S. employees. The Company currently expects employer contributions to be approximately $15.0 million to $20.0 million in 2009, primarily due to the decline in fair value of plan assets. Termination Benefit Payments In connection with the cost reduction and productivity program and the global manufacturing strategy, the Company currently expects to pay approximately $48.7 million in 2009 and $9.4 million in 2010 related to termination benefits. Environmental Matters The Company is subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations, and it accrues for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. These accruals do not take into account any discounting for the time value of money and are not reduced by potential insurance recoveries, if any. The Company does not believe that it is reasonably possible that its liability in excess of the amounts that it has accrued for environmental matters will be material to its consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets or cash flows. The Company reassesses environmental liabilities whenever circumstances become better defined or it can better estimate remediation efforts and their costs. The Company evaluates these liabilities periodically based on available information, including the progress of remedial investigations at each site, the current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible parties. As some of these issues are decided (the outcomes of which are subject to uncertainties) or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated, the Company adjusts the recorded accruals, as necessary. The Company believes that these exposures are not material to its consolidated financial position and results of operations. The Company believes that it has adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures. Principal Sources of Liquidity The Company requires cash to fund operating expenses, capital expenditures, interest, taxes and dividends and to pay its debt obligations and other long term liabilities as they come due. The Companys principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, accumulated cash and amounts available under its existing lines of credit described below, including the revolving credit facility and the ANZ facility, and its accounts receivable securitization program. As of December 31, 2008, the following material cash obligations will be due or contingently due within the next 18 months (dollars in millions): 6.95% Senior Notes due May 15, 2009 $ 136.7 Settlement agreement and related accrued interest 707.8 3% Convertible Senior Notes due June 2033 431.3 The holders of the 3% convertible Senior Notes have the option to require the Company to repurchase these notes on June 30, 2010, 2013, 2018, 2023 and 2028, or upon the occurrence of a fundamental change in or a termination of trading of the Companys common stock, at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. With respect to the Settlement agreement and related accrued interest, the Company does not know whether or when a final plan of reorganization for Grace will become effective or whether the final plan will be consistent with the terms of the Settlement agreement. See "Settlement agreement and Related Costs," above for further discussion. Graces PI Settlement Plan is subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions. As part of this plan, Grace has included, as a condition to the plans effectiveness, exit financing in the amount and on terms satisfactory to Grace, adding to the uncertainty as to when the plan might become effective. The Company has considered a variety of options to fund its obligation under the Settlement agreement, depending on when this funding would take place. The Companys existing sources of liquidity are expected to be sufficient to provide for the payment of the Settlement agreement, and the Company will regularly reassess the sufficiency of its funds. 41 Table of Contents The Company expects to have sufficient liquidity from a combination of available cash and cash equivalents, the net proceeds from the issuance of the 12.0% Senior Notes in February 2009 and, subject to availability, funds from the Companys committed lines of credit, including its revolving credit facility and the ANZ facility, and its accounts receivable securitization program to retire the remaining outstanding balance of the 6.95% Senior Notes in May 2009. Similarly, the Company expects to have sufficient liquidity from cash provided by operating activities and from the revolving credit facility to retire its 3% Convertible Senior Notes in June 2010 if the holders exercise their put option. Depending on the timing of the above contingent events, the Companys actual amount of cash flow provided by operations and the availability of funds under the Companys existing lines of credit and the accounts receivable securitization program, the Company may need to raise additional funds from external sources. These funds would be sought at market terms and conditions and could include a combination of short and medium term debt as well as equity offerings. However, there is no assurance as to the future cost or availability of external funds, and the Company may experience difficulty obtaining external funding and could incur increased financing costs. Cash tax benefits resulting from the payment made under the Settlement agreement are expected to increase the cash available to repay any borrowings made to fund the Settlement agreement. These tax benefits, which are recorded as a deferred tax asset, are anticipated to provide approximately $300.0 million of future cash tax benefits from the time the payment under the Settlement agreement is made. However, the amount of future cash tax benefits could vary, depending on the value of the Companys common stock and the Companys tax situation at that time. Lines of Credit The following table summarizes the Companys available lines of credit and committed and uncommitted lines of credit, including the revolving credit facility and the ANZ facility discussed below, at December 31, 2008 and 2007: December 31, 2008 2007 Used lines of credit $ 46.7 $ 46.4 Unused lines of credit 773.4 823.8 Total available lines of credit $ 820.1 $ 870.2 Available lines of credit committed $ 588.8 $ 646.0 Available lines of credit uncommitted 231.3 224.2 Total available lines of credit $ 820.1 $ 870.2 The Companys principal credit lines were committed and consisted of the revolving credit facility and the ANZ facility. The Company is not subject to any material compensating balance requirements in connection with its lines of credit. The Revolving Credit Facility The revolving credit facility is available for general corporate purposes, including the payment of amounts required to be paid upon the effectiveness of the Settlement agreement. The Company may re borrow amounts repaid under the revolving credit facility from time to time prior to the expiration or earlier termination of the revolving credit facility. The Companys obligations under the revolving credit facility bear interest at floating rates, which are generally determined by adding the applicable borrowing margin to the base rate or the interbank rate for the relevant currency and time period. The revolving credit facility provides for changes in borrowing margins based on the Companys long term senior unsecured debt ratings. The facility has an expiration date of July 26, 2012. The terms include a requirement that, upon the occurrence of specified events that would adversely affect the Settlement agreement or would materially increase the Companys liability in respect of the Grace bankruptcy or the asbestos liability arising from the Cryovac transaction, the Company would be required to repay any amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility, or refinance the facility, within 60 days. See "Settlement agreement and Related Costs" and "Cryovac Transaction" and "Contingencies Related to 42 Table of Contents the Cryovac Transaction," of Note 16, "Commitments and Contingencies," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. The revolving credit facility commitments include $28.0 million provided by Lehman Commercial Paper Inc., a subsidiary of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. As a result of the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries in September 2008, Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. is no longer funding borrowing requests under the revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2008, the total amount available under the revolving credit facility was approximately $472.0 million. On December 12, 2008, the parties to the revolving credit facility entered into an amendment that modified some definitions and calculations of the financial covenants in the revolving credit facility, including changes to the definition of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. In addition, while the current total amount available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility is approximately $472.0 million, the amendment also provides a mechanism to increase the total facility size to a maximum of $750.0 million. This does not represent a commitment by the lenders to increase the facility size; rather, it provides the Company with a simplified method of requesting an increase at a later date if desired and market conditions permit. This mechanism is not included in the available lines of credit table above. This amendment provided for up front fees for timely agreement to the amendment, increased facility fees, and increased drawn pricing. Facility fees are payable at the rate of 0.20% per annum on the total amounts available under the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility provides for changes in facility fees based on the Companys long term senior unsecured debt ratings. Also, this amendment provides for springing subsidiary guarantees if the Companys long term senior unsecured debt ratings by both Moodys and Standard & Poors fall below investment grade. See Note 11, "Debt and Credit Facilities," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the revolving credit facility. ANZ Facility The Company has a 170.0 million Australian dollar, dual currency revolving credit facility, known as the ANZ facility, equivalent to U.S. $116.8 million at December 31, 2008, due March 2010. A syndicate of banks made this facility available to a group of the Companys Australian and New Zealand subsidiaries for general corporate purposes, including refinancing of previously outstanding indebtedness. The Company may re borrow amounts repaid under the ANZ facility from time to time prior to the expiration or earlier termination of the facility. The Company plans to renew or replace the ANZ credit facility prior to its expiration date. However, there is no assurance that the syndicate of banks will renew or replace this facility. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had an outstanding balance of 9.4 million Australian dollars, which was equivalent to U.S. $6.5 million. Other Lines of Credit Substantially all of the Companys short term borrowings of $37.6 million at December 31, 2008 and $36.5 million at December 31, 2007 were outstanding under lines of credit available to several of the Companys foreign subsidiaries. The weighted average interest rate on these outstanding lines of credit was 11.2% at December 31, 2008 and 11.0% at December 31, 2007. Amounts available under these credit lines were $222.2 million ($191.1 million unused) at December 31, 2008 and $214.2 million ($177.8 million unused) at December 31, 2007. Accounts Receivable Securitization Program The Company and a group of its U.S. subsidiaries maintain an accounts receivable securitization program with a bank and an issuer of commercial paper administered by the bank. In December 2007, the maximum purchase limit for receivables interests was increased from $125.0 million to $135.0 million and the program expiration date was extended to December 2, 2012. In December 2008, the parties amended the program to increase the maximum purchase limit for receivables interests from $135.0 million to $160.0 million. The amounts available from time to time under the program may be less than $160.0 million subject to the level of the eligible assets included in the U.S. accounts receivable portfolio. The level of eligible assets can be impacted by a number of factors, including but not limited to the Companys net sales, the creditworthiness of the underlying customers accounts receivable balances and the Companys receivables collection experience. 43  Table of Contents The program includes a bank financing commitment that must be renewed annually prior to the expiration date. The bank financing commitment is scheduled to expire on December 4, 2009. The Company plans to seek an additional 364 day renewal of the bank financing commitment prior to its expiration but the bank is not obligated to renew the bank financing commitment. From time to time during 2008, the Company utilized the program and sold eligible U.S. accounts receivables to its indirectly wholly owned subsidiary SA Funding. which in turn sold undivided ownership interests in receivables under the program to an unaffiliated buyer, and these amounts were removed from the assets reflected on the Companys consolidated balance sheet at the time of the sales. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $80.0 million outstanding under the program. SA Funding did not sell any receivables interests under the program during 2007. Therefore, the Company did not remove any related amounts from the assets reflected on the Companys consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2007. See Note 6, "Accounts Receivable Securitization Program," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning this program. Covenants At December 31, 2008, the Company was in compliance with its financial covenants and limitations, as discussed in "Covenants," of Note 11, "Debt and Credit Facilities," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Debt Ratings The Companys cost of capital and ability to obtain external financing may be affected by its debt ratings, which the credit rating agencies review periodically. In January 2009, Standard & Poors revised the Companys long term senior unsecured debt rating from BBB to BB+ and revised the outlook to stable. The revised rating is considered below investment grade. The Companys long term senior unsecured debt rating is currently rated Baa3 (negative outlook) by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. This rating is considered investment grade. If the Companys credit ratings are further downgraded, there could be a negative impact on the Companys ability to access capital markets and borrowing costs could increase. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Outstanding Indebtedness At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Companys total debt outstanding consisted of the amounts set forth in the following table (dollars in millions). See Note 11, "Debt and Credit Facilities," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Companys debt. December 31, 2008 2007 Short term borrowings $ 37.6 $ 36.5 Current portion of long term debt 151.5 303.7 Total current debt 189.1 340.2 Total long term debt, less current portion 1,289.9 1,531.6 Total debt $ 1,479.0 $ 1,871.8 44 Table of Contents Analysis of Historical Cash Flow The following table summarizes the Companys changes in cash flows for the three years ended December 31, 2008 (dollars in millions): 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 % Change 2007 vs. 2006 % Change Net cash provided by operating activities $ 404.4 $ 378.1 $ 432.9 7 % (13 )% Net cash used in investing activities (176.7 ) (274.1 ) (202.5 ) (35 )% 35 % Net cash used in financing activities (562.9 ) (59.5 ) (350.0 ) # (83 )% #Denotes a variance greater than 100.0% Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 2008 compared with 2007 The $26.3 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the following factors: an increase in other current liabilities of $113.9 million in 2008, primarily due to the following: a decrease in cash used for income taxes payable of $93.4 million in 2008. Income tax payments were $90.7 million in 2008 compared with $201.8 million in 2007. The decrease in income tax payments in 2008 primarily resulted from lower estimated taxable income for 2008; and an increase in accrued restructuring costs of $43.6 million in 2008, primarily reflecting additional net accrued termination costs recorded in connection with the Companys cost reduction program and, to a lesser extent, its global manufacturing strategy in 2008; partially offset by: a decrease in accrued payroll of $23.0 million in 2008, primarily reflecting lower management incentive compensation in 2008; and the utilization of $80.0 million available to the Company under its accounts receivable securitization program in 2008 as discussed above. These items were partially offset by: a decrease in net earnings adjusted for non cash items of $118.0 million in 2008; and an increase in cash used for accounts payable of $45.6 million in 2008, primarily due to the timing of payments. 2007 compared with 2006 The $54.8 million decrease in cash provided from operating activities was primarily due to the following factors: a decrease in cash generated from receivables, net, of $13.5 million primarily due to the increase in international net sales and the generally longer trade payment cycles outside the U.S. The decrease in cash generated from receivables was also due to an increase of $8.6 million for value added tax receivables related to the Companys international business; an increase in cash used for inventory of $15.7 million primarily due to higher inventory levels to support international sales growth; and an increase in cash used for other current liabilities of $77.7 million, primarily due to $49.2 million of cash used for income tax payments. Income tax payments were $201.8 million in 2007 compared with $152.6 million in 2006; partially offset by: an increase in net earnings adjusted for non cash activity of $67.7 million. 45 Table of Contents Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 2008 compared with 2007 The $97.4 million decrease in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to the following: a decrease in cash used for acquisitions of $73.3 million in 2008. See Note 20, "Acquisitions and Divestiture," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of the Companys acquisitions in 2008 and 2007; and a decrease of $30.1 million in capital expenditures in 2008, primarily due to the timing of the completion of some new capacity projects in 2008. These items were partially offset by cash received of $36.0 million in 2007 from the Polymask transaction. The Company expects to continue to invest capital as it deems appropriate to expand its business, to maintain or replace depreciating property, plant and equipment, to acquire new manufacturing technology and to improve productivity. Taking into account a reduction of capital expenditures in 2009 for the Companys global manufacturing strategy, as the Company has substantially completed the construction phase associated with this program in 2008 with the completion of three new plants in emerging markets regions, the Company expects total capital expenditures in 2009 to be in the range of $100.0 million to $125.0 million. This projected range is comparable to the level of capital expenditures incurred prior to implementing the Companys global manufacturing strategy in 2006. This projection is based upon the Companys capital expenditure budget for 2009, the status of approved but not yet completed capital projects, anticipated future projects including the implementation of the Companys global manufacturing strategy and historic spending trends. 2007 compared with 2006 The $71.6 million increase in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to the following: an increase of $42.9 million in capital expenditures in 2007. Capital expenditures were $210.8 million in 2007, which included $58.5 million related to the Companys global manufacturing strategy. Capital expenditures were $167.9 million in 2006, which included $14.2 million related to the Companys global manufacturing strategy; $43.3 million of cash used for acquisitions of intangible assets primarily consisting of certain assets relating to polyethylene foam product lines; an increase in net purchases of available for sale securities of $20.9 million in 2007; and an increase of $7.2 million of cash used in other investing activities, primarily due to the Companys investment in the Teknik Plastik joint venture in September 2007; partially offset by: $36.0 million of cash received in 2007 from the PolyMask transaction; and a reduction in cash used for businesses acquired of $20.4 million in 2007, primarily due to the Company using an aggregate of $32.9 million of cash to acquire Alga Plastics in August 2007 and Pack Tiger in January 2007 and $51.7 million of cash to acquire Nelipak in January 2006 and Entapack in July 2006. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities 2008 compared with 2007 The $503.4 million increase in cash used for financing activities was primarily due to the following: an increase in net long term debt repayments of $389.9 million in 2008, primarily due to the retirement of the Companys 5.375% Senior Notes with a face value of $300.0 million in April 2008 and the purchase of $90.6 million in aggregate principal amount of the 6.95% Senior Notes, discussed above; 46 Table of Contents an increase in cash used for the repurchase of the Companys common stock of $88.3 million in 2008, as discussed below; and an increase in cash used for the payment of common stock dividends of $11.8 million in 2008, primarily due to the increase in dividends paid per common share in 2008. 2007 compared with 2006 The $290.5 million decrease in cash used for financing activities was primarily due to the following: net debt proceeds of $11.4 million in 2007 compared with net debt repayments of $251.8 million in 2006. Net debt proceeds in 2007 include net proceeds from short term borrowings of $15.8 million, partially offset by the net repayment of $4.4 million of long term debt. The net debt repayments in 2006 primarily consist of $251.7 million due to the retirement of the 5.625% Euro notes in July 2006 and repayment of $8.0 million of the debt assumed in the Nelipak acquisition, partially offset by net proceeds from long term debt of $23.6 million; and a decrease in cash used in 2007 for the repurchase of the Companys common stock, as discussed below; partially offset by: higher cash payments for dividends on the Companys common stock of $16.0 million in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily due to the increase in the cash dividend per common share in 2007. Repurchases of Capital Stock During 2008, the Company repurchased 4,024,400 shares of its common stock, par value $0.10 per share, in open market purchases at a cost of $95.1 million. The average price per share of these common stock repurchases was $23.64. During 2007, the Company repurchased 216,000 shares of its common stock in open market purchases at a cost of $6.8 million. The average price per share of these common stock repurchases was $31.58. In 2006, the Company repurchased 2,098,400 shares of its common stock, par value $0.10 per share, in open market purchases at a cost of $52.4 million. All repurchases have been adjusted for the two for one stock split in March 2007. The Company made the share repurchases in 2008 under the share repurchase program adopted by the Companys Board of Directors in August 2007. The Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase in the aggregate up to 20 million shares of its issued and outstanding common stock. This program replaced the Companys prior share repurchase program, which was terminated in August 2007. The new program has no set expiration date, and the Company may from time to time continue to repurchase its common stock. See Item 5, "Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities," for further information on the share repurchase program. The 2007 and 2006 share repurchases were made under the Companys prior share repurchase program. Changes in Working Capital At December 31, 2008, working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $50.5 million compared with $194.5 million at December 31, 2007. The $144.0 million decrease in the Companys working capital during 2008 resulted primarily from the following: a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $301.4 million in 2008. See, "Analysis of Historical Cash Flows" above for a discussion of major factors that contributed to this decrease; a decrease in receivables, net, of $107.0 million, primarily due to the sale of undivided ownership interests of $80.0 million under the Companys accounts receivables securitization program and the effect of foreign currency translation of $58.4 million. These items were partially offset by higher receivables balances in North America; an increase in accrued restructuring costs of $42.5 million related to the termination benefits incurred in connection with the Companys cost reduction and productivity program and global manufacturing strategy; and an increase in accrued interest related to the Settlement agreement of $36.9 million. 47 Table of Contents The items above were partially offset by the following items: a decrease in current portion of long term debt of $152.2 million in 2008. This decrease was primarily due to the following: the retirement of the Companys 5.375% Senior Notes with a face value of $300.0 million in April 2008; the repurchase of $90.6 million of the Companys 6.95% Senior Notes in a cash tender offer in December 2008, offset by the reclassification of the Companys 6.95% Senior Notes with a face value of $227.3 million, prior to the repurchase, from long term debt; an increase in current deferred tax assets of $118.1 million, primarily reflecting the reclassification of a portion of the Companys deferred tax asset related to the Settlement agreement from non current deferred tax assets. This reclassification primarily represents the tax benefit that the Company would expect to receive for the carryback of the net operating loss that would be generated assuming the Settlement agreement payment is made in 2009; a decrease in accrued salaries, wages and related costs of $30.4 million, primarily due to the reduction in management incentive compensation discussed above. Current and Quick Ratios The ratio of current assets to current liabilities, known as the current ratio, was 1.0 at December 31, 2008 and 1.1 at December 31, 2007. The ratio of current assets less inventory to current liabilities, known as the quick ratio, was 0.7 at December 31, 2008 and 0.8 at December 31, 2007. Derivative Financial Instruments Interest Rate Swaps The information set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K in Note 12, "Derivatives and Hedging Activities," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption "Interest Rate Swaps" is incorporated herein by reference. Foreign Currency Forward Contracts At December 31, 2008, the Company was party to foreign currency forward contracts, which did not have a significant impact on the Companys liquidity. The information set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K in Note 12, "Derivatives and Hedging Activities," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption "Foreign Currency Forward Contracts" is incorporated herein by reference. For further discussion about these contracts and other financial instruments, see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." Shareholders Equity The Companys shareholders equity was $1,924.6 million at December 31, 2008 and $2,019.6 million at December 31, 2007. Shareholders equity decreased $95.0 million, or 4.7%, in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to the following: negative foreign currency translation of $118.4 million in 2008; repurchases of common stock at a cost of $95.1 million in 2008; and dividends paid on common stock of $76.4 million in 2008; partially offset by: net earnings of $179.9 million in 2008; and the amortization of deferred compensation of $16.1 million related to the Companys contingent stock plan. 48 Table of Contents Recently Issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, Accounting Guidance and Disclosure Requirements The Company is subject to numerous recently issued statements of financial accounting standards, accounting guidance and disclosure requirements. Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, describes these new accounting pronouncements and the Companys application of the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 and is incorporated herein by reference. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Companys discussion and analysis of its consolidated financial position and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on all available evidence, including historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. To derive these estimates and assumptions, management draws from those available sources that can best contribute to its efforts. These sources include the Companys officers and other employees, outside consultants and legal counsel, experts and actuaries. In addition, the Company uses internally generated reports and statistics, such as aging of accounts receivable, as well as outside sources such as government statistics, industry reports and third party research studies. The results of these estimates and assumptions may form the basis of the carrying value of assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from estimates under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, and any such differences may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company believes the following accounting policies are critical to its business operations and the understanding of its consolidated results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. The critical accounting policies discussed below should be read together with the Companys significant accounting policies set forth in "Recent Accounting Pronouncements," of Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts In the normal course of business, the Company extends credit to its customers if they satisfy pre defined credit criteria. The Company maintains an accounts receivable allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of its customers to make required payments. An additional allowance may be required if the financial condition of the Companys customers deteriorates. The allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that management assesses to be appropriate to absorb estimated losses in the accounts receivable portfolio. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed quarterly, and changes to the allowance are made through the provision for bad debts, which is included in marketing, administrative and development expenses on the Companys consolidated statements of operations. These changes may reflect changes in economic, business and market conditions. The allowance is increased by the provision for bad debts and decreased by the amount of charge offs, net of recoveries. The provision for bad debts charged against operating results is based on several factors including, but not limited to, a regular assessment of the collectibility of specific customer balances, the length of time a receivable is past due and the Companys historical experience with its customers. In circumstances where a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations is known, the Company records a specific provision for bad debt against amounts due thereby reducing the receivable to the amount the Company reasonably assesses will be collected. If circumstances change, such as higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customers ability to pay, the Companys estimates of recoverability could be reduced by a material amount. Commitments and Contingencies Litigation On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses the potential liabilities and costs related to any lawsuits or claims brought against it. The Company accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Litigation 49 Table of Contents proceedings are evaluated on a case by case basis considering the available information, including that received from internal and outside legal counsel, to assess potential outcomes. While it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions, the Company uses its best judgment to determine if it is probable that it will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, the Company considers insurance recoveries, if any. The Company expenses legal costs, including those legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred. The Company has in the past adjusted existing accruals as proceedings have continued, been settled or otherwise provided further information on which the Company could review the likelihood of outflows of resources and their measurability, and the Company expects to do so in future periods. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery, it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that the Company has previously made. Impairment of Long Lived Assets The determination of the value of long lived assets requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company periodically reviews long lived assets, other than goodwill, for impairment whenever there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses, such as future cash flows, which are based on operational performance, market conditions and other factors, and disposition costs, may affect the carrying value of long lived assets and result in possible impairment expense in the Companys consolidated financial statements. As assumptions and estimates change in the future, the Company may be required to record an impairment charge. Goodwill In accordance with SFAS No. 142, goodwill is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. A review of goodwill may be initiated prior to or after conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may potentially be no longer recoverable. The Company uses a fair value approach to test goodwill for impairment. The Company must recognize an impairment charge for the amount, if any, by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. The Company derives an estimate of fair values for each of the Companys reporting units using a combination of an income approach and two market approaches, each based on an applicable weighting. The Company assesses the applicable weighting based on such factors as current market conditions and the quality and reliability of the data. Absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transactions, the Company believes that the use of these methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting units fair value. Fair value computed by these methods is arrived at using a number of factors, including projected future operating results, anticipated future cash flows, comparable marketplace data within a consistent industry grouping, and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties, however, related to these factors and to the Companys judgment in applying them to this analysis. Nonetheless, the Company believes that the combination of these methods provides a reasonable approach to estimate the fair value of the Companys reporting units. Assumptions for sales, earnings and cash flows for each reporting unit were consistent among these methods. The income approach is based upon the present value of expected cash flows. Expected cash flows are converted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of the future cash flows. The estimate of cash flows used is prepared on an unleveraged debt free basis. The discount rate reflects a market derived weighted average cost of capital. The Company believes that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units expected long term operating and cash flow performance. The projections are based upon the Companys best estimates of projected economic and market conditions over the related period including growth rates, estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures. Other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates, terminal value margin rates, future capital expenditures and changes in future working capital. The Company uses two market approaches. The first market approach estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by applying EBITDA multiples to the reporting units operating performance. The EBITDA multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar investment characteristics to the reporting unit. The Company believes that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value 50 Table of Contents estimate using multiples from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to its reporting units and the Company. The second market approach is based on the publicly traded common shares of the Company and the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is based on the applicable EBITDA multiples of the Company. The key estimates and assumptions that are used to determine fair value under the two market approaches includes trailing and future 12 month EBITDA results, as applicable. Under both market approaches, a control premium is applied to the calculated equity values to adjust the public trading value upward for a 100% ownership interest, where applicable. See Note 9, "Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the Companys goodwill balance and the goodwill review performed in 2008 and other related information. Self Insurance The Company retains the obligation for specified claims and losses related to property, casualty, workers compensation and employee benefit claims. The Company accrues for outstanding reported claims and claims that have been incurred but not reported based upon managements estimates of the aggregate liability for retained losses using historical experience, insurance company estimates and the estimated trends in claim values. The Companys estimates include managements and independent insurance companies assumptions regarding economic conditions, the frequency and severity of claims and claim development patterns and settlement practices. These estimates and assumptions are monitored and evaluated on a periodic basis by management and are adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances. Although management believes it has the ability to adequately project and record estimated claim payments, actual results could differ significantly from the recorded liabilities. Pensions The Company maintains a non contributory profit sharing plan and a contributory thrift and retirement savings plan in which most U.S. employees of the Company are eligible to participate. For a limited number of its U.S. employees and for some of its international employees, the Company maintains defined benefit pension plans. The Company accounts for these pension plans in accordance with SFAS No. 158, "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans." Under this accounting standard, the Company makes assumptions regarding the valuation of projected benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. The projected benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost are based on third party actuarial assumptions and estimates that are reviewed by management on an annual basis. The principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation, the expected future rate of return on plan assets and the expected rate of future compensation increases. The Company revises these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of long term trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits. In determining the discount rate, the Company utilizes market conditions and other data sources management considers reasonable based upon the profile of the remaining service life of eligible employees. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration the weighted average expected return on the Companys asset allocation, asset return data, historical return data, and the economic environment. The Company believes these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions of the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. The rate of compensation increase is based on the Companys long term plans for such increases. The measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is December 31. At December 31, 2008, the projected benefit obligation for U.S. pension plans was $53.9 million and the net periodic benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $2.9 million. At December 31, 2008, the projected benefit obligation for international pension plans was $237.8 million and the net periodic benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $14.1 million. 51  Table of Contents In general, material changes to the principal assumptions could have a material impact on the costs and liabilities recorded under SFAS No. 158. A 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate and a 100 basis point change in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in the following increases (decreases) on the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2008 and the expected net periodic benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 2009 (in millions). 25 Basis Point Increase 25 Basis Point Decrease United States Discount Rate Effect on 2008 projected benefit obligation $ (1.7 ) $ 1.8 Effect on 2009 expected net periodic benefit cost (0.1 ) 0.1 100 Basis Point Increase 100 Basis Point Decrease Return on Assets Effect on 2009 expected net periodic benefit cost $ (0.3 ) $ 0.3 25 Basis Point Increase 25 Basis Point Decrease International Discount Rate Effect on 2008 projected benefit obligation $ (7.7 ) $ 8.1 Effect on 2009 expected net periodic benefit cost (1.1 ) 0.8 100 Basis Point Increase 100 Basis Point Decrease Return on Assets Effect on 2009 expected net periodic benefit cost $ (1.6 ) $ 1.6 Income Taxes Estimates and judgments are required in the calculation of tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets. The Companys deferred tax assets arise from net deductible temporary differences and tax benefit carry forwards. The Company evaluates whether its taxable earnings during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carry forwards may be utilized should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits. For those jurisdictions where the expiration dates of tax benefit carry forwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely, the Company provides a valuation allowance. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company estimates future taxable earnings, with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax benefit carry forwards and past operating results, to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future. Changes to tax laws, statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings can have an impact on valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods, the Company may need to adjust the valuation allowance, which could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In calculating its worldwide provision for income taxes, the Company also evaluates its tax positions for years where the statutes of limitations have not expired. Based on this review, the Company may establish reserves for additional taxes and interest that could be assessed upon examination by relevant tax authorities. The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, including the results of tax audits and changes in tax law. If the payment of additional taxes and interest ultimately proves unnecessary, the reversal of the reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the reserves are no longer necessary. If an estimate of tax reserves proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to income tax provision would result. These adjustments to reserves and related expenses could materially affect the Companys consolidated financial statements. 52 Table of Contents On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48. Under FIN 48, the Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with tax authorities. See Note 15, "Income Taxes," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Summarized Quarterly Financial Information (Unaudited, in millions, except share data) 2008 First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Net sales $ 1,177.4 $ 1,278.8 $ 1,219.0 $ 1,168.3 Gross profit 305.1 330.2 293.7 307.6 Net earnings 60.8 62.6 9.2 47.3 Basic net earnings per common share $ 0.38 $ 0.40 $ 0.06 $ 0.30 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 0.33 $ 0.34 $ 0.05 $ 0.26 2007 First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Net sales $ 1,094.7 $ 1,145.4 $ 1,160.9 $ 1,250.2 Gross profit 314.2 323.3 320.1 343.5 Net earnings 127.0 73.9 72.4 79.7 Basic net earnings per common share $ 0.79 $ 0.46 $ 0.45 $ 0.50 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 0.67 $ 0.40 $ 0.39 $ 0.43 Non GAAP Information The Companys management from time to time presents information that does not conform to U.S. GAAP, including changes in net sales excluding the effects of foreign currency translation, the net impact of a business acquisition in 2008 and certain sales related to acquisitions. The Companys management uses changes in net sales excluding the items above to measure the performance of the Companys operations and to aid in the comparison of results. Thus, management believes that this information may be useful to investors. Such measures are also among the criteria upon which performance based compensation may be determined.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which may adversely affect its consolidated financial position and results of operations. The Company seeks to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company does not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rates From time to time, the Company may use interest rate swaps, collars or options to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. The Companys interest rate swaps are described in Note 12, "Derivatives and Hedging Activities," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and in "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Derivative Financial Instruments Interest Rate Swaps" contained in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Such information is incorporated herein by reference. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had no interest rate collars or options outstanding. The Company had no interest rate swaps outstanding at December 31, 2008. 53 Table of Contents The carrying value of the Companys total debt, which includes the impact of outstanding interest rate swaps in 2007, was $1,479.0 million at December 31, 2008 and $1,871.8 million at December 31, 2007. The Companys fixed rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps in 2007, was $1,430.9 million at December 31, 2008 and $1,526.1 million at December 31, 2007. The fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt varies with changes in interest rates. Generally, the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The estimated fair value of the Companys total debt, including the impact of outstanding interest rate swaps in 2007, was $1,204.8 million at December 31, 2008 compared with $1,818.4 million at December 31, 2007. A hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates would result in an increase of $74.1 million in the fair value of the total debt balance at December 31, 2008. These changes in the fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt do not alter the Companys obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount of such debt. See Note 13, "Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the methodology and inputs used to determine the fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt in accordance with SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements." Foreign Exchange Rates The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to fix the amount payable on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates at December 31, 2008 would have caused the Company to pay approximately $37.2 million to terminate these contracts. The Companys foreign currency forward contracts are described in Note 12, "Derivatives and Hedging Activities," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is contained in Part II, Item 8 and in "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Derivative Financial Instruments Foreign Currency Forward Contracts" contained in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Such information is incorporated herein by reference. The Company may use other derivative instruments from time to time, such as foreign exchange options to manage exposure due to foreign exchange rates and interest rate and currency swaps related to access to additional sources of international financing. These instruments can potentially limit foreign exchange exposure and limit or adjust interest rate exposure by swapping borrowings denominated in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had no foreign exchange options or interest rate and currency swap agreements outstanding. The Companys outstanding debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing subsidiary. The Company believes that this enables it to better match operating cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match the currency of assets and liabilities. The amount of outstanding debt denominated in a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar was $48.5 million at December 31, 2008 and $49.2 million at December 31, 2007. Available for Sale Investments The Companys available for sale investments, consisting of auction rate securities at December 31, 2008 and 2007, are exposed to market risk related to changes in conditions in the U.S. financial markets and in the financial condition of the issuers of these securities. The Companys investment in auction rate securities at December 31, 2008 and 2007 had an original cost of $44.7 million. These auction rate securities consisted of two contingent capital securities that were converted into perpetual preferred stock of Ambac Assurance Corporation ("AMBAC"), the issuer, in December 2008, and three debt instruments individually issued by Primus Financial Products LLC (maturity date 2021), River Lake Insurance Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Genworth Financial, Inc. (maturity date 2033) and Ballantyne Re Plc (maturity date 2036). These five securities historically were re auctioned every twenty eight days, which had provided a liquid market for them. However, as a result of continuing liquidity concerns affecting capital markets, particularly in the U.S., specifically for asset backed securities, every auction held by the issuers for these auction rate securities in 2008 failed. During 2008, the Company continued to receive all interest and dividend payments, totaling $2.2 million, when due. The Company accounts for these investments as available for sale investments and reviews them for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity 54 Table of Contents Securities," and other related guidance issued by the FASB and the SEC. During its impairment review, the Company has evaluated the following: in the fourth quarter of 2008, the rating agencies lowered the credit rating on all of the issuers; the timeliness and level of interest and dividend payments received from the issuers; the duration and severity in the decline in the estimated fair market value of these securities; the exercise of AMBACs put option, which converted the two contingent capital securities into non cumulative perpetual preferred stock of AMBAC Assurance in December 2008; AMBACs cancellation of dividends on its common stock in December 2008; Ballantynes notification in January 2009 that it was unable to fully fund its upcoming interest payments. As a result, Ballantyne exercised its option to rely on the insurance protection provided to it by AMBAC (UK), the issuer of an insurance wrap on this debt instrument held by the Company; and the ability and intent of the Company to hold these securities for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a recovery of their original cost. Based on the evaluation discussed above, the Company has determined that all of the securities incurred an other than temporary decline in fair market value during 2008. As a result, the Company recorded an other than temporary impairment of the market value of these securities of $34.0 million ($21.8 million, net of taxes) and established a new cost basis of $10.7 million for these securities at December 31, 2008. The Companys available for sale investments are described in more detail in Note 5, "Available for Sale Investments," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Customer Credit The Company is exposed to credit risk from its customers. In the normal course of business the Company extends credit to its customers if they satisfy pre defined credit criteria. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of its customers to make required payments. An additional allowance may be required if the financial condition of the Companys customers deteriorates. The allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that management assesses to be appropriate to absorb estimated losses in the accounts receivable portfolio. The Companys customers may default on their obligations to the Company due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. Despite uncertainties surrounding current global economic conditions and levels of credit risk, as of December 31, 2008, the Company has not experienced a significant change in its customers payment patterns or defaults. The Companys provision for bad debt expense was $9.3 million in 2008 and $2.9 million in 2007. Pensions Recent market conditions have resulted in an unusually high degree of volatility and increased risks and short term liquidity concerns associated with some of the plan assets held by the Companys defined benefit pension plans, which have impacted the performance of some of the plan assets. Based upon the annual valuation of the Companys defined benefit pension plans at December 31, 2008 the Company expects its net periodic benefit costs to increase to approximately $20.0 million in 2009 compared with $17.0 million in 2008. See Note 14, "Employee Benefits and Incentive Programs," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the Companys defined benefit pension plans. Commodities The Company uses various commodity raw materials such as plastic resins and energy products such as electric power and natural gas in conjunction with its manufacturing processes. Generally, the Company acquires these components at market prices in the region in which they will be used and does not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices. Moreover, the Companys supply chain team seeks to maintain appropriate levels of commodity raw material inventories thus minimizing the expense and risks of carrying excess inventories. The Company does not typically purchase substantial quantities in advance of production requirements. As a result, the Company is exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components. 55  Table of Contents
