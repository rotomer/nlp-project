Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The information in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes set forth in Part II, Item 8, as well as the discussion included in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors," of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. All amounts and percentages are approximate due to rounding. Non U.S. GAAP Information In Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we present financial information in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but we also present financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP, or non U.S. GAAP. As discussed below, we provide this supplemental information as our management believes it is useful to investors. Investors should use caution, however, when reviewing our non U.S. GAAP presentations. The non U.S. GAAP information is not a substitute for U.S. GAAP information. It does not purport to represent the similarly titled U.S. GAAP information, should not be considered as a substitute for the U.S. GAAP information and is not an indicator of our performance under U.S. GAAP. Further, non U.S. GAAP financial measures that we present may not be comparable with similarly titled measures used by others. In our "2010 Outlook" below, we present anticipated full year 2010 diluted net earning per common share on a U.S. GAAP basis, but also on a non U.S. GAAP adjusted basis excluding an estimated $0.02 charge related to GMS. We believe that excluding the anticipated GMS charge from our projected earnings aids in the comparison of our earnings performance between 2010 and prior years. Our management will look at our earnings performance both including the GMS charge and excluding it. Further, we may use adjusted earnings per share results to determine incentive compensation. Thus, our management believes that this information may be useful to investors. In our "Highlights of Financial Performance" and in our "Net Sales by Segment Reporting Structure" below, we first present our results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but in the discussions that follow, we exclude the impact of foreign currency translation when presenting net sales information. Changes in net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency translation is a non U.S. GAAP financial measure, which we define as "constant dollar." Similarly, in "Changes in Working Capital" below, we exclude the impact of foreign currency translation on changes in inventories. As a worldwide business, it is important that we take into account the effects of foreign currency translation when we view our results and plan our strategies. Nonetheless, we cannot directly control changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Consequently, when management looks at our net sales to measure the performance of our business, it typically excludes the impact of foreign currency translation. We also may exclude the impact of foreign currency translation when making incentive compensation determinations. As a result, management believes that these presentations may be useful to investors. Overview Beginning with the invention of Bubble Wrap&reg; fifty years ago, we have become a leading global innovator and manufacturer of a wide range of packaging and performance based materials and equipment systems that now serve an array of food, industrial, medical and consumer applications. At December 31, 2009, we employed approximately 2,600 sales, marketing and customer service personnel throughout the world who sell and market our products through a large number of distributors, fabricators and converters, as well as directly to end users such as food processors, food service businesses, supermarket retailers and manufacturers. We have no material long term contracts for the distribution of our products. In 2009, no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net sales. We do not consider seasonality to be material to our consolidated net sales or to any reportable business segment net sales. Historically, net sales in our food businesses have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter, due to holiday events. Our Protective Packaging segment has tended to also be slightly lower in the first quarter and higher during the "back to school" season in the mid third quarter and through the fourth quarter due to the holiday shopping season. 24 Table of Contents Competition for most of our packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics, service and price. Competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology and, as a result, we maintain ongoing research and development programs to enable us to maintain technological leadership. For more details on our competition, see "Competition" included in "Business," of Item 1, of Part I. Our net sales are sensitive to developments in our customers business or market conditions, changes in the global economy, and the effects of foreign currency translation. Our costs can vary with changes in input costs, including petrochemical related costs, which are not within our control. Consequently, our management focuses on reducing those costs that we can control and using petrochemical based raw materials as efficiently as possible. We also believe that our global presence helps to insulate us from localized changes in business conditions. Our businesses are managed to generate substantial operating cash flow. We believe that our operating cash flow will permit us to continue to spend on innovative research and development and to invest in our business by means of capital expenditures for property and equipment and acquisitions. Moreover, our ability to generate substantial operating cash flow should provide us with the flexibility to modify our capital structure as the need or opportunity arises. 2010 Outlook Although a fair amount of uncertainty remains about the pace and timing of economic recovery, we are anticipating a modest recovery in global economic conditions in 2010. We are assuming that the pace and timing of the recovery will be led by developing regions, with more advanced economies experiencing a slower, more modest rate of recovery. As a result, we are anticipating a 4% to 6% growth in our net sales from a combination of unit volume growth and product price/mix. We also are assuming that we may experience increased raw material costs for North American commodity resins, and we expect to take pricing actions as appropriate to lessen the impact of cost increases. We anticipate marketing, administrative and development expenses to be in the range of 16% to 17% of net sales and a full year 2010 effective tax rate of 27%. As a result, we anticipate full year 2010 diluted net earnings per common share to be in the range of $1.48 to $1.68, or $1.50 to $1.70 on an adjusted basis to exclude an estimated $0.02 charge related to the remaining portion of our Global Manufacturing Strategy, or GMS. Significant 2009 Events GMS In 2009, we completed the construction phase of GMS with the launch of our manufacturing facility in Duchnice, Poland. This facility along with our other new facilities in Qingpu, China and Monterrey, Mexico substantially finishes the construction and launch of all three greenfield sites related to this program. In November 2009, we committed to relocating our bagmaking and printing operations presently in Norderstedt, Germany by June 30, 2010 to other existing facilities in Europe. We estimate that we will incur total costs of approximately $7 million, including $5 million recorded in 2009, in connection with this project, which would be future cash expenditures, primarily for costs for one time termination benefits. See "Global Manufacturing Strategy and 2008 Cost Reduction and Productivity Program" below for additional details of GMS. Financing Activities In 2009, we completed the following financing activities: retirement of the remaining outstanding balance of $136.7 million of our 6.95% Senior Notes; redemption of the entire $431.3 million of our 3% Convertible Senior Notes due 2033 in July 2009; issuance of $300 million of 12% Senior Notes due February 2014; issuance of $400 million of 7.875% Senior Notes due June 2017; 25 Table of Contents execution of a 150 million Euro senior unsecured revolving credit facility due July 2012, known as our European credit facility; and cancellation of our 170 million Australian dollar revolving credit facility that was due to expire in March 2010. Further information on these financing activities and on our total debt and available credit is included in Note 11, "Debt and Credit Facilities," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Also, see "Principal Sources of Liquidity" below for a discussion of our current liquidity position. Quarterly Cash Dividends On February 18, 2010, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per common share, which is payable on March 19, 2010 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 5, 2010. The estimated amount of this dividend payment is $19 million based on 159 million shares of our common stock issued and outstanding as of January 31, 2010. During 2009 and 2008, we declared and paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.12 per common share in each quarter, using a total of $152 million from available cash. Highlights of Financial Performance Highlights of our financial performance for 2009 compared with 2008 and 2007 were: 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs. 2008 % Change 2008 vs. 2007 % Change Net sales: U.S. $ 1,969.1 $ 2,185.2 $ 2,118.2 (10 )% 3 % % of total net sales 46.4 % 45.1 % 45.5 % International 2,273.7 2,658.3 2,533.0 (15 ) 5 % of total net sales 53.6 % 54.9 % 54.5 % Total net sales $ 4,242.8 $ 4,843.5 $ 4,651.2 (12 )% 4 % Gross profit $ 1,218.5 $ 1,236.6 $ 1,301.1 (1 )% (5 )% % of total net sales 28.7 % 25.5 % 28.0 % Marketing, administrative and development expenses $ 719.2 $ 755.0 $ 750.2 (5 )% 1 % % of total net sales 17.0 % 15.6 % 16.1 % Restructuring and other charges $ 7.0 $ 85.1 $ 1.6 (92 ) # Operating profit $ 492.3 $ 396.5 $ 549.3 24 % (28 )% % of total net sales 11.6 % 8.2 % 11.8 % Net earnings $ 244.3 $ 179.9 $ 353.0 36 % (49 )% Net earnings per common share: Basic $ 1.54 $ 1.13 $ 2.19 36 % (48 )% Diluted. $ 1.35 $ 0.99 $ 1.88 36 % (47 )% #Denotes a change equal to or greater than 100% Our net earnings increased 36% in 2009 compared with 2008 despite a 12% decline in net sales. The primary contributing factors to our net earnings growth were lower input costs and restructuring charges, the incremental benefits generated from our 2008 cost reduction and productivity program and other cost reduction initiatives and incremental benefits from GMS. During the year we experienced lower unit volume results and relatively flat product price/mix. Our consolidated unit volume results for 2009, detailed below, were lower than comparable periods primarily reflecting weak global economic conditions. Our Protective Packaging segment and our Specialty Materials business, which combined represent approximately 32% of our consolidated net sales in the period, were the most impacted by the recession. These lower unit volumes were judged by management to be 26 Table of Contents consistent with our peers in each segment and with economic indicators of customer demand in each segment and geographic region. We continue to believe that the unit volume declines experienced in these businesses do not represent a shift in our competitiveness or in the quality of our products and solutions. Comparing the fourth quarter of 2009 with the third quarter of 2009, or sequentially, the Protective Packaging segment and Specialty Materials business experienced a combined 6% reported increase in net sales to $366 million from $346 million. Excluding a 2% favorable impact of foreign currency translation, these businesses recorded a 4% increase in net sales. This increase reflected a combination of a seasonal lift from the holiday shopping season, modest customer inventory restocking and, to a lesser extent, new product placements. Sequentially, our Food Packaging and Food Solutions segments experienced a combined 7% reported increase in net sales to $740 million from $693 million. Excluding a 3% favorable impact of foreign currency translation, these segments recorded a 4% increase in net sales, which primarily reflected a seasonal lift in demand due to the holiday period. See the discussion below for further details about the material factors that contributed to the changes in net sales by our segment reporting structure and by geographic region and operating profit. Net Sales by Segment Reporting Structure The following table presents net sales by our segment reporting structure: 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs. 2008 % Change 2008 vs. 2007 % Change Net sales: Food Packaging $ 1,839.8 $ 1,969.4 $ 1,882.9 (7 )% 5 % As a % of total net sales 43.4 % 40.6 % 40.5 % Food Solutions 891.7 988.3 944.7 (10 ) 5 As a % of total net sales 21.0 % 20.4 % 20.3 % Protective Packaging 1,192.9 1,480.3 1,506.9 (19 ) (2 ) As a % of total net sales 28.1 % 30.6 % 32.4 % Other 318.4 405.5 316.7 (21 ) 28 As a % of total net sales 7.5 % 8.4 % 6.8 % Total $ 4,242.8 $ 4,843.5 $ 4,651.2 (12 )% 4 % Foreign Currency Translation Impact on Net Sales For the first nine months of 2009, the U.S. dollar remained strong relative to most foreign currencies. This resulted in an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact on net sales of $242 million in 2009 compared with 2008. This impact includes a favorable foreign currency translation impact of $49 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 as most foreign currencies began to strengthen against the U.S. dollar. Due in part to concerns about the ability of some countries in the Euro zone to effectively manage sovereign debt obligations and rising budget deficits, the Euro has weakened against the U.S. dollar during the first quarter of 2010. In 2008, we experienced a strengthening of most foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, which resulted in a favorable foreign currency translation impact on net sales of $110 million in 2008 compared with 2007. This impact includes an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of $66 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most foreign currencies, which continued through the first nine months of 2009. The following tables present the components of change in net sales for the year ended 2009 compared with 2008 and the year ended 2008 compared with 2007. We also present the change in net sales excluding 27 Table of Contents the impact of foreign currency translation, a non U.S. GAAP measure, which we define as "constant dollar." We believe using constant dollar comparisons aids in the comparability with other periods. 2009 compared with 2008 Food Packaging Food Solutions Protective Packaging Other Total Company Volume Units $ (55.4 ) (2.8 )% $ (35.4 ) (3.6 )% $ (209.4 ) (14.1 )% $ (78.5 ) (19.3 )% $ (378.7 ) (7.8 )% Volume Acquired businesses, net of (dispositions) 2.2 0.1 (3.4 ) (0.8 ) (1.2 ) Product price/mix 46.2 2.3 (3.7 ) (0.4 ) (30.6 ) (2.0 ) 9.3 2.3 21.2 0.4 Foreign currency translation (120.4 ) (6.1 ) (57.5 ) (5.8 ) (49.6 ) (3.4 ) (14.5 ) (3.6 ) (242.0 ) (5.0 ) Total change (U.S. GAAP) $ (129.6 ) (6.6 )% $ (96.6 ) (9.8 )% $ (287.4 ) (19.4 )% $ (87.1 ) (21.4 )% $ (600.7 ) (12.4 )% Impact of foreign currency translation 120.4 6.1 57.5 5.8 49.6 3.4 14.5 3.6 242.0 5.0 Total constant dollar change (Non U.S. GAAP) $ (9.2 ) (0.5 )% $ (39.1 ) (4.0 )% $ (237.8 ) (16.0 )% $ (72.6 ) (17.8 )% $ (358.7 ) (7.4 )% 2008 compared with 2007 Food Packaging Food Solutions Protective Packaging Other Total Company Volume Units $ (11.2 ) (0.6 )% $ (11.2 ) (1.2 )% $ (81.6 ) (5.4 )% $ 4.5 1.4 % $ (99.5 ) (2.1 )% Volume Acquired businesses, net of (dispositions) 0.6 61.5 19.4 62.1 1.3 Product price/mix 62.4 3.3 29.3 3.1 21.4 1.4 7.0 2.2 120.1 2.5 Foreign currency translation 35.3 1.9 25.5 2.7 33.0 2.2 15.8 5.0 109.6 2.4 Total change (U.S. GAAP) $ 86.5 4.6 % $ 43.6 4.6 % $ (26.6 ) (1.8 )% $ 88.8 28.0 % $ 192.3 4.1 % Impact of foreign currency translation (35.3 ) (1.9 ) (25.5 ) (2.7 ) (33.0 ) (2.2 ) (15.8 ) (5.0 ) (109.6 ) (2.4 ) Total constant dollar change (Non U.S. GAAP) $ 51.2 2.7 % $ 18.1 1.9 % $ (59.6 ) (4.0 )% $ 73.0 23.0 % $ 82.7 1.7 % The following net sales discussion is on a constant dollar basis. Food Packaging Segment Net Sales 2009 compared with 2008 The $9 million or 1% decrease in net sales in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to: decreases in unit volume in Europe of $24 million, or 5%, and in the United States of $19 million, or 2%; partially offset by: favorable impacts of product price/mix in Latin America of $31 million, or 11%. The decrease in unit volume in Europe was primarily due to lower equipment sales, which was mostly the result of lower capital spending by customers in this region. The decrease in unit volume in the United States was primarily due to the decline in local meat production mostly experienced during the first nine months of 2009. The unit volume declines in Europe and the United States reflected the continuing economic weakness in these regions. The favorable impact of product price/mix in Latin America was primarily due to the timing of pricing actions on most Food Packaging products, in part to cover the weakness of the Venezuelan currency. 2008 compared with 2007 The $51 million, or 3%, increase in net sales in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to: favorable impacts of product price/mix in Latin America of $23 million, or 8%, and in the United States of $36 million, or 4%; and increases in unit volume in the United States of $10 million, or 1%, and in Europe of $9 million, or 2%; 28 Table of Contents partially offset by: a decrease in unit volume in Latin America of $23 million, or 8%. The favorable impacts of product price/mix in Latin America and the United States were primarily due to the positive impact of selling price increases implemented in December 2007 and during 2008 for most Food Packaging products. The increase in unit volume in the United States was primarily attributed to higher pork slaughter rates during the first half of 2008, which in turn resulted in higher sales of our fresh meat packaging products. The increase in unit volume in Europe was primarily attributed to net positive trends in this region during the first half of 2008 in the fresh red meat and cheese markets, which in turn resulted in higher sales of our fresh meat and dairy packaging products. The decrease in unit volume in Latin America was primarily due to market factors in Brazil. Throughout 2008, Brazilian meat exports to Europe were restricted due to some Brazilian meat processors lack of compliance with previously issued European food traceability and safety standards. By late 2008, the majority of Brazilian meat processors had complied with the standards, but by this time, end market demand in Europe had slowed due to a decline in meat consumption attributable to weak economic conditions. Food Solutions Segment Net Sales 2009 compared with 2008 The $39 million, or 4%, decrease in net sales in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to decreases in unit volume in Europe of $29 million, or 7%, and in the United States of $13 million, or 3%. The decrease in unit volume in Europe was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of reduced consumption of certain meats in some countries, which in turn resulted in lower sales of our case ready packaging products. The decrease in the United States was primarily due to lower sales of our vertical pouch packaging products to customers in the food service sector. Both declines in Europe and the United States reflected the economic weakness in these regions. 2008 compared with 2007 The $18 million, or 2%, increase in net sales in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to: favorable impacts of product price/mix in the United States of $22 million, or 6%, and in Europe of $8 million, or 2%; and an increase in unit volume in the Asia Pacific region of $9 million, or 7%; partially offset by: decreases in unit volume in Europe of $14 million, or 4%, and in the United States of $11 million, or 3%. The favorable impacts of product price/mix in both the United States and Europe were primarily attributed to the positive impact of selling price increases implemented in December 2007 and in 2008 for most Food Solutions products. The increase in unit volume in the Asia Pacific region was primarily attributed to product adoption by new and existing customers of our case ready products. The decrease in unit volume in Europe was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of lower consumption of meats and cheeses in certain countries resulting from deteriorating economic conditions in this region and, to a lesser extent, certain low margin business we decided to withdraw from in the first quarter of 2008. The decrease in unit volume in the United States was primarily due to a large retailer opting in November 2007 to move from a case ready packaging format to an alternative packaging format for a portion of its meat packaging. This decrease was partially offset by increased flexible food film and vertical pouch packaging products sales to existing customers in this region. 29  Table of Contents Outsourced Products In addition to net sales from products produced in our facilities, approximately 16% in 2009, 17% in 2008 and 19% in 2007 of net trade sales in this segment were from the sale of products fabricated by other manufacturers, which we refer to as outsourced products. Outsourced products include, among others, foam and solid plastic trays and containers fabricated primarily in North America and in Europe, which largely support our case ready products. We have strategically opted to use third party manufacturers for technically less complex products and selected equipment in order to offer customers a broader range of solutions. We have benefited from this strategy with increased net sales and operating profit requiring minimal capital expenditures. Net sales of outsourced products included in this segment amounted to $147 million in 2009, $170 million in 2008 and $181 million in 2007. Additional sales of $90 million in 2009, $70 million in 2008 and $83 million in 2007 from the sales of outsourced products were primarily in our Protective Packaging segment. Protective Packaging Segment Net Sales 2009 compared with 2008 The $238 million, or 16%, decrease in net sales in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily the result of lower unit volume in the United States of $113 million, or 14%, and in Europe of $70 million, or 16%. These declines were principally attributable to continuing economic weakness in these regions, which were consistent with manufacturing output and export and shipping trends. 2008 compared with 2007 The $60 million, or 4%, decrease in net sales in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily the result of lower unit volume in the United States of $48 million, or 6%, and in Europe of $19 million, or 4%, which was principally attributable to weakening regional economic conditions and was consistent with manufacturing output, shipping and retail indicators. Partially offsetting this decrease in unit volume was the favorable impact of product price/mix in the United States of $14 million, or 2%, primarily attributed to the positive impact of selling price increases implemented in December 2007 and during 2008 for most Protective Packaging products. Other Net Sales 2009 compared with 2008 The $73 million, or 18%, decrease in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily attributed to lower unit volumes in North America of $44 million, or 29%, and in Europe of $27 million, or 14%. These declines were primarily attributed to lower unit volumes for some of our Specialty Materials products, which were principally the result of continuing economic weakness in these regions consistent with manufacturing output and export and shipping trends. 2008 compared with 2007 Other net sales increased $73 million, or 23%, in 2008 compared with 2007. Excluding $62 million in net sales resulting from the November 2007 acquisition of certain assets relating to Ethafoam&reg; and related polyethylene foam product lines and the August 2007 acquisition of Alga Plastics, Other net sales would have increased $12 million, or 4%, primarily due to: a favorable impact of product price/mix in North America of $11 million, or 10%, primarily attributed to the positive impact of selling price increases for most of our Specialty Materials products; and an increase in unit volume in Asia of $7 million, or 18%, primarily due to adoption of medical applications products by new and existing customers mainly in the first half of 2008. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in unit volume in the United States of $3 million, or 3%, primarily attributed to lower unit volume in some of our Specialty Materials products, which was principally the result of weakening regional economic conditions and was consistent with manufacturing output indicators. 30 Table of Contents Net Sales by Geographic Region The following table shows net sales by geographic region. 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs. 2008 % Change 2008 vs. 2007 % Change Net sales: U.S. $ 1,969.1 $ 2,185.2 $ 2,118.2 (10 )% 3 % As a % of total net sales 46.4 % 45.1 % 45.5 % International 2,273.7 2,658.3 2,533.0 (15 ) 5 As a % of total net sales 53.6 % 54.9 % 54.5 % Total net sales $ 4,242.8 $ 4,843.5 $ 4,651.2 (12 )% 4 % By geographic region, the components of the decrease in net sales for 2009 compared with 2008 were as follows: 2009 compared with 2008 U.S. International Total Company Volume Units $ (186.4 ) (8.5 )% $ (192.3 ) (7.2 )% $ (378.7 ) (7.8 )% Volume Acquired businesses, net of dispositions 2.2 0.1 (3.4 ) (0.1 ) (1.2 ) Product price/mix (32.0 ) (1.5 ) 53.2 2.0 21.2 0.4 Foreign currency translation (242.0 ) (9.1 ) (242.0 ) (5.0 ) Total $ (216.2 ) (9.9 )% $ (384.5 ) (14.4 )% $ (600.7 ) (12.4 )% By geographic region, the components of the increase in net sales for 2008 compared with 2007 were as follows: 2008 compared with 2007 U.S. International Total Company Volume Units $ (52.0 ) (2.5 )% $ (47.5 ) (1.9 )% $ (99.5 ) (2.1 )% Volume Acquired businesses, net of dispositions 40.9 1.9 21.2 0.8 62.1 1.3 Product price/mix 78.1 3.8 42.0 1.7 120.1 2.5 Foreign currency translation 109.6 4.3 109.6 2.4 Total $ 67.0 3.2 % $ 125.3 4.9 % $ 192.3 4.1 % See "Net Sales by Segment Reporting Structure" above for details of the major factors, trends and regions that contributed to the changes in net sales in the periods mentioned above. Cost of Sales Our primary input costs include resins, direct and indirect labor, other raw materials and other energy related costs (including transportation costs.) We utilize petrochemical based resins in the manufacture of many of our products. The costs for these raw materials are impacted by the rise and fall in crude oil and natural gas prices, since they serve as feedstocks utilized in the production of most resins. The prices for these feedstocks have been particularly volatile in recent years. Although changes in the prices of crude oil and natural gas are not perfect benchmarks, they are indicative of the variations in raw materials and other input costs we face. We continue to monitor changes in raw material and energy related costs as they occur and take pricing actions as appropriate to lessen the impact of cost increases when they occur. The following table shows our cost of sales for the three years ended December 31, 2009: 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs. 2008 % Change 2008 vs. 2007 % Change Cost of sales $ 3,024.3 $ 3,606.9 $ 3,350.1 (16 )% 8 % As a % of net sales 71.3 % 74.5 % 72.0 % 31 Table of Contents 2009 compared with 2008 The $583 million decrease in cost of sales in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to: favorable average petrochemical based raw material expenditures of approximately $200 million, which was primarily experienced in the first nine months of 2009; the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $185 million; other lower input costs, including favorable freight and energy related costs in 2009 of approximately $45 million; and estimated benefits from our expense control initiatives and other cost control measures in 2009, including approximately $40 million of incremental benefits from our 2008 cost reduction and productivity program and from GMS. Expenses included in cost of sales related to the implementation of GMS were $10 million in 2009, compared with $7 million in 2008. 2008 compared with 2007 The $257 million increase in cost of sales in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to: unfavorable average petrochemical based raw material expenditures of approximately $125 million, which was experienced in the first nine months of 2008; the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $73 million; and other higher input costs, including unfavorable freight and energy related costs in 2008 of approximately $26 million. Also contributing to the increase in cost of sales was incremental expenses in 2008 related to the 2007 acquisitions of Ethafoam&reg; and related polyethylene foam product lines and Alga Plastics, which amounted to approximately $54 million. Expenses included in cost of sales related to the implementation of GMS were $7 million in 2008 compared with $11 million in 2007. These items were partially offset by the impact of expense control initiatives in 2008. Marketing, Administrative and Development Expenses The following table shows our marketing, administrative and development expenses for the three years ended December 31, 2009: 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs. 2008 % Change 2008 vs. 2007 % Change Marketing, administrative and development expenses $ 719.2 $ 755.0 $ 750.2 (5 )% 1 % As a % of net sales 17.0 % 15.6 % 16.1 % 2009 compared with 2008 Marketing, administrative and development expenses decreased $36 million in 2009 compared with 2008. These expenses decreased due to the following: estimated benefits from our expense control initiatives and other cost control measures in 2009, including approximately $40 million of incremental benefits from our 2008 cost reduction and productivity program, lower travel and entertainment expenses and GMS; and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $31 million. These decreases were partially offset by higher management incentive compensation expenses of approximately $55 million in 2009, of which approximately $30 million occurred in the fourth quarter of 2009, because we exceeded our 2009 financial performance goals but did not meet our 2008 financial performance goals. 32 Table of Contents Our management incentive compensation expense includes annual cash incentives, our annual U.S. profit sharing contribution, and long term, share based compensation. The table below shows the increase in these expenses in 2009 compared with 2008. 2009 2008 2009 vs. 2008 Change Annual cash incentive compensation $ 35.0 $ 13.0 $ 22.0 Annual U.S. profit sharing contribution 29.0 18.0 11.0 Share based compensation 38.8 16.5 22.3 Total $ 102.8 $ 47.5 $ 55.3 2008 compared with 2007 Marketing, administrative and development expenses increased $5 million in 2008 compared with 2007. These expenses increased due to the following: the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $19 million; additional expenses of $5 million in 2008 related to businesses acquired in the second half of 2007; an increase in provision for bad debt expense of $5 million (substantially all in the fourth quarter of 2008), primarily related to credit conditions affecting some of our Food Packaging and Protective Packaging customers; and additional operating expenses of $3 million in 2008 related to our New Ventures businesses, which includes spending related to innovation and new product introductions including spending related to renewable products. These increases were largely offset by: lower management incentive compensation expenses of $22 million, of which $14 million occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008 because we did not meet our 2008 financial performance goals; and a decrease in information systems expenses of $6 million, primarily due to expense control initiatives in 2008. GMS and 2008 Cost Reduction and Productivity Program GMS Our GMS expands our production capabilities in regions where demand for our products and services has been growing significantly. Additionally, we are optimizing certain manufacturing platforms in North America and Europe into centers of excellence. The goals of this multi year program have been to expand capacity in growing markets, further improve our operating efficiencies, and implement new technologies more effectively. By taking advantage of new technologies and streamlining production on a global scale, we have continued to enhance our profitable growth and our global leadership position and have produced meaningful benefits. We announced the first phase of this multi year global manufacturing strategy in July 2006. In 2009, we substantially finished the construction phase of GMS with the launch of our manufacturing facility in Duchnice, Poland. This facility along with our other new facilities in Qingpu, China and Monterrey, Mexico substantially completes the construction and launch of all three greenfield sites related to this program. We estimate that we have realized benefits of approximately $25 million from GMS in 2008, which increased to $45 million in 2009. We expect to realize an additional $10 million of benefits in 2010 bringing total estimated annual benefits to $55 million in 2010 and thereafter. These benefits were primarily realized in cost of sales. We anticipate pre tax charges related to this program to be approximately $4 million in 2010. The actual timing of any future related costs is subject to change due to a variety of factors that may cause a portion of the spending and benefits to occur in future periods. 33 Table of Contents The capital expenditures, associated costs and related restructuring charges and the total amounts incurred since inception of this multi year strategy are included in the table below. Year Ended December 31, Cumulative Through December 31, 2009 2009 2008 2007 Capital expenditures $ 20.0 $ 59.5 $ 58.5 $ 152.7 Associated costs(1) 9.8 7.4 11.4 32.4 Restructuring and other charges(2) 6.5 19.3 0.7 38.3 (1)The associated costs principally include facility start up costs, which are primarily included in cost of sales on the consolidated statements of operations. These charges by our reporting structure were as follows: 2009 2008 2007 Food Packaging $ 7.6 $ 4.0 $ 10.2 Food Solutions 1.3 0.6 Protective Packaging 0.9 2.6 0.9 Other 0.2 0.3 Total $ 9.8 $ 7.4 $ 11.4 (2)The restructuring and other charges were primarily for costs for termination benefits, the majority of which were related to the Food Packaging segment. These charges were included in restructuring and other charges on the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 3, "Segments," for restructuring and other charges by reportable segment and Other. A reconciliation of the restructuring accrual for GMS is included below. Of the $6.5 million of restructuring and other charges related to GMS in 2009, $5.2 million was for costs for termination benefits in connection with our decision to cease some of our manufacturing operations in Norderstedt, Germany. We intend to relocate our bagmaking and printing operations to other existing facilities in Europe and plan to continue our production of medical products and maintain support functions in the Norderstedt facility. We estimate that we will incur total costs of approximately $7.0 million, all of which will be paid in 2010 or later. These estimated costs in connection with this action, by major type, consist of the following: Costs for termination benefits $ 5.2 Other associated restructuring costs, primarily for equipment relocation 1.2 Other non restructuring associated costs 0.6 Total $ 7.0 During 2009, we also recorded restructuring and other charges of $1.3 million primarily related to costs for termination benefits incurred in connection with other projects associated with GMS. During 2008, the restructuring and other charges of $19.3 million related to this program were primarily for costs for termination benefits related to our decision to close our manufacturing facility in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. This facilitys manufacturing operations were moved to existing facilities in North America. The components of the restructuring accrual for GMS through December 31, 2009 and the accrual balance remaining on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2009 were as follows: Restructuring accrual at December 31, 2008 $ 14.4 Provision for termination benefits 5.9 Adjustment to accrual for termination benefits (1.4 ) Cash payments during 2009 (9.8 ) Effect of changes in foreign currency rates 0.3 Restructuring accrual at December 31, 2009 $ 9.4 We expect to pay $9.3 million of the accrual balance remaining at December 31, 2009 in 2010. This amount is included in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2009. The 34 Table of Contents remaining accrual of $0.1 million is expected to be paid in 2011 and is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2009. 2008 Cost Reduction and Productivity Program In the third quarter of 2008, we implemented a cost reduction and productivity program. As a result, we recorded $65.8 million of pre tax charges primarily for costs for termination benefits in 2008. The components of the restructuring accrual through December 31, 2009 and the accrual balance remaining on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2009 related to this program are included in the table below. We expect to incur additional modest costs associated with this program during 2010. Restructuring accrual at December 31, 2008 $ 43.7 Provision for termination benefits 0.8 Cash payments made during 2009 (37.8 ) Effect of changes in foreign currency rates (0.1 ) Restructuring accrual at December 31, 2009 $ 6.6 We expect to pay $6.5 million of the accrual balance remaining at December 31, 2009 in 2010. This amount is included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2009. The remaining accrual of $0.1 million is expected to be paid in 2011 and is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2009. See "Cost of Sales" and "Marketing, Administrative and Development Expenses" above for a discussion of the benefits realized from this program in 2009. Operating Profit by Business Segment and Other Management evaluates the performance of each reportable segment based on its operating profit. Operating profit by our segment reporting structure for the three years ended December 31, 2009 was as follows: 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs. 2008% Change 2008 vs. 2007% Change Food Packaging $ 251.7 $ 217.5 $ 228.2 16 % (5 )% As a % of Food Packaging net sales 13.7 % 11.0 % 12.1 % Food Solutions 85.7 80.0 86.1 7 (7 ) As a % of Food Solutions net sales 9.6 % 8.1 % 9.1 % Protective Packaging 150.0 169.1 208.6 (11 ) (19 ) As a % of Protective Packaging net sales 12.6 % 11.4 % 13.8 % Other 11.9 15.0 28.0 (21 ) (46 ) As a % of Other net sales 3.7 % 3.7 % 8.8 % Total segments and other 499.3 481.6 550.9 4 (13 ) As a % of total net sales 11.8 % 9.9 % 11.8 % Restructuring and other charges(1) 7.0 85.1 1.6 (92 ) # Total operating profit $ 492.3 $ 396.5 $ 549.3 24 (28 ) As a % of total net sales 11.6 % 8.2 % 11.8 % #Denotes a change equal to or greater than 100% (1)Restructuring and other charges by our segment reporting structure were as follows: 2009 2008 2007 Food Packaging $ 6.0 $ 46.2 $ 0.5 Food Solutions 1.0 15.1 0.1 Protective Packaging (0.1 ) 18.8 1.0 Other 0.1 5.0 Total $ 7.0 $ 85.1 $ 1.6 See "Global Manufacturing Strategy and 2008 Cost Reduction and Productivity Program," above for further discussion of restructuring and other charges. 35  Table of Contents Food Packaging Segment Operating Profit 2009 compared with 2008 The increase in operating profit in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to lower input costs including favorable average petrochemical based raw material expenditures of approximately $80 million, the favorable impact of product price/mix of $46 million and freight and utilities costs of approximately $16 million. Operating profit was also favorably impacted from benefits from GMS and our expense control initiatives and other cost control measures in 2009 and 2008 as discussed above. These items were partially offset by the decline in unit volume discussed above. Expenses in this segment related to the implementation of GMS were $8 million in 2009 compared with $4 million in 2008. 2008 compared with 2007 The decrease in operating profit in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to higher input costs including unfavorable average petrochemical based raw material expenditures of approximately $60 million and freight and utilities costs of approximately $14 million. These items were partially offset by the favorable impact of product price/mix of $62 million discussed above. Expenses in this segment related to the implementation of GMS were $4 million in 2008 compared with $10 million in 2007. Food Solutions Segment Operating Profit 2009 compared with 2008 The increase in operating profit in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to lower input costs including favorable average petrochemical based raw material expenditures of approximately $40 million and freight and utilities costs of approximately $7 million. Operating profit was also favorably impacted by benefits from our expense control initiatives and other cost control measures in 2009 and 2008 as discussed above. These items were partially offset by the decline in unit volume discussed above. 2008 compared with 2007 The decrease in operating profit in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to higher input costs, including unfavorable average petrochemical based raw material expenditures of approximately $20 million and freight and utilities costs of approximately $4 million. These items were partially offset by the favorable impact product price/mix of $29 million discussed above. Protective Packaging Segment Operating Profit 2009 compared with 2008 The decrease in operating profit in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to the decline in unit volume and unfavorable product price/mix, both discussed above. These items were partially offset by favorable average petrochemical based raw material expenditures of approximately $60 million, freight and utilities costs of approximately $30 million. Operating profit was also favorably impacted from benefits from our expense control initiatives and other cost control measures in 2009 and 2008, as discussed above. 2008 compared with 2007 The decrease in operating profit in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to higher input costs, including unfavorable average petrochemical based raw material expenditures of approximately $30 million and freight and utilities costs of approximately $5 million. Also contributing to this decrease was the decline in unit volume, which was partially offset by the favorable product price/mix of $21 million discussed above. Other Operating Profit 2009 compared with 2008 The decrease in operating profit in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to the decline in unit volume in our Specialty Materials products discussed above. Partially offsetting this decline was favorable 36 Table of Contents average petrochemical based raw material expenditures of approximately $20 million, favorable product price/mix of approximately $9 million, and favorable freight and utilities costs of approximately $7 million. 2008 compared with 2007 The decrease in operating profit in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to higher input costs including unfavorable average petrochemical based raw material expenditures of approximately $10 million and freight and utilities costs of approximately $10 million, which included additional freight costs related to the Ethafoam&reg; foam product lines. These higher input costs were partially offset by the favorable impact of product price/mix shown above. This businesss operating profit was also unfavorably impacted by an interim supply and distribution agreement for the Ethafoam&reg; foam product lines. We completed the construction of additional capacity in the United States to produce these products before the end of the interim agreement. This businesss operating profit was also unfavorably impacted by the additional expenses related to innovation and new product introductions discussed above in "Marketing, Administrative and Development Expenses." Interest Expense Interest expense includes the stated interest rate on our outstanding debt, as well as the net impact of capitalized interest, the effects of interest rate swaps and the amortization of capitalized senior debt issuance costs, bond discounts, and terminated treasury locks. We expect to incur approximately $160 million of interest expense in 2010, which includes approximately $41 million of interest expense for a full year of accrued interest on the cash portion of the Settlement agreement. Interest expense for the three years ended December 31, 2009 was as follows: 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs. 2008 Change 2008 vs. 2007 Change Interest expense on the amount payable for the Settlement agreement $ 39.0 $ 36.9 $ 35.0 $ 2.1 $ 1.9 Interest expense on our senior notes: 12% Senior Notes due February 2014 30.9 30.9 7.875% Senior Notes due June 2017 17.6 17.6 6.875% Senior Notes due July 2033 30.9 30.9 30.9 5.625% Senior Notes due July 2013 21.9 21.9 21.9 3% Convertible Senior Notes redeemed July 2009 8.0 14.4 14.4 (6.4 ) 6.95% Senior Notes matured May 2009 3.6 16.1 16.1 (12.5 ) 5.375% Senior Notes matured April 2008 7.1 24.8 (7.1 ) (17.7 ) Other interest expense 9.7 10.1 7.0 (0.4 ) 3.1 Less: capitalized interest (6.7 ) (9.3 ) (9.5 ) 2.6 0.2 Total $ 154.9 $ 128.1 $ 140.6 $ 26.8 $ (12.5 ) Loss on Debt Redemption In the third quarter of 2009, we redeemed the entire $431.3 million of our 3% Convertible Senior Notes due 2033 and recorded a $3 million pre tax loss. This loss represented a 0.429% call premium of $2 million and a write down of the remaining debt issuance costs of $1 million related to the issuance of these senior notes in July 2003. See Note 11, "Debt and Credit Facilities," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Impairment of Available for Sale Securities Our valuation of our auction rate security investments resulted in the recognition of other than temporary impairment of $4 million ($2 million, net of taxes) in 2009 and $34 million ($22 million, net of taxes) in 2008. See Note 5, "Available for Sale Investments," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 37 Table of Contents Gain on Sale of Equity Method Investment In the first quarter of 2007, we sold our 50 percent investment in PolyMask Corporation to our joint venture partner, 3M Company (the "PolyMask transaction"). The joint venture was formed in 1991 to produce and sell non packaging surface protection films. Before the sale, we accounted for this joint venture under the equity method of accounting. We received an aggregate cash amount of $36 million for the transaction and other related assets and recorded a pre tax gain of $35 million ($22 million, net of taxes) in the first quarter of 2007. This gain was included in gain on the sale of equity method investment on the consolidated statement of operations. Our investment in this joint venture was not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Other (Expense) Income, Net The following table provides details of our other (expense) income, net: 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs. 2008 Change 2008 vs. 2007 Change Interest and dividend income $ 7.1 $ 14.1 $ 19.9 $ (7.0 ) $ (5.8 ) Net foreign exchange transaction losses (1.1 ) (16.0 ) (6.4 ) 14.9 (9.6 ) Settlement agreement and related costs (1.8 ) (1.5 ) (0.7 ) (0.3 ) (0.8 ) Noncontrolling interests 1.8 1.2 0.7 0.6 0.5 Advisory expenses incurred before ceasing work on an acquisition (7.5 ) 7.5 Net loss on sale of small product lines (0.2 ) (6.8 ) (0.2 ) 6.8 Gain on termination of forward starting interest rate swaps 3.7 (3.7 ) Costs associated with our accounts receivable securitization program (0.7 ) (3.4 ) (0.4 ) 2.7 (3.0 ) Other, net (5.2 ) (6.5 ) 9.5 1.3 (16.0 ) Other (expense) income, net $ (0.1 ) $ (12.1 ) $ 12.0 $ 12.0 $ (24.1 ) Interest and dividend income decreased in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates received on our invested cash and, to a lesser extent, lower cash balances in interest bearing accounts. Interest and dividend income decreased in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to the use of available cash and cash equivalents to retire the 5.375% Senior Notes on the date of their maturity and, to a lesser extent, lower interest rates received on our invested cash. Net foreign exchange transaction losses decreased in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates in 2009. Net foreign exchange transaction losses increased in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the latter part of 2008, particularly against foreign currencies in developing markets. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 25.9% for 2009, 19.1% for 2008 and 22.6% for 2007. As described below, in each of those years, we recognized benefits for items that may not recur to the same extent in future years. As such, we expect an effective income tax rate of approximately 27% for 2010. Our 2010 effective tax rate may be higher if we fund the Settlement agreement in 2010. We anticipate that funding the Settlement agreement in 2010 will result in a loss for U.S. income tax return purposes. This loss will eliminate some tax benefits in 2010, primarily the domestic manufacturing deduction. For 2009, our effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35% primarily due to the lower net effective income tax rate on foreign earnings and income tax benefits from tax credits and the domestic manufacturing deduction, partially offset by state income taxes and an increase in accruals relating to uncertain tax positions. See Note 15, "Income Taxes," for a reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory rate to our effective tax rate which also shows the major components of the year over year changes. 38 Table of Contents For 2008, the effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35% primarily due to the lower net effective income tax rate on foreign earnings and, to a lesser extent, the following items: a reduction in the estimated cost of repatriating certain foreign earnings, a change in assertion made with regard to certain undistributed foreign earnings, the reversal of tax accruals and related interest for contingencies that did not materialize following the completion of tax audits, and the utilization of loss carryforwards in a foreign jurisdiction for which no benefit had previously been recognized for financial reporting purposes. For 2007, the effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35% primarily due to the reversal of tax accruals and related interest and, to a lesser extent, the lower net effective income tax rate on foreign earnings, partially offset by state income taxes. Liquidity and Capital Resources The discussion that follows contains: a description of our material commitments and contingencies; a description of our principal sources of liquidity; a description of our outstanding indebtedness; an analysis of our historical cash flows and changes in working capital; a description of our derivative financial instruments; and a description of changes in our stockholders equity. Material Commitments and Contingencies Settlement Agreement and Related Costs We recorded a charge of $850.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, of which $512.5 million represents a cash payment that we are required to make (subject to the satisfaction of the terms and conditions of the Settlement agreement) upon the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy of W.R. Grace & Co. We did not use cash in any period with respect to this liability. The Bankruptcy Court has conducted hearings to consider confirmation of the PI Settlement Plan and has heard closing arguments with respect to the PI Settlement Plan but additional hearings may be held by the Bankruptcy Court and the District Court to consider matters related to the PI Settlement Plan. We do not know whether or when a final plan of reorganization will become effective or whether the final plan will be consistent with the terms of the Settlement agreement. We currently expect to fund this payment by using a combination of accumulated cash and cash equivalents, future cash flows from operations and funds available under our global credit facility, our European facility, or our accounts receivable securitization program, described below. The cash payment of $512.5 million accrues interest at a 5.5% annual rate, which is compounded annually, from December 21, 2002 to the date of payment. We have recorded this accrued interest in Settlement agreement and related accrued interest on our consolidated balance sheets, and these amounts were $234.3 at December 31, 2009 and $195.3 million at December 31, 2008. The information set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K in Note 16, "Commitments and Contingencies," under the caption "Settlement Agreement and Related Costs" is incorporated herein by reference. Cryovac Transaction Commitments and Contingencies The information set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K in Note 16, "Commitments and Contingencies," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption "Cryovac Transaction Commitments and Contingencies" is incorporated herein by reference. 39 Table of Contents MPERS Lawsuit and Other Litigation and Claims The information set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K in Note 16, "Commitments and Contingencies," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the captions "MPERS Lawsuit" and "Other Litigation and Claims" are incorporated herein by reference. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations and sets forth the amounts of required or contingently required cash outlays in 2010 and future years (amounts in millions): Payments Due by Years Contractual Obligations Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Short term borrowings $ 28.2 $ 28.2 $ $ $ Current portion of long term debt exclusive of debt discounts 6.5 6.5 Long term debt, exclusive of debt discounts 1,636.7 86.7 700.0 850.0 Total debt(1) 1,671.4 34.7 86.7 700.0 850.0 Interest payments due on long term debt(2) 1,191.0 120.9 241.9 177.3 650.9 Operating leases 138.6 34.0 47.7 24.8 32.1 Cash portion of the Settlement agreement, including accrued interest at December 31, 2009(3) 746.8 746.8 First quarter 2010 quarterly cash dividend declared 19.1 19.1 Other principal contractual obligations 179.9 114.3 62.7 2.9 Total contractual cash obligations $ 3,946.8 $ 1,069.8 $ 439.0 $ 905.0 $ 1,533.0 (1)These amounts include principal maturities (at face value) only. These amounts also include our contractual obligations under capital leases of $6.3 million in 2010, $7.6 million in 2011 2012 and $0.3 million in 2013 2014. (2)Includes interest payments required under our senior notes issuances only. (3)This liability is reflected as a current liability due to the uncertainty of the timing of payment. Interest accrues on this amount at a rate of 5.5% per annum, compounded annually, until it becomes due and payable. Current Portion of Long Term Debt and Long Term Debt The debt shown in the above table excludes unamortized bond discounts as of December 31, 2009 and therefore represents the principal amount of the debt required to be repaid in each period. Operating Leases The contractual operating lease obligations listed in the table above represent estimated future minimum annual rental commitments primarily under non cancelable real and personal property leases as of December 31, 2009. Cash Portion of the Settlement Agreement The Settlement agreement is described more fully in "Settlement Agreement and Related Costs," of Note 16, "Commitments and Contingencies," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Principal Contractual Obligations Other principal contractual obligations include agreements to purchase an estimated amount of goods, including raw materials, or services, including energy, in the normal course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the purchase. Liability for Unrecognized Tax Benefits At December 31, 2009, we had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest of $11 million, which is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2009, 40 Table of Contents we cannot reasonably estimate the future period or periods of cash settlement of these liabilities. See Note 15, "Income Taxes," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have reviewed our off balance sheet arrangements and have determined that none of those arrangements have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial statements, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. At December 31, 2009, we had no amounts outstanding under our accounts receivable securitization program. See Note 6, "Accounts Receivable Securitization Program," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Income Tax Payments We currently expect to pay between $100 million and $110 million in income taxes in 2010. This range would be adjusted if the Settlement agreement were to become effective in 2010. Contributions to Defined Benefit Pension Plans We maintain defined benefit pension plans for a limited number of our U.S. employees and for some of our non U.S. employees. We currently expect employer contributions to be approximately $12 million in 2010. Termination Benefit Payments In connection with our GMS and 2008 cost reduction and productivity program, we currently expect to pay approximately $16 million of termination benefits in 2010. Environmental Matters We are subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations, and we accrue for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. These accruals do not take into account any discounting for the time value of money and are not reduced by potential insurance recoveries, if any. We do not believe that it is reasonably possible that the liability in excess of the amounts that we have accrued for environmental matters will be material to our consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets or cash flows. We reassess environmental liabilities whenever circumstances become better defined or we can better estimate remediation efforts and their costs. We evaluate these liabilities periodically based on available information, including the progress of remedial investigations at each site, the current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible parties. As some of these issues are decided (the outcomes of which are subject to uncertainties) or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated, we adjust the recorded accruals, as necessary. We believe that these exposures are not material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations. We believe that we have adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures. Principal Sources of Liquidity We require cash to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures, interest, taxes and dividend payments and to pay our debt obligations and other long term liabilities as they come due. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, accumulated cash and amounts available under our existing lines of credit described below, including the global credit facility and the European credit facility, and our accounts receivable securitization program. In 2009, we redeemed the entire $431.3 million of our 3% Convertible Senior Notes, retired all of our outstanding 6.95% Senior Notes and issued $400 million of 7.875% Senior Notes and $300 million of 12% Senior Notes. We believe that our current liquidity position and future cash flows from operations will enable us to fund our operations, including all of the items mentioned above and the cash payment under the Settlement agreement should it become payable within the next 12 months. 41  Table of Contents With respect to the Settlement agreement, we do not know whether or when a final plan of reorganization for Grace will become effective or whether the final plan will be consistent with the terms of the Settlement agreement. Graces PI Settlement Plan is subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, including the availability of exit financing and the approval of both the Bankruptcy Court and United States District Court for the District of Delaware, resulting in uncertainty as to when the plan might become effective. Tax benefits resulting from the payment made under the Settlement agreement, which are currently recorded as deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheets, are anticipated to provide approximately $350 million of current and future cash tax benefits at the time the payment under the Settlement agreement is made. The amount and timing of future cash tax benefits could vary, depending on the amount of cash paid by us and various facts and circumstances at the time of payment under the Settlement agreement, including the price of our common stock, our tax position and the applicable tax codes. Cash and Cash Equivalents The following table summarizes our accumulated cash and cash equivalents: December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 Cash and cash equivalents $ 694.5 $ 128.9 See "Analysis of Historical Cash Flows" below. Lines of Credit The following table summarizes our available lines of credit and committed and uncommitted lines of credit, including the global credit facility and the European credit facility discussed below, at December 31, 2009 and 2008: December 31, 2009 2008 Used lines of credit $ 107.1 $ 46.7 Unused lines of credit 846.3 773.4 Total available lines of credit $ 953.4 $ 820.1 Available lines of credit committed $ 686.1 $ 588.8 Available lines of credit uncommitted 267.3 231.3 Total available lines of credit $ 953.4 $ 820.1 Our principal credit lines were committed and consisted of the global credit facility and the European credit facility. We are not subject to any material compensating balance requirements in connection with our lines of credit. Global Credit Facility The global credit facility is available for general corporate purposes, including the payment of amounts required to be paid upon the effectiveness of the Settlement agreement. We may re borrow amounts repaid under the global credit facility from time to time before the expiration or earlier termination of the global credit facility. Our obligations under the global credit facility bear interest at floating rates, which are generally determined by adding the applicable borrowing margin to the base rate or the interbank rate for the relevant currency and time period. The global credit facility provides for changes in borrowing margins based on our long term senior unsecured debt ratings. The facility has an expiration date of July 26, 2012. The terms of this facility include a requirement that, upon the occurrence of specified events that would adversely affect the Settlement agreement or would materially increase our liability in respect of the Grace bankruptcy or the asbestos liability arising from the Cryovac transaction, we would be required to repay any amounts outstanding under the global credit facility or refinance the facility within 60 days. Before December 10, 2009, the global credit facility commitments included $28 million provided by Lehman Commercial Paper Inc., a subsidiary of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. As a result of the 42 Table of Contents bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries in September 2008, Lehman Commercial Paper was no longer funding borrowing requests under the global credit facility. Effective December 10, 2009, we removed Lehman Commercial Papers commitments from the global credit facility and as a result, as of December 31, 2009, the total amount available under the global credit facility was approximately $472 million. While the current total amount available for borrowing under the global credit facility is approximately $472 million, the facility also provides a mechanism to increase the total facility size to a maximum of $750 million. This does not represent a commitment by the lenders to increase the facility size; rather, it provides us with a simplified method of requesting an increase at a later date if desired and market conditions permit. This mechanism is not included in the available lines of credit table above. Facility fees are payable at the rate of 0.20% per annum on the total amounts available under the revolving credit facility. The global credit facility provides for changes in facility fees based on our long term senior unsecured debt ratings. Also, the facility provides for springing subsidiary guarantees if our long term senior unsecured debt ratings by both Moodys and Standard & Poors fall below investment grade. During 2009, we borrowed funds from time to time under this facility. Interest expense related to the funds drawn in 2009 was $0.2 million. The related weighted average interest rate for these borrowings was 1.7%. At December 31, 2009 there were no amounts outstanding under this facility. European Credit Facility In November 2009, we entered into a &euro;150 million European credit facility, equivalent to U.S. $214 million at December 31, 2009. The facility has an expiration date of July 26, 2012. A syndicate of banks made this facility available to Sealed Air and a group of our European subsidiaries for general corporate purposes, including the payment of amounts required to be paid upon effectiveness of the Settlement agreement. We may re borrow amounts repaid under the European credit facility from time to time before the expiration or earlier termination of the facility. The terms of this facility are substantially similar to the terms of our global credit facility. As of December 31, 2009, we had an outstanding balance of &euro;45 million, which was equivalent to U.S. $64 million. We repaid this outstanding balance in January 2010. Interest expense related to the funds drawn in 2009 was $0.1 million and had a weighted average interest rate of 3.625%. In December 2009, after entering into the European credit facility, we cancelled our 170 million Australian dollar revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in March 2010. We did not utilize the Australian facility in 2009. Other Lines of Credit Substantially all our short term borrowings of $28 million at December 31, 2009 and $38 million at December 31, 2008 were outstanding under lines of credit available to several of our foreign subsidiaries. The following table details our other lines of credit at December 31, 2009 and 2008: December 31, 2009 2008 Available lines of credit $ 252.6 $ 222.2 Unused lines of credit 224.4 191.1 Weighted average interest rate 5.5 % 11.2 % See Note 11, "Debt and Credit Facilities," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our outstanding long term debt and available lines of credit. Accounts Receivable Securitization Program We and a group of our U.S. subsidiaries maintain an accounts receivable securitization program with a bank and an issuer of commercial paper administered by the bank. As of December 31, 2009, the maximum purchase limit for receivable interests was $125 million. The amounts available from time to time under the program may be less than $125 million due to a number of factors, including but not limited to our credit ratings, accounts receivable balances, the creditworthiness of our customers and our receivables collection experience. 43 Table of Contents During 2009, the level of eligible assets available under the program declined primarily due to our current credit rating. As a result, the amount available to us under the program was approximately $74 million at December 31, 2009. Although we do not believe that these restrictive provisions presently materially restrict our operations, if an event occurs that triggers one of these restrictive provisions, we could experience a further decline in the amounts available under the program or termination of the program. The program is scheduled to expire in December 2012. The program includes a bank financing commitment that must be renewed annually before the expiration date. The bank financing commitment is scheduled to expire on December 3, 2010. We plan to seek an additional 364 day renewal of the bank financing commitment before its expiration, but the bank is not obligated to renew the bank financing commitment. At December 31, 2009, we had no amounts outstanding under this program. See Note 6, "Accounts Receivable Securitization Program," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning this program. Covenants At December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with our financial covenants and limitations, as discussed in "Covenants," of Note 11, "Debt and Credit Facilities," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Debt Ratings Our cost of capital and ability to obtain external financing may be affected by our debt ratings, which the credit rating agencies review periodically. The Company and our long term senior unsecured debt are currently rated BB+ (stable outlook) by Standard & Poors. This rating is considered non investment grade. The Company and our long term senior unsecured debt are currently rated Baa3 (negative outlook) by Moodys. This rating is considered investment grade. If our credit ratings are downgraded, there could be a negative impact on our ability to access capital markets and borrowing costs could increase. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Outstanding Indebtedness At December 31, 2009 and 2008, our total debt outstanding consisted of the amounts set forth in the following table. See Note 11, "Debt and Credit Facilities," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our debt. December 31, 2009 2008 Short term borrowings $ 28.2 $ 37.6 Current portion of long term debt 6.5 151.5 Total current debt 34.7 189.1 Total long term debt, less current portion 1,626.3 1,289.9 Total debt $ 1,661.0 $ 1,479.0 Analysis of Historical Cash Flow The following table summarizes the changes in our cash flows for the three years ended December 31, 2009: 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs. 2008 % Change 2008 vs. 2007 % Change Net cash provided by operating activities $ 552.0 $ 404.4 $ 378.1 36 % 7 % Net cash used in investing activities (70.3 ) (176.7 ) (274.1 ) (60 ) (35 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 90.3 (562.9 ) (59.5 ) # # #Denotes a variance greater than 100% 44 Table of Contents Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 2009 compared with 2008 The $148 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2009 was primarily due to the following factors: a decrease in receivables, net, of $156 million in 2009, which was attributable to both lower sales and a decline in days sales outstanding in 2009; a decrease in inventories of $141 million in 2009, primarily due to managements efforts to maintain lower inventory levels and the benefit of lower average petrochemical based raw material expenditures experienced in 2009; and an increase in net earnings adjusted for non cash items of $77 million in 2009. These factors were partially offset by the following: a decrease of net cash of $160 million resulting from the repurchases in 2009 and sales in 2008 of receivable interests under our accounts receivable securitization program. We used available cash of $80 million to fund the repurchase of receivable interests in 2009, compared with the receipt of $80 million in cash from the sale of receivable interests in 2008; an increase in cash used for accounts payable of $40 million due to the timing of payments; an increase in accrued interest related to the Settlement agreement of $39 million; and an increase in cash used for the payment of termination benefits of $24 million in 2009 in connection with our 2008 cost reduction and productivity program and GMS. Cash payments for termination benefits were $48 million in 2009, compared with $24 million in 2008. 2008 compared with 2007 The $26 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2008 was primarily due to the following factors: an increase in other current liabilities of $114 million in 2008, primarily due to the following: a decrease in cash used for income taxes payable of $93 million in 2008. Income tax payments were $91 million in 2008 compared with $202 million in 2007. The decrease in income tax payments in 2008 primarily resulted from lower estimated taxable income for 2008; and an increase in accrued restructuring costs of $44 million in 2008, primarily reflecting additional net accrued termination costs recorded in connection with our 2008 cost reduction program and, to a lesser extent, GMS; partially offset by: a decrease in accrued payroll of $23 million in 2008, primarily reflecting lower management incentive compensation in 2008; and the utilization of $80 million available to us under our accounts receivable securitization program in 2008 as discussed above. These items were partially offset by: a decrease in net earnings adjusted for non cash items of $118 million in 2008; and an increase in cash used for accounts payable of $46 million in 2008, primarily due to the timing of payments. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 2009 compared with 2008 The $106 million decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2009 was primarily due to lower capital expenditures of $100 million in 2009 compared with 2008. During 2009, we completed the construction phase of GMS with the launch of our manufacturing facility in Poland. 45 Table of Contents 2008 compared with 2007 The $97 million decrease in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to the following: a decrease in cash used for acquisitions of $73 million in 2008; and a decrease of $30 million in capital expenditures in 2008, primarily due to the timing of the completion of some new capacity projects in 2008. These items were partially offset by cash received of $36 million in 2007 from the PolyMask transaction. We expect to continue to invest capital as we deem appropriate to expand our business, to maintain or replace depreciating property, plant and equipment, to acquire new manufacturing technology and to improve productivity. Since we have substantially finished the construction phase associated with GMS, we expect total capital expenditures in 2010 to be in the range of $80 million to $100 million. This projected range is comparable to the annual level of capital expenditures incurred before commencing GMS in 2006. This projection is based upon our capital expenditure budget for 2010, the status of approved but not yet completed capital projects, anticipated future projects and historic spending trends. Net Cash Provided By (Used in) Financing Activities 2009 compared with 2008 In 2009, our financing activities provided a net $90 million of cash and cash equivalents, primarily due to the following activities: issuance of $400 million of 7.875% Senior Notes due June 2017; issuance of $300 million of 12% Senior Notes due February 2014; funds drawn of $64 million under our European credit facility; partially offset by: redemption of the entire $431.3 million of our 3% Convertible Senior Notes; retirement of the remaining outstanding balance of $137 million of our 6.95% Senior Notes; and dividend payments of $76 million. In 2008, our financing activities resulted in a net usage of $563 million of cash and cash equivalents, which was primarily due to: retirement of our 5.375% Senior Notes with a face value of $300 million; purchase of $91 million in aggregate principal amount of the 6.95% Senior Notes; repurchases of our common stock of $95 million; and dividend payments of $76 million. 2008 compared with 2007 The $503 million increase in cash used for financing activities was primarily due to the following: an increase in net long term debt repayments of $390 million in 2008, primarily due to the retirement of our 5.375% Senior Notes with a face value of $300 million in April 2008 and the purchase of $91 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.95% Senior Notes; an increase in cash used for the repurchase of our common stock of $88 million in 2008, as discussed below; and an increase in cash used for the payment of common stock dividends of $12 million in 2008, primarily due to the increase in dividends paid per common share in 2008. Repurchases of Capital Stock During 2009, we did not repurchase any shares of common stock. During 2008, we repurchased 4 million shares of our common stock, par value $0.10 per share, in open market purchases at a cost of 46 Table of Contents $95 million. The average price per share of these common stock repurchases was $23.64. During 2007, we repurchased 0.2 million shares of our common stock in open market purchases at a cost of $7 million. The average price per share of these common stock repurchases was $31.58. All repurchases have been adjusted for the two for one stock split in March 2007. We made the share repurchases in 2008 under the share repurchase program adopted by our Board of Directors in August 2007 when the Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase in the aggregate up to 20 million shares of its issued and outstanding common stock. This program replaced our prior share repurchase program, which ended in August 2007. The current program has no set expiration date, and we may from time to time continue to repurchase our common stock. See Item 5, "Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities," for further information on the share repurchase program. Changes in Working Capital December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 Increase Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) $ 639.6 $ 50.5 $ 589.1 Current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) 1.4x 1.0x Quick ratio (current assets, less inventories divided by current liabilities) 1.1x 0.7x The increase in working capital in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to the following: an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $566 million. See "Analysis of Historical Cash Flows" above for details of the factors that contributed to the increase in cash and cash equivalents; a decrease in current portion of long term debt of $145 million. This decrease was primarily due to the retirement of the remaining $136.7 million 6.95% Senior Notes in May 2009; and a decrease in accounts payable of $63 million, which primarily reflected lower purchases of raw materials as a result of lower volumes of net sales and lower raw material unit costs experienced in 2009; and a decrease in accrued restructuring costs of $34 million, primarily due to payments made for termination benefits accrued in connection with our 2008 cost reduction and productivity program. These items were partially offset by: a decrease in inventories of $95 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation of $21 million, inventories would have decreased $116 million, primarily due to managements efforts to maintain lower inventory levels and the benefit of lower average petrochemical based raw material expenditures experienced in 2009; a decrease in deferred taxes of $54 million, due to a reclassification of a portion of the deferred tax asset related to the Settlement agreement to non current based on the current anticipated timing of the related tax benefit; an increase in accrued interest of $39 million related to the Settlement agreement; and an increase in other current liabilities of $27 million, primarily due to an increase in accrued payroll reflecting higher 2009 accruals for management incentive compensation expenses. Foreign currency translation had a net favorable impact on working capital of approximately $32 million. Derivative Financial Instruments Interest Rate Swaps The information set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K in Note 12, "Derivatives and Hedging Activities," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption "Interest Rate Swaps" is incorporated herein by reference. 47 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Forward Contracts At December 31, 2009, we were party to foreign currency forward contracts, which did not have a significant impact on our liquidity. The information set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K in Note 12, "Derivatives and Hedging Activities," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption "Foreign Currency Forward Contracts" is incorporated herein by reference. For further discussion about these contracts and other financial instruments, see Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." Stockholders Equity Our stockholders equity was $2,200 million at December 31, 2009 and $1,926 million at December 31, 2008. Stockholders equity increased $274 million, or 14%, in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to the following: net earnings of $244 million; and positive foreign currency translation of $72 million. The items above were partially offset by dividends paid and accrued on our common stock of $78 million in 2009. Recently Issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, Accounting Guidance and Disclosure Requirements We are subject to numerous recently issued statements of financial accounting standards, accounting guidance and disclosure requirements. Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Standards," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, describes these new accounting standards and is incorporated herein by reference. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on all available evidence, including historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. To derive these estimates and assumptions, management draws from those available sources that can best contribute to its efforts. These sources include our officers and other employees, outside consultants and legal counsel, experts and actuaries. In addition, we use internally generated reports and statistics, such as aging of accounts receivable, as well as outside sources such as government statistics, industry reports and third party research studies. The results of these estimates and assumptions may form the basis of the carrying value of assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from estimates under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, and any such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our consolidated results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The critical accounting policies discussed below should be read together with our significant accounting policies set forth in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Standards," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 48  Table of Contents Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts In the normal course of business, we extend credit to our customers if they satisfy pre defined credit criteria. We maintain an accounts receivable allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments. An additional allowance may be required if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates. The allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that management assesses to be appropriate to absorb estimated losses in the accounts receivable portfolio. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed quarterly, and changes to the allowance are made through the provision for bad debts, which is included in marketing, administrative and development expenses on our consolidated statements of operations. These changes may reflect changes in economic, business and market conditions. The allowance is increased by the provision for bad debts and decreased by the amount of charge offs, net of recoveries. The provision for bad debts charged against operating results is based on several factors including, but not limited to, a regular assessment of the collectibility of specific customer balances, the length of time a receivable is past due and our historical experience with our customers. In circumstances where a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations is known, we record a specific provision for bad debt against amounts due thereby reducing the receivable to the amount we reasonably assess will be collected. If circumstances change, such as higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customers ability to pay, our estimates of recoverability could be reduced by a material amount. Fair Value Measurements In determining fair value of financial instruments, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible and consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value. We determine fair value of our financial instruments based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market. When considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs, which are categorized in one of the following levels: Level 1 Inputs: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the reporting entity at the measurement date. Level 2 Inputs: Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at measurement date. Our fair value measurements for our financial instruments, such as our investments in auction rate securities, are subjective and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect our estimates. See Note 13, "Fair Value Measurements and Other Financial Instruments," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further details on our fair value measurements. Commitments and Contingencies Litigation On an ongoing basis, we assess the potential liabilities and costs related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us. We accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Litigation proceedings are evaluated on a case by case basis considering the available information, including that received from internal and outside legal counsel, to assess potential outcomes. While it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions, we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, we consider insurance recoveries, if any. We expense legal costs, including those legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred. We have in the past adjusted existing accruals as proceedings have continued, been settled or otherwise provided further information on which we could review the likelihood of outflows of resources and their measurability, and we expect to do so in future periods. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the 49 Table of Contents eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery, it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made. Impairment of Long Lived Assets The determination of the value of long lived assets requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements. We periodically review long lived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses, such as future cash flows, which are based on operational performance, market conditions and other factors, and disposition costs, may affect the carrying value of long lived assets and result in possible impairment expense in our consolidated financial statements. As assumptions and estimates change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment charge. Goodwill Goodwill is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually on a reporting unit level during the fourth quarter of each year. A review of goodwill may be initiated before or after conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable. A reporting unit is the operating segment unless, at businesses one level below that operating segment the "component" level discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management, and the component has economic characteristics that are different from the economic characteristics of the other components of the operating segment, in which case the component is the reporting unit. We use a fair value approach to test goodwill for impairment. We must recognize a non cash impairment charge for the amount, if any, by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. We derive an estimate of fair values for each of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach and two market approaches, each based on an applicable weighting. We assess the applicable weighting based on such factors as current market conditions and the quality and reliability of the data. Absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transactions, we believe that the use of these methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting units fair value. Fair value computed by these methods is arrived at using a number of factors, including projected future operating results, anticipated future cash flows, effective income tax rates, comparable marketplace data within a consistent industry grouping, and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties, however, related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis. Nonetheless, we believe that the combination of these methods provides a reasonable approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. Assumptions for sales, net earnings and cash flows for each reporting unit were consistent among these methods. Income Approach Used to Determine Fair Values The income approach is based upon the present value of expected cash flows. Expected cash flows are converted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of the future cash flows. The estimate of cash flows used is prepared on an unleveraged debt free basis. We use a discount rate that reflects a market derived weighted average cost of capital. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units expected long term operating and cash flow performance. The projections are based upon our best estimates of projected economic and market conditions over the related period including growth rates, estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures. Other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value long term growth rates, provisions for income taxes, future capital expenditures and changes in future cashless, debt free working capital. Market Approaches Used to Determine Fair Values We use two market approaches. The first market approach estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by applying multiples of operating performance measures to the reporting units operating performance. 50 Table of Contents These multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar investment characteristics to the reporting unit. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using multiples from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units and the Company. The second market approach is based on the publicly traded common stock of the Company and the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is based on the applicable multiples of the Company. The key estimates and assumptions that are used to determine fair value under the two market approaches includes trailing and future 12 month operating performance results and the selection of the relevant multiples to be applied. Under both market approaches, a control premium, or an amount that a buyer is usually willing to pay over the current market price of a publicly traded company, is applied to the calculated equity values to adjust the public trading value upward for a 100% ownership interest, where applicable. See Note 9, "Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details of our goodwill balance and the goodwill review performed in 2009 and other related information. Pensions We maintain a non contributory profit sharing plan and a contributory thrift and retirement savings plan in which most U.S. employees are eligible to participate. For a limited number of our U.S. employees and for some of our international employees, we maintain defined benefit pension plans. Under current accounting standards, we are required to make assumptions regarding the valuation of projected benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans. The projected benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost are based on third party actuarial assumptions and estimates that are reviewed and approved by management on a plan by plan basis each fiscal year. The principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation, the expected future rate of return on plan assets and the expected rate of future compensation increases. We revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of long term trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits. In determining the discount rate, we utilize market conditions and other data sources management considers reasonable based upon the profile of the remaining service life of eligible employees. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration the weighted average expected return on our asset allocation, asset return data, historical return data, and the economic environment. We believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions of the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. The rate of compensation increase is based on our long term plans for such increases. The measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is December 31. At December 31, 2009, the projected benefit obligation for our U.S. pension plans was $17 million and the net periodic benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $4 million. At December 31, 2009, the projected benefit obligation for our international pension plans was $86 million and the net periodic benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $18 million. In general, material changes to the principal assumptions could have a material impact on the costs and liabilities recognized on our consolidated financial statements. A 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate and a 100 basis point change in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in the following increases (decreases) in the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2009 and the expected net periodic benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 2010 (in millions). 25 Basis Point Increase 25 Basis Point Decrease United States Discount Rate Effect on 2009 projected benefit obligation $ (1.8 ) $ 1.9 Effect on 2010 expected net periodic benefit cost (0.2 ) 0.2 51 Table of Contents 100 Basis Point Increase 100 Basis Point Decrease Return on Assets Effect on 2010 expected net periodic benefit cost $ (0.4 ) $ 0.4 25 Basis Point Increase 25 Basis Point Decrease International Discount Rate Effect on 2009 projected benefit obligation $ (9.6 ) $ 10.1 Effect on 2010 expected net periodic benefit cost (1.2 ) 1.2 100 Basis Point Increase 100 Basis Point Decrease Return on Assets Effect on 2010 expected net periodic benefit cost $ (1.9 ) $ 1.9 Income Taxes Estimates and judgments are required in the calculation of tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets. Our deferred tax assets arise from net deductible temporary differences and tax benefit carry forwards. We evaluate whether our taxable earnings during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carry forwards may be utilized should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits. For those jurisdictions where the expiration dates of tax benefit carry forwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely, we provide a valuation allowance. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we estimate future taxable earnings, with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax benefit carry forwards and past operating results, to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future. Changes to tax laws, statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings can have an impact on valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods, we may need to adjust the valuation allowance, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes, we also evaluate our tax positions for years where the statutes of limitations have not expired. Based on this review, we may establish reserves for additional taxes and interest that could be assessed upon examination by relevant tax authorities. We adjust these reserves to take into account changing facts and circumstances, including the results of tax audits and changes in tax law. If the payment of additional taxes and interest ultimately proves unnecessary or less than the amount of the reserve, the reversal of the reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the reserves are no longer necessary. If an estimate of tax reserves proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to income tax provision would result. These adjustments to reserves and related expenses could materially affect our consolidated financial statements. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with tax authorities. See Note 15, "Income Taxes," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 52 Table of Contents Summarized Quarterly Financial Information (Unaudited, in millions, except share data) 2009 First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Net sales $ 988.5 $ 1,028.0 $ 1,079.9 $ 1,146.4 Gross profit 285.7 288.1 311.1 333.6 Net earnings 58.1 60.5 60.6 65.1 Basic net earnings per common share $ 0.37 $ 0.38 $ 0.38 $ 0.41 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 0.32 $ 0.33 $ 0.34 $ 0.37 2008 First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Net sales $ 1,177.4 $ 1,278.8 $ 1,219.0 $ 1,168.3 Gross profit 305.1 330.2 293.7 307.6 Net earnings 60.8 62.6 9.2 47.3 Basic net earnings per common share $ 0.38 $ 0.39 $ 0.06 $ 0.30 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 0.33 $ 0.34 $ 0.05 $ 0.26  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which may adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations. We seek to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We do not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rates From time to time, we may use interest rate swaps, collars or options to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. Our interest rate swaps are described in Note 12, "Derivatives and Hedging Activities," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and in "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Derivative Financial Instruments Interest Rate Swaps" contained in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Such information is incorporated herein by reference. At December 31, 2009, we had outstanding interest rate swaps, but no outstanding collars or options. At December 31, 2008, we had no outstanding interest rate swaps, collars or options. The carrying value of our total debt, which includes the impact of outstanding interest rate swaps in 2009, was $1,661.0 million at December 31, 2009 and $1,479.0 million at December 31, 2008. Our fixed rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps in 2009, was $1,568.6 million at December 31, 2009 and $1,430.9 million at December 31, 2008. The fair value of our fixed rate debt varies with changes in interest rates. Generally, the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The estimated fair value of our total debt, including the impact of outstanding interest rate swaps in 2009, was $1,774.7 million at December 31, 2009 and $1,204.8 million at December 31, 2008. A hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates would result in an increase of $66.9 million in the fair value of the total debt balance at December 31, 2009. These changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt do not alter our obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount of such debt. See Note 13, "Fair Value Measurements and Other Financial Instruments," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the methodology and inputs used to determine the fair value of our fixed rate debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk As a large, global organization, we face exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could materially impact our consolidated financial position or results of operations in the future. 53 Table of Contents The translation of the financial statements of our non U.S. operations is impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The change in net sales and operating income was impacted by the translation of our international financial statements into U.S. dollars. This resulted in a decrease in net sales of $242 million and increased operating profit by $26 million in 2009 compared with 2008. Recent economic events in Venezuela have exposed us to heightened levels of foreign currency exchange risk. Effective January 1, 2010, Venezuela has been designated as a highly inflationary economy, and the U.S. dollar replaced the Bolivar fuerte as the functional currency for our subsidiary in Venezuela. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, a highly inflationary economy is one that has a cumulative inflation rate of approximately 100 percent or more over a three year period. We determined the cumulative inflation rate using a blended inflation rate which included the National Consumer Price Index, known as the NCPI, and the consumer price index, known as the CPI. The CPI is only based on the metropolitan areas of Caracas and Maracaibo in Venezuela and the NCPI is based on the entire country of Venezuela. Once a country is designated to be a highly inflationary economy, the remeasurement method must be used, which is also called the monetary/nonmonetary method. All Bolivar denominated monetary assets and liabilities are re measured into U.S. dollars using the current exchange rate and any changes in foreign currency are reflected in other (expense) income on the consolidated statement of operations. All Bolivar denominated nonmonetary assets and liabilities are re measured into U.S. dollars using the historical exchange rates. The potential future impact to our consolidated financial position and results of operations for future Bolivar denominated transactions will depend on the exchange rates in effect when we enter into, remeasure and settle transactions. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the future impact until each transaction settles at its applicable exchange rate or gets remeasured into U.S. dollars. At December 31, 2009, our subsidiary in Venezuela had net assets of approximately $8 million. For the year ended December 31, 2009, less than 1% of our consolidated net sales and less than 3% of our consolidated operating profit was derived from our business in Venezuela. Accordingly, we do not expect the devaluation of the Bolivar fuerte to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We use foreign currency forward contracts to fix the amount payable on some transactions denominated in foreign currencies. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates at December 31, 2009 would have caused us to pay approximately $35.6 million to terminate these contracts. Our foreign currency forward contracts are described in Note 12, "Derivatives and Hedging Activities," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is contained in Part II, Item 8 and in "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Derivative Financial Instruments Foreign Currency Forward Contracts" contained in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Such information is incorporated herein by reference. We may use other derivative instruments from time to time, such as foreign exchange options to manage exposure due to foreign exchange rates and interest rate and currency swaps related to access to additional sources of international financing. These instruments can potentially limit foreign exchange exposure and limit or adjust interest rate exposure by swapping borrowings denominated in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had no foreign exchange options and currency swap agreements outstanding. Our outstanding debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing subsidiary. We believe that this enables us to better match operating cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match the currency of assets and liabilities. The amount of outstanding debt denominated in a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar was $109.0 million at December 31, 2009 and $48.5 million at December 31, 2008. Available for Sale Investments Our available for sale investments, consisting of auction rate securities at December 31, 2009 and 2008, are exposed to market risk related to changes in conditions in the U.S. financial markets and in the financial condition of the issuers of these securities. Our investment in auction rate securities at December 31, 2009 and 2008 had an original cost of $44.7 million (debt instruments of $24.7 million and non cumulative 54 Table of Contents perpetual preferred stock of $20.0 million). As of December 31, 2009, the estimated fair value of our investments in auction rate securities was $13.7 million. These auction rate securities consisted of two contingent capital securities that were converted into perpetual preferred stock of Ambac Assurance Corporation (AMBAC), the issuer, in December 2008, and three debt instruments issued individually by Primus Financial Products LLC (Primus) (maturity date 2021), River Lake Insurance Company (River Lake), a wholly owned subsidiary of Genworth Financial, Inc. (maturity date 2033) and Ballantyne Re Plc (Ballantyne) (maturity date 2036). We received interest and dividend payments of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. These five securities historically were re auctioned every twenty eight days, which had provided a liquid market for them. However, as a result of continuing liquidity concerns for these types of asset backed securities, every auction held by the issuers for these auction rate securities since late 2007 has failed. We account for these investments as available for sale investments on a security by security basis and determine whether a decline in fair value below its cost is temporary or other than temporary. The objective of other than temporary impairment analysis under U.S. GAAP is to determine whether the holder of an investment in a debt or equity security for which changes in fair value are not regularly recognized in earnings should recognize a loss in earnings when the investment is impaired. An investment is impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. Since August 2007, the estimated fair value of each of our investments in auction rate securities has been less than its original cost. As a result, we have recognized cumulative losses of $38.0 million ($23.8 million, net of taxes) through December 31, 2009 from the decline in market values from the securities original cost. After considering impairment indicators under U.S. GAAP and the declines in fair value, we determined that these investments were impaired. We evaluated the following factors in determining whether the impairment is temporary or other than temporary: the creditworthiness of the issuers and the timelines and level of interest payments received from the issuers; downgrades of credit ratings of all of the issuers; the severity of the decline in the estimated market value of the securities in 2008 and 2009; potential recovery of the investment value; AMBACs December 2008 exercise of its put option to convert its asset backed capital commitment securities into non cumulative perpetual preferred stock of AMBAC Assurance (no maturity date); AMBACs December 2008 cancellation of the dividend on its common stock; AMBACs cancellation of the dividend on its non cumulative preferred stock effective August 1, 2009; and the level of subordination of the Ballantyne securities. Based on the evaluations discussed above, we determined that the securities incurred other than temporary decline in fair market value. We also recorded $7.0 million of unrealized gains ($4.4 million, net of taxes) in 2009 in other comprehensive income related to an increase in the estimated fair value of the River Lake securities, following their initial decline in value, which was primarily due to an improvement in River Lakes credit spread. See Note 13, "Fair Value Measurements and Other Financial Instruments," for details on the inputs and valuation methodology used to calculate the estimated fair value of these investments. We continue to monitor developments in the market for auction rate securities including the specific securities in which we have invested. At December 31, 2009, ratings of the securities held by us by Moodys ranged from Baa3 to unrated and ratings by Standard & Poors ranged from BBB to D. These ratings are among the ratings assigned by each of these organizations for investment and non investment grade long term unsecured debt. Moreover, during the year ended December 31, 2009, we continued to receive all interest payments totaling $0.8 million on a timely basis from the issuers of the three debt securities, 55 Table of Contents Effective August 1, 2009, AMBAC discontinued paying dividends on its perpetual preferred stock. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we received dividend payments totaling $0.3 million from AMBAC. If credit or liquidity conditions relating to these securities or the issuers worsen, we may recognize additional other than temporary impairments, which would result in the recognition of additional losses on our consolidated statement of operations. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating cash needs without the sale of these securities. Customer Credit We are exposed to credit risk from our customers. In the normal course of business we extend credit to our customers if they satisfy pre defined credit criteria. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments. An additional allowance may be required if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates. The allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that management assesses to be appropriate to absorb estimated losses in the accounts receivable portfolio. Our customers may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. Despite uncertainties surrounding global economic conditions and levels of credit risk since the second half of 2007, we have not experienced a significant adverse change in our customers payment patterns or defaults. Our provision for bad debt expense was $6 million in 2009, $9 million in 2008 and $3 million in 2007. Pensions Recent market conditions have resulted in an unusually high degree of volatility and increased risks and short term liquidity concerns associated with some of the plan assets held by our defined benefit pension plans, which have impacted the performance of some of the plan assets. Based upon the annual valuation of our defined benefit pension plans at December 31, 2009, we expect our net periodic benefit costs to be approximately $20 million in 2010, which is comparable to prior years costs. See Note 14, "Profit Sharing, Retirement Savings Plans and Defined Benefit Pension Plans," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on our defined benefit pension plans. Commodities We use various commodity raw materials such as plastic resins and energy products such as electric power and natural gas in conjunction with our manufacturing processes. Generally, we acquire these components at market prices in the region in which they will be used and do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices. Moreover, we seek to maintain appropriate levels of commodity raw material inventories thus minimizing the expense and risks of carrying excess inventories. We do not typically purchase substantial quantities in advance of production requirements. As a result, we are exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components. 56  Table of Contents
