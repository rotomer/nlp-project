Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The information in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MDA) should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes set forth in Part II, Item 8, as well as the discussion included in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. All amounts and percentages are approximate due to rounding and all dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. Non U.S. GAAP Information In our MDA, we present financial information in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but we also present financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP, which we refer to as non U.S. GAAP. As discussed below, we provide this supplemental information as our management believes it is useful to investors. Investors should use caution, however, when reviewing our non U.S. GAAP presentations. The non U.S. GAAP information is not a substitute for U.S. GAAP information. It does not purport to represent the similarly titled U.S. GAAP information and is not an indicator of our performance under U.S. GAAP. Further, non U.S. GAAP financial measures that we present may not be comparable with similarly titled measures used by others. In our 2011 Outlook below, we present anticipated full year 2011 diluted net earnings per common share on a U.S. GAAP basis, but we also note that we will exclude any non operating gains or losses that may be recognized in 2011 related to currency fluctuations in Venezuela. We believe these gains or losses are attributable to the significant foreign exchange fluctuations in that country and are not indicative of a normal operating environment. We will exclude future foreign exchange and other non operating gains and or losses from our non U.S. GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per common share relating to our Venezuelan subsidiary until such time that we believe the foreign exchange environment in Venezuela stabilizes. We believe that excluding these items from our U.S. GAAP reported and projected net earnings performance will aid in the comparison of our adjusted net earnings performance between 2011 and prior years. We also present adjusted diluted net earnings per common share in our Highlights of Financial Performance below, for the three years ended December 31, 2010. Our management will look at our earnings performance both on an U.S. GAAP basis and on a non U.S. GAAP basis. Our non U.S. GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings performance excludes unusual items that are evaluated on an individual basis. Our evaluation of whether to exclude an item for purposes of determining our non U.S. GAAP net earnings performance considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including, among other things (i) its size and nature, (ii) whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations, and (iii) whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis. For purposes of determining non U.S. GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings performance, restructuring and other charges and their related tax effect are excluded. Further, the items excluded from non U.S. GAAP adjusted basis may also be excluded from the calculations of our performance measures set by the Compensation Committee for purposes of determining incentive compensation. Thus, our management believes that this information may be useful to investors. In our Highlights of Financial Performance, Net Sales by Segment Reporting Structure, Net Sales by Geographic Region and elsewhere below, we first present our results in accordance with U.S. GAAP and also present a non U.S. GAAP financial measure, adjusted diluted net earnings per common share. Also, in some of the discussions and tables that follow, we exclude the impact of foreign currency translation when presenting net sales information, which we define as constant dollar. Changes in net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency translation are non U.S. GAAP financial measures. As a worldwide business, it is important that we take into account the effects of foreign currency translation when we view our results and plan our strategies. Nonetheless, we cannot directly control changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Consequently, when our management looks at net sales to measure the performance of our business, we typically exclude the impact of foreign currency translation from net sales. We also may exclude the impact of foreign currency translation when making incentive compensation determinations. As a result, our management believes that these presentations may be useful to investors. 25 Table of Contents Overview Beginning with the invention of Bubble Wrap brand cushioning over fifty years ago, we have been a leading global innovator and manufacturer of a wide range of packaging and performance based materials and equipment systems that serve an array of food, industrial, medical and consumer applications. At December 31, 2010, we employed approximately 2,300 sales, marketing and customer service personnel throughout the world who sell and market our products through a large number of distributors, fabricators and converters, as well as directly to end users such as food processors, foodservice businesses, supermarket retailers and manufacturers. We have no material long term contracts for the distribution of our products. In 2010, no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net sales. Historically, net sales in our food businesses have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter, due to holiday events. Our Protective Packaging segment has also tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and higher during the back to school season in the mid third quarter and through the fourth quarter due to the holiday shopping season. Competition for most of our packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics, service and price. Competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology and, as a result, we maintain ongoing research and development programs to enable us to maintain technological leadership. For more details, see Competition included in Business, of Item 1, Part I. Our net sales are sensitive to developments in our customers business or market conditions, changes in the global economy, and the effects of foreign currency translation. Our costs can vary materially with changes in input costs, including petrochemical related costs (primarily resin costs), which are not within our control. Consequently, our management focuses on reducing those costs that we can control and using petrochemical based raw materials as efficiently as possible. We also believe that our global presence helps to insulate us from localized changes in business conditions. We manage our businesses to generate substantial operating cash flow. We believe that our operating cash flow will permit us to continue to spend on innovative research and development and to invest in our business by means of capital expenditures for property and equipment and acquisitions. Moreover, our ability to generate substantial operating cash flow should provide us with the flexibility to modify our capital structure as the need or opportunity arises and return capital to our stockholders. 2011 Outlook In 2011, we are anticipating an ongoing modest rate of economic recovery and an average constant dollar sales growth rate in the 5% to 7% range. Presently, our full year 2011 guidance also assumes: a low to mid single digit percent average increase in our resin costs compared to our 2010 average cost; a slightly unfavorable impact on net sales from foreign currency translation; depreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment of $145 million; amortization of share based incentive compensation expense of $30 million; interest expense of $150 million, including $43 million of accrued interest on the cash portion of our payment under the Settlement agreement; and an effective income tax rate of 27%. As a result, we anticipate our full year 2011 diluted net earnings guidance to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.90. Our guidance excludes the payment under the Settlement agreement, as the exact timing of the settlement payment is unknown, although it is possible that payment could occur in the first half of 2011. Payment of the Settlement agreement is expected to be accretive to our net earnings by approximately $0.12 to $0.14 per diluted share annually following the payment date. This impact assumes using a substantial portion of available cash to fund the payment and ceasing to accrue interest on the settlement liability. See Settlement Agreement and Related 26 Table of Contents Costs, of Material Commitments and Contingencies below, for further discussion. Additionally, our guidance excludes any non operating gains or losses that may be recognized in 2011 due to currency fluctuations in Venezuela. In addition, capital expenditures in 2011 are estimated to be $150 to $175 million. Significant 2010 Events Quarterly Cash Dividends In July 2010, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend by 8% to $0.13 per common share from $0.12 per common share. We used cash of $80 million to pay quarterly dividends in 2010. During 2009, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.12 per common share using $76 million of available cash. On February 17, 2011, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.13 per common share payable on March 18, 2011 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 4, 2011. The estimated amount of this dividend payment is $21 million based on 159 million shares of our common stock issued and outstanding as of January 31, 2011. Early Redemption of Debt In December 2010, we completed an early redemption of $150 million of our outstanding $300 million principal amount of our 12% Senior Notes due 2014. We redeemed the notes at 127% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. The aggregate redemption price was $196 million, which was funded with available cash. Because of the redemption, we recognized a pre tax loss of $39 million. See Loss on Debt Redemption below for further discussion. Completion of Global Manufacturing Strategy In 2010, we recognized approximately $8 million of restructuring and other associated charges related to our GMS program, which marked the completion of this program. As a result of the program, we have repositioned our supply chain platform for more profitable growth in developing regions while concurrently realigning our core manufacturing sites to improve operating efficiency and realizing an annual $55 million benefit run rate. Common Stock Repurchases In the fourth quarter of 2010, we repurchased 0.4 million shares of our common stock using approximately $10 million of available cash. 27 Table of Contents Highlights of Financial Performance Below are the highlights of our financial performance for the three years ended December 31, 2010. 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 2010 2009 2008 % Change % Change Net sales $ 4,490.1 $ 4,242.8 $ 4,843.5 6 % (12 )% Gross profit $ 1,252.8 $ 1,218.5 $ 1,236.6 3 % (1 )% % of total net sales 27.9 % 28.7 % 25.5 % Marketing, administrative and development expenses 710.2 719.2 755.0 (1 ) (5 ) % of total net sales 15.8 % 17.0 % 15.6 % Restructuring and other charges 7.6 7.0 85.1 9 (92 ) Operating profit $ 535.0 $ 492.3 $ 396.5 9 % 24 % % of total net sales 11.9 % 11.6 % 8.2 % Net earnings available to common stockholders $ 255.9 $ 244.3 $ 179.9 5 % 36 % Net earnings per common share: Basic $ 1.61 $ 1.54 $ 1.13 4 % 36 % Diluted $ 1.44 $ 1.35 $ 0.99 7 % 36 % Weighted average number of common shares outstanding: Basic 158.3 157.2 157.6 1 % % Diluted 176.7 182.6 188.6 (3 )% (3 )% As shown in the table above, our diluted net earnings per common share increased 7% in 2010 compared with 2009. The primary contributing factors to our diluted net earnings per common share growth in 2010 compared with 2009 were: higher gross profit of $34 million, which was largely driven by volume growth in both our industrial and food businesses, benefits realized from our supply chain productivity improvements and from producing products in our new, low cost facilities in developing regions. These factors were partially offset by higher average petrochemical based raw material costs of approximately $130 million; lower marketing, administrative and development expenses of $9 million, primarily due to lower incentive compensation expenses as our financial results for 2010 did not meet some of our goals; and a decline in the weighted average number of diluted common shares of 5.9 million in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to the early redemption in July 2009 of our 3% Convertible Senior Notes due 2033. These factors were partially offset by an increase in non operating items of $29 million, primarily due to the loss on debt redemption of $39 million in 2010 compared with $3 million in 2009. On an adjusted basis, excluding the items detailed in Diluted Net Earnings per Common Share below, our diluted net earnings per common share increased 11% to $1.60 in 2010 from $1.44 in 2009. A reconciliation of U.S. GAAP diluted net earnings per common share to non U.S. GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per common share is included in Diluted Net Earnings per Common Share below. See the discussions below for further details about the material factors that contributed to the changes in our net earnings for the three years ended December 31, 2010. 28 Table of Contents Net Sales by Segment Reporting Structure The following table presents net sales by our segment reporting structure: 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 2010 2009 2008 % Change % Change Net sales: Food Packaging $ 1,923.6 $ 1,839.8 $ 1,969.4 5 % (7 )% As a % of total net sales 43 % 43 % 41 % Food Solutions 934.9 891.7 988.3 5 (10 ) As a % of total net sales 21 % 21 % 20 % Protective Packaging 1,299.4 1,192.9 1,480.3 9 (19 ) As a % of total net sales 29 % 28 % 31 % Other 332.2 318.4 405.5 4 (21 ) As a % of total net sales 7 % 8 % 8 % Total $ 4,490.1 $ 4,242.8 $ 4,843.5 6 % (12 )% Net Sales by Geographic Region The following table presents our net sales by geographic region: 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 2010 2009 2008 % Change % Change Net sales: U.S. $ 2,081.6 $ 1,969.1 $ 2,185.2 6 % (10 )% As a % of total net sales 46 % 46 % 45 % International 2,408.5 2,273.7 2,658.3 6 (15 ) As a % of total net sales 54 % 54 % 55 % Total net sales $ 4,490.1 $ 4,242.8 $ 4,843.5 6 % (12 )% By geographic region, the components of the increase in net sales for 2010 compared with 2009 were as follows: 2010 compared with 2009 U.S. International Total Company Volume Units $ 116.4 6 % $ 99.3 4 % $ 215.7 5 % Volume Acquired businesses, net of dispositions (1.8 ) (1.8 ) (3.6 ) Product price/mix (2.0 ) (32.7 ) (1 ) (34.7 ) (1 ) Foreign currency translation 69.9 3 69.9 2 Total $ 112.6 6 % $ 134.7 6 % $ 247.3 6 % 29 Table of Contents By geographic region, the components of the decrease in net sales for 2009 compared with 2008 were as follows: 2009 compared with 2008 U.S. International Total Company Volume Units $ (186.4 ) (9 )% $ (192.3 ) (7 )% $ (378.7 ) (8 )% Volume Acquired businesses, net of dispositions 2.2 (3.4 ) (1.2 ) Product price/mix (32.0 ) (1 ) 53.2 2 21.2 1 Foreign currency translation (242.0 ) (9 ) (242.0 ) (5 ) Total $ (216.2 ) (10 )% $ (384.5 ) (14 )% $ (600.7 ) (12 )% Foreign Currency Translation Impact on Net Sales As shown above, more than 50% of our consolidated net sales are generated outside the U.S. Approximately 20% of our consolidated net sales are euro denominated. Since we are a U.S. company, we translate our foreign currency denominated net sales into U.S. dollars. Due to the strengthening and weakening in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, the translation of our net sales from foreign currencies to U.S. dollars may result in a favorable or unfavorable impact on our consolidated net sales. In 2010, we experienced a favorable foreign currency translation impact on net sales of $70 million compared with 2009 due to the strengthening of most foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar. This impact includes an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of $18 million in the second half of 2010 as the U.S. dollar began to strengthen against most foreign currencies. In 2009, we experienced an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact on net sales of $242 million compared with 2008 due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to most foreign currencies. This impact includes a favorable foreign currency translation impact of $49 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 as most foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar. Components of Change in Net Sales The following tables present the components of change in net sales by our segment reporting structure for 2010 compared with 2009 and 2009 compared with 2008. We also present the change in net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, a non U.S. GAAP measure, which we define as constant dollar. We believe using constant dollar measures aids in the comparability between periods.

Also included in our reported product price/mix is the net effect of some of our customers purchasing our products in other countries at selling prices denominated in U.S. dollars or euros. This primarily arises when we export product from the U.S. and euro zone countries. The impact to our reported product price/mix of these purchases in other countries at selling prices denominated in U.S. dollars or euros was approximately $(17) million unfavorable for 2010 compared with 2009 and approximately $55 million favorable for 2009 compared with 2008. In 2010 and 2009, this effect was most pronounced in our Food Packaging segment, in part due to the volatility in Venezuelan exchange rates. The following net sales discussion is on a constant dollar basis. Food Packaging Segment Net Sales 2010 compared with 2009 The $34 million or 2% increase in net sales in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to: higher unit volumes in North America of $36 million, or 4%, and in the Latin American region of $22 million, or 8%; partially offset by: unfavorable impacts of product price/mix in North America of $12 million, or 1%, and in the Latin American region of $9 million, or 3%. The higher unit volumes in North America and in Latin America were mostly due to an increase in our customers beef production rates, resulting in higher demand for most of our packaging formats. The unfavorable impact of product price/mix in North America was primarily due to selectively lower pricing associated with higher customer volume commitments, which offset the benefits of our price increases and formula contract adjustments in the year. The unfavorable impact of product price/mix in the Latin American region was primarily due to the volatility of the Venezuelan currency as discussed above. 2009 compared with 2008 The $9 million or 1% decrease in net sales in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to: decreases in unit volume in Europe of $24 million, or 5%, and in the United States of $19 million, or 2%; partially offset by: favorable impacts of product price/mix in Latin America of $31 million, or 11%. 31 Table of Contents The decrease in unit volume in Europe was primarily due to lower equipment sales, which we believe was mostly the result of lower capital spending by customers in this region. The decrease in unit volume in the United States was primarily due to the decline in local meat production mostly experienced during the first nine months of 2009. The unit volume declines in Europe and the United States reflected the continuing economic weakness in these regions. The favorable impact of product price/mix in Latin America was primarily due to the timing of pricing actions on most Food Packaging products, in part to cover the weakness of the Venezuelan currency. Food Solutions Segment Net Sales 2010 compared with 2009 The $30 million, or 4%, increase in net sales in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to: higher unit volumes in Europe of $11 million, or 3%, and North America of $10 million, or 3%, mostly due to increased demand for our ready meals packaging products and, to a lesser extent, our vertical pouch packaging products; and favorable product price/mix in North America of $12 million, or 3%, from the benefits of both prior price increases and contract adjustments. These factors were partially offset by a decline in product price/mix in Europe of $5 million, or 2%, primarily due to the timing of price adjustments for changes in resin costs experienced in the first half of 2010. 2009 compared with 2008 The $39 million, or 4%, decrease in net sales in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to decreases in unit volume in Europe of $29 million, or 7%, and in North America of $13 million, or 3%. The decrease in unit volume in Europe was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of reduced consumption of certain meats in some countries, which in turn resulted in lower sales of our case ready packaging products. The decrease in North America was primarily due to lower sales of our vertical pouch packaging products to customers in the foodservice sector. The unit volume decreases in Europe and North America reflected the economic weakness in these regions. Outsourced Products In addition to net sales from products produced in our facilities, net trade sales in this segment were also attributable to the sale of products fabricated by other manufacturers, which we refer to as outsourced products. Outsourced products include, among others, foam and solid plastic trays and containers fabricated primarily in North America and in Europe that largely support our case ready products. We have strategically opted to use third party manufacturers for technically less complex products and selected equipment in order to offer customers a broader range of solutions. In each of the three years ended December 31, 2010, outsourced products represented approximately 17% of Food Solutions net sales. We have benefited from this strategy with increased net sales and operating profit requiring minimal capital expenditures. Net sales of outsourced products included in this segment amounted to $159 million in 2010, $150 million in 2009 and $170 million in 2008. In addition, we had sales of $119 million in 2010, $90 million in 2009 and $70 million in 2008 from the sales of outsourced products in our other segments, primarily our Protective Packaging segment. Protective Packaging Segment Net Sales 2010 compared with 2009 The $96 million, or 8%, increase in net sales in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily the result of higher unit volumes in North America of $60 million, or 9%, in Europe of $24 million, or 7%, and in the Asia Pacific region of $17 million, or 13%. These increases were principally attributable to improving economic conditions in these regions, which were consistent with manufacturing output and export and shipping trends. Also contributing to the higher unit volumes, to a lesser extent, was strength in fulfillment/e commerce applications. 32 Table of Contents 2009 compared with 2008 The $238 million, or 16%, decrease in net sales in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily the result of lower unit volume in North America of $115 million, or 14%, and in Europe of $70 million, or 16%. These declines were principally attributable to continuing economic weakness in these regions, which were consistent with manufacturing output and export and shipping trends. Other Net Sales 2010 compared to 2009 The $17 million, or 5%, increase in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily attributed to higher unit volumes in North America of $12 million, or 11%, and in Europe of $16 million, or 11%. These increases were primarily attributed to higher unit volumes for some of our Specialty Materials products, which were principally the result of improving economic conditions in these regions, consistent with manufacturing output and export and shipping trends. Partially offsetting these factors was lower unit volumes in our Medical Applications business in Asia of $13 million, or 38%, primarily due to the impact of an April 2010 licensing expiration in China. Late in the third quarter of 2010, our license was renewed. 2009 compared with 2008 The $73 million, or 18%, decrease in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily attributed to lower unit volumes in North America of $44 million, or 29%, and in Europe of $27 million, or 14%. These declines were primarily attributed to lower unit volumes for some of our Specialty Materials products, which were principally the result of continuing economic weakness in these regions consistent with manufacturing output and export and shipping trends. Cost of Sales Our primary input costs include resins, direct and indirect labor, other raw materials and other input costs, including energy related costs and transportation costs. We utilize petrochemical based resins in the manufacture of many of our products. The costs for these raw materials are impacted by the rise and fall in crude oil and natural gas prices, since they serve as feedstocks utilized in the production of most resins. The prices for these feedstocks have been particularly volatile in recent years as a result of changes in global demand. In addition, supply and demand imbalances of intermediate compounds such as benzene and supplier facility outages also impacted resin costs. Although changes in the prices of crude oil and natural gas are not perfect benchmarks, they are indicative of the variations in raw materials and other input costs we face. We continue to monitor changes in raw material and energy related costs as they occur and take pricing actions as appropriate to lessen the impact of cost increases when they occur. In this cost of sales section and in the marketing, administrative and development expenses section below, when we refer to variable incentive compensation we are referring to our annual U.S. profit sharing contribution (in both sections) and our annual cash incentive compensation (in the marketing, administrative and development expenses section). Variable incentive compensation does not include our share based incentive compensation programs. Details about our share based incentive compensation programs are included in Note 17, Stockholders Equity. Cost of sales for the three years ended December 31, 2010 was as follows: 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 2010 2009 2008 % Change % Change Cost of sales $ 3,237.3 $ 3,024.3 $ 3,606.9 7 % (16 )% As a % of net sales 72 % 71 % 74 % 33 Table of Contents 2010 compared with 2009 The $213 million increase in cost of sales in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to: higher average petrochemical based raw material expenditures due to additional consumption from the 5% increase in sales volume in 2010; higher resin costs of approximately $130 million attributable to the increased average cost per pound of resin in 2010; higher other input costs, including transportation and energy related costs of $30 million in 2010; and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $53 million in 2010. The factors above that drove the increase in cost of sales in 2010 compared with 2009 were partially offset by our supply chain productivity improvements, including lower headcount in 2010 compared with 2009 despite higher unit volumes, and by the benefits of producing products in our new, low cost facilities in developing regions. Also partially offsetting the increase in cost of sales was lower variable incentive compensation expenses of $6 million in 2010 compared with 2009 because we did not meet some of our 2010 financial performance goals. Expenses included in cost of sales related to the implementation of GMS were $4 million in 2010 compared with $10 million in 2009. 2009 compared with 2008 The $583 million decrease in cost of sales in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to: lower average petrochemical based raw material expenditures of approximately $200 million, which was primarily experienced in the first nine months of 2009; the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $185 million; other lower input costs, including favorable freight and energy related costs in 2009, of approximately $45 million; and estimated benefits from our expense control initiatives and other cost control measures in 2009, including approximately $40 million of incremental benefits from our 2008 cost reduction and productivity program and from GMS. Expenses included in cost of sales related to the implementation of GMS were $10 million in 2009 compared with $7 million in 2008. Marketing, Administrative and Development Expenses Marketing, administrative and development expenses for the three years ended December 31, 2010 were as follows: 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 2010 2009 2008 % Change % Change Marketing, administrative and development expenses $ 710.2 $ 719.2 $ 755.0 (1 )% (5 )% As a % of net sales 15.8 % 17.0 % 15.6 % 2010 compared with 2009 Marketing, administrative and development expenses decreased $9 million in 2010 compared with 2009. These expenses decreased primarily due to lower incentive compensation expenses of approximately $30 million in 2010, primarily because we did not meet some of our 2010 financial performance goals. See the table below for further details. 34 Table of Contents This factor was partially offset by: higher sales and marketing costs to support the increase in net sales in 2010 compared with 2009, including higher travel and entertainment expenses of $20 million; and additional research and development expenses of $5 million, which includes spending related to innovation and new product introductions. Our variable incentive compensation expense includes annual cash incentives and our annual U.S. profit sharing contribution. We also have long term, share based incentive compensation that is included in marketing, administrative and development expenses. The table below shows the year over year changes in these expenses in 2010 compared with 2009. 2010 vs. 2009 2010 2009 Change Annual cash incentive compensation $ 18.0 $ 35.0 $ (17.0 ) Annual U.S. profit sharing contribution(1) 18.0 29.0 (11.0 ) Share based incentive compensation 30.6 38.8 (8.2 ) Total $ 66.6 $ 102.8 $ (36.2 ) (1) Approximately $10 million in 2010 and $16 million in 2009 of our U.S. profit sharing contribution expense is included in cost of sales. 2009 compared with 2008 Marketing, administrative and development expenses decreased $36 million in 2009 compared with 2008. These expenses decreased due to the following: estimated benefits from our expense control initiatives and other cost control measures in 2009, including approximately $40 million of incremental benefits from our 2008 cost reduction and productivity program, lower travel and entertainment expenses and GMS; and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $31 million. These decreases were partially offset by higher incentive compensation expenses, including long term share based incentive compensation of approximately $39 million in 2009, of which approximately $30 million occurred in the fourth quarter of 2009, because we exceeded our 2009 financial performance goals but did not meet our 2008 financial performance goals. The table below shows the year over year changes in incentive compensation expenses in 2009 compared with 2008. 2009 vs. 2008 2009 2008 Change Annual cash incentive compensation $ 35.0 $ 13.0 $ 22.0 Annual U.S. profit sharing contribution 29.0 18.0 11.0 Share based incentive compensation 38.8 16.5 22.3 Total $ 102.8 $ 47.5 $ 55.3 (1) Approximately $16 million in 2009 and $10 million in 2008 of our U.S. profit sharing contribution expense is included in cost of sales. 35 Table of Contents Restructuring Activities Global Manufacturing Strategy We announced our global manufacturing strategy program in 2006 and completed the program in 2010. The goals of this multi year program were to realign our manufacturing footprint to expand capacity in growing markets, to further improve our operating efficiencies, and to implement new technologies more effectively. Additionally, we optimized certain manufacturing platforms in North America and Europe into centers of excellence. By taking advantage of new technologies and streamlining production on a global scale, we have continued to enhance our profitable growth and our global leadership position and have produced meaningful benefits. At the inception of this multi year program, we projected cumulative capital expenditures and related costs to implement this program to be approximately $220 million. The actual amount was $235 million. A substantial portion of the difference between the projected amount and the actual amount of capital expenditures and related costs was due to foreign currency translation. The capital expenditures, associated costs and related restructuring charges and the total amounts incurred since inception of this multi year program are included in the table below. These associated costs and restructuring and other charges have been excluded from our non U.S. GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per common share. See Diluted Net Earnings Per Common Share below for further details. Cumulative Through Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2010 2009 2008 2010 Capital expenditures $ 3.3 $ 20.0 $ 59.5 $ 156.0 Associated costs 3.8 9.8 7.4 36.2 Restructuring and other charges 4.4 6.5 19.3 42.7 We estimate that we realized approximately $25 million in benefits in 2008, which increased to $45 million in 2009, and increased further to $55 million in 2010. These benefits are primarily realized in cost of sales. European Facility Closure In December 2010, we informed affected employees that we would be closing a small shrink packaging factory in Europe. We are taking this action based on our review of operating costs and technology levels in an effort to simplify our plant network and improve our operating efficiency. We recorded associated costs and restructuring and other charges of $7 million in 2010. We will record the remaining costs of approximately $1 to 2 million in future years, mostly in 2011. These associated costs and restructuring and other charges related to this action have been excluded from our non U.S. GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per common share. See Diluted Net Earnings Per Common Share below for further details. See Note 4, Restructuring Activities, for additional information on GMS and our other recent restructuring activities. 36 Table of Contents Operating Profit Management evaluates the performance of each reportable segment based on its operating profit. Operating profit by our segment reporting structure for the three years ended December 31, 2010 was as follows: 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 2010 2009 2008 % Change % Change Food Packaging $ 262.7 $ 251.7 $ 217.5 4 % 16 % As a % of Food Packaging net sales 13.7 % 13.7 % 11.0 % Food Solutions 99.2 85.7 80.0 16 7 As a % of Food Solutions net sales 10.6 % 9.6 % 8.1 % Protective Packaging 169.5 150.0 169.1 13 (11 ) As a % of Protective Packaging net sales 13.0 % 12.6 % 11.4 % Other 11.2 11.9 15.0 (6 ) (21 ) As a % of Other net sales 3.4 % 3.7 % 3.7 % Total segments and other 542.6 499.3 481.6 9 4 As a % of net sales 12.1 % 11.8 % 9.9 % Restructuring and other charges(1) 7.6 7.0 85.1 9 (92 ) Total operating profit $ 535.0 $ 492.3 $ 396.5 9 % 24 % As a % of net sales 11.9 % 11.6 % 8.2 % (1) Restructuring and other charges by our segment reporting structure were as follows: 2010 2009 2008 Food Packaging $ 3.7 $ 6.0 $ 46.2 Food Solutions 1.0 15.1 Protective Packaging 3.8 (0.1 ) 18.8 Other 0.1 0.1 5.0 Total $ 7.6 $ 7.0 $ 85.1 See Restructuring Activities above for further discussion of restructuring activities. Food Packaging Segment Operating Profit 2010 compared with 2009 The increase in operating profit in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to the favorable impact of the increase in unit volumes mentioned above. Also contributing to this segments increase in operating profit were lower marketing, administrative and development expenses as a percentage of net sales, which include the impact of lower variable incentive compensation expenses mentioned above. These factors were partially offset by higher average petrochemical based raw material expenditures of approximately $51 million. Expenses in this segment related to the implementation of GMS were $3 million in 2010 compared with $8 million in 2009. 2009 compared with 2008 The increase in operating profit in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to lower input costs including favorable average petrochemical based raw material expenditures of approximately $80 million and the favorable impact of product price/mix of $46 million and freight and utilities costs of approximately $16 million. Operating profit was also favorably impacted by benefits from GMS and our expense control initiatives and other cost control 37 Table of Contents measures in 2009 and 2008 as discussed above. These items were partially offset by the decline in unit volumes discussed above. Expenses in this segment related to the implementation of GMS were $8 million in 2009 compared with $4 million in 2008. Food Solutions Segment Operating Profit 2010 compared with 2009 The increase in operating profit in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to the favorable impacts of the increase in unit volumes and product price/mix, both mentioned above. Also contributing to this segments increase in operating profit were lower marketing, administrative and development expenses as a percentage of net sales, which include the impact of lower variable incentive compensation expenses mentioned above. These factors were partially offset by higher average petrochemical based raw material expenditures of approximately $30 million. 2009 compared with 2008 The increase in operating profit in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to lower input costs including favorable average petrochemical based raw material expenditures of approximately $40 million and lower freight and utilities costs of approximately $7 million. Operating profit was also favorably impacted by benefits from our expense control initiatives and other cost control measures in 2009 and 2008 as discussed above. These items were partially offset by the decline in unit volume discussed above. Protective Packaging Segment Operating Profit 2010 compared with 2009 The increase in operating profit in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to the favorable impact of the increase in unit volumes mentioned above. Also contributing to this segments increase in operating profit were lower marketing, administrative and development expenses as a percentage of net sales, which include the impact of lower variable incentive compensation expenses mentioned above. These factors were partially offset by higher average petrochemical based raw material expenditures of approximately $35 million. Expenses included in this segments operating profit related to the closure of a small factory in Europe were $3 million in 2010. 2009 compared with 2008 The decrease in operating profit in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to the decline in unit volumes and unfavorable product price/mix, both discussed above. These items were partially offset by favorable average petrochemical based raw material expenditures of approximately $60 million and lower freight and utilities costs of approximately $30 million. Operating profit was also favorably impacted by benefits from our expense control initiatives and other cost control measures in 2009 and 2008, as discussed above. Other Operating Profit 2010 compared with 2009 The decrease in operating profit in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to higher average petrochemical based raw material expenditures of approximately $14 million. Also contributing to the decline in operating profit were incremental expenses related to our new ventures. These factors were partially offset by the favorable impact of the increase in unit volumes mentioned above. 2009 compared with 2008 The decrease in operating profit in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to the decline in unit volumes in our Specialty Materials products discussed above. Partially offsetting this decline were favorable average petrochemical based raw material expenditures of approximately $20 million, favorable product price/mix of approximately $9 million, and favorable freight and utilities costs of approximately $7 million. 38 Table of Contents Interest Expense Interest expense includes the stated interest rate on our outstanding debt, as well as the net impact of capitalized interest, the effects of interest rate swaps and the amortization of capitalized senior debt issuance costs, bond discounts, and terminated treasury locks. Interest expense for the three years ended December 31, 2010 was as follows: 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 2010 2009 2008 Change Change Interest expense on the amount payable for the Settlement agreement $ 41.1 $ 39.0 $ 36.9 $ 2.1 $ 2.1 Interest expense on our senior notes: 5.625% Senior Notes due July 2013 21.9 21.9 21.9 12% Senior Notes due February 2014(1) 30.0 30.9 (0.9 ) 30.9 7.875% Senior Notes due June 2017, issued June 2009 33.0 17.6 15.4 17.6 6.875% Senior Notes due July 2033 30.9 30.9 30.9 3% Convertible Senior Notes redeemed July 2009 8.0 14.4 (8.0 ) (6.4 ) 6.95% Senior Notes matured May 2009(2) 3.6 16.1 (3.6 ) (12.5 ) 5.375% Senior Notes matured April 2008 7.1 (7.1 ) Other interest expense 8.4 9.7 10.1 (1.3 ) (0.4 ) Less: capitalized interest (3.7 ) (6.7 ) (9.3 ) 3.0 2.6 Total $ 161.6 $ 154.9 $ 128.1 $ 6.7 $ 26.8 (1) We redeemed $150 million of these notes in December 2010. See Loss on Debt Redemption below. (2) A substantial portion of these notes were retired prior to their maturity. Gains on Sale (Other Than Temporary Impairment) of Available for Sale Securities In 2010, we sold our five auction rate security investments, representing our total holdings of these securities. These sales resulted in a pre tax gain of $7 million ($4 million, net of taxes). Before we sold these investments, we recognized $1 million of pre tax other than temporary impairment in 2010 due to the decline in estimated fair value of some of these investments. Our valuation of our auction rate security investments resulted in the recognition of other than temporary impairment of $4 million ($2 million, net of taxes) in 2009 and $34 million ($22 million, net of taxes) in 2008. The gains and losses associated with our auction rate security investments have been excluded from our non U.S. GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per common share. See Diluted Net Earnings Per Common Share below for further details. See Note 5, Available for Sale Investments, for further discussion. Foreign Currency Exchange (Losses) Gains Related to Venezuelan Subsidiary Effective January 1, 2010, Venezuela was designated a highly inflationary economy. The foreign currency exchange gains and losses we recorded in 2010 for our Venezuelan subsidiary were the result of two factors: 1) the significant changes in the exchange rates used to settle bolivar denominated transactions and 2) the significant changes in the exchange rates used to remeasure our Venezuelan subsidiarys financial statements at the balance sheet date. We believe these gains and losses are attributable to an unpredictable foreign currency environment in 39 Table of Contents Venezuela. As a result, we have excluded these gains and losses and we will exclude future non operating gains and or losses relating to our Venezuelan subsidiary from our non U.S. GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per common share until such time that we believe the foreign exchange environment in Venezuela stabilizes. See Venezuela in Foreign Exchange Rates of Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, for further discussion on Venezuela. Loss on Debt Redemption In December 2010, we completed an early redemption of $150 million of the outstanding $300 million principal amount of our 12% Senior Notes due February 14, 2014. We redeemed the notes at 127% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. The aggregate redemption price was $196 million, including $5 million of accrued interest. We funded the redemption with available cash. We recorded a pre tax loss of $41 million resulting from the 27% premium. We also recognized a gain of $2 million from the termination of a related interest rate swap. As a result, the total net pre tax loss was $39 million, which equated to a $0.14 per common share decrease to our reported diluted net earnings per common share. The annual pre tax interest expense savings from this redemption is $18 million, which equates to $0.06 per diluted common share, beginning in December 2010 through February 2014. In 2009, we redeemed the entire $431.3 million of our 3% Convertible Senior Notes due 2033 and recorded a $3 million pre tax loss. This loss represented a 0.429% call premium of $2 million and a write down of the remaining debt issuance costs of $1 million related to the issuance of these senior notes in July 2003. The losses associated with our debt redemptions have been excluded from our non U.S. GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per common share. See Diluted Net Earnings Per Common Share below for further details. Other Expense, Net See Note 19, Other Expense, net, for the components and discussion of other expense, net. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 25.5% for 2010, 25.9% for 2009 and 19.1% for 2008. As described below, in each of those years, we recognized benefits for items that may not recur to the same extent in future years. As such, we expect an effective income tax rate of approximately 27% for 2011. Our 2011 effective tax rate may be higher if we fund the Settlement agreement in 2011. We anticipate that funding the Settlement agreement in 2011 will result in a loss for U.S. income tax return purposes. This loss will eliminate some tax benefits in 2011, primarily the domestic manufacturing deduction. For 2010, our effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35% primarily due to the lower net effective income tax rate on foreign earnings, as well as income tax benefits from tax credits and the domestic manufacturing deduction, partially offset by state income taxes. Our 2009 effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate for the same reasons as in 2010, except that the benefits were offset by an increase in accruals relating to uncertain tax positions. See Note 15, Income Taxes, for a reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory rate to our effective tax rate, which also shows the major components of the year over year changes. 40 Table of Contents Diluted Net Earnings per Common Share The following table presents a reconciliation of U.S. GAAP diluted net earnings per common share to non U.S. GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per common share for the three years ended December 31, 2010. 2010 2009 2008 U.S. GAAP diluted net earnings per common share $ 1.44 $ 1.35 $ 0.99 Net earnings effect resulting from the following: Add: Losses on debt redemptions of $24.3, net of taxes of $14.2 in 2010 and $2.1, net of taxes of $1.3 in 2009 0.14 0.01 Add: Global manufacturing strategy and restructuring and other charges of $5.1, net of taxes of $2.3 in 2010, $11.4, net of taxes of $5.3 in 2009 and $18.0, net of taxes of $8.6 in 2008 0.03 0.07 0.10 Add: Cost reduction and productivity program restructuring charge of $43.5, net of taxes of $22.3 0.23 Add: European manufacturing facility closure restructuring and other charges of $4.8, net of taxes of $2.1 0.03 (Less) / add: (Gains on sale) other than temporary impairment of available for sale securities of $(3.7), net of taxes of $(2.2) in 2010, $2.5, net of taxes of $1.5 in 2009 and $21.4, net of taxes of $12.6 in 2008 (0.02 ) 0.01 0.11 (Less): Foreign currency exchange losses related to Venezuelan subsidiary of $3.6, net of taxes of $1.9 (0.02 ) Reversal of tax accruals, net, and related interest (0.03 ) Non U.S. GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per common share $ 1.60 $ 1.44 $ 1.40 See Note 18, Net Earnings Per Common Share, for further details on the calculation of U.S. GAAP basic and diluted net earnings per common share. Liquidity and Capital Resources The discussion that follows contains: a description of our material commitments and contingencies; a description of our principal sources of liquidity; a description of our outstanding indebtedness; an analysis of our historical cash flows and changes in working capital; a description of changes in our stockholders equity; and a description of our derivative financial instruments. Material Commitments and Contingencies Settlement Agreement and Related Costs We recorded a pre tax charge of $850.1 million in 2002, of which $512.5 million represents a cash payment that we are required to make (subject to the satisfaction of the terms and conditions of the Settlement agreement) upon the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy of W.R. Grace Co. We did not use cash in any period with respect to this liability. We currently expect to fund a substantial portion of this payment when it becomes due by using accumulated cash and cash equivalents with the remainder from our committed credit facilities. Our global credit facility and European credit facility are available for general corporate purposes, including the payment of the amounts required upon effectiveness of the Settlement agreement. See Principal Sources of Liquidity below. The cash payment of 41 Table of Contents $512.5 million accrues interest at a 5.5% annual rate, which is compounded annually, from December 21, 2002 to the date of payment. This accrued interest was $275 million at December 31, 2010 and is recorded in Settlement agreement and related accrued interest on our consolidated balance sheet. The total liability on our consolidated balance sheet was $788 million at December 31, 2010. In addition, the Settlement agreement provides for the issuance of 18 million shares of our common stock. Since the impact of issuing these shares is dilutive, under U.S. GAAP, they have been included in our calculation of diluted net earnings per common share for all periods presented. Tax benefits resulting from the payment made under the Settlement agreement, which are currently recorded as deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheets, are anticipated to provide approximately $370 million of current and future cash tax benefits. These deferred tax assets reflect the cash portion of the Settlement agreement and related accrued interest and the fair market value of the 18 million shares of our common stock at a post split price of $17.86 per share, which was the price when the Settlement agreement was reached in 2002. The amount and timing of future cash tax benefits could vary, depending on the amount of cash paid by us and various facts and circumstances at the time of payment under the Settlement agreement, including the price of our common stock, our tax position and the applicable tax codes. Any changes in the tax benefits resulting from an increase in our stock price in excess of the $17.86 share price mentioned above will not have an impact on our net earnings. Additionally we may incur an approximate one percentage point increase in our effective income tax rate during the calendar year in which we make the payment under the Settlement. We anticipate that funding the Settlement agreement will result in a loss for U.S. income tax purposes, and this loss will eliminate some tax benefits for that year, primarily the domestic manufacturing deduction. While the Bankruptcy Court has confirmed the PI Settlement Plan, additional proceedings may be held before the District Court or other courts to consider matters related to the PI Settlement Plan. Additionally, various parties have filed notices of appeal or have otherwise challenged the Memorandum Opinion and Confirmation Order, and the PI Settlement Plan may be subject to further appeal or challenge by additional parties. Parties filed a number of objections to the PI Settlement Plan, and some of these objections concerned injunctions, releases and provisions as applied to us and or that are contemplated by the Settlement agreement. Such parties (or others) may appeal or otherwise challenge the Bankruptcy Courts Memorandum Opinion and Confirmation Order, or otherwise continue to oppose the PI Settlement Plan. We do not know whether or when a final plan of reorganization will become effective or whether the final plan will be consistent with the terms of the Settlement agreement. As mentioned in 2011 Outlook above, our full year 2011 diluted net earnings per common share guidance continues to exclude the payment under the Settlement agreement, as the timing is unknown. Payment under the Settlement agreement is expected to be accretive to our post payment diluted net earnings per common share by approximately $0.12 to $0.14 annually. This range primarily represents the accretive impact on our net earnings from ceasing to accrue any future interest on the settlement amount following the payment.

These amounts also include our contractual obligations under capital leases of $6.2 million in 2011, $1.2 million in 2012 2013 and $0.1 million in 2014 2015. (2) Includes interest payments required under our senior notes issuances only. (3) This liability is reflected as a current liability due to the uncertainty of the timing of payment. Interest accrues on this amount at a rate of 5.5% per annum, compounded annually, until it becomes due and payable. Current Portion of Long Term Debt and Long Term Debt The debt shown in the above table excludes unamortized bond discounts as of December 31, 2010 and therefore represents the principal amount of the debt required to be repaid in each period. Operating Leases The contractual operating lease obligations listed in the table above represent estimated future minimum annual rental commitments primarily under non cancelable real and personal property leases as of December 31, 2010. Cash Portion of the Settlement Agreement The Settlement agreement is described more fully in Settlement Agreement and Related Costs, of Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies. Other Principal Contractual Obligations Other principal contractual obligations include agreements to purchase an estimated amount of goods, including raw materials, or services, including energy, in the normal course of business. These obligations are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the purchase. Liability for Unrecognized Tax Benefits At December 31, 2010, we had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest of $11 million, which is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2010, we cannot reasonably estimate the future period or periods of cash settlement of these liabilities. See Note 15, Income Taxes, for further discussion. 43 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have reviewed our off balance sheet arrangements and have determined that none of those arrangements has a material current effect or is reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our consolidated financial statements, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Income Tax Payments We currently expect to pay between $100 million and $115 million in income taxes in 2011, assuming we do not make the Settlement agreement payment in 2011. If we were to make the Settlement agreement payment in 2011, we would cease making quarterly estimated U.S. federal tax payments, thus significantly reducing our cash payments. Contributions to Defined Benefit Pension Plans We maintain defined benefit pension plans for a limited number of our U.S. employees and for some of our non U.S. employees. We currently expect employer contributions to be approximately $15 million in 2011. Environmental Matters We are subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations, and we accrue for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. These accruals do not take into account any discounting for the time value of money and are not reduced by potential insurance recoveries, if any. We do not believe that it is reasonably possible that the liability in excess of the amounts that we have accrued for environmental matters will be material to our consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets or cash flows. We reassess environmental liabilities whenever circumstances become better defined or we can better estimate remediation efforts and their costs. We evaluate these liabilities periodically based on available information, including the progress of remedial investigations at each site, the current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible parties. As some of these issues are decided (the outcomes of which are subject to uncertainties) or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated, we adjust the recorded accruals, as necessary. We believe that these exposures are not material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations. We believe that we have adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures. Principal Sources of Liquidity We require cash to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures, interest, taxes and dividend payments and to pay our debt obligations and other long term liabilities as they come due. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, accumulated cash and amounts available under our existing lines of credit described below, including the global credit facility and the European credit facility, and our accounts receivable securitization program. We believe that our current liquidity position and future cash flows from operations will enable us to fund our operations, including all of the items mentioned above, and the cash payment under the Settlement agreement should it become payable within the next 12 months. Cash and Cash Equivalents The following table summarizes our accumulated cash and cash equivalents: December 31, December 31, 2010 2009 Cash and cash equivalents $ 675.6 $ 694.5 44 Table of Contents See Analysis of Historical Cash Flows below. Lines of Credit At December 31, 2010, there were no amounts outstanding under our global and European credit facilities, and we had $669 million available to us under these facilities. We did not borrow funds from these facilities during any period in 2010. Further information about our lines of credit, our outstanding long term debt and the related financial covenants and limitations is provided in Note 11, Debt and Credit Facilities. Accounts Receivable Securitization Program At December 31, 2010, we had $91 million available to us under the program, and we did not utilize this program in 2010. See Note 6, Accounts Receivable Securitization Program, for information concerning this program. Covenants At December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with our financial covenants and limitations, as discussed in Covenants of Note 11, Debt and Credit Facilities. Debt Ratings Our cost of capital and ability to obtain external financing may be affected by our debt ratings, which the credit rating agencies review periodically. The Company and our long term senior unsecured debt are currently rated BB+ (positive outlook) by Standard Poors. On November 18, 2010, Standard Poors revised our ratings outlook to positive from stable. This rating is considered non investment grade. The Company and our long term senior unsecured debt are currently rated Baa3 by Moodys. This rating is considered investment grade. On May 4, 2010, Moodys revised our ratings outlook to stable from negative. If our credit ratings are downgraded, there could be a negative impact on our ability to access capital markets and borrowing costs could increase. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Outstanding Indebtedness At December 31, 2010 and 2009, our total debt outstanding consisted of the amounts set forth in the following table. See Note 11, Debt and Credit Facilities, for further information on our debt. December 31, 2010 2009 Short term borrowings $ 23.5 $ 28.2 Current portion of long term debt 6.5 6.5 Total current debt 30.0 34.7 Total long term debt, less current portion 1,399.2 1,626.3 Total debt $ 1,429.2 $ 1,661.0 Analysis of Historical Cash Flow Changes in our consolidated cash flows in the three years ended December 31, 2010: 2010 2009 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 483.1 $ 552.0 $ 404.4 Net cash used in investing activities (96.9 ) (70.3 ) (176.7 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (373.0 ) 90.3 (562.9 ) 45 Table of Contents Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 2010 Net cash provided by operating activities of $483 million for 2010 was primarily attributable to net income adjusted for non cash items of $480 million, which included depreciation and amortization of $155 million, share based compensation of $31 million and the loss on debt redemption of $39 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net cash source of $3 million. 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities of $552 million for 2009 was primarily attributable to net income adjusted for non cash items of $440 million, which included depreciation and amortization of $155 million and share based compensation of $39 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided a net cash source of $112 million primarily due to: a decline in receivables, net, of $115 million, primarily attributable to the impact of lower net sales in 2009 and, to a lesser extent, improved collections in 2009; and a decline in inventories of $110 million primarily due to maintaining lower inventory levels due to the decline in sales volumes and the decline in average petrochemical based raw material costs experienced in 2009; partially offset by: use of available cash of $80 million to fund the repurchase of receivable interests in 2009; and cash used for accounts payable of $68 million primarily due to the timing of payments. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 2010 In 2010, we used net cash of $97 million for investing activities, which was primarily due to capital expenditures of $88 million and the use of $24 million of cash for the completion of three business acquisitions and one equity investment in 2010. These investments were not material, individually or in the aggregate, to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Partially offsetting these uses of cash in 2010 were cash proceeds of $13 million received from the sale of all of our auction rate security investments in 2010. 2009 In 2009, we used net cash of $70 million for investing activities, which was primarily due to capital expenditures of $80 million. During 2009, we completed the construction phase of GMS with the launch of our manufacturing facility in Poland. We expect to continue to invest capital as we deem appropriate to expand our business, to maintain or replace depreciating property, plant and equipment, to acquire new manufacturing technology and to improve productivity and sales growth. We expect total capital expenditures in 2011 to be in the range of $150 million to $175 million. This projection is based upon our capital expenditure budget for 2011, the status of approved but not yet completed capital projects, anticipated future projects and historic spending trends. This projection also supports targeted cost reduction initiatives globally. We expect to maintain this range of capital expenditures over the next several years to support our projected increases in unit volume growth using new technology platforms or otherwise requiring incremental capital. 46 Table of Contents Net Cash (Used in) Provided By Financing Activities 2010 In 2010, we used $373 million of cash and cash equivalents for financing activities primarily due to the following activities: the use of $196 million of cash for the redemption of $150 million of the outstanding $300 million principal amount of our 12% Senior Notes due February 14, 2014; the repayment of amounts outstanding under our European credit facility of $64 million in the first quarter of 2010; the payment of quarterly dividends of $80 million; and the repurchase of 0.4 million shares of our common stock for $10 million. 2009 In 2009, our financing activities provided a net $90 million of cash and cash equivalents, primarily due to the following activities: issuance of $400 million of 7.875% Senior Notes due June 2017; issuance of $300 million of 12% Senior Notes due February 2014; and funds drawn of $64 million under our European credit facility; partially offset by: redemption of the entire $431.3 million of our 3% Convertible Senior Notes; retirement of the remaining outstanding balance of $137 million of our 6.95% Senior Notes; and the payment of quarterly dividends of $76 million. Repurchases of Capital Stock During 2010, we repurchased 0.4 million shares of our common stock, par value $0.10 per share, in open market purchases at a cost of $10 million. The average price per share of these common stock repurchases was $22.91. During 2009, we did not repurchase any shares of common stock. During 2008, we repurchased 4 million shares of our common stock in open market purchases at a cost of $95 million. The average price per share of these common stock repurchases in 2008 was $23.64. We made the share repurchases in 2010 and 2008 under the share repurchase program adopted by our Board of Directors in August 2007 under which the Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase in the aggregate up to 20 million shares of its issued and outstanding common stock. The program has no set expiration date, and we may from time to time continue to repurchase our common stock. See Item 5, Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, for further information on the share repurchase program. Changes in Working Capital December 31, December 31, Increase 2010 2009 (Decrease) Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) $ 592.3 $ 639.6 $ (47.3 ) Current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) 1.4 x 1.4 x Quick ratio (current assets, less inventories divided by current liabilities) 1.1 x 1.1x 47 Table of Contents The 7% decrease in working capital in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to the following factors: Net cash used in financing activities of $373 million, primarily due to: the repayment of long term debt of $276 million; cash used for the payment of our quarterly dividends of $80 million; and cash used for the repurchase of common stock of $10 million; net cash flows used in investing activities of $97 million, primarily for capital expenditures; and a decrease in current deferred tax assets of $30 million, primarily due to the reclassification of certain tax benefits from current to long term assets; partially offset by: net cash flows from operations of $483 million. Changes in Stockholders Equity The $201 million, or 9%, increase in stockholders equity in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to the following: an increase in retained earnings of $175 million, reflecting the net impact in 2010 from net earnings of $256 million, less dividends paid and accrued on our common stock of $81 million; and an increase in additional paid in capital of $26 million, primarily due to the recognition of our share based incentive compensation expenses. Derivative Financial Instruments Interest Rate Swaps The information set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K in Note 12, Derivatives and Hedging Activities, under the caption Interest Rate Swaps is incorporated herein by reference. Foreign Currency Forward Contracts At December 31, 2010, we were party to foreign currency forward contracts, which did not have a significant impact on our liquidity. The information set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K in Note 12, Derivatives and Hedging Activities, under the caption Foreign Currency Forward Contracts is incorporated herein by reference. For further discussion about these contracts and other financial instruments, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Recently Issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, Accounting Guidance and Disclosure Requirements We are subject to numerous recently issued statements of financial accounting standards, accounting guidance and disclosure requirements. Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Standards, which is contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, describes these new accounting standards and is incorporated herein by reference. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and 48 Table of Contents assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on all available evidence, including historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. To derive these estimates and assumptions, management draws from those available sources that can best contribute to its efforts. These sources include our officers and other employees, outside consultants and legal counsel, experts and actuaries. In addition, we use internally generated reports and statistics, such as aging of accounts receivable, as well as outside sources such as government statistics, industry reports and third party research studies. The results of these estimates and assumptions may form the basis of the carrying value of assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from estimates under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, and any such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our consolidated results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The critical accounting policies discussed below should be read together with our significant accounting policies set forth in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Standards. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts In the normal course of business, we extend credit to our customers if they satisfy pre defined credit criteria. We maintain an accounts receivable allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments. An additional allowance may be required if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates. The allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that management assesses to be appropriate to absorb estimated losses in the accounts receivable portfolio. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed quarterly, and changes to the allowance are made through the provision for bad debts, which is included in marketing, administrative and development expenses on our consolidated statements of operations. These changes may reflect changes in economic, business and market conditions. The allowance is increased by the provision for bad debts and decreased by the amount of charge offs, net of recoveries. The provision for bad debts charged against operating results is based on several factors including, but not limited to, a regular assessment of the collectibility of specific customer balances, the length of time a receivable is past due and our historical experience with our customers. In circumstances where a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations is known, we record a specific provision for bad debt against amounts due thereby reducing the receivable to the amount we reasonably assess will be collected. If circumstances change, such as higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customers ability to pay, our estimates of recoverability could be reduced by a material amount. Fair Value Measurements In determining fair value of financial instruments, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible and consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value. We determine fair value of our financial instruments based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market. When considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs, which are categorized in one of the following levels: Level 1 Inputs: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the reporting entity at the measurement date. Level 2 Inputs: Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 49 Table of Contents Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at measurement date. Our fair value measurements for our financial instruments are subjective and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect our estimates. See Note 13, Fair Value Measurements and Other Financial Instruments, for further details on our fair value measurements. Commitments and Contingencies Litigation On an ongoing basis, we assess the potential liabilities and costs related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us. We accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Litigation proceedings are evaluated on a case by case basis considering the available information, including that received from internal and outside legal counsel, to assess potential outcomes. While it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions, we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, we consider insurance recoveries, if any. We expense legal costs, including those legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred. We have in the past adjusted existing accruals as proceedings have continued, been settled or otherwise provided further information on which we could review the likelihood of outflows of resources and their measurability, and we expect to do so in future periods. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery, it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made. Impairment of Long Lived Assets The determination of the value of long lived assets requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements. We periodically review long lived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses, such as future cash flows, which are based on operational performance, market conditions and other factors, and disposition costs, may affect the carrying value of long lived assets and result in possible impairment expense in our consolidated financial statements. As assumptions and estimates change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment charge. Goodwill Goodwill is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually on a reporting unit level during the fourth quarter of each year. A review of goodwill may be initiated before or after conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable. A reporting unit is the operating segment unless, at businesses one level below that operating segment the component level discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management, and the component has economic characteristics that are different from the economic characteristics of the other components of the operating segment, in which case the component is the reporting unit. We use a fair value approach to test goodwill for impairment. We must recognize a non cash impairment charge for the amount, if any, by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. We derive an estimate of fair values for each of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach and appropriate market approaches, each based on an applicable weighting. We assess the applicable weighting based on such factors as current market conditions and the quality and reliability of the data. Absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transactions, we believe that the use of these methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting units fair value. 50 Table of Contents Fair value computed by these methods is arrived at using a number of factors, including projected future operating results, anticipated future cash flows, effective income tax rates, comparable marketplace data within a consistent industry grouping, and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties, however, related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis. Nonetheless, we believe that the combination of these methods provides a reasonable approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. Assumptions for sales, net earnings and cash flows for each reporting unit were consistent among these methods. Income Approach Used to Determine Fair Values The income approach is based upon the present value of expected cash flows. Expected cash flows are converted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of the future cash flows. The estimate of cash flows used is prepared on an unleveraged debt free basis. We use a discount rate that reflects a market derived weighted average cost of capital. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units expected long term operating and cash flow performance. The projections are based upon our best estimates of projected economic and market conditions over the related period including growth rates, estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures. Other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value long term growth rates, provisions for income taxes, future capital expenditures and changes in future cashless, debt free working capital. Market Approaches Used to Determine Fair Values Each year we consider various market approaches that could be used to determine fair value. Historically, we have considered two relevant market approaches. In 2010, an additional relevant market approach was included to determine fair value, and this approach is referred to as the merger and acquisition method. The first market approach estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by applying multiples of operating performance measures to the reporting units operating performance. These multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar investment characteristics to the reporting unit, and such comparables are reviewed and updated as needed annually. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using multiples from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units and the Company. The second market approach is based on the publicly traded common stock of the Company, and the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is based on the applicable multiples of the Company. The third market approach is based on recent mergers and acquisitions of comparable publicly traded and privately held companies in the packaging industry. The key estimates and assumptions that are used to determine fair value under these market approaches include trailing and future 12 month operating performance results and the selection of the relevant multiples to be applied. Under the first and second market approaches, a control premium, or an amount that a buyer is usually willing to pay over the current market price of a publicly traded company, is applied to the calculated equity values to adjust the public trading value upward for a 100% ownership interest, where applicable. See Note 9, Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets, for details of our goodwill balance and the goodwill review performed in 2010 and other related information. Pensions We maintain a qualified non contributory profit sharing plan and qualified contributory retirement savings plans in which most U.S. employees are eligible to participate. For a limited number of our U.S. employees and for some of our international employees, we maintain defined benefit pension plans. Under current accounting standards, we are required to make assumptions regarding the valuation of projected benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans. The projected benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost are based on third party actuarial assumptions and estimates that are reviewed and approved by management on a plan by plan basis each fiscal year. The principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation, the expected future rate of return on plan assets and the expected rate of future compensation increases. We revise these 51 Table of Contents assumptions based on an annual evaluation of long term trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits. In determining the discount rate, we utilize market conditions and other data sources management considers reasonable based upon the profile of the remaining service life of eligible employees. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration the weighted average expected return on our asset allocation, asset return data, historical return data, and the economic environment. We believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions of the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. The rate of compensation increase is based on our long term plans for such increases. The measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is December 31. At December 31, 2010, the projected benefit obligation for our U.S. pension plans was $55 million, and the net periodic benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $3 million. At December 31, 2010, the projected benefit obligation for our international pension plans was $286 million, and the net periodic benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $16 million. In general, material changes to the principal assumptions could have a material impact on the costs and liabilities recognized on our consolidated financial statements. A 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate and a 100 basis point change in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in the following increases (decreases) in the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2010 and the expected net periodic benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 2011 (in millions). 25 Basis 25 Basis Point Point United States Increase Decrease Discount Rate Effect on 2010 projected benefit obligation $ (1.7 ) $ 1.8 Effect on 2011 expected net periodic benefit cost (0.1 ) 0.1 100 Basis 100 Basis Point Point Increase Decrease Return on Assets Effect on 2011 expected net periodic benefit cost $ (0.4 ) $ 0.4 25 Basis 25 Basis Point Point International Increase Decrease Discount Rate Effect on 2010 projected benefit obligation $ (8.5 ) $ 9.3 Effect on 2011 expected net periodic benefit cost (0.8 ) 0.9 100 Basis 100 Basis Point Point Increase Decrease Return on Assets Effect on 2011 expected net periodic benefit cost $ (2.2 ) $ 2.2 Income Taxes Estimates and judgments are required in the calculation of tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets. Our deferred tax assets arise from net deductible temporary differences and tax benefit carry forwards. We evaluate whether our taxable earnings during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carry forwards may be utilized should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits. For those jurisdictions where the expiration dates of tax benefit carry forwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely, we provide a valuation allowance. 52 Table of Contents In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we estimate future taxable earnings, with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax benefit carry forwards and past operating results, to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future. Changes to tax laws, statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings can have an impact on valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods, we may need to adjust the valuation allowance, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes, we also evaluate our tax positions for years where the statutes of limitations have not expired. Based on this review, we may establish reserves for additional taxes and interest that could be assessed upon examination by relevant tax authorities. We adjust these reserves to take into account changing facts and circumstances, including the results of tax audits and changes in tax law. If the payment of additional taxes and interest ultimately proves unnecessary or less than the amount of the reserve, the reversal of the reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the reserves are no longer necessary. If an estimate of tax reserves proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to income tax provision would result. These adjustments to reserves and related expenses could materially affect our consolidated financial statements. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with tax authorities. See Note 15, Income Taxes, for further discussion.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in the conditions in the global financial markets, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices and the creditworthiness of our customers and suppliers, which may adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations. We seek to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We do not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rates From time to time, we may use interest rate swaps, collars or options to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. At December 31, 2010, we had outstanding interest rate swaps, but no outstanding collars or options. 53 Table of Contents The information set forth in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K in Note 12, Derivatives and Hedging Activities, under the caption Interest Rate Swaps is incorporated herein by reference. See Note 13, Fair Value Measurements and Other Financial Instruments, for details of the methodology and inputs used to determine the fair value of our fixed rate debt. The fair value of our fixed rate debt varies with changes in interest rates. Generally, the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. A hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates would result in an increase of $57 million in the fair value of the total debt balance at December 31, 2010. These changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt do not alter our obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount or any related interest of such debt. Foreign Exchange Rates Operations As a large global organization, we face exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could materially impact our consolidated financial position or results of operations in the future. See Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, above for the impacts foreign currency translation had on our operations. Venezuela Economic events in Venezuela have exposed us to heightened levels of foreign currency exchange risk. Effective January 1, 2010, Venezuela was designated a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP, and the U.S. dollar replaced the bolivar fuerte as the functional currency for our subsidiary in Venezuela. Accordingly, all bolivar denominated monetary assets and liabilities were re measured into U.S. dollars using the current exchange rate available to us, and any changes in the exchange rate were reflected in foreign currency exchange gains and losses related to our Venezuelan subsidiary on the consolidated statement of operations. Also, in January 2010, the Venezuelan government devalued the bolivar by resetting the official exchange rate from 2.15 bolivars per U.S. dollar to 4.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar for non essential transactions and 2.60 bolivars per U.S. dollar for essential transactions. On January 1, 2010 we did not have access or permission to use the official exchange rate. Accordingly, for the majority of our transactions, we accessed the parallel foreign currency exchange market (which was a rate of 5.95 bolivars per U.S. dollar at December 31, 2009) that was available to entities that did not have access to the official exchange rate. Since we did not have access to the official exchange rate, we translated our Venezuelan subsidiarys balance sheet using the parallel rate at December 31, 2009. In May 2010, the Venezuelan government closed the parallel foreign currency exchange market and in June 2010 replaced it with a new foreign currency exchange system, the Transaction System in Securities in Foreign Currency (SITME). The Central Bank of Venezuela began accepting and approving applications, under certain conditions, for non government operated Foreign Exchange Administrative Board (CADIVI) exchange transactions at the weighted average implicit exchange rate obtained from the SITME. Effective June 9, 2010, the SITME weighted average implicit exchange rate was 5.3 bolivars per U.S dollar. We did not access the SITME during 2010. From time to time during 2010 our access to the official exchange rate was restricted. However, as of December 31, 2010, we had access to the CADIVI in Venezuela. Therefore, as of December 31, 2010, we re measured the net bolivar denominated monetary assets of approximately $16 million (consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents) of our Venezuelan subsidiary using the official exchange rate of 4.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar. At December 31, 2010, our Venezuelan subsidiary had a negative cumulative translation adjustment balance of approximately $46 million. During 2010, we settled transactions at the applicable official exchange rates. As a result of the changes in the exchange rates upon settlement of bolivar denominated transactions and upon the remeasurement of our Venezuelan subsidiarys financial statements, we recognized net gains of $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. 54 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2010, less than 1% of our consolidated net sales were derived from our business in Venezuela and approximately 2% of our consolidated operating profit was derived from our business in Venezuela. Effective January 1, 2011, the Venezuelan government devalued the bolivar by eliminating the non essential exchange rate of 2.60 bolivars per U.S. dollar. Therefore, there are now only two legal exchange rates available. This includes the CADIVI non essential rate of 4.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar and the SITME rate of 5.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar. The potential future impact to our consolidated financial position and results of operations for future bolivar denominated transactions will depend on our access to U.S. dollars and on the exchange rates in effect when we enter into, remeasure and settle transactions. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the future impact until each transaction settles at its applicable exchange rate or gets remeasured into U.S. dollars. Foreign Currency Forward Contracts We use foreign currency forward contracts to fix the amounts payable or receivable on some transactions denominated in foreign currencies. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates at December 31, 2010 would have caused us to pay approximately $24 million to terminate these contracts. Our foreign currency forward contracts are described in Note 12, Derivatives and Hedging Activities, which is contained in Part II, Item 8, and in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Derivative Financial Instruments Foreign Currency Forward Contracts, contained in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, which information is incorporated herein by reference. We may use other derivative instruments from time to time, such as foreign exchange options to manage exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rate and currency swaps related to certain financing transactions. These instruments can potentially limit foreign exchange exposure and limit or adjust interest rate exposure by swapping borrowings denominated in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency. At December 31, 2010, we had no foreign exchange options or interest rate and currency swap agreements outstanding. Outstanding Debt Our outstanding debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrower. We believe that this enables us to better match operating cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match the currency of assets and liabilities. The amount of outstanding debt denominated in a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar was $26 million at December 31, 2010 and $109 million at December 31, 2009. Customer Credit We are exposed to credit risk from our customers. In the normal course of business we extend credit to our customers if they satisfy pre defined credit criteria. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments. An additional allowance may be required if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates. The allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that management assesses to be appropriate to absorb estimated losses in the accounts receivable portfolio. Our customers may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. Our provision for bad debt expense was $7 million in 2010, $6 million in 2009 and $9 million in 2008. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $17 million at December 31, 2010 and $18 million at December 31, 2009. Pensions Recent market conditions have resulted in an unusually high degree of volatility and increased risks and short term liquidity concerns associated with some of the plan assets held by our defined benefit pension plans, which have impacted the performance of some of the plan assets. Based upon the annual valuation of our defined benefit 55 Table of Contents pension plans at December 31, 2010, we expect our net periodic benefit costs to be approximately $14 million in 2011. See Note 14, Profit Sharing, Retirement Savings Plans and Defined Benefit Pension Plans, for further details on our defined benefit pension plans. Commodities We use various commodity raw materials such as plastic resins and energy products such as electric power and natural gas in conjunction with our manufacturing processes. Generally, we acquire these components at market prices in the region in which they will be used and do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices. Moreover, we seek to maintain appropriate levels of commodity raw material inventories thus minimizing the expense and risks of carrying excess inventories. We do not typically purchase substantial quantities in advance of production requirements. As a result, we are exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components. 56 Table of Contents
