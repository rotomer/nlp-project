ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The information required by this item is set forth on pages 24 through 37 of our 2003 Annual Report under the caption entitled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which is incorporated herein by reference. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk associated with interest rates and foreign currency exposure. We utilize derivative instruments as part of our overall financial risk management policy, but do not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. The Company has partially hedged risks associated with fixed interest rate debt by entering into various interest rate swap agreements. These interest rate swap contracts are described in detail in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 55 and 56 of our 2003 Annual Report. We do not believe that any potential loss related to interest rate exposure will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We also entered into foreign currency option and forward contracts to hedge against value changes in foreign currency. Foreign currency option and forward contracts are described in detail in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 60 and 61 of our 2003 Annual Report. We believe we may experience continuing losses from foreign currency translation. However, we do not expect currency translation, transaction or hedging contract losses to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
