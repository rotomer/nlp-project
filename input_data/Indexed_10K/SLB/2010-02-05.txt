Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Form 10 K. We urge you to carefully consider the risks described below, as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the SEC and the other information included or incorporated by reference in Form 10 K. If any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this Form 10 K were to materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Demand for the majority of our services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by the oil and gas industry. Our customers capital expenditures may decline in 2010 and beyond if current global economic conditions continue or worsen. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The current global economic downturn has reduced worldwide demand for oil and natural gas and resulted in significantly lower crude oil and natural gas prices compared to their record highs in July 2008. It is difficult to predict how long the global economic downturn will continue, or to what extent this will continue to affect us. The significant decline in oil and natural gas prices reduced many of our customers activities and spending on our services and products in 2009; this reduction in our customers activities and spending could continue through 2010 and beyond. Demand for the majority of our services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves. These expenditures are sensitive to the industrys view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas. The worldwide deterioration in the financial and credit markets, which began in the second half of 2008, resulted in diminished demand for oil and gas and significantly lower oil and natural gas prices. This caused many of our customers to reduce or delay their oil and gas exploration and production spending in 2009, which consequently reduced the demand for our services, and exerted downward pressure on the prices of our services and products. If the economic downturn 6 Table of Contents Part 1, Item 1A continues for a prolonged period or if there is little or no economic growth, it will likely result in further reductions of exploration and production expenditures by our customers, causing further declines in the demand for, and prices of, our services and products. This could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The reduction in cash flows being experienced by our customers resulting from declines in commodity prices, together with the reduced availability of credit and increased costs of borrowing, could have significant adverse effects on the financial condition of some of our customers. This could result in project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delay in, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. The prices for oil and natural gas are subject to a variety of factors, including: demand for hydrocarbons, which is affected by worldwide population growth, economic growth rates and general economic and business conditions; the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to set and maintain production levels for oil; oil and gas production by non OPEC countries; the level of excess production capacity; political and economic uncertainty and sociopolitical unrest; the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration and production activity; the cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas; technological advances affecting energy consumption; and weather conditions. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from our non United States operations, which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the approximately 80 countries in which we operate. Our non United States operations accounted for approximately 84% of our consolidated revenue in 2009, 78% in 2008 and 76% in 2007. Operations in countries other than the United States are subject to various risks, including: unsettled political and economic conditions in certain areas; exposure to possible expropriation of our assets or other governmental actions; social unrest, acts of terrorism, war or other armed conflict; confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies; deprivation of contract rights; trade restrictions or embargoes imposed by the United States or other countries; restrictions under the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar legislation in other countries; restrictions on the repatriation of income or capital; currency exchange controls; inflation; and currency exchange rate fluctuations and devaluations. 7 Table of Contents Part 1, Item 1A In addition, we are subject to risks associated with our operations in countries, including Iran, Syria, Sudan and Cuba, which are subject to trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the United States or other governments or organizations. United States law enforcement authorities are currently conducting a grand jury investigation and an associated regulatory inquiry related to our operations in certain of these countries. If any of the risks described above materialize, or if any governmental investigation results in criminal or civil penalties or other remedial measures, it could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations. We are also subject to risks related to investment in our common stock in connection with certain US state divestment or investment limitation legislation applicable to companies with operations in these countries, and similar actions by some private investors, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Environmental compliance costs and liabilities could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations. We are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to importation and use of hazardous materials, radioactive materials and explosives, environmental protection, including laws and regulations governing air emissions, water discharges and waste management. We incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations. The technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex, stringent and expensive to implement. These laws may provide for strict liability for damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety. Strict liability can render a party liable for damages without regard to negligence or fault on the part of the party. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances. We use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations. In addition, many of our current and former properties are, or have been, used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we could become subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties, and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to, or releases of, hazardous substances. In addition, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, new laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis of new or increased liabilities that could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations. We believe we are currently in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations. We could be subject to substantial liability claims, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Certain equipment used in the delivery of oilfield services, such as directional drilling equipment, perforating systems, subsea completion equipment, radioactive materials and explosives and well completion systems, are used in hostile environments, such as exploration, development and production applications. An accident or a failure of a product could cause personal injury, loss of life, damage to property, equipment or the environment, and suspension of operations. Our insurance may not adequately protect us against liability for some kinds of events, including events involving pollution, or against losses resulting from business interruption. Moreover, in the future we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate. Substantial claims made under our policies could cause our premiums to increase. Any future damages caused by our products that are not covered by insurance, or are in excess of policy limits or are subject to substantial deductibles, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 8 Table of Contents Part 1, Item 1A If we are unable to maintain technology leadership in the form of services and products, this could adversely affect any competitive advantage we hold. If we are unable to develop and produce competitive technology or deliver it to our clients in the form of services and products in a timely and cost competitive manner in the various markets we serve, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Limitations on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, including our trade secrets, could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold. Some of our products or services, and the processes we use to produce or provide them, have been granted patent protection, have patent applications pending or are trade secrets. Our business may be adversely affected if our patents are unenforceable, the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology, our patent applications are denied, or our trade secrets are not adequately protected. Our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets. We may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights. The tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. Infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business. Royalty payments under licenses from third parties, if available, would increase our costs. If a license were not available we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, developing non infringing technologies would increase our costs. Failure to obtain and retain skilled technical personnel could impede our operations. We require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business. Competition for the personnel required for our businesses intensifies as activity increases. In periods of high utilization it may become more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals. This could increase our costs or have other adverse effects on our operations. Severe weather conditions may affect our operations. Our business may be materially affected by severe weather conditions in areas where we operate. This may entail the evacuation of personnel and stoppage of services. In addition, if particularly severe weather affects platforms or structures, this may result in a suspension of activities until the platforms or structures have been repaired. Any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 9 Table of Contents Part 1, Item 1B, 2, 3, 4 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements, including, without limitation, statements relating to our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions and resources. Such forward looking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Report. Executive Overview As 2009 progressed, oil prices recovered gradually from levels under $40 per barrel at the beginning of the year to over $70 per barrel by year end. The large drop in oil demand in 2009 that resulted from the global economic recession, together with increased production capacity in spite of significant delays in new development projects, led to spare oil production capacity reaching its highest level in nearly two decades. However, the decisions by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) at the end of 2008 to cut production, the adherence of the majority of OPEC countries to production quotas, and the improving economic outlook contributed to rising prices with stabilization at current levels. During 2009, the demand forecasts of the major energy organizations evolved with economic projections falling to a low of nearly 83 million barrels of oil per day (BOPD) in May, then increasing gradually by 1.5 million BOPD toward the end of the year. The final forecast figure of 84.4 million BOPD represented the second consecutive year on year drop in oil demand for the first time in 25 years. For 2010, economic projections for world real GDP growth are converging towards a median estimate of 3%, but with a significant level of uncertainty. A large gap exists between GDP growth rates of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and non OECD countries particularly in China and in other developing Asian economies. Overall OECD country demand will remain at its lowest level in over a decade, but this will be compensated by growth in China, South East Asia and the Middle East. From a supply standpoint, the level of uncertainty in oil demand and oil prices led E&P customers to cut investment in 2009 particularly in projects with the highest production costs but forecasts published at the end of the year indicated a likely rise in investment in 2010. The natural gas markets behaved differently from oil markets in 2009. The combination of the drop in gas demand that resulted from reduced industrial activity; the rise in production of unconventional gas resources in North America; and the commissioning of a number of new large LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) exporting facilities around the world contributed to an over supplied market with consequent pressure on spot gas prices. On a per British Thermal Unit basis, the ratio of oil to Henry Hub gas prices increased to its highest level in the last four decades, threatening the linkage mechanisms in future long term supply contracts. Within the United States, the worlds largest natural gas market, and despite some fuel switching in power generation from coal to gas and lower Canadian gas imports, natural gas storage levels have been significantly above the five year range consistently since April 2009. Consequently, natural gas wellhead prices have reached their lowest levels since 2002. This has translated into the largest sustained drop in gas related drilling and service activity since the 2001 2002 period. Nevertheless, the technological success associated with production from unconventional gas reservoirs in the United States is leading to an increasing level of interest in similar formations outside North America, particularly in Europe, which could lead to an expansion in activity when natural gas prices rebound. Within this market, Schlumberger Oilfield Services full year revenue in 2009 declined 16% versus 2008, falling to $20.52 billion. Lower natural gas prices and unfavorable market fundamentals led to a 37% decline in North America revenue, primarily in the US Land and Canada GeoMarkets. Europe/CIS/Africa revenue fell 13% mainly due to the weakening of local currencies against the US dollar and reduced activity in the Russia, North Sea, West & South Africa and Caspian GeoMarkets as well as at Framo Engineering. This decline however was partially offset by increased activity in the North Africa GeoMarket. Middle East & Asia revenue dropped 9% primarily due to decreases in the East Asia, East Mediterranean, Arabian and Australia/Papua New Guinea GeoMarkets. Latin America revenue was only marginally lower than last year as the impact of the weakening of 17 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 local currencies against the US dollar and much lower activity in Venezuela/Trinidad & Tobago and Peru/ Colombia/Ecuador was nearly offset by stronger activity in Mexico/Central America and Brazil. Weakening of local currencies against the US dollar reduced 2009 revenue by approximately 4%. Across the Areas, all of the Technologies recorded revenue declines except Testing Services. IPM recorded revenue growth compared to 2008. While customers spent less on new technology in 2009 versus the previous year, a number of recently introduced Schlumberger services made further market progress. PowerDrive* family rotary steerable drilling systems extended their market reach, entering new markets in the North and Latin America. Scanner Family* services for advanced formation evaluation saw success in Mexico and Canada, and Well Services recorded market penetration in Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and Malaysia with the range of ACTive* real time coiled tubing services that improve operating efficiency and well performance through the innovative use of fiber optic cable to convey downhole information to the surface. Investment in Oilfield Services infrastructure continued throughout the year. Significant events included the opening of a new reservoir completions manufacturing center in Damman, Saudi Arabia. Representing an investment of $25 million, the center houses a team of design and manufacturing engineers specialized in the production of downhole reservoir completions equipment. The center also provides a collaborative environment in which joint oil company and Schlumberger teams can develop and manufacture completions solutions for application across Saudi Arabia and the Middle East. In Brazil, we announced the signing of a joint cooperation agreement with the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro to build a key international research center on the universitys campus. This new center will focus on research and development activities in the deepwater subsalt environment, with emphasis on the development of geosciences software for the exploration and production sector; new technologies to meet reservoir challenges in subsalt environments; and the creation of a geophysical processing and interpretation Center of Excellence covering time lapse seismic and combined electromagnetic and seismic measurements. A number of technology agreements and acquisitions were completed during the year to enable future product development or improve geographical reach. In May, Schlumberger acquired Techsia SA, a supplier of petrophysical software based in Montpellier, France. Techsia will become the Schlumberger Petrophysics Software Center of Excellence for the development of state of the art solutions for the oil and gas exploration and production industry. In September, Schlumberger and National Oilwell Varco announced the creation of a joint venture to provide high speed drill string telemetry systems to improve the efficiency and safety of oil and gas operations. The venture is expected to accelerate development and delivery of intelligent drilling solutions through the expanded use of the IntelliServ&reg; Broadband Network, a patented technology that provides high resolution data in real time to and from the bottom of oil and gas wells as they are being drilled. In November, Schlumberger acquired Lonkar Services a company providing slickline, cased hole wireline and surface well testing services in Western Canada and Northern USA. Also in November Schlumberger signed a global cooperation agreement with Technip to jointly develop subsea integrity and surveillance solutions for the flexible pipes used in deep offshore oil and gas production. This agreement will initially focus on surveillance systems activities for new and challenging flexible pipe applications such as those required in the deepwater subsalt environment in Brazil. Full year 2009 revenue of WesternGeco was, at $2.12 billion, 25% lower than 2008. Revenue decreased across all product lines, with the largest declines seen in Marine and Multiclient activity. Marine revenue fell on lower activity combined with reduced pricing as a result of weak market conditions. Multiclient revenue decreased primarily in North America, as customers continued to reduce discretionary spending. Land revenue fell on lower crew utilization, while Data Processing revenue decreased reflecting lower activity primarily in Europe/Africa and in North America. Towards the end of the year, WesternGeco announced the deployment of the next generation UniQ* integrated point receiver land seismic acquisition and processing system in Kuwait for the Kuwait Oil Company. The new system, designed for greater operational efficiency and flexibility, offers up to four times 18 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 the capability of existing Q Land* systems and is currently acquiring data from 53,000 live point receiver channels in conjunction with the WesternGeco DX 80* Desert Explorer with MD Sweep* technology introduced the previous year. The outlook for 2010 remains largely dependent on the prospects for the general economy. At the end of the third quarter of 2009, we indicated that we were encouraged that signs were emerging that demand for oil and gas would begin to increase. Consensus forecasts now predict that oil demand in 2010 will increase, particularly in the developing world, for the first time since 2007. As a result we feel that oil prices are likely to be sustained at current levels and that as our customers confidence grows, their exploration and production budgets will increase. We feel that considerable leverage to increase investment exists in offshore markets, in Russia, as well as in certain emerging investment opportunities such as Iraq. These events will be dependent on continued increases in economic growth in the second half of the year beyond the current government stimulus packages. For natural gas activity we remain a great deal more cautious. Despite signs of some recovery in industrial demand as well as the recent cold weather, we consider that markets remain generally oversupplied. Increased LNG flows together with further capacity being added in 2010, as well as the general uncertainty over the decline rates of unconventional gas production, have the potential to limit the current increase in the North American gas drilling rig count. We anticipate that 2010 will be a better year for multiclient seismic, and for activity in land seismic particularly in Middle East and North Africa. While Marine activity is expected to be reasonably robust, pricing improvements will be limited due to continued new capacity additions. Longer term we remain confident that considerably increased spending will be necessary to maintain sufficient reserves and production of hydrocarbons to meet the worlds needs. Our technology portfolio and worldwide infrastructure mean we are strongly positioned to capture growth opportunities as our customers begin to increase their investment. The following discussion and analysis of results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements. Fourth Quarter 2009 Results (Stated in millions) Fourth Qtr.2009 Third Qtr.2009 % change OILFIELD SERVICES Revenue $ 5,170 $ 4,953 4 % Pretax Operating Income $ 1,006 $ 1,042 (3 )% WESTERNGECO Revenue $ 549 $ 463 19 % Pretax Operating Income $ 115 $ 61 89 % Pretax operating income represents the segments income before taxes and noncontrolling interests. The pretax operating income excludes such items as corporate expenses and interest income and interest expense not allocated to the segments as well as the charges described in detail in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, interest on postretirement medical benefits and stock based compensation costs. Fourth quarter revenue was $5.74 billion versus $5.43 billion in the third quarter of 2009. Income from continuing operations attributable to Schlumberger was $817 million an increase of 4% sequentially. Oilfield Services fourth quarter revenue of $5.17 billion was up 4% compared to the third quarter of 2009. Sequential pretax segment operating income of $1.01 billion was down 3%. WesternGeco fourth quarter revenue of $549 million was up 19% sequentially. Fourth quarter pretax segment operating income of $115 million was up 89% compared to the third quarter of 2009. 19 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Oilfield Services Fourth quarter revenue of $5.17 billion increased 4% sequentially, with all Areas, except Europe/CIS/Africa, contributing to the improvement. Sequential growth was driven by increased deepwater and exploration related activity leading to demand for Wireline, Testing Services and Drilling & Measurements technologies, while growth was also recorded on land in North America, primarily from increased Well Services activity. In addition, seasonal year end strength was seen in software and product sales in a number of GeoMarkets in particular for SIS software and Artificial Lift products. These increases, however, were partially offset by lower activity in Russia and in the Mexico/Central America GeoMarket. Fourth quarter pretax operating income of $1.01 billion was down 3% sequentially. Pretax operating margin decreased 157 basis points (bps) sequentially to 19.5% primarily due to lower activity coupled with a less favorable revenue mix in Russia and in the Mexico/Central America GeoMarket. Pricing concessions made earlier in the year also contributed to the sequential decrease in margins. North America Fourth quarter revenue of $873 million was 6% higher sequentially. Pretax operating income of $18.0 million was down 35% sequentially. Sequentially, US Land GeoMarket revenue grew on increased drilling activity, the impact of which was partially diluted by lower pricing for Well Services technologies. US Gulf of Mexico GeoMarket revenue was up marginally as improved shelf activity and the beginning of a build up in deepwater activity were hampered by downtime associated with Hurricane Ida as well as by some pricing pressure. Canada revenue was flat while Alaska GeoMarket revenue fell sequentially due to a slowdown in activity resulting from operator budget constraints. Pretax operating margin decreased 129 bps sequentially to 2.1% as the increased activity in the US Land and Gulf of Mexico GeoMarkets was insufficient to offset the impact of a less favorable revenue mix in Canada and lower activity in the Alaska GeoMarket. Latin America Fourth quarter revenue of $1.13 billion increased 5% sequentially. Pretax operating income of $178 million was down 9% sequentially. Sequentially, Peru/Colombia/Ecuador GeoMarket revenue grew primarily on greater demand for Drilling & Measurements, Wireline and Testing Services technologies resulting from increased drilling activity. Higher SIS software and Artificial Lift product sales also contributed to this growth. Brazil revenue was higher due to increased offshore exploration activity as well as to SIS software and Completions product sales. Venezuela/Trinidad & Tobago GeoMarket recorded growth mainly from Integrated Project Management (IPM) activity while Argentina/Bolivia/Chile revenue was higher due to increased activity and SIS product sales. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in Mexico/Central America revenue as a result of reduced activity. Pretax operating margin decreased 254 bps sequentially to 15.8% primarily as the result of the reduced activity and a less favorable revenue mix in the Mexico/Central America GeoMarket, which was only partly offset by the impact of increased activity and software and product sales in the rest of the Area. Europe/CIS/Africa Fourth quarter revenue of $1.78 billion was flat sequentially. Pretax operating income of $385 million was down 9% sequentially. Sequentially, Nigeria & Gulf of Guinea GeoMarket revenue grew as the result of strong Testing Services product sales and an increase in exploration activity that led to greater demand for Wireline services. In the West & South Africa GeoMarket revenue increased on high demand for Drilling & Measurements services. The 20 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 North Sea GeoMarket also recorded growth from increased Well Services stimulation activity while Libya GeoMarket revenue increased on higher deepwater Testing Services and Wireline exploration activity. These increases, however, were partially offset by lower revenue in Russia as a result of client budgetary constraints which mainly affected IPM activity. Revenue was also lower in the North Africa GeoMarket on reduced Testing Services product sales and in the Caspian GeoMarket on the completion of drilling campaigns. Pretax operating margin decreased 208 bps sequentially to 21.6% largely as the result of the lower activity in Russia. Middle East & Asia Fourth quarter revenue of $1.31 billion increased 7% sequentially. Pretax operating income of $426 million was 9% higher sequentially. Sequentially, revenue growth was driven by an increase in deepwater and exploration related activity that led to strong demand for Wireline services. Seasonal year end SIS software and Artificial Lift product sales also contributed to the increase in revenue. Pretax operating margin improved 66 bps sequentially to 32.4% primarily as the result of the more favorable mix of deepwater and exploration related activity in addition to year end SIS software sales. WesternGeco Fourth quarter revenue of $549 million increased 19% sequentially. Pretax operating income of $115 million increased 89% sequentially. Sequential revenue growth was led by Multiclient which recorded strong year end sales of wide azimuth surveys in the US Gulf of Mexico. Land revenue also grew due to increased activity in the Middle East and North Africa. These increases, however, were partially offset by a significant decrease in Marine as the result of weaker pricing, project start up delays and vessel transits. Pretax operating margin improved 776 bps sequentially to 20.9% primarily as a result of the high Multiclient sales that were partially offset by the impact of the lower pricing and project delays in Marine. Full Year 2009 Results (Stated in millions) Total Year2009 Total Year2008 % Change OILFIELD SERVICES Revenue $ 20,518 $ 24,282 (16 )% Pretax Operating Income $ 4,326 $ 6,505 (33 )% WESTERNGECO Revenue $ 2,122 $ 2,838 (25 )% Pretax Operating Income $ 326 $ 836 (61 )% Oilfield Services Full year 2009 revenue of $20.52 billion declined 16% versus 2008. Lower natural gas prices and unfavorable market fundamentals resulted in a 37% decline in North America revenue, primarily in the US Land and Canada GeoMarkets. Europe/CIS/Africa revenue decreased 13% mainly due to the weakening of local currencies against the US dollar and reduced activity in the Russia, North Sea, West & South Africa and Caspian GeoMarkets as well as in Framo, which was partially offset by increased activity in the North Africa GeoMarket. Middle East & Asia revenue also fell by 9% primarily due to decreases in the East Asia, East Mediterranean, Arabian and Australia/Papua New Guinea GeoMarkets. Latin America revenue was only marginally lower than last year as the impact of the weakening of local currencies against the US dollar and 21 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 much lower activity in Venezuela/Trinidad & Tobago and Peru/Colombia/Ecuador were nearly offset by stronger activity in Mexico/Central America and Brazil. Weakening of local currencies against the US dollar reduced 2009 revenue by approximately 4%. Across the Areas, all of the Technologies recorded revenue declines except Testing Services. IPM recorded revenue growth compared to the same period last year. Full year 2009 pretax operating margin decreased 5.7 percentage points to 21.1%, on the significant drop in activity and pricing pressure experienced across all the Areas, but most notably in North America. North America Revenue of $3.71 billion was 37% lower than last year with reductions across the entire Area. The decreases were highest in US Land and Canada, where lower natural gas prices resulted in a steep drop in activity and consequent pressure on pricing. Canada revenue was also lower as the result of the weakening of the Canadian dollar against the US dollar. Revenue in the US Gulf of Mexico GeoMarket was severely impacted by weaker shelf drilling activity and strong pricing pressure. Pretax operating margin fell 17.3 percentage points to 5.8% due to the significant decline in activity levels across the Area, combined with the severe pricing erosion. Latin America Revenue of $4.22 billion was marginally lower compared to 2008. The weakening of local currencies against the US dollar reduced 2009 revenue by approximately 3%. In addition, Venezuela/Trinidad & Tobago revenue fell due to significantly reduced customer spending while Peru/Colombia/Ecuador revenue was lower due to reduced gain share in IPM projects. These decreases were mostly offset by higher IPM activity in Mexico/Central America and increased offshore activity in Brazil. Pretax operating margin decreased 245 bps to 17.8% primarily as the result of the sharp activity decline in Venezuela/Trinidad & Tobago and the lower gain share in Peru/Colombia/Ecuador. Europe/CIS/Africa Revenue of $7.15 billion was 13% lower than last year largely due to the weakening of local currencies against the US dollar, which reduced revenue by approximately 7%. In addition, revenue was negatively impacted by reduced customer spending that resulted in significantly lower activity and pricing erosion in Russia and the North Sea. Revenue in the West & South Africa and Caspian GeoMarkets and in Framo was also negatively impacted by lower activity levels. These decreases were partially offset by a revenue increase in the North Africa GeoMarket due to strong Testing Services product sales. Pretax operating margins declined 357 bps to 23.9% on a combination of the overall lower activity and heavy pricing pressure across the Area. Middle East & Asia Revenue of $5.23 billion was 9% below 2008. Revenue was down across much of the Middle East, especially in the East Mediterranean and Arabian GeoMarkets, due to reduced demand for Drilling & Measurements, Wireline and Testing Services technologies. Revenue in Asia also fell, primarily due to a decrease in offshore exploration activity, which was most significant in the East Asia and Australia/Papua New Guinea GeoMarkets, resulting in lower demand for Testing Services and Wireline technologies as well as Completion Systems products. Pretax operating margin decreased 268 bps to 32.4% primarily as a result of the lower overall activity and a less favorable revenue mix across the Area. 22 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 WesternGeco Full year revenue of $2.12 billion was 25% lower than 2008. Revenue decreased across all product lines, with the largest declines experienced in Marine and Multiclient. Marine revenue declined due to lower activity combined with reduced pricing as the result of weak market conditions. Multiclient revenue decreased primarily in North America, as customers continued to reduce discretionary spending. Land revenue fell on lower crew utilization, while Data Processing revenue was down reflecting lower activity primarily in Europe/Africa and in North America. Pretax margin decreased 14.1 percentage points to 15.4% primarily due to the weaker Marine activity and pricing as well as lower Multiclient sales. Revenue backlog was $1.0 billion at December 31, 2009, compared to $1.8 billion at December 31, 2008. Full Year 2008 Results (Stated in millions) Total Year2008 Total Year2007 % Change OILFIELD SERVICES Revenue $ 24,282 $ 20,306 20 % Pretax Operating Income $ 6,505 $ 5,959 9 % WESTERNGECO Revenue $ 2,838 $ 2,963 (4 )% Pretax Operating Income $ 836 $ 1,060 (21 )% Oilfield Services Full year 2008 revenue of $24.28 billion increased 20% versus 2007 driven by Area growth of 28% in Latin America, 24% in Europe/CIS/Africa, 18% in Middle East & Asia and 11% in North America. All Technologies experienced double digit growth, most notably in Well Services, Drilling & Measurements and Wireline. Pretax operating income of $6.50 billion in 2008 was 9% higher than 2007. However, pretax operating margin declined 256 bps to 26.8% primarily due to reduced pricing for well stimulation services in the US land GeoMarkets, a higher mix of low margin third party managed services in the Mexico/Central America GeoMarket and cost inflation across all Areas. North America Revenue of $5.91 billion grew 11% versus 2007. Growth was led by the US land West GeoMarket mostly due to increased gas shale activity that resulted in robust demand for Well Services and Drilling & Measurements technologies and by the US land Central GeoMarket on higher rig activity and strong Artificial Lift product sales. The Canada GeoMarket revenue was higher from demand for Well Services and Drilling & Measurements technologies while the US Gulf of Mexico GeoMarket grew on increased deepwater activity the resulted in strong demand for Drilling & Measurements and Wireline services in addition to Completion Systems products. Pretax operating margin decreased 557 bps to 23.2% primarily as the result of lower pricing for well stimulation services in the US land GeoMarkets and cost inflation across the Area. Latin America Revenue of $4.23 billion was 28% higher than 2007 on double digit growth across all GeoMarkets. The Mexico/Central America GeoMarket increased on significantly higher IPM activity while the Peru/Colombia/Ecuador GeoMarket also experienced increased IPM activity in addition to robust demand for Wireline services and for Artificial Lift products and SIS software. The Brazil GeoMarket grew on higher offshore activity that resulted in stronger demand for Well Testing, Wireline and Well Services technologies. The Venezuela/Trinidad and Tobago GeoMarket experienced increased demand for Wireline, Drilling & Measurements and Well Services activities. 23 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Pretax operating margin of 20.3% declined 262 bps versus 2007 as a result of an increased mix of low margin third party managed services in the Mexico/Central America GeoMarket and cost inflation across the Area. Europe/CIS/Africa Revenue of $8.18 billion increased 24% versus the same period last year. Growth was led by Russia which experienced strong demand for Wireline, Well Services and Drilling & Measurements technologies. The West & South Africa, North Sea and Caspian GeoMarkets grew on increased exploration related services as well as strong demand for Well Services technologies. The Continental Europe GeoMarket was higher due to strong drilling related activities and demand for SIS offerings. The consolidation of Framo also contributed to the increase. Pretax operating margin decreased 112 bps to 27.4% primarily as a result of reduced pricing in the Libya GeoMarket and a less favorable revenue mix in the Nigeria & Gulf of Guinea GeoMarket and Russia. The consolidation of Framo also reduced total Area margin. Middle East & Asia Revenue of $5.72 billion was 18% higher than the prior year. All GeoMarkets experienced growth, most notably in the Arabian, Australia/Papua New Guinea/New Zealand, Gulf, and East Mediterranean GeoMarkets. Among the Technologies, growth was strongest in Wireline, Drilling & Measurements, Well Services and Well Testing. Pretax operating margin was nearly flat at 35.0% as the positive impact of the higher overall activity level was offset by cost inflation. WesternGeco Full year 2008 revenue of $2.84 billion was 4% lower than 2007. Multiclient revenue was down primarily as the result of significantly lower client discretionary spending in the fourth quarter of 2008, while Land decreased on lower crew utilization. These decreases were partially offset by increases in Marine, as a result of additional vessel capacity and higher pricing, and in Data Processing, which experienced a growth in activity in all geographic areas. Pretax operating margin of 29.5% decreased 634 bps due to significantly lower Multiclient sales, reduced Land activity and cost inflation that affected Marine operations. Revenue backlog was $1.8 billion at December 31, 2008, compared to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2007. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income consisted of the following: (Stated in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Interest income $ 61 $ 119 $ 162 Equity in net earnings of affiliated companies 209 293 244 Other1 3 (10 ) 25 $ 273 $ 402 $ 431 1. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details. Interest Income The average return on investments decreased to 1.4% in 2009 from 3.5% in 2008 and the weighted average investment balance of $4.5 billion in 2009 increased $1.1 billion compared to 2008. The average return on investments decreased to 3.5% in 2008 from 5.2% in 2007 and the weighted average investment balance of $3.4 billion in 2008 increased $286 million compared to 2007. 24 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Equity in Net Earnings of Affiliated Companies The equity in net earnings of affiliated companies primarily represents Schlumbergers share of the results of its 40% interest in the M I SWACO drilling fluids joint venture with Smith International, Inc. Schlumbergers equity income from this joint venture was $131 million in 2009, $210 million in 2008 and $178 million in 2007. The decrease in equity income relating to this joint venture from 2008 to 2009 was attributable to a significant decline in M I SWACO activity levels, primarily in its United States and Europe/Africa regions, as well as increased pricing pressures. Interest Expense Interest expense of $221 million in 2009 decreased by $26 million compared to 2008 due to a decline in the weighted average borrowing rates, from 4.5% to 3.9%. The weighted average debt balance of $5.6 billion in 2009 increased $148 million compared to 2008. Interest expense of $247 million in 2008 decreased by $28 million compared to 2007 due to a decline in the weighted average borrowing rates, from 5.0% to 4.5%. The weighted average debt balance of $5.5 billion in 2008 was essentially flat compared to 2007. Other Gross margin was 23.4%, 30.2% and 33.5% in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decline in gross margin in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to lower activity coupled with the impact of a significant reduction in pricing across all of Oilfield Services, most notably in North America and Europe/CIS/Africa. Weaker Marine activity and pricing and reduced Multiclient sales in WesternGeco also contributed to the margin decline. The decline in gross margin percentage in 2008, compared to 2007, was primarily attributable to the following factors: reduced pricing for well stimulation services in the US Land GeoMarkets, a higher mix of low margin third party managed services in the Mexico/Central America GeoMarket, significantly lower Multiclient sales in WesternGeco and the impact of cost inflation across all Areas within Oilfield Services as well as the Marine operations of WesternGeco. Research & engineering, Marketing and General & administrative expenses, as a percentage of Revenue, were as follows: 2009 2008 2007 Research & engineering 3.5 % 3.0 % 3.1 % Marketing 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.4 % General & administrative 2.4 % 2.2 % 2.2 % Research & engineering expenditures, by segment, were as follows: (Stated in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Oilfield Services $ 679 $ 686 $ 595 WesternGeco 108 118 120 Other 15 15 13 $ 802 $ 819 $ 728 Income Taxes The Schlumberger effective tax rate was 19.6% in 2009, 20.9% in 2008, and 21.9% in 2007. The Schlumberger effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings. When the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of North America increases, the Schlumberger effective tax rate will generally decrease. Conversely, when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of North America decreases, the Schlumberger effective tax rate will generally increase. 25 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 The decrease in the Schlumberger effective tax rate over the past two years has been primarily attributable to the geographic mix of earnings. Schlumberger has generated a lower proportion of its pretax earnings in North America in each of the last two years. In addition, outside North America, various GeoMarkets with lower tax rates have contributed a greater percentage to pretax earnings. Charges and Credits Schlumberger recorded significant charges and credits in continuing operations during 2009, 2008 and 2007. These charges and credits, which are summarized below, are more fully described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following is a summary of the 2009 charges: (Stated in millions) Pretax Tax Non controllingInterests Net Income Statement Classification Workforce reductions $ 102 $ (17 ) $ $ 85 Cost of revenue Postretirement benefits curtailment 136 (14 ) 122 Cost of revenue $ 238 $ (31 ) $ $ 207 The following is a summary of the 2008 charges: (Stated in millions) Pretax Tax Non controllingInterests Net Income Statement Classification Workforce reduction $ 74 $ (9 ) $ $ 65 Cost of revenue Provision for doubtful accounts 32 (8 ) (6 ) 18 Cost of revenue Other 10 10 Interest and other income, net $ 116 $ (17 ) $ (6 ) $ 93 The following is a summary of the 2007 credits: (Stated in millions) Pretax Tax Non controllingInterests Net Income Statement Classification Gain on sale of workover rigs $ (24 ) $ 7 $ $ (17 ) Interest and other income, net Cash Flow Net Debt represents gross debt less cash, short term investments and fixed income investments, held to maturity.

The proceeds from these notes were used to refinance existing debt obligations. During the first quarter of 2009, Schlumberger entered into a 3.0 billion Euro Medium Term Note program. This program provides for the issuance of various types of debt instruments such as fixed or floating rate notes in Euro, US dollar or other currencies. During the first quarter of 2009, Schlumberger issued 1.0 billion 4.50% Guaranteed Notes due 2014 under this program. Schlumberger entered into agreements to swap these euro notes for US dollars on the date of issue until maturity, effectively making this a US dollar denominated debt on which Schlumberger will pay interest in US dollars at a rate of 4.95%. The proceeds from these notes were used to refinance existing debt obligations and for general corporate purposes. In September 2008, Schlumberger issued 500 million 5.25% Guaranteed Notes due 2013. Schlumberger entered into agreements to swap these Euro notes for US dollars on the date of issue 27 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 until maturity, effectively making this a US dollar denominated debt on which Schlumberger will pay interest in US dollars at a rate of 4.74%. The proceeds from these notes were used to repay commercial paper borrowings. On April 20, 2006, the Schlumberger Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program of up to 40 million shares of common stock to be acquired in the open market before April 2010, subject to market conditions. This program was completed during the second quarter of 2008. On April 17, 2008, the Schlumberger Board of Directors approved an $8 billion share repurchase program for shares of Schlumberger common stock, to be acquired in the open market before December 31, 2011, of which $1.43 billion had been repurchased as of December 31, 2009. The following table summarizes the activity under these share repurchase programs during 2009, 2008 and 2007: (Stated in thousands except per share amounts and prices) Total costof sharespurchased Total numberof sharespurchased Averageprice paidper share 2009 $ 500,097 7,825.0 $ 63.91 2008 $ 1,818,841 21,064.7 $ 86.35 2007 $ 1,355,000 16,336.1 $ 82.95 Cash flow provided by operations was $5.3 billion in 2009, $6.9 billion in 2008 and $6.3 billion in 2007. The decline in cash flow from operations in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily driven by the decrease in net income experienced in 2009 and the significant pension plan contributions made during 2009, offset by an improvement in working capital requirements. The improvement in 2008 as compared to 2007 was driven by the net income increase experienced in 2008 offset by required investments in working capital. The reduction in cash flows experienced by some of Schlumbergers customers as a result of global economic conditions could have significant adverse effects on their financial condition. This could result in, among other things, delay in, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to Schlumberger, which could have a material adverse effect on Schlumbergers results of operations and cash flows. At times in recent quarters, Schlumberger has experienced delays in payments from certain of its customers. Schlumberger operates in approximately 80 countries. At December 31, 2009, only three of those countries individually accounted for greater than 5% of Schlumbergers accounts receivable balance of which only one represented greater than 10%. During 2008 and 2007, Schlumberger announced that its Board of Directors had approved increases in the quarterly dividend of 20% and 40%, respectively. Total dividends paid during 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $1.0 billion, $964 million and $771 million, respectively. Capital expenditures were $2.4 billion in 2009, $3.7 billion in 2008 and $2.9 billion in 2007. Capital expenditures in 2008 and 2007 reflected the record activity levels experienced in those years. The decrease in capital expenditures in 2009 as compared to 2008 is primarily due to the significant activity decline during 2009. Oilfield Services capital expenditures are expected to approach $2.4 billion for the full year 2010 as compared to $1.9 billion in 2009 and $3.0 billion in 2008. WesternGeco capital expenditures are expected to approach $0.3 billion for the full year 2010 as compared to $0.5 billion in 2009 and $0.7 billion in 2008. 28 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 During 2009, 2008 and 2007 Schlumberger made contributions of $1.1 billion, $290 million and $250 million, respectively, to its defined benefit pension plans. The US pension plans were 92% funded at December 31, 2009 based on the projected benefit obligation. This compares to 69% funded at December 31, 2008. Schlumbergers international defined benefit pension plans are a combined 85% funded at December 31, 2009 based on the projected benefit obligation. This compares to 69% funded at December 31, 2008. Schlumberger currently anticipates contributing approximately $500 million to $600 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2010, subject to market and business conditions. Schlumberger repaid approximately $1.9 billion of debt during 2009 compared to $0.8 billion during 2008 and $0.7 billion during 2007. During 2008 and 2007, certain holders of Schlumberger Limited 1.5% Series A Convertible Debentures due June 1, 2023 and 2.125% Series B Convertible Debentures due June 1, 2023 converted their debentures into Schlumberger common stock. The following table summarizes these conversions: (Stated in millions) 2008 2007 Conversions Shares issued Conversions Shares issued 1.5% Series A debentures $ 353 9.76 $ 622 17.19 2.125% Series B debentures 95 2.36 34 0.85 $ 448 12.12 $ 656 18.04 At December 31, 2008, there were no outstanding Series A debentures. There were $321 million outstanding Series B debentures at both December 31, 2009 and 2008. On December 10, 2007, Schlumberger completed the acquisition of Eastern Echo for $838 million in cash. Net assets acquired included $320 million of cash and investments and $182 million of long term debt. As of December 31, 2009, Schlumberger had approximately $4.6 billion of cash and short term investments on hand. Schlumberger had separate committed debt facility agreements aggregating $3.8 billion with commercial banks, of which $2.8 billion was available and unused as of December 31, 2009. This included $2.5 billion of committed facilities which support commercial paper borrowings in the United States and Europe. Schlumberger believes that these amounts are sufficient to meet future business requirements for at least the next twelve months. Schlumbergers total outstanding debt at December 31, 2009 was $5.5 billion and included approximately $0.4 billion of commercial paper borrowings. The total outstanding debt increased approximately $0.2 billion compared to December 31, 2008.

Excludes future payments for interest. Includes, in 2010, amounts relating to the $321 million of 2.125% Series B Convertible Debentures which are described in Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 29 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 2. Represents an estimate of contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business. Although these contractual obligations are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow Schlumberger the option to reschedule and adjust their requirements based on business needs prior to the delivery of goods. Refer to Note 19 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding Schlumbergers pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. As discussed in Note 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in the Schlumberger Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2009 is approximately $1.03 billion of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in the over 100 jurisdictions in which Schlumberger conducts business. Due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded, Schlumberger cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash outflows relating to these liabilities. Schlumberger has outstanding letters of credit/guarantees which relate to business performance bonds, custom/excise tax commitments, facility lease/rental obligations, etc. These were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are customary practices in the various countries where Schlumberger operates. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires Schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by Schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain. A summary of all of Schlumbergers significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Multiclient Seismic Data The WesternGeco segment capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data. The carrying value of the multiclient seismic data library at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $288 million and $287 million, respectively. Such costs are charged to Cost of revenue based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that Schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data. However, under no circumstances will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4 year straight line amortized value. The carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred. Adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues, which involve significant judgment on the part of Schlumberger, would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys. Significant adverse changes in Schlumbergers estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period. For purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library, future cash flows are analyzed primarily based on two pools of surveys: United States and non United States. The United States and non United States pools were determined to be the most appropriate level at which to perform the impairment review based upon a number of factors including (i) various macroeconomic factors that influence the ability to successfully market surveys and (ii) the focus of the sales force and related costs. Certain larger surveys, which are typically prefunded by customers, are analyzed for impairment on a survey by survey basis. 30 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value. A significant amount of judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve. Allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible, including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices. Depending on how such potential issues are resolved, or if the financial condition of Schlumberger customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, adjustments to the allowance may be required. Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Long Lived Assets Schlumberger records the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired as goodwill. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of Schlumbergers individual reporting units to their carrying amount to determine if there is a potential goodwill impairment. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. For purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill, Schlumbergers reporting units are primarily the geographic areas comprising the Oilfield Services segment in addition to the WesternGeco segment. Schlumberger estimates the fair value of these reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis and or applying various market multiples. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is a matter of judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Schlumbergers estimates of the fair value of each of its reporting units were significantly in excess of their respective carrying values at the time of the annual goodwill impairment tests for 2009, 2008 and 2007. Long lived assets, including fixed assets and intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In reviewing for impairment, the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If such cash flows are not sufficient to support the assets recorded value, an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long lived asset to its estimated fair value. The determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of long lived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management. If there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value, Schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future. Schlumberger evaluates the remaining useful life of its intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated amortization period. Income Taxes Schlumbergers tax filings are subject to regular audit by the tax authorities in most of the over 100 jurisdictions in which it conducts business. These audits may result in assessments for additional taxes which are resolved with the authorities or, potentially, through the courts. Tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits. Estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances. However, due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different from these estimates. In such an event, Schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs. 31 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Pension and Postretirement Benefits Schlumbergers pension and postretirement benefit obligations are described in detail in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts, which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates. These assumptions are important elements of expense and or liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis, or upon the occurrence of significant events. The discount rate Schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high quality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the payment of the benefit obligations. The following summarizes the discount rates utilized by Schlumberger for its various pension and postretirement benefit plans: The discount rate utilized to determine the liability for Schlumbergers United States pension plans and postretirement medical plans was 6.00% at December 31, 2009 and 6.50% at December 31, 2008. The weighted average discount rate utilized to determine the liability for Schlumbergers international pension plans was 5.89% at December 31, 2009 and 6.48% at December 31, 2008. The weighted average discount rate utilized to determine expense for Schlumbergers United States pension plans and postretirement medical plans increased from 6.50% in 2008 to 6.94% in 2009. The weighted average discount rate utilized to determine expense for Schlumbergers international pension plans was increased from 5.80% in 2008 to 6.81% in 2009. A higher discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligations and decreases expense. The expected rate of return for our retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation are expected to be paid. The expected rate of return for Schlumbergers United States pension plans has been determined based upon expectations regarding future rates of return for the investment portfolio, with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class. The expected rate of return on plan assets for the United States pension plans was 8.50% in both 2009 and 2008. The weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the international plans was 8.35% in 2009 and 8.00% in 2008. A lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense. Schlumbergers medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends. The overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized to determine both the 2009 postretirement medical expense as well as the postretirement medical liability as of December 31, 2009 was 8% graded to 5% over the next six years. The following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, for the United States and international pension plans: (Stated in millions) Change in Assumption Effect on 2009Pretax PensionExpense Effect onDec. 31, 2009Liability 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$13 +$226 25 basis point increase in discount rate $13 $210 25 basis point decrease in expected return on plan assets +$11 25 basis point increase in expected return on plan assets $11 32 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7, 7A The following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, for Schlumbergers United States postretirement medical plans: (Stated in millions) Change in Assumption Effect on 2009Pretax PostretirementMedical Expense Effect onDec. 31, 2009Liability 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$3 +$35 25 basis point increase in discount rate $2 $33 100 basis point decrease per annum in medical cost trend rate $14 $126 100 basis point increase per annum in medical cost trend rate +$21 +$154 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Schlumberger is subject to market risks primarily associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. As a multinational company, Schlumberger conducts business in approximately 80 countries. Schlumbergers functional currency is primarily the US dollar, which is consistent with the oil and gas industry. Approximately 80% of Schlumbergers revenue in 2009 was denominated in US dollars. However, outside the United States, a significant portion of Schlumbergers expenses is incurred in foreign currencies. Therefore, when the US dollar weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which Schlumberger conducts business, the US dollar reported expenses will increase. A 5% increase or decrease in the average exchange rates of all the foreign currencies in 2009 would have changed revenue by approximately 1%. If the 2009 average exchange rates of the US dollar against all foreign currencies had strengthened by 5%, Schlumbergers income from continuing operations would have increased by approximately 4%. Conversely, a 5% weakening of the US dollar average exchange rates would have decreased income from continuing operations by approximately 4%. Although the functional currency of Schlumbergers operations in Venezuela is the US dollar, a portion of the transactions are denominated in local currency. For financial reporting purposes, such transactions are remeasured into US dollars at the official exchange rate, which until January 2010 was fixed at 2.15 Venezuelan bolivares fuertes per US dollar, despite significant inflation in recent periods. In January 2010, Venezuelas currency was devalued and a new currency exchange rate system was announced. Schlumberger is in the process of evaluating what exchange rate will apply to Schlumbergers local currency denominated transactions. Such rate is expected to be between 2.6 and 4.3 Venezuelan bolivars fuertes per US dollar. Schlumberger does not expect the immediate impact of this devaluation to have a significant impact on its first quarter 2010 results of operations. Going forward, although this devaluation will result in a reduction in the US dollar reported amount of local currency denominated revenues and expenses, the impact will not be material to Schlumbergers consolidated financial statements. Schlumberger maintains a foreign currency risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to protect its interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates. Foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options to provide a hedge against currency fluctuations either on monetary assets/liabilities denominated in other than a functional currency or on expenses. At December 31, 2009, contracts were outstanding for the US dollar equivalent of $4.3 billion in various foreign currencies. Schlumberger is subject to the risk of market price fluctuations of certain commodities, such as metals and fuel. Schlumberger utilizes forward contracts to manage a small percentage of the price risk associated with forecast metal purchases. As of December 31, 2009, $4 million of commodity forward contracts were outstanding. Schlumberger is subject to interest rate risk on its debt and its investment portfolio. Schlumberger maintains an interest rate risk management strategy that uses a mix of variable and fixed rate debt combined with its investment portfolio and interest rate swaps to mitigate the exposure to changes in interest rates. At 33 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7A December 31, 2009, Schlumberger had fixed rate debt aggregating approximately $4.2 billion and variable rate debt aggregating approximately $1.3 billion. Schlumberger has entered into interest rate swaps relating to $1.1 billion of its fixed rate debt as of December 31, 2009 whereby Schlumberger will receive interest at a fixed rate and pay interest at a variable rate. Schlumbergers exposure to interest rate risk associated with its debt is also partially mitigated by its investment portfolio. Both Short term investments and Fixed income investments, held to maturity, which totaled approximately $5.1 billion at December 31, 2009, are comprised primarily of money market funds, eurodollar time deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, euro notes and Eurobonds and are substantially all denominated in US dollars. The average return on investment was 1.4% in 2009. The following table represents principal amounts of Schlumbergers debt at December 31, 2009 by year of maturity: (Stated in millions) Expected Maturity Dates 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Total Fixed rate debt 2.125% Series B Convertible Debentures $ 321 $ 321 5.14% Guaranteed Notes 238 238 5.875% Guaranteed Bonds $ 362 362 6.5% Notes $ 649 649 5.25% Guaranteed Bonds $ 727 727 3.00% Guaranteed Notes 449 449 4.50% Guaranteed Bonds $ 1,449 1,449 Total fixed rate debt $ 559 $ 362 $ 649 $ 1,176 $ 1,449 $ 4,195 Variable rate debt $ 567 $ 294 $ 375 $ 20 $ 29 $ 1,285 Total $ 1,126 $ 656 $ 1,024 $ 1,196 $ 1,478 $ 5,480 The fair market value of the outstanding fixed rate debt was approximately $4.6 billion as of December 31, 2009. The weighted average interest rate on the variable rate debt as of December 31, 2009 was approximately 1.7%. Schlumberger does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes.
