ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 2001 (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS) OVERVIEW ON AUGUST 7, 1997, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STUDENT LOAN MARKETING ASSOCIATION REORGANIZATION ACT OF 1996 (THE "PRIVATIZATION ACT") AND APPROVAL BY SHAREHOLDERS OF AN AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION, THE STUDENT LOAN MARKETING ASSOCIATION (THE "GSE") WAS REORGANIZED INTO A SUBSIDIARY OF USA EDUCATION, INC. (THE "REORGANIZATION"). USA EDUCATION, INC. IS A HOLDING COMPANY THAT OPERATES THROUGH A NUMBER OF SUBSIDIARIES INCLUDING THE GSE. REFERENCES HEREIN TO THE "COMPANY" REFER TO THE GSE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO THE REORGANIZATION AND TO USA EDUCATION, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES FOR PERIODS AFTER THE REORGANIZATION. USA EDUCATION, INC. WILL BE RENAMED SLM CORPORATION EFFECTIVE MAY 17, 2002. The Company is the largest private source of funding, delivery and servicing support for education loans in the United States primarily through its participation in the Federal Family Education Loan Program ("FFELP"), formerly the Guaranteed Student Loan Program. The Companys products and services include student loan purchases and commitments to purchase student loans, student loan servicing and collections, as well as operational support to originators of student loans and to post secondary education institutions, guarantors and other education related financial services. The Company also originates, purchases, holds and services non federally insured private loans. The following Managements Discussion and Analysis contains forward looking statements and information that are based on managements current expectations as of the date of this document. Discussions that utilize the words "intend," "anticipate," "believe," "estimate" and "expect" and similar expressions, as they relate to the Companys management, are intended to identify forward looking statements. Such forward looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause the actual results of the Company to be materially different from those reflected in such forward looking statements. Such factors include, among others, changes in the terms of student loans and the educational credit marketplace arising from the implementation of applicable laws and regulations and from changes in such laws and regulations, which may reduce the volume, average term and costs of yields on student loans under the FFELP or result in loans being originated or refinanced under non FFELP programs or may affect the terms upon which banks and others agree to sell FFELP loans to the Company. The Company could also be affected by changes in the demand for educational financing and consumer lending or in financing preferences of lenders, educational institutions, students and their families; changes in the general interest rate environment and in the securitization markets for education loans, which may increase the costs or limit the availability of financings necessary to initiate, purchase or carry education loans; losses from default; and changes in prepayment rates and credit spreads. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these 20 estimates under varying assumptions or conditions. Note 2 of the "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. On an on going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, particularly as they relate to accounting policies that management believes are most "critical" that is, they are most important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results and they require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These accounting policies include: securitization accounting, provision for loan losses, sales of floor revenue contracts and derivative accounting. SECURITIZATION ACCOUNTING. The Company regularly engages in securitization transactions as part of its financing strategy. When the Company sells student loans to a securitization trust, it retains any excess residual cash flows ("residual interest"), servicing rights, and in some cases, a cash reserve account, all of which are retained interests in the securitized receivables. Gains and losses from securitizations are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income when the Company transfers the financial assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140 ("SFAS 140"), "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities a Replacement of FASB Statement No. 125." The gain or loss on securitization is based upon the previous carrying amount of the financial assets involved in the transfer and the fair value of the retained interest at the date of transfer. The Company estimates fair value, both initially and on a quarterly basis going forward, based on the present value of future expected cash flows estimated using managements best estimates of the key assumptions credit losses, prepayment speeds and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved. The use of different estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES. The allowance for student loan losses is established primarily through a charge to the provision for student loan losses. Provisions are made to the reserve for estimated losses in outstanding loan balances principally for the Companys non insured student loans. The estimated losses are based on historical default rates by program type and are regularly evaluated by the Company for adequacy by considering factors such as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, changes in actual and forecasted default rates, and evaluating actual versus projected charge offs. A large percentage of the Companys non federally insured loans have not matured to a point at which predictable loan loss patterns have developed. Accordingly, the evaluation of the provision for loan losses is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant changes. SALES OF FLOOR REVENUE CONTRACTS. Management continually evaluates the projected balance of the student loan portfolio that contains an embedded option for earning additional income when short term interest rates fall below certain levels. This evaluation primarily considers prepayment rates, projected volume through originations and purchases and default rates. Based on these projections, management enters into floor revenue contracts (see "Student Loan Floor Revenue Contracts"). Fluctuations in the value of such contracts are recorded currently in income. If the estimates used in the projections differ materially from the actual portfolio balances, it could have a material impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. DERIVATIVE ACCOUNTING. The Company maintains an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuation in earnings that are caused by interest rate volatility. Derivative instruments that are used as part of the Companys interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps, interest rate futures contracts, and interest rate floor and cap contracts. Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 ("SFAS 133"), "Accounting for Derivative 21 Instruments and Hedging Activities," which requires that every derivative instrument, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. Most of the derivative contracts into which the Company enters are effective economic hedges for its interest rate risk management strategy but are not effective hedges under SFAS 133. This results in the majority of these hedges being classified as "trading" for GAAP purposes and therefore the resulting mark to market is included in GAAP earnings. Mark to market values for certain derivative contracts are derived from pricing models that consider current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments, as well as time value and yield curve or volatility factors underlying the positions. Pricing models and their underlying assumptions impact the amount and timing of unrealized gains and losses recognized, and the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different financial results. Other accounting policies involve estimates, assumptions and judgments that, if varied, may cause actual results to be materially different from those reported. 22 SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA CONDENSED STATEMENTS OF INCOME INCREASE (DECREASE) YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 VS. 2000 2000 VS. 1999 2001 2000 1999 $ % $ % Net interest income................... $ 873 $ 642 $ 694 $ 231 36% $ (52) (7)% Less: provision for losses............ 66 32 34 34 105 (2) (7) Net interest income after provision for losses.......................... 807 610 660 197 32 (50) (8) Gains on student loan securitizations..................... 75 92 35 (17) (18) 57 160 Servicing and securitization revenue............................. 634 296 289 338 115 7 2 (Losses) gains on sales of securities..........................

The decrease in 2001 reported net income from 2000 is attributable to several significant factors. The Company increased the on balance sheet average balance of student loans by $5.4 billion, and the lower interest rate environment in 2001 increased after tax floor income by $77 million. Offsetting these increases were a $79 million after tax increase in operating expense principally due to the acquisitions of USA Group, Inc. ("USA Group") and Student Loan Funding Resources, Inc. ("SLFR"), and a $128 million after tax decrease in gains on sales of securities. These decreases to net income were only partially offset by the increases in after tax servicing and securitization revenue of $220 million. After tax fee income increased net income by $82 million, principally due to the additional guarantor and third party servicing fee income attributable to the acquisition of USA Group. In addition, GAAP net income includes a net after tax year to date loss of $294 million attributable to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 ("SFAS 133"), "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activites," mark to market effect. (For additional discussion of SFAS 133, see Note 10 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.") During 2001, the Company repurchased 19.4 million common shares through its open market purchases and equity forward settlements (or 12 percent of its outstanding shares) at a cost of $859 million, and issued a net 10.7 million shares from benefit plans. As a result, common shares outstanding decreased to 155.5 million at December 31, 2001 from 164.1 million at December 31, 2000. The Companys "core cash basis" net income was $624 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 ($3.75 diluted earnings per share) versus $492 million ($2.93 diluted earnings per share) for the year ended December 31, 2000. (See "Pro forma Statements of Income" for a detailed discussion of "core cash basis" net income.) During 2001, the Company acquired $13.5 billion of managed student loans. Student loan acquisitions increased the average balance of managed loans outstanding by $10.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001. The higher average student loan balance and a lower cost of funds primarily due to the Company locking in floor income through term hedges (see "Core Cash Basis Student Loan Spread and Net Interest Income"), increased after tax "core cash basis" earnings by $121 million. In addition, after tax fee income increased by $82 million from the year ended December 31, 2000, principally due to the full year effect of the additional guarantor and third party servicing fee income attributable to the acquisition of USA Group. (See "Other Income.") These increases to "core cash basis" net income were partially offset by the after tax increase to operating expenses of $95 million principally due to the acquisitions of USA Group and SLFR, which closed on July 31, 2000 and July 7, 2000, respectively. NET INTEREST INCOME Net interest income is derived largely from the Companys portfolio of student loans that remain on balance sheet. The "Taxable Equivalent Net Interest Income" analysis set forth below is designed to facilitate a comparison of non taxable asset yields to taxable yields on a similar basis. Additional information regarding the return on the Companys student loan portfolio is set forth under "Student Loans Student Loan Spread Analysis." Information regarding the provision for losses is contained in Note 5 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements." Taxable equivalent net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2001 versus the year ended December 31, 2000 increased by $225 million while the net interest margin increased by 30 basis 24 points. The increase in taxable equivalent net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2001 was primarily due to the lower interest rate environment in 2001, which led to an increase of $119 million in floor income, and the $5.4 billion increase in the average balance of student loans. The net interest margin increase is reflective of the higher average balance of student loans as a percentage of average total earning assets and the increase in floor income. This is partially offset by the increase in the Companys portfolio of lower yielding loans due to the acquisition of loans earlier in their life cycles which has decreased the average special allowance payment ("SAP") in the student loan yield. Taxable equivalent net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2000 versus the year ended December 31, 1999 decreased by $59 million while the net interest margin decreased by 33 basis points. The decrease in taxable equivalent net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2000 was primarily due to the higher interest rate environment in 2000, which led to a decrease of $63 million in floor income. The net interest margin decrease is reflective of the higher average balance of investments as a percentage of average total earning assets. In addition, the increase in the Companys portfolio of lower yielding loans due to the acquisition of loans earlier in their life cycles has decreased the average SAP in the student loan yield. TAXABLE EQUIVALENT NET INTEREST INCOME The amounts in this table and the following table are adjusted for the impact of certain tax exempt and tax advantaged investments based on the marginal federal corporate tax rate of 35 percent.

The Company generally earns interest at the greater of the borrowers rate or a floating rate determined by reference to the average of the applicable floating rates (91 day Treasury bill, commercial paper, 52 week Treasury bill, or the constant maturity Treasury rate) in a calendar quarter, plus a fixed spread which is dependent upon when the loan was originated. If the resulting floating rate exceeds the borrower rate, the Department of Education pays the difference directly to the Company. This payment is referred to as SAP. If the resulting floating rate is less than the rate the borrower is obligated to pay, the Company simply earns interest at the borrower rate. In all cases, the rate the borrower pays sets a minimum rate for determining the yield the Company earns on the loan. Borrowers interest rates are either fixed to term or are reset annually on July 1 of each year depending on when the loan was originated. The Company generally finances its student loan portfolio with floating rate debt tied to the average of the 91 day Treasury bill auctions, the commerical paper index, the 52 week Treasury bill, or the constant maturity Treasury rate, either directly or through the use of derivative financial instruments intended to mimic the interest rate characteristics of the student loans. Such borrowings in general, however, do not have minimum rates. As a result, in certain declining interest rate environments, the portfolio of managed student loans may be earning at the minimum borrower rate while the Companys funding costs (exclusive of fluctuations in funding spreads) will generally decline 27 along with short term interest rates. For loans where the borrowers interest rate is fixed to term, lower interest rates may benefit the spread earned on student loans for extended periods of time. For loans where the borrowers interest rate is reset annually, any benefit of a low interest rate environment will only enhance student loan spreads through the next annual reset of the borrowers interest rates, which occurs on July 1 of each year. The effect of this enhanced spread is referred to as floor income. Low average Treasury bill rates in 2001 benefited the Companys on balance sheet student loan income, net of payments under floor revenue contracts (see "Student Loan Floor Revenue Contracts"), by $119 million of which $43 million was attributable to student loans with minimum borrower rates fixed to term and $76 million was attributable to student loans with minimum borrower rates adjusting annually. Higher average Treasury bill rates in 2000 compared to 1999 decreased the Companys benefit from student loans earning at the minimum borrower rate included in student loan income, net of payments under floor revenue contracts, to $3 million, of which $2 million was attributable to student loans with minimum borrower rates fixed to term and $1 million was attributable to student loans with minimum borrower rates adjusting annually. The 19 basis point increase in the student loan spread in 2001 versus 2000 is due primarily to the increase in floor income, attributable to lower short term interest rates. The student loan spread in 2000 decreased by 21 basis points from 1999. This was due mainly to the decrease in floor income, attributable to higher short term interest rates in 2000. The following table analyzes the ability of the FFELP student loans in the Companys managed student loan portfolio to earn at the minimum borrower interest rate at December 31, 2001 and 2000, based on the last Treasury bill auction of the year (1.74 percent in 2001 and 5.86 percent in 2000). Commercial paper rate loans are based upon the final commercial paper rate of the year (1.81 percent in 2001 and 6.39 percent in 2000).

Under these contracts, referred to as "floor revenue contracts," the Company receives an upfront payment and agrees to pay the difference between (1) the minimum borrower interest rate less the spread ("the strike rate") and (2) the average of the index over the period of the contract. If the strike rate is less than the average of the index, then no payment is required. Prior to the implementation of SFAS 133, these upfront payments were amortized over the average life of the contracts. Floor revenue contracts sold on loans where the borrower rate is reset annually have historically had terms through the next reset date, a period of one year or less, while floor revenue contracts sold on loans where the borrower 28 rate is fixed to term have multi year terms. The $13.5 billion of outstanding fixed borrower rate floor revenue contracts at December 31, 2001 have expiration dates through the year 2008. For the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, the amortization of the upfront payments received from the sale of floor revenue contracts on the Companys on balance sheet student loans with fixed borrower rates was $23 million and $20 million, respectively, and for floor revenue contracts with annually reset borrower rates was $1 million and $21 million, respectively. Effective December 31, 2000, in anticipation of the adoption of SFAS 133, the floor revenue contracts were de designated as effective hedges and marked to market. The net effect of the fair market value of these contracts and the unamortized upfront payment was a loss totaling $104 million. This loss was reclassified to student loan premium and is being amortized over the average life of the student loan portfolio. At December 31, 2001, the unamortized balance related to the fair market value of these contracts in student loan premium totaled $77 million. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the related amortization totaled $13 million, and the premium write off due to securitization totaled $14 million. Since these contracts are no longer considered effective hedges for GAAP, the Company marks to market the floor revenue contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recognized $258 million in pre tax, mark to market losses attributable to floor revenue contracts due to the implementation of SFAS 133. At December 31, 2001, the outstanding notional amount of floor revenue contracts totaled $18.5 billion. ACTIVITY IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES The provision for loan losses represents the periodic expense of maintaining an allowance sufficient to absorb losses, net of recoveries, inherent in the portfolio of student loans. The Company evaluates the adequacy of the provision for losses on its federally insured portfolio of student loans separately from its non federally insured portfolio. For the federally insured portfolio, the Company primarily considers trends in student loan claims rejected for payment by guarantors due to servicing defects as well as overall default rates on those FFELP student loans subject to the two percent risk sharing, i.e., those loans that are insured as to 98 percent of principal and accrued interest. Once a student loan is rejected for claim payment, the Companys policy is to continue to pursue the recovery of principal and interest. Due to the nature of the FFELP assets and the extensive collection efforts in which the Company engages, the Company currently writes off an unpaid claim once it has aged to two years. 29 For the non federally insured portfolio of student loans, the Company primarily considers recent trends in delinquencies, charge offs and recoveries, historical trends in loan volume by program, economic conditions and credit and underwriting policies. A large percentage of the Companys non federally insured loans have not matured to a point at which predictable loan loss patterns have developed. Accordingly, the evaluation of the provision for loan losses is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant changes. Management believes that the provision for loan losses is adequate to cover anticipated losses in the student loan portfolio. An analysis of the Companys allowance for loan losses is presented in the following table.

As the volume of non federally insured loans increases and begins to age, the Company obtains more historical data on default rates for these loans. Based on managements assumptions and on actual loan performance, the Company re evaluates the requirements for its provision for loan losses. In 2001, non federally insured loan write offs increased by $31 million over 2000 which is primarily attributable to the increased volume and aging of this portfolio. These factors did not significantly impact the provision for loan losses in 2000 or 1999. 30 ON BALANCE SHEET FUNDING COSTS The Companys borrowings are generally variable rate indexed principally to the 91 day Treasury bill, commercial paper, 52 week Treasury bill, or the constant maturity Treasury rate. The following table summarizes the average balance of on balance sheet debt (by index, after giving effect to the impact of interest rate swaps) for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 (dollars in millions). YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 2000 1999 AVERAGE AVERAGE AVERAGE AVERAGE AVERAGE AVERAGE INDEX BALANCE RATE BALANCE RATE BALANCE RATE Treasury bill, principally 91 day......... $31,459 4.06% $30,823 6.54% $26,559 5.33% LIBOR..................................... 2,004 4.53 1,900 6.49 2,597 5.14 Discount notes............................ 7,168 4.42 5,300 6.26 3,424 4.90 Fixed..................................... 5,180 5.53 3,552 5.75 5,655 5.57 Zero coupon............................... 192 11.14 171 11.17 153 11.14 Commercial paper.......................... 2,357 3.03 969 6.65 302 5.69 Auction rate securities................... 1,101 3.67 653 5.65 Other..................................... 238 3.59 598 6.25 806 5.08 Total..................................... $49,699 4.27% $43,966 6.45% $39,496 5.35% SECURITIZATION PROGRAM In 2001, the Company completed four securitization transactions in which a total of $6.0 billion of student loans were sold to a special purpose finance subsidiary and by that subsidiary to special purpose trusts that issued asset backed securities to fund the student loans to term. Also in 2001, the Company sold $435 million of student loans through the recycling provisions of prior securitizations. In 2000, the Company completed four securitization transactions in which a total of $8.8 billion of student loans were sold to a special purpose finance subsidiary and by that subsidiary to special purpose trusts that issued asset backed securities to fund the student loans to term. In addition, the Company acquired the securitization revenue streams of $5.2 billion of student loans previously securitized by USA Group. In 1999, the Company completed three securitization transactions in which a total of $4.0 billion of student loans were securitized. The Company accounts for its securitization transactions in accordance with SFAS 140, which establishes the accounting for certain financial asset transfers, including securitization transactions. Under SFAS 140, the Company records a gain on sale based upon the difference between the cost basis of the assets sold and the fair value of the assets received. As a result, the Company records an asset, the residual interest, which approximates the present value of the expected net cash flows from the trust to the Company over the life of the portfolio securitized. In addition, the Company continues to service the loans in the trusts through Sallie Mae Servicing L.P., formerly known as Sallie Mae Servicing Corporation, for a fee, and earns that fee over the life of the portfolio. When the contract servicing fee is greater than current market servicing rates, the present value of such excess servicing fees is recognized as a servicing asset and amortized over the life of the portfolio serviced. 31 GAINS ON STUDENT LOAN SECURITIZATIONS For the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, the Company recorded pre tax securitization gains of $75 million, $92 million and $35 million, respectively. Gains for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, measured as a percentage of the securitized portfolios, were 1.16 percent, 1.04 percent and .88 percent, respectively. During 2001, the Company securitized $2.8 billion less than in 2000. The decrease in gains in 2001 versus 2000 is primarily due to the lower volume of loans securitized. The increase in the gain percentage in 2001 versus 2000 is principally due to lower financing spreads. The increase in the gains and gain percentage in 2000 versus 1999 is due to increased volume and lower financing spreads, respectively. Gains on future securitizations will continue to vary depending on the size and the loan characteristics of the loan portfolios securitized and the funding costs prevailing in the securitization debt markets. SERVICING AND SECURITIZATION REVENUE Servicing and securitization revenue, the ongoing revenue from securitized loan pools, includes both the revenue the Company receives for servicing loans in the securitization trusts and the income earned on the residual interest asset. The following table summarizes the components of servicing and securitization revenue: YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 2000 1999 Servicing revenue less amortization of servicing asset................................................. $266 $219 $158 Securitization revenue.................................. 368 77 131 Total servicing and securitization revenue.............. $634 $296 $289 The increase in servicing revenue is mainly due to the increase in the average balance of securitized student loans to $30.6 billion in 2001 from $25.7 billion in 2000 and $17.5 billion in 1999. The average balance of the retained interest was $1.4 billion in 2001, $849 million in 2000 and $701 million in 1999. The Companys securitized loan portfolio benefits from low average Treasury bill rates in a manner similar to the on balance sheet portfolio of student loans. In 2001 and 1999, low average Treasury bill rates enhanced securitization revenue by $216 million and $42 million, respectively. The increase in Treasury bill rates during 2000 reduced these earnings to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 and was the principal cause of the reduction in securitization revenue in 2000 versus 1999. GAIN ON SALE OF STUDENT LOANS During the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company sold $900 million of student loan assets and recorded a pre tax gain of $27 million. As part of the transaction the Company entered into long term servicing agreements with four companies to service the loans sold. No such sales occurred in 2001 or 2000. OTHER INCOME Other income, exclusive of gains on student loan securitizations, servicing and securitization revenue, the effect of SFAS 133 and gains and losses on sales of investment securities and student loans, totaled $439 million in 2001 versus $281 million in 2000 and $84 million in 1999. Other income mainly includes guarantor servicing fees (as a result of the USA Group transaction which closed in July 2000), late fees earned on student loans, revenue received from servicing third party portfolios of student loans, and commitment fees for letters of credit. Guarantor servicing fees arise primarily from four categories of services that correspond to the student loan life cycle. They include fees from loan 32 originations, the maintenance of loan guarantees, default prevention, and collections. Guarantor servicing fees totaled $255 million in 2001 versus $128 million in 2000. Late fees totaled $56 million in 2001, versus $42 million in 2000 and $38 million in 1999. Third party servicing fees totaled $53 million in 2001, versus $39 million in 2000 and $5 million in 1999. Commitment fees for letters of credit totaled $11 million in 2001, versus $16 million in 2000 and $19 million in 1999. For the year ended December 31, 2001, $3 million of SFAS 133 transition adjustment losses were reclassified from other comprehensive income to other income (see Note 10 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"). Other income for 2001 also includes an $18 million loss recognized by the Company in the fourth quarter, on the impairment of assets generated from the scheduled sale of its Sallie Mae Solutions product line. In 2000, the Company entered into LIBOR floor revenue contracts that were an effective economic hedge of a segment of its student loan portfolio. These positions did not meet the hedge effectiveness requirements under GAAP and were marked to market which resulted in a $25 million pre tax loss recorded in other income for the year ended December 31, 2000. No such transactions were in effect for 1999. OPERATING EXPENSES The following table summarizes the components of operating expenses: YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 2000 1999 Servicing and acquisition expenses................... $414 $320 $239 General and administrative expenses.................. 294 213 120 Integration charge................................... 53 Total operating expenses............................. $708 $586 $359 Operating expenses include costs to service the Companys managed student loan portfolio, operational costs incurred in the process of acquiring student loan portfolios, general and administrative expenses, and beginning in August 2000, operational costs associated with its guarantor servicing operations. The Company recorded an integration charge of $53 million in 2000 to cover severance costs, costs to close facilities and move functional responsibilities as well as costs to align system capabilities and move the Companys data center. Exclusive of this one time integration charge, operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $708 million, $533 million and $359 million, respectively. Operating expenses increased during 2001 and 2000 as a direct result of the acquisitions of SLFR and the business operations of USA Group, each of which occurred in July 2000. In 2001, the acquisitions increased operating expenses for the full year and in 2000, for half of the year. The Company has maintained an aggressive integration plan that is designed to eliminate the duplicate operations and merge the complimentary operations of all the consolidated entities. 33 STUDENT LOAN PURCHASES The following table summarizes the components of the Companys student loan purchase activity: YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 2000 1999 Preferred channel............................ $ 9,524 $ 6,595 $ 7,161 Other commitment clients..................... 949 1,405 1,788 Spot purchases............................... 678 885 115 Consolidations............................... 1,172 824 920 Other........................................ 1,209 1,149 1,111 USA Group acquisition........................ 1,421 SLFR acquisition............................. 3,103 Nellie Mae acquisition....................... 2,585 Subtotal..................................... 13,532 15,382 13,680 Managed loans acquired....................... 894 5,912 457 Total........................................ $14,426 $21,294 $14,137 The Company purchased $13.5 billion and acquired the securitization revenue streams of $0.9 billion of managed loans for a total of $14.4 billion of student loans in 2001 compared with $21.3 billion in 2000 and $14.1 billion in 1999. Included in the 2000 purchases are $1.4 billion of student loans acquired from USA Group and $3.1 billion of student loans acquired from SLFR. Included in the 1999 purchases are $2.6 billion of student loans acquired in the Nellie Mae acquisition. The Companys preferred channel represents all loans originated on the Companys origination systems. In 2001, the Companys preferred channel loan originations totaled $10.1 billion versus $7.3 billion in 2000. The pipeline of loans currently serviced and committed for purchase by the Company was $5.6 billion at December 31, 2001 versus $4.5 billion at December 31, 2000. The following table summarizes the activity in the Companys managed portfolio of student loans for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999.

(2,436) (1,170) (1,158) ENDING BALANCE................................... $71,726 $67,515 $53,276 LEVERAGED LEASES The Company has investments in leveraged leases totaling $296 million and $291 million as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, of which $282 million and $276 million as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, represent general obligations of major U.S. commercial airlines. The airline industry has been in a state of uncertainty since the events of September 11, 2001. All payment obligations remain current and the Company has not been notified of any counterpartys intention to default on any payment obligations. In the event of default, any potential loss would be partially 34 mitigated by recoveries on the sale of the aircraft collateral and elimination of expected tax liabilities reflected in the balance sheet of $259 million and $263 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Any potential loss would be increased by incremental tax obligations related to forgiveness of debt obligations. PRO FORMA STATEMENTS OF INCOME Under GAAP, the Companys securitization transactions have been treated as sales. At the time of sale, in accordance with SFAS 140, the Company records a gain which approximates the present value of the estimated future net cash flows from the portfolios of loans sold. Interest earned on the residual interest and fees earned for servicing the loan portfolios are recognized over the life of the securitization transaction as servicing and securitization revenue. Income recognition is effectively accelerated through the recognition of a gain at the time of sale while the ultimate realization of such income remains dependent on the actual performance, over time, of the loans that were securitized. Most of the derivative contracts into which the Company enters are effective economic hedges for its interest rate risk management strategy but are not effective hedges under SFAS 133 because they do not typically extend to the full term of the hedged item. The majority of these hedges are treated as "trading" for GAAP purposes and therefore the resulting mark to market is taken into GAAP earnings. In addition, SFAS 133 requires that the Company mark to market its written options but none of its embedded options in its student loan assets. Effectively, in this case, SFAS 133 recognizes the liability but not the corresponding asset. Management believes that, in addition to results of operations as reported in accordance with GAAP, another important performance measure is pro forma results of operations under the assumptions that the securitization transactions are financings and that the securitized student loans were not sold. In addition, the effects of SFAS 133 are excluded from the pro forma results of operations and the economic hedge effects of derivative instruments are recognized. The pro forma results of operations also exclude the benefit of floor income, certain gains and losses on sales of investment securities and student loans, a one time integration charge related to the July 2000 acquisition of USA Group and the amortization and changes in market value of goodwill and intangible assets. The following pro forma statements of income present the Companys results of operations under these assumptions. Management refers to these pro forma results as "core cash basis" statements of income. Management monitors the periodic "core cash basis" earnings of the Companys managed student loan portfolio and believes that they assist in a better understanding of the Companys student loan business. The following table presents the "core cash basis" statements of income and reconciliations to GAAP net income as reflected in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income. 35 YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 2000 1999 "CORE CASH BASIS" STATEMENTS OF INCOME: Insured student loans............................. $ 4,325 $ 5,015 $ 3,642 Advances/Facilities/Investments................... 468 652 386 Total interest income............................. 4,793 5,667 4,028 Interest expense..................................

The SFAS 133 items include the reversal of a $452 million net, mark to market loss on derivative positions offset by the reversal of a loss of $3 million attributable to the amortization of derivative items included in other comprehensive income at transition. The "core cash basis" adjustment for derivatives includes an $89 million gain representing the amortization of premiums on floor and cap hedges, the reversal of a $13 million net loss representing the amortization of floor revenue contracts de designated as effective hedges on December 31, 2000, and the reversal of a $13 million net loss on Eurodollar futures contracts. These adjustments are based upon the guidance for derivative accounting prior to SFAS 133. (2) Such tax effect is based upon the Companys marginal tax rate for the respective period. "CORE CASH BASIS" SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA The following table presents the "core cash basis" selected financial and other operating information of the Company. 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 "CORE CASH BASIS" RESULTS: Net interest income............................ $ 1,271 $ 1,039 $ 927 $ 892 $ 937 Net income..................................... 624 492 405 381 384 Diluted earnings per common share.............. 3.75 2.93 2.48 2.24 2.10 Net interest margin............................ 1.64% 1.53% 1.68% 1.76% 1.75% Return on assets............................... .79 .71 .71 .72 .70 37 "CORE CASH BASIS" STUDENT LOAN SPREAD AND NET INTEREST INCOME The following table analyzes the reported earnings from the Companys portfolio of managed student loans, which includes loans both on balance sheet and those off balance sheet in securitization trusts.

However, the amortization of the upfront payments received from the floor revenue contracts with fixed borrower rates is included as an addition to student loan income in the "core cash basis" results. For the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, the amortization of the upfront payments received from the floor revenue contracts with fixed borrower rates was $72 million, $23 million and $20 million, respectively. The 11 basis point increase in the 2001 "core cash basis" student loan spread versus 2000 was mainly due to the Company locking in floor revenue through term hedges and as a result of better funding spreads. In addition, the "core cash basis" student loan spread increased due to higher yields on the student loan portfolio from the mix (private loans versus federal loans) and a higher percentage of federal loans in a repayment status. In 2000, "core cash basis" financing spreads, relative to the Treasury bill, increased by 6 basis points versus 1999. This was due to wider financing spreads in both the GSE and securitization debt markets and to the higher percentage of the student loan portfolio being funded by the Companys asset backed securities. The Companys asset backed securities have a higher cost of funds than the Companys GSE debt because they are term match funded and do not benefit from the GSEs status. The higher funding costs on the Companys asset backed securities is partially mitigated by the absence of offset fees on securitized loans. The net effect of increased funding costs and lower offset fees in 2000 versus 1999 was 5 basis points. In 2001, net interest income, on a "core cash basis," was $1.3 billion compared with $1.0 billion in 2000 and $927 million in 1999. The increase in net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2001 versus the year ago period was due to the increase in the average balance of managed student loans of $10.3 billion and the increase in the student loan spread. The increase in net interest income in 2000 over 1999 is mainly due to the increase in the average balance of managed student loans. 38 "CORE CASH BASIS" PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES The provision for loan losses represents the periodic expense of maintaining an allowance sufficient to absorb losses, net of recoveries, inherent in the managed portfolio of student loans. The Company evaluates the adequacy of the provision for losses on its federally insured portfolio of managed student loans separately from its non federally insured portfolio. For the federally insured portfolio, the Company primarily considers trends in student loan claims rejected for payment by guarantors due to servicing defects as well as overall default rates on those FFELP student loans subject to the two percent risk sharing. Once a student loan is rejected for claim payment, the Companys policy is to continue to pursue the recovery of principal and interest. Due to the guaranteed nature of the FFELP assets and the extensive collection efforts in which the Company engages, the Company currently writes off an unpaid claim once it has aged to two years. For the non federally insured portfolio of student loans, the Company primarily considers recent trends in delinquencies, charge offs and recoveries, historical trends in loan volume by program, economic conditions and credit and underwriting policies. A large percentage of the Companys non federally insured loans have not matured to a point at which predictable loan loss patterns have developed. Accordingly, the evaluation of the provision for loan losses is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant changes. Management believes that the provision for loan losses is adequate to cover anticipated losses in the student loan portfolio. An analysis of the Companys allowance for loan losses is presented in the following table. "CORE CASH BASIS" ACTIVITY IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 2000 1999 Balance at beginning of year................................ $ 335 $ 260 $ 237 Provision for loan losses................................... 98 51 51 Reserves acquired in acquisition............................ 23 9 Other....................................................... 35 27 3 Charge offs: Non federally insured loans.............................

The 2000 "core cash basis" provision for loan losses includes $6 million for potential loan losses on the non federally insured student loans and $45 million for potential loan losses due to risk sharing and other claims on FFELP loans. The 1999 "core cash basis" provision includes $12 million for potential loan losses on the non federally insured portfolio and $39 million for potential loan losses due to risk sharing and other claims on FFELP loans. The provision and allowance for loan losses presented on a "core cash basis" are directly tied to the activity presented for the Companys on balance sheet student loan portfolio. The increased volume and aging of the Companys non federally insured student loans and managements estimates as to their effects on the allowance for loan losses were the primary causes for the increase in the provision for loan losses of $47 million in 2001 versus 2000. This increased volume and aging also contributed to the $31 million increase in write offs in 2001 versus 2000. DELINQUENCIES NON FEDERALLY INSURED STUDENT LOANS The following table shows the loan delinquency trends for the years presented on the Companys non federally insured student loan portfolio.

For the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, "core cash basis" other income was $455 million, $281 million, and $84 million, respectively. "Core cash basis" other income mainly includes guarantor servicing fees, late fees earned on student loans, fees received from servicing third party portfolios of student loans, and commitment fees for letters of credit. The increase in "core cash basis" other income for 2001 versus 2000 and 1999 is principally due to fee income attributable to the acquisition of USA Group in July 2000. Guarantor servicing fees, late fees, third party servicing fees, and commitment fees for letters of credit contributed $255 million, $56 million, $53 million, and $11 million, respectively, to "core cash basis" other income during the year ended December 31, 2001, versus $128 million, $42 million, $39 million, and $16 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2000. For the year ended December 31, 1999, "core cash basis" other income included $38 million in late fees, $5 million in third party servicing fees, and $19 million in commitment fees for letters of credit. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recognized an $18 million loss on the impairment of assets generated from the scheduled sale of its Sallie Mae Solutions product line. This loss has been excluded from "core cash basis" other income. FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES The Companys overall effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 is 36 percent, 33 percent and 32 percent, respectively. The Company maintains a portfolio of tax advantaged assets principally to support education related financing activities. That portfolio was responsible for a decrease in the effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 of two percent, two percent, and three percent, respectively. The GSE is exempt from all state, local and District of Columbia income, franchise, sales and use, personal property and other taxes, except for real property taxes. However, this tax exemption applies only to the GSE and does not apply to USA Education, Inc. or its other operating subsidiaries. Under the Privatization Act, the Companys GSE and non GSE activities are separated, with non GSE activities being subject to taxation at the state and local levels. State taxes for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 increased the Companys effective tax rate by three percent, two percent and one percent, respectively. As increasing business activity occurs outside of the GSE, the impact of state and local taxes will increase accordingly. Ultimately all business activities will occur outside of the GSE, which could increase the Companys effective income tax rate by as much as five percentage points from the 1999 effective tax rate. The loss of the GSE tax exemption for sales and use and personal property taxes could increase operating costs by one percentage point. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES GENERAL The Companys primary requirements for capital are to fund the Companys operations, to purchase student loans and to repay its debt obligations while continuing to meet the GSEs statutory capital adequacy ratio test. The Companys primary sources of liquidity are through debt issuances by the GSE, off balance sheet financings through securitizations, borrowings under its commercial paper and medium term notes programs, other senior note issuances by the Company, and cash generated by 41 its subsidiaries operations and distributed through dividends to the Company. The Companys borrowings are broken down as follows: YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 2000 1999 AVERAGE AVERAGE AVERAGE AVERAGE AVERAGE AVERAGE BALANCE RATE BALANCE RATE BALANCE RATE GSE........................................... $47,877 4.27% $43,325 6.45% $39,274 5.35% Company....................................... 1,822 4.45 641 6.94 222 5.85 Securitizations (off balance sheet)........... 30,489 4.58 25,705 6.97 17,751 5.56 Total......................................... $80,188 4.39% $69,671 6.64% $57,247 5.42% GSE FINANCING ACTIVITIES The GSE secures financing to fund its on balance sheet portfolio of student loans, along with its other operations, by issuing debt securities in the domestic and overseas capital markets, through public offerings and private placements of U.S. dollar denominated and foreign currency denominated debt of varying maturities and interest rate characteristics. The GSEs debt securities are currently rated at the highest credit rating level by both Moodys and S&P. Historically, the agencies ratings of the GSE have been largely a factor of its status as a government sponsored enterprise. Since the Privatization Act did not modify the attributes of debt issued by the GSE, management anticipates that the GSE will retain its current credit ratings. The GSEs unsecured financing requirements are driven by three principal factors: refinancing of existing liabilities as they mature; financing of student loan portfolio growth; and the level of securitization activity. SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES In addition to the GSE debt, student loan securitization has been an important source of funding for the Companys managed student loan portfolio since 1995. As student loans are securitized and are removed from the balance sheet, the need for long term financing decreases. Over the long term, securitization is expected to provide the principal source of long term funding for the Companys managed portfolio of student loans. Management believes that securitizations represent an efficient source of funding. The Companys asset backed securities generally have a higher cost of funds than its traditional on balance sheet financing because the asset backed securities are term match funded and do not benefit from the GSEs status. However, the increased funding costs of the asset backed securities are mitigated by the absence of the offset fees on securitized loans. Securitization also allows the Company to obtain term financing at a lower cost than otherwise would be achievable without the GSEs government sponsored status. Securitizations to date have been structured to achieve an "AAA" credit rating on over 96 percent of its securities sold (with an "A" credit rating on the remaining subordinated securities). In 2001, the Company completed four securitization transactions totaling $6.0 billion in student loans and an additional $435 million through the recycling provisions of certain securitizations. In both late 1998 and early 1999, the Russian bond default in August 1998 caused financing spreads on potential Treasury bill indexed securitization transactions to be wider and thus more costly than previous years transactions. As a result, the Company did not enter into a securitization transaction from September 1998 through May of 1999. Financial market conditions did improve to a point at which it was economical to securitize student loans, and in the second quarter of 1999, the Company reentered the asset backed securities market by completing a $1.0 billion securitization. In 1999, the Company completed three securitization transactions totaling $4.0 billion in student loans. 42 During 1999, demand for Treasury bill securities remained high causing Treasury bill rates to remain low relative to other market indices. As a consequence, the Company issued $3.8 billion in LIBOR based asset backed securities, the first issuances indexed to LIBOR in the history of the program. The Companys 2000 and 2001 securitization transactions continue to be indexed to LIBOR. The Company is managing this off balance sheet basis risk through on balance sheet financing activities, principally through basis swaps. COMPANY FINANCING ACTIVITIES In order to finance non GSE activities and in preparation for the eventual wind down of the GSE, USA Education is developing additional financing vehicles. While continued use of the securitization market will be the core of the Companys financing strategy, these efforts will be supplemented by commercial paper, asset backed commercial paper, bank lines of credit, underwritten long term debt, and a medium term note program. In the third quarter of 1999, the Company received credit ratings that will facilitate its access to the private funding markets: short term debt ratings of A 1, F1+ and P 1, and long term senior unsecured debt ratings of A, A+ and A3 were issued by S&P, Moodys and Fitch IBCA, Inc., respectively. Upon receiving its initial credit ratings, the Company initiated its commercial paper program. Effective October 26, 2001, the Company renewed its $600 million 364 day revolving credit facility for an additional 364 day period. Liquidity support for the Companys commercial paper program is provided by this $600 million 364 day revolving credit facility which matures on October 25, 2002, and a $400 million 5 year revolving credit facility which matures on October 29, 2004. On October 3, 2000, the Company issued $500 million of its Senior Notes due September 16, 2002. During 2001, the Company issued an additional $1.6 billion of long term notes under its medium term note program and other senior note offerings. During 2001, the Company used the proceeds from student loan securitizations of $6.5 billion, repayments and claim payments on student loans of $3.5 billion, net proceeds from debt issuances of $3.0 billion, and the net proceeds from sales of student loans to purchase student loans of $13.5 billion. Operating activities provided net cash inflows of $839 million in 2001, an increase of $94 million from the net cash inflows of $745 million in 2000. During 2001, the Company issued $19.6 billion of long term notes to refund maturing and repurchased obligations. At December 31, 2001, the Company had $17.3 billion of outstanding long term debt issues of which $2.5 billion had stated maturities that could be accelerated through call provisions. The Company uses interest rate and foreign currency swaps (collateralized where appropriate), purchases of U.S. Treasury securities and other hedging techniques to reduce its exposure to interest rate and currency fluctuations that arise from its financing activities and to match the variable interest rate characteristics of its earning assets. (See "Interest Rate Risk Management.") GSE WIND DOWN Until the GSE is dissolved, the Privatization Act places a number of limitations on the Company. Under the Privatization Act, the GSE must wind down its operations and dissolve on or before September 30, 2008. The Company has the option of effecting an earlier dissolution of the GSE if certain conditions are met. On January 23, 2002, the GSEs board of directors approved managements plans to accelerate the wind down of the entity by at least two years, with a view to effecting dissolution of the GSE no later than September 30, 2006. Any GSE debt obligations outstanding at the date of such dissolution are required to be defeased through creation of a fully collateralized trust, consisting of U.S. government or agency obligations with cash flows matching the interest and principal obligations of the defeased debt. The Privatization Act requires that on the dissolution date, the GSE shall repurchase or redeem, or make proper provisions for repurchase or redemption of any 43 outstanding preferred stock. The GSE redeemed its Series A Adjustable Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, its only outstanding preferred stock, in the fourth quarter of 2001. Also upon the GSEs dissolution, all of its remaining assets will transfer to the Company. The Privatization Act effectively requires that the GSE maintain a minimum statutory capital adequacy ratio (the ratio of stockholders equity to total assets plus 50 percent of the credit equivalent amount of certain off balance sheet items) of at least 2.25 percent or be subject to certain "safety and soundness" requirements designed to restore such statutory ratio. While the GSE may not finance the activities of its non GSE affiliates, it may, subject to its minimum capital requirements, dividend retained earnings and surplus capital to USA Education, Inc., which in turn may contribute such amounts to its non GSE subsidiaries. The Privatization Act requires management to certify to the Secretary of the Treasury that, after giving effect to the payment of dividends, the statutory capital ratio test would have been met at the time the dividend was declared. At December 31, 2001, the GSEs statutory capital adequacy ratio, after the effect of the dividends to be paid in the first quarter of 2002, was 2.95 percent. The GSE has also received guidance from the U.S. Department of Treasurys Office of Sallie Mae Oversight regarding safety and soundness considerations affecting its wind down. As a result, in connection with any dividend declarations, the GSE will supplement the statutory minimum capital ratio requirement with a risk based capital measurement formula. Management does not expect the capital levels of the Companys consolidated balance sheet to change as a result of this supplemental formula. The Privatization Act imposes certain restrictions on intercompany relations between the GSE and its affiliates during the wind down period. In particular, the GSE must not extend credit to, nor guarantee, any debt obligations of USA Education, Inc. or its non GSE subsidiaries. The Privatization Act provides that the GSE may continue to issue new debt obligations maturing on or before September 30, 2008. The legislation further provides that the legal status and attributes of the GSEs debt obligations, including the exemptions from SEC registration and state taxes, will be fully preserved until their respective maturities. Such debt obligations will remain GSE debt obligations, whether such obligations were outstanding at the time of, or issued subsequent to, the Reorganization. The obligations of USA Education, Inc. do not have GSE status. INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT INTEREST RATE GAP ANALYSIS The Companys principal objective in financing its operations is to minimize its sensitivity to changing interest rates by matching the interest rate characteristics of its borrowings to specific assets in order to lock in spreads. The Company funds its floating rate managed loan assets (most of which have weekly rate resets) with variable rate debt and fixed rate debt converted to variable rates with interest rate swaps. The Company also uses interest rate cap agreements, foreign currency swaps, options on securities, and financial futures contracts to further reduce interest rate risk and foreign currency exposure on certain of its borrowings. Investments are funded on a "pooled" approach, i.e., the pool of liabilities that funds the investment portfolio has an average rate and maturity or reset date that corresponds to the average rate and maturity or reset date of the investments which they fund. In addition to term match funding at December 31, 2001, $13.4 billion of the Companys asset backed securities match the interest rate characteristics of the majority of the student loans in the trusts by being indexed to the 91 day Treasury bill. At December 31, 2001, there were approximately $2.9 billion of PLUS student loans outstanding in the trusts, which have interest rates that reset annually based on the final auction of 52 week Treasury bills before each July 1. In addition, at December 31, 2001, there were approximately $19.8 billion of asset backed securities indexed to 44 LIBOR. In its securitization transactions, the Company retains this basis risk and manages it within the trusts through its on balance sheet financing and hedging activities. The effect of this basis risk management is included in the following table as the impact of securitized student loans. In the table below the Companys variable rate assets and liabilities are categorized by reset date of the underlying index. Fixed rate assets and liabilities are categorized based on their maturity dates. An interest rate gap is the difference between volumes of assets and volumes of liabilities maturing or repricing during specific future time intervals. The following gap analysis reflects rate sensitive positions at December 31, 2001 and is not necessarily reflective of positions that existed throughout the period.

(.4)% (9.5)% (9.0)% (9.3)% (1.3)% % INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS While the Company follows a policy to minimize its sensitivity to changing interest rates by generally funding its floating rate student loan portfolio with floating rate debt, in low interest rate environments, the student loan portfolio earns at a minimum fixed interest rate. During 2001, the Company was in a low interest environment where the student loans were earning at a fixed minimum rate, while the funding costs for these loans continued to decrease. The Company chose to lock in a portion of the income associated with this mismatch through the use of futures and swap contracts. The result of these hedging transactions was to convert a portion of 45 floating rate debt into fixed rate debt, matching the fixed rate nature of the student loans during the low interest rate environment. Therefore, in certain low interest rate environments, the relative spread between the student loan asset rate and the converted fixed rate liability is fixed. If interest rates rise dramatically, then rates earned on the student loan asset will reach a point where it will become floating again. For those student loans where the fixed loan rate (in low interest rate environments) was economically hedged by fixed rate funding (through the use of derivatives), a higher spread will be earned in a high interest rate environment. The impact of the dramatic increase in rates on the hedging positions described above resulted in an approximate $260 million increase to earnings in the scenario in which interest rates are increased by 300 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2001. The positions were not effective in the year 2000. The effect of short term movements in interest rates on the Companys results of operations and financial position has been limited through the Companys risk management activities. The following tables summarize the effect on earnings for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 and the effect on fair values at December 31, 2001 and 2000 based upon a sensitivity analysis performed by the Company assuming a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of 100 basis points and 300 basis points while funding spreads remained constant. The Company has chosen to show the effects of a hypothetical increase to interest rates, as an increase gives rise to a larger absolute value change to the financial statements. The effect on earnings was performed on the Companys variable rate assets, liabilities, and hedging instruments while the effect on fair values was performed on the Companys fixed rate assets, liabilities, and hedging instruments.

If the Company had to refinance these obligations at a higher funding spread of five basis points, the annualized increase to interest expense would be $19 million and $21 million, respectively. If the Company had to refinance total outstanding liabilities at December 31, 2001 and 2000, the annualized increase to interest expense would be $24 million and $23 million, respectively.

As student loans are securitized, the need for long term on balance sheet financing will decrease. COMMON STOCK The Company repurchased 19.4 million common shares during 2001 through its open market purchases and equity forward settlements. The Company also issued a net 10.7 million shares from its benefit plans. The net result was a decrease in outstanding shares to 155.5 million at December 31, 2001. At December 31, 2001, the total common shares that could potentially be acquired over the next three years under outstanding equity forward contracts was 11.2 million shares, and the Company has remaining authority to enter into additional share repurchases and equity forward contracts for 2.3 million shares. The Companys equity forward contracts permit the counterparty to terminate the contracts prior to their maturity date based on several factors including a significant drop in the Companys common stock price or a significant decrease in the credit ratings of the Company and or the GSE (see Note 15 in the "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements"). In addition, the Company has negotiated with each of its equity forward counterparties a limit on the total number of shares that the Company can be required to deliver to the counterparty in settlement of the transactions. As of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, the aggregate maximum number of shares that the Company could be required to deliver was 67.2 million and 55.9 million shares, respectively. 47 YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 2000 Common shares repurchased: Open market............................................ 2.7 2.1 Equity forwards........................................ 16.7 4.9 Total shares repurchased................................. 19.4 7.0 Average purchase price per share......................... $44.32 $44.26 Equity forward contracts: Outstanding at beginning of year......................... 18.2 21.4 New contracts............................................ 9.7 1.7 Exercises................................................

The act also provides that borrower rates will remain indexed to the 91 day Treasury bill until July 1, 2006 and that loans made on or after July 1, 2006 will have a fixed rate for borrowers: 6.8% for Stafford loans and 7.9% for PLUS loans.
