Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Years ended December 31, 2000 2002 (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) OVERVIEW The Company is the largest private source of funding, delivery and servicing support for education loans in the United States primarily through its participation in the Federal Family Education Loan Program ("FFELP"). The Company provides a wide range of financial services, processing capabilities and information technology to meet the needs of educational institutions, lenders, students and their families, and guarantee agencies. The Companys primary business is to originate and hold student loans, but the Company also provides fee based student loan related products and services and earns servicing fees for student loan servicing and guarantee processing, and student loan default management and loan collections. SLM Corporation is a holding company that operates through a number of subsidiaries including Student Loan Marketing Association, a federally chartered government sponsored enterprise (the "GSE"). References herein to the "Company" refer to SLM Corporation and its subsidiaries. Our results can be materially affected by changes in: Applicable laws and regulations, which may change the volume, average term and effective yields of student loans under the FFELP or result in loans being originated or refinanced under non FFELP programs or may affect the terms upon which banks and others agree to sell FFELP loans to the Company; The demand for education financing; The competition for education financing; The financing preferences of students and their families; The general interest rate environment and credit spreads; The funding spreads on our non GSE financing activities; Prepayment rates on student loans, including prepayments through loan consolidation; The securitization market for fixed income securities backed by education loans, either by increasing the costs or limiting the availability of financing; and Borrower default rates. The majority of our student loan purchases and on balance sheet financing of student loans occurs in the GSE. We finance such purchases through the issuance of GSE debt obligations and through student loan securitizations. In a securitization, we sell student loans from the GSE to a trust that issues bonds backed by the student loans as part of the transaction. Once securitized, the GSE no longer owns the student loans and the bonds issued by the trust are not obligations of the GSE. In 1997, we transferred all personnel and certain assets of the GSE to the Company or other non GSE affiliates and, as a consequence, the operations of the GSE are managed by us through a management services agreement. We will continue to transfer the GSEs assets throughout the Wind Down Period. We also service the majority of the GSEs student loans under a servicing agreement between the GSE and Sallie Mae Servicing, LP. All student loans that we originate on our behalf are owned by non GSE subsidiaries of the Company from inception. 13 We have provided the discussion of the GSE within the context of this MD&A because a substantial portion of the Companys operations is conducted through the GSE. MD&A disclosures applicable solely to the GSE are included at the end of this MD&A in the section titled "Student Loan Marketing Association." The discussion that follows regarding our interest income and expenses from on balance sheet assets and liabilities is applicable to both the Company and the GSE. Likewise, because all of our FFELP securitizations to date have originated from the GSE, the discussion of the securitization gains and securitization revenue is applicable to both the Company and the GSE. On the other hand, the discussions of our off balance sheet loans, our fee based businesses, and our operations on a Managed Basis, as well as the discussions set forth below under the headings, "Selected Financial Data," "Other Income," "Federal and State Taxes" and "Alternative Performance Measures" do not address the GSE and relate to the Company on a consolidated basis. As of December 31, 2002, 85 percent of the Companys consolidated on balance sheet assets were held by the GSE, and 93 percent of the Companys interest income was derived from assets held by and financed by the GSE. In addition, 50 percent of our private credit student loans were held by non GSE affiliates. For the year ended December 31, 2002, 78 percent of our fee income was generated by non GSE fee based businesses. The GSE has no employees, so the management of its operations is provided by a non GSE subsidiary of the Company under a management services agreement. During the year, the GSE transferred $3.4 billion in private credit student loans in a series of transactions to a non GSE subsidiary of the Company and recognized gains of $165 million. All intercompany transactions between the GSE and the Company and its non GSE subsidiaries have been eliminated in the Companys consolidated financial statements. Financial Highlights for 2002 Listed below are some of the additional performance measures that management uses to assess the business. Years ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Diluted earnings per share $ 4.93 $ 2.28 $ 2.76 Student loan spread 2.40 % 2.01 % 1.82 % Net interest margin 2.08 % 1.82 % 1.52 % Servicing and securitization revenue $ 629 $ 634 $ 296 Gains on student loan securitizations 338 75 92 Derivative market value adjustment (204 ) (452 ) Fee and other income 513 439 282 Gains (losses) on sales of securities (255 ) (178 ) 19 Operating expenses 690 708 586 Managed student loan acquisitions 16,525 14,426 21,294 Preferred Channel originations 11,870 10,093 7,321 Loans securitized 13,670 6,439 8,736 Ending on balance sheet student loans 42,339 41,001 37,647 Ending off balance sheet student loans 35,785 30,725 29,868 Managed student loans 78,124 71,726 67,515 Managed Basis student loan spread 1.88 % 1.81 % 1.70 % The main drivers of our earnings are: the growth in the Managed portfolio of student loans; the student loan spread including the effect of Floor Income; 14 the number, size and mix of student loans in securitizations, which influence the level of securitization gains; cost effective financing; servicing and securitization revenue; the derivative market value adjustment; guarantor servicing fees, default management operations and collections services and other fee income; and loan servicing, acquisition, and operating expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2002, our net income was $792 million ($4.93 diluted earnings per share), versus net income of $384 million ($2.28 diluted earnings per share) in 2001. The $408 million or 106 percent increase in net income can mainly be attributed to higher average balances in Managed student loans, securitization gains, the after tax $161 million reduction in the loss on the derivative market value adjustment, and the $65 million after tax increase in Floor Income. The growth in our Managed student loans benefits net income through the spread earned by student loans on balance sheet, by gains on securitizing such loans, and by the residual cash flows earned as servicing and securitization revenue from the securitized student loans. The growth in our Managed student loan portfolio is therefore an important driver of future earnings. For 2002, our Managed student loan portfolio grew by $6.4 billion from $71.7 billion at December 31, 2001 to $78.1 billion at December 31, 2002. This growth in the student loan portfolio was fueled by the $16.5 billion in new Managed student loans acquired in 2002, a 15 percent increase over the $14.4 billion acquired in 2001. In 2002, we originated $11.9 billion of student loans through our Preferred Channel, an increase of 18 percent over the $10.1 billion originated in 2001. The Managed student loan spread which measures the spread earned on our portfolio of Managed student loans is an important driver of net income, and for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Managed student loan spread, exclusive of Floor Income, was 1.88 percent and 1.81 percent, respectively. The increase in the Managed student loan spread is attributable to the increase in the proportion of private credit student loans, partially offset by the increase in lower yielding Consolidation Loans. The spread also benefitted from our financing activities. On a Managed Basis, in 2002, we earned $474 million of Floor Income, net of payments under Floor Income Contracts, an increase of $139 million or 41 percent over 2001. This increase was largely driven by lower average interest rates during the period. The $5 million decrease in servicing and securitization revenue for the year ended 2002 versus 2001 was mainly caused by the increase in the Constant Prepayment Rate ("CPR") assumption from 7 percent to 9 percent that was made in the second quarter of 2002 to reflect the impact of increased Consolidation Loan activity on student loans in the securitization trusts. Loans consolidated from the trusts are considered prepayments from the trusts perspective and shorten the average life of the trust. The shorter average life resulted in a $38 million other than temporary impairment of the Retained Interest asset that was recognized as a reduction to securitization revenue in the second quarter of 2002. This decrease was partially offset by the increase in revenue from the average balance of securitized loans and Floor Income earned on the securitized loan portfolio. Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (see "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Derivative Accounting"), some of our derivatives, primarily Floor Income Contracts and basis swaps, are not considered effective hedges because they do not extend to the full term of the hedged item and are therefore required to be valued at fair value while the hedged item is not. The losses from the 15 derivative market value adjustment are mainly due to declining interest rates and narrower spreads between LIBOR and Treasury bill indices, that caused the market value of the Floor Income Contracts and basis swaps to decrease. The losses on sales of securities are primarily due to losses from the early termination or expiration of Eurodollar futures that did not qualify for hedge treatment under SFAS No. 133. Included in the Eurodollar futures losses are losses incurred where we, in connection with our interest rate risk management and capital planning activities, terminated several hedges and subsequently replaced them with longer term and more economically advantageous hedges which will benefit earnings spreads in future periods. We continue to expand our fee based businesses, primarily guarantor servicing, debt management services, and loan servicing. During the first quarter of 2002, we acquired two debt management companies that added $69 million in fee revenue. In total, the debt management businesses generated gross revenue of $185 million in 2002, an increase of 53 percent from 2001. Guarantor servicing fees increased by 4 percent in 2002 versus 2001. We actively manage our operating expenses, which despite the acquisition of two debt management companies and the continued growth of the business, decreased to $690 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $708 million in 2001. The reduction in operating expenses that offset the increased costs from the new businesses and internal growth is mainly due to the realization of synergies from the USA Group acquisition and increased operating efficiencies. In 2002, we repurchased 7.3 million shares in connection with our common stock repurchase program. This was accomplished mainly through the settling of equity forward contracts. The share repurchases netted against the 4.4 million common share issuances related to benefit plans reduced common stock outstanding by 2.9 million shares. In recent years, the pace of our share repurchases has decelerated as we build capital in connection with the GSE Wind Down. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions. Note 2 of the "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. On an on going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, particularly as they relate to accounting policies that management believes are most "critical" that is, they are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These accounting policies include: securitization accounting, provision for loan losses, and derivative accounting. Securitization Accounting We regularly engage in securitization transactions as part of our financing strategy. In a securitization, we sell student loans to a trust that issues bonds backed by the student loans as part of the transaction. When our securitizations meet the sale criteria of SFAS No. 140, "Accounting for 16 Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities a Replacement of SFAS No. 125," we record a gain on the sale of the student loans. To meet the sale criteria of SFAS No. 140, we structure our securitizations using two step transactions with a qualifying special purpose entity ("QSPE") that legally isolates the transferred assets from the Company, even in the event of bankruptcy. Also, each transaction is structured to ensure that the holders of the beneficial interests issued by the QSPE are not constrained from pledging or exchanging their interests, and that the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets. All of our securitization structures through 2002 have been accomplished by issuing the loans in QSPEs; however, in January of 2003, we structured a securitization of Consolidation Loans such that the requirements of being a QSPE were not met, and the securitization vehicle was considered a variable interest entity and was accounted for on balance sheet. We calculate gains on our securitizations by taking the difference between the fair value of the assets sold and their carrying value. When determining the carrying value of the student loan portfolio being securitized, we must estimate the student loan premiums, loan loss reserves and borrower benefits that are applicable to the portfolio of student loans being securitized. The Retained Interests in each of our securitizations are treated as available for sale securities in accordance with SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," and therefore must be marked to market and unrealized gains and losses must be recognized, net of tax, in other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. Since there are no quoted market prices for our Retained Interests, we must estimate their fair value both initially and each subsequent quarter using the key assumptions listed below that are considered when estimating the securitization gain on the sale of student loans: The projected net interest yield from the underlying securitized loans; The calculation of the Embedded Floor Income associated with the securitized loan portfolio (see below); The compound rate of student loan prepayment referred to as the constant prepayment rate (or "CPR"); The discount rate used to calculate the Residual Interest commensurate with the risks involved; The projected average life or remaining term of the securitized loan portfolio; and The expected credit losses from the underlying securitized loan portfolio. The fair value of the Fixed Rate Embedded Floor Income earned on securitized loans is estimated for the life of the loan and included in the fair value of the Residual Interest at the time of the sale and each subsequent quarter. This estimate is based on a discounted cash flow calculation that considers the current borrower rate, SAP spreads and the term for which the loan is eligible to earn Floor Income as well as time value, yield curve and volatility factors. The Variable Rate Embedded Floor Income, which is earned until the July 1 reset date of the loans, is estimated and included in the quarterly mark to market valuations of the Residual Interest. The estimate of the CPR affects the estimate of the average life of the securitized trusts and therefore affects the valuation estimate of the Residual Interest. Prepayments shorten the average life of the trust, and if all other factors remain equal, will reduce the value of the Retained Interest asset and the securitization gain on sale. Student loan prepayments come from three principal sources: actual borrower prepayments, reimbursements of student loan defaults from the guarantor and consolidation of loans from the trust. We use historical statistics on prepayments, borrower defaults, and trends in Consolidation Loans to estimate the amount of prepayments. When a loan is consolidated from the trust either by us or a third party, the loan is repurchased from the trust and is treated as a 17 prepayment. In cases where the loan is consolidated by us, it will be recorded as an on balance sheet asset. Due to the historically low interest rate environment, we have experienced an increase in Consolidation Loan activity for several quarters. We believe that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future. As a result, in the second quarter of 2002, we increased the estimated CPR from 7 percent to 9 percent per annum. The change in the CPR assumption resulted in a $59 million after tax other than temporary impairment of the Retained Interest asset, of which $38 million ($25 million after tax) reduced securitization revenue in the second quarter of 2002, and $34 million was an after tax reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains in other comprehensive income as a component of equity. The change in the CPR assumption also reduced the gains on the loan portfolios securitized during the second, third and fourth quarters of 2002 relative to previous transactions. We record interest income and periodically evaluate our Retained Interests for other than temporary impairment in accordance with the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 99 20 "Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets." Under this standard, on a quarterly basis we estimate the cash flows to be received from our Retained Interests. In cases where our estimate of future cash flows is below our initial estimate when the asset is acquired, the Retained Interest is written down to fair value through earnings as an other than temporary impairment. Interest income is recorded using the effective interest method using the most current cash flows. We also receive income for servicing the loans in our securitization trusts. We assess the amounts received as compensation for these activities at inception and on an ongoing basis to determine if the amounts received are adequate compensation as defined in SFAS No. 140. To the extent such compensation is determined to be only adequate compensation, no servicing asset or obligation is recorded. Provision for Loan Losses The provision for loan losses represents the periodic expense of maintaining an allowance sufficient to absorb losses, net of recoveries, inherent in the portfolio of student loans. We evaluate the adequacy of the provision for losses on our federally insured portfolio of student loans separately from our non federally insured portfolio of private credit student loans. A large percentage of our private credit student loans have not matured to a point at which predictable loan loss patterns have developed, so to calculate the private credit student loan loss reserve, we must rely on a combination of our own historic data, such as recent trends in delinquencies, the credit profile of the borrower and or co signer, loan volume by program, and charge offs and recoveries. We use this data in internally developed statistical models to estimate the amount of losses, net of subsequent collections, that are projected to be incurred on the portfolio of private credit student loans. When calculating the private credit student loan loss reserve, we subdivide the portfolio into various categories such as loans with co borrowers, months into repayment, and type of program. We then estimate defaults by cohort (loans grouped by the year in which they entered into repayment status) based on the borrower(s) credit profile, net of an estimate of collections by cohort for both new and previously defaulted loans. Private credit student loans are charged off against the allowance when they are 212 days delinquent depending on the type of loan and historic patterns of losses. This policy is periodically reconsidered by management as trends develop. Private credit student loans continue to accrue interest until they are charged off and removed from the active portfolio. Recoveries on loans charged off are recorded directly to the reserve. The loan loss reserve attributable to federally insured loans consists of two components: the Risk Sharing reserve and a reserve for rejected guarantor claims losses, caused mainly by servicing defects. The Risk Sharing reserve is an estimate based on the amount of loans subject to Risk Sharing and on 18 the historical experience of losses. The rejected claims loss reserve is based on the historical trend of ultimate losses on loans initially rejected for reimbursement by the guarantor. Since FFELP loans are guaranteed as to both principal and interest, they continue to accrue interest until such time that they are paid by the guarantor. Once a student loan is rejected for claim payment, our policy is to continue to pursue the recovery of principal and interest, whether by curing the reject or collecting from the borrower. We attempt to cure the reject by engaging in extensive collection efforts including repeated and methodical mail and phone contact with borrowers and co borrowers. We have a history of successfully curing rejected claims within two years and, as a result, our policy is to charge off an unpaid claim once it has aged to two years Accordingly, the evaluation of the provision for loan losses is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant changes. Management believes that the provision for loan losses is adequate to cover probable losses in the student loan portfolio. Derivative Accounting We use interest rate swaps, interest rate futures contracts, interest rate cap contracts, and Floor Income Contracts as an integral part of our overall risk management strategy to manage interest rate risk arising from our fixed rate and floating rate financial instruments. We account for these instruments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," which requires that every derivative instrument, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability. We determine fair value for our derivative contracts using pricing models that consider current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments, as well as time value and yield curve or volatility factors underlying the positions. Pricing models and their underlying assumptions impact the amount and timing of unrealized gains and losses recognized; the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different financial results. Many of our derivatives, mainly standard interest rate swaps and certain interest rate futures contracts, qualify as effective hedges under SFAS No. 133. For these derivatives, we document the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged items, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions at the inception of the hedging relationship. We link each derivative to either a specific asset or liability on the balance sheet or expected future cash flows, and designate them as either fair value or cash flow hedges. Fair value hedges are designed to hedge our exposure to changes in fair value of a fixed rate asset or liability ("fair value" hedge), while cash flow hedges are desired to hedge our exposure to variability of either a floating rate assets or liabilitys cash flows or expected fixed rate debt issuance ("cash flow" hedge). For effective fair value hedges we mark to market both the hedge and the hedged item with any difference recorded immediately in the income statement. For effective cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the cash flow hedge are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of tax, and recognized in earnings in the same period as the earnings effects of the hedged item. The assessment of the hedges effectiveness is performed on an ongoing basis, and is tested on at least a quarterly basis. When it is determined that a derivative is not currently an effective hedge or it will not be one in the future, we discontinue the hedge accounting prospectively and cease recording changes in the fair value of the hedged item to market. We also have a number of derivatives, primarily Floor Income Contracts, certain Eurodollar futures contracts, interest rate caps and basis swaps, that we believe are effective economic hedges, but are not considered effective hedges under SFAS No. 133. They are considered ineffective under SFAS No. 133 because they are hedging only a portion of the term of the underlying risk or hedging an off balance sheet financial instrument for which the hedged risk is retained in our Residual Interest. These derivatives are classified as "trading" for GAAP purposes and as a result they are marked to market through GAAP earnings with no consideration for the price fluctuation of the hedged item. 19  SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA Condensed Statements of Income Increase (decrease) Years ended December 31, 2002 vs. 2001 2001 vs. 2000 2002 2001 2000 $ % $ % Net interest income $ 1,009 $ 873 $ 642 $ 136 16 % $ 231 36 % Less: provision for losses 117 66 32 51 77 34 105 Net interest income after provision for losses 892 807 610 85 11 197 32 Gains on student loan securitizations 338 75 92 263 349 (17 ) (18 ) Servicing and securitization revenue 629 634 296 (5 ) (1 ) 338 115 (Losses) gains on sales of securities, net (255 ) (178 ) 19 (77 ) (43 ) (197 ) (1,058 ) Derivative market value adjustment (204 ) (452 ) 248 55 (452 ) (100 ) Guarantor servicing and debt management fees 325 255 128 70 28 127 99 Other income 188 184 153 4 2 31 20 Operating expenses 690 708 586 (18 ) (3 ) 122 21 Income taxes 431 223 236 208 93 (13 ) (5 ) Minority interest in net earnings of subsidiary 10 11 (10 ) (100 ) (1 ) (6 ) Net income 792 384 465 408 106 (81 ) (17 ) Preferred stock dividends 12 12 12 Net income attributable to common stock $ 780 $ 372 $ 453 $ 408 110 % $ (81 ) (18 )% Basic earnings per share $ 5.06 $ 2.34 $ 2.84 $ 2.72 116 % $ (.50 ) (18 )% Diluted earnings per share $ 4.93 $ 2.28 $ 2.76 $ 2.65 116 % $ (.48 ) (17 )% Dividends per common share $ .85 $ .73 $ .66 $ .12 17 % $ .07 11 % Condensed Balance Sheets Increase (decrease) December 31, 2002 vs. 2001 2001 vs. 2000 2002 2001 $ % $ % Assets Federally insured student loans, net $ 37,168 $ 36,777 $ 391 1 % $ 2,496 7 % Private credit student loans, net 5,171 4,224 947 22 858 25 Academic facilities financings and other loans 1,202 1,998 (796 ) (40 ) (22 ) (1 ) Cash and investments 4,990 5,557 (567 ) (10 ) (202 ) (4 ) Retained Interest in securitized receivables 2,146 1,859 287 15 898 93 Goodwill and acquired intangible assets 586 566 20 4 (48 ) (8 ) Other assets 1,912 1,893 19 1 102 6 Total assets $ 53,175 $ 52,874 $ 301 1 % $ 4,082 8 % Liabilities and Stockholders Equity Short term borrowings $ 25,619 $ 31,065 $ (5,446 ) (18 )% $ 601 2 % Long term notes 22,242 17,285 4,957 29 2,374 16 Other liabilities 3,316 2,852 464 16 1,064 60 Total liabilities 51,177 51,202 (25 ) 4,039 9 Minority interest in subsidiary (214 ) (100 ) Stockholders equity before treasury stock 4,703 3,750 953 25 1,200 47 Common stock held in treasury at cost 2,705 2,078 627 30 943 83 Total stockholders equity 1,998 1,672 326 19 257 18 Total liabilities and stockholders equity $ 53,175 $ 52,874 $ 301 1 % $ 4,082 8 % 20 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NET INTEREST INCOME Net interest income is derived largely from our portfolio of student loans that remain on balance sheet. The "Taxable Equivalent Net Interest Income" analysis set forth below is designed to facilitate a comparison of non taxable asset yields to taxable yields on a similar basis. Additional information regarding the return on our student loan portfolio is set forth under "Student Loans Student Loan Spread Analysis." Information regarding the provision for losses is contained in Note 5 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements." Taxable equivalent net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2002 versus the year ended December 31, 2001 increased by $136 million while the net interest margin increased by 26 basis points. The increase in taxable equivalent net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2002 was primarily due to the lower interest rate environment in 2002, which led to an increase of $100 million in Floor Income (see "Student Loan Spread Analysis"), and the $3.1 billion increase in the average balance of student loans. The increase in the net interest margin reflects the higher average balance of student loans as a percentage of average total earning assets, the increased proportion of higher yielding private credit student loans and the increase in Floor Income. This increase was partially offset by the increase of lower yielding Consolidation Loans. Taxable equivalent net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2001 versus the year ended December 31, 2000 increased by $225 million while the net interest margin increased by 30 basis points. The increase in taxable equivalent net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2001 was primarily due to the lower interest rate environment in 2001 which led to an increase of $119 million in Floor Income. The net interest margin increase is reflective of the higher average balance of student loans as a percentage of average total earning assets and the increase in Floor Income. This is partially offset by the increase in our portfolio of lower yielding "in school" loans obtained through our Preferred Channel, which has decreased the average SAP in the student loan yield.

We account for premiums paid, discounts received and certain origination costs incurred on the acquisition of student loans in accordance with SFAS No. 91, 22 "Accounting for Nonrefundable Fees and Costs Associated with Originating or Acquiring Loans and Initial Direct Costs of Leases." The unamortized portion of the premiums and discounts are included in the carrying value of the student loan on the consolidated balance sheet. We recognize income on our student loan portfolio based on the expected yield of the student loan after giving effect to the amortization of purchase premiums and the accretion of student loan discounts including borrower incentive programs. When student loans are sold in a securitization, the unamortized premium or discount relating to such loans is allocated between the assets sold and the Retained Interest with the portion allocated to the assets sold included in the gain calculation (see "Securitization Program"). Origination fees charged on private credit student loans are deferred and in effect become a student loan discount, which is amortized to income over the lives of the student loans. In the table below, this amortization is netted with the amortization of the premiums. Student Loan Spread Analysis The following table analyzes the spread on student loans both on balance sheet and those off balance sheet in securitization trusts. For student loans on balance sheet, the amortization of premiums or discounts, the Consolidation Loan Rebate and Offset Fees, and yield adjustments from borrower benefit programs are netted against student loan interest income on the consolidated statements of income. For student loans off balance sheet, we earn interest on our Retained Interests in the trusts, Floor Income from securitized loans not recognized in the gain on sale calculation and servicing and administration fees for servicing the securitized student loan portfolios. These revenue streams added together constitute servicing and securitization revenue. (See "Securitization Program Servicing and Securitization Revenue.") Years ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 On Balance Sheet Student loan yields, before Floor Income 5.01 % 6.72 % 8.91 % Floor Income .47 .33 Consolidation Loan Rebate Fees (.40 ) (.30 ) (.27 ) Offset Fees (.10 ) (.13 ) (.13 ) Borrower benefits (.08 ) (.07 ) (.07 ) Premium and origination fee amortization (.19 ) (.23 ) (.20 ) Student loan net yield 4.71 6.32 8.24 Student loan cost of funds (2.31 ) (4.31 ) (6.42 ) Student loan spread 2.40 % 2.01 % 1.82 % Off Balance Sheet Servicing and securitization revenue, before Floor Income 1.21 % 1.39 % 1.14 % Floor Income on securitized loans .74 .68 .01 Servicing and securitization revenue 1.95 % 2.07 % 1.15 % Average Balances (in millions of dollars) On balance sheet student loans $ 43,082 $ 40,025 $ 34,637 Securitized student loans 32,280 30,594 25,711 Managed student loans $ 75,362 $ 70,619 $ 60,348 The student loan spread has increased in each of the last three years from 1.82 percent in 2000 to 2.40 percent in 2002. Exclusive of the effects of Floor Income, the student loan spread increased by 25 basis points in 2002 versus 2001. This increase was due to several factors. First, we have lowered our funding costs for on balance sheet loans through lower funding spreads and through the refinancing of some higher rate debt. Losses on such refinancings are included in losses on sales of securities in other 23 income. Second, the percentage of private credit student loans in the on balance sheet student loan portfolio increased to 12.2 percent in 2002, from 10.2 percent in 2001. These loans are subject to credit risk and therefore earn higher spreads which average 4.51 percent for the private credit student loan portfolio versus a spread of 1.93 percent for guaranteed student loans, before Floor Income. These positive effects are offset by the continued growth in our Consolidation Loans, which are lower yielding due mainly to Consolidation Loan Rebate Fees. The 19 basis point increase in the student loan spread from 2000 to 2001 is primarily due to higher Floor Income. Floor Income For on balance sheet student loans, Floor Income is included in student loan income. For off balance student loans, Fixed Rate Embedded Floor Income is estimated using a discounted cash flow of Floor Income and included in the Residual Interest. Variable Rate Embedded Floor Income, which by definition is earned in less than one year, is recognized as earned in servicing and securitization revenue. Due to the low average Treasury bill and commercial paper rates in 2002, we earned $219 million of Floor Income from on balance sheet student loans, net of payments under Floor Income Contracts (see "Student Loan Floor Income Contracts"), of which $104 million was Fixed Rate Floor Income and $115 million was Variable Rate Floor Income. In comparison, in 2001, we earned $119 million of Floor Income from on balance sheet student loans, net of payments under Floor Income Contracts, of which $43 million was Fixed Rate Floor Income and $76 million was Variable Rate Floor Income. Higher average interest rates in 2000 decreased our Floor Income from on balance sheet student loans, net of payments under Floor Income Contracts, to $3 million, of which $2 million was Fixed Rate Floor Income and $1 million was Variable Rate Floor Income. Student Loan Floor Income Contracts With the adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, the upfront payments from Floor Income Contracts are no longer amortized to student loan income, but are accounted for based on the change in their fair market value and reported as a component of the derivative market value adjustment in other liabilities. At December 31, 2002, the notional amount of Floor Income Contracts totaled $23.6 billion, of which $7.2 billion are contracts that commence in October 2004. The following table analyzes the ability of the FFELP student loans in our Managed portfolio of student loans to earn Floor Income at December 31, 2002 and 2001, based on current interest rates versus the last Treasury bill auctions applicable to those periods (1.21 percent in 2002 and 1.74 percent in 2001 for fixed and variable rate loans). Commercial paper rate loans are based upon the last commercial paper rate applicable to those periods (1.30 percent in 2002 and 1.81 percent in 2001). The table includes only Floor Income Contracts that are economically hedging Floor Income in the current period.

An analysis of our allowance for student loan losses is presented in the following table: Years ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Balance at beginning of year $ 252 $ 225 $ 203 Provision for student loan losses: Private credit loans 94 36 6 Federally insured loans 16 33 24 Total provision for student loan losses 110 69 30 Reserves acquired in acquisition 7 Other (30 ) 15 22 Charge offs: Private credit loans (76 ) (39 ) (11 ) Federally insured loans (9 ) (14 ) (14 ) Total charge offs (85 ) (53 ) (25 ) Recoveries: Private credit loans 9 3 1 Federally insured loans 2 7 4 Total recoveries 11 10 5 Net charge offs (74 ) (43 ) (20 ) Reduction for sale of student loans (27 ) (14 ) (17 ) Balance at end of year $ 231 $ 252 $ 225 Allocation of the allowance for student loan losses: Private credit loans $ 181 $ 194 $ 172 Federally insured loans 50 58 53 Total allowance for student loan losses $ 231 $ 252 $ 225 Net charge offs as a percentage of average student loans .17 % .11 % .06 % Total allowance as a percentage of average student loans .54 % .63 % .65 % Total allowance as a percentage of the ending balance of student loans .54 % .61 % .59 % Private credit allowance as a percentage of the ending balance of private credit student loans 3.38 % 4.38 % 5.37 % Average student loans $ 43,082 $ 40,025 $ 34,637 Ending balance of student loans $ 42,570 $ 41,253 $ 37,872 Ending balance of private credit student loans $ 5,352 $ 4,417 $ 3,194 For the year ended December 31, 2002, we increased the provision for loan losses on our private credit student loan portfolio by $58 million or 161 percent over the provision for the year ended December 31, 2001. This increase is attributable to a reclassification in 2002 related to a change in presentation for student loan discounts discussed below and to the 21 percent increase in volume of private credit student loans in 2002 versus 2001, and the continued aging of the portfolio. The Company periodically re evaluates the requirements for its provision for loan losses. For the year ended December 31, 2002, private credit student loan charge offs increased by $37 million over the year ago period, which is due primarily to the growth and aging of the private credit student loan portfolio and 25 to a $17 million charge off for fully reserved loans that related to prior periods. The decrease in the federally insured provision for student loans is mainly due to better than expected loss experience. The $39 million increase in the provision for loan losses from 2000 to 2001 was primarily due to the 39 percent increase in volume of private credit student loans year over year. In 2001, private credit loan charge offs increased by $28 million over 2000 which was primarily attributable to the increased volume and aging of this portfolio. We charge the borrower fees on private credit student loans, both at origination and when the loan enters repayment. Such fees are deferred and recognized into income as a component of interest over the average life of the related pool of loans. These fees are charged to compensate for anticipated loan losses and prior to 2002, we reflected the unamortized balance of these fees as a component of the allowance for loan losses. In the second quarter of 2002, we reclassified the unamortized balance of these fees from the allowance for loan losses to a student loan discount and this is reflected as "other" in the above table. The unamortized balance of deferred origination fee revenue at December 31, 2002 was $95 million. The table below shows the Companys private credit student loan delinquency trends for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. Delinquencies have the potential to adversely impact earnings through increased servicing and collection costs and account charge offs.

A small portion of our portfolio is also indexed to the 52 week Treasury bill or the constant maturity Treasury rate, and these are included in the Treasury bill balances in the table below. The following table summarizes the average balance of on balance sheet debt (by index, after giving effect to the impact of interest rate swaps) for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 (dollars in millions).

For each transaction we retain the right to receive the cash flows from the securitized student loans in excess of cash flows needed to pay interest and principal on the bonds issued by the trust and servicing and administration fees. We recognize a Retained Interest asset on balance sheet, which is the present value of these excess cash flows plus any reserve or cash accounts and a gain or loss on the securitization. The gain or loss is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the assets securitized and an allocation of their carrying value between the cash flows sold and those retained at the time of sale. The Retained Interests in each of our securitizations are accounted for as available for sale securities under SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," and must therefore be recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses must be recognized net of tax in other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. Since there are no quoted market prices for our Retained Interests, we must estimate their fair value both initially and each subsequent quarter using several key assumptions, as described in "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates," that primarily relate to the valuation of the Residual Interest. The balance of the Retained Interest was $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The average balance of the Retained Interest for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $1.7 billion, $1.4 billion and $826 million, respectively. In 2002, we sold $13.7 billion of student loans in nine securitization transactions and recorded pre tax securitization gains of $338 million or 2.47 percent of the portfolios securitized. In 2001, we sold $6.4 billion of student loans in four securitization transactions and recorded pre tax securitization gains of $75 million or 1.16 percent of the portfolios securitized. The increase in the gains as a percentage of loans securitized is mainly due to the securitization of Consolidation Loans which have 27 higher Fixed Rate Embedded Floor Income value and securitization of private credit student loans which have higher relative student loan spreads compared to FFELP loans previously securitized. In 2000, we sold $8.8 billion of student loans in four securitization transactions and acquired the securitization revenue streams of $5.2 billion of student loans previously securitized by USA Group. We recorded pre tax securitization gains of $92 million or 1.04 percent of the portfolios securitized. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, securitized student loans outstanding totaled $35.8 billion and $30.7 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, we held in our investment portfolio $1.1 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, of asset backed securities issued by our securitization trusts. We purchased these securities in the secondary market. Embedded Floor Income Included in the gain on student loan securitizations is an estimate of the Fixed Rate Embedded Floor Income from the loans securitized. Depending on interest rate levels, the ongoing estimate of Fixed Rate Embedded Floor Income can cause volatility in the fair value of the Retained Interest asset. The fair value of the Fixed Rate Embedded Floor Income included in the Retained Interest asset as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 was $629 million and $237 million, respectively. The fair value of the Variable Rate Embedded Floor Income included in the Retained Interest asset as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 was $75 million and $247 million, respectively. Servicing and Securitization Revenue Servicing and securitization revenue is the ongoing revenue from securitized loan pools, and includes both the revenue the Company receives for servicing loans in the securitization trusts and the income earned on the Residual Interest. The following table summarizes the components of servicing and securitization revenue: Years ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Servicing revenue $ 278 $ 266 $ 219 Securitization revenue, before Floor Income 112 158 74 Embedded Floor Income 239 210 3 Total servicing and securitization revenue $ 629 $ 634 $ 296 For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, servicing and securitization revenue was 1.95 percent, 2.07 percent and 1.15 percent, respectively, of average securitized loans. In response to higher Consolidation Loan activity, we increased the estimated CPR used to calculate the value of the Residual Interest and the gain or loss on sale of student loans from 7 percent to 9 percent per annum in the second quarter of 2002. The change in the CPR assumption resulted in a $59 million after tax other than temporary impairment of the Retained Interest asset, of which $38 million ($25 million after tax) reduced securitization revenue in the second quarter of 2002, and $34 million was an after tax reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains in other comprehensive income as a component of equity. The change in the CPR assumption also reduced the gains on the loan portfolios securitized during the second, third and fourth quarters of 2002 relative to previous transactions. The $338 million increase in servicing and securitization revenue from 2000 to 2001 was mainly due to lower average interest rates in 2001 which increased the amount of Embedded Floor Income by $207 million and to the increased volume of securitized loans. The increase in Embedded Floor Income earned in 2002 is primarily due to the increase in off balance sheet student loans and to lower average interest rates in 2002 versus 2001. For most of 28 2000, interest rates rose and, as a result, securitized student loans did not earn at the fixed borrower rate over the period, resulting in only a minimal amount of Embedded Floor Income. Gains/Losses on Sales of Securities, Net For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, we recognized losses on sales of securities of $255 million and $178 million, respectively. In connection with our interest rate risk management activities, we terminated or did not renew expired Eurodollar future contracts and recognized losses of $201 million and $94 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These contracts were economically hedging Floor Income, but were not considered effective hedges under SFAS No. 133. Consequently, the losses were recognized. Unrealized gains and losses on these contracts that were previously recorded through the derivative market value adjustment were reversed. Also in 2002 and 2001, we refinanced certain debt obligations with longer term debt obligations that had lower interest rates. In connection with these refinancings, we closed out certain derivatives that were matched with the refinanced debt or extinguished certain debt instruments prior to their maturity and recognized losses on sales of securities of $48 million and $67 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2000, we had a net gain on the sales of securities of $19 million which was primarily due to gains on the sale of investments of $43 million offsetting derivative losses of $25 million. Guarantor Servicing Fees, Debt Management Fees and Other Income The following table summarizes the components of other income for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000: Years ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Guarantor servicing and debt management fees: Guarantor servicing fees $ 140 $ 134 $ 63 Debt management fees 185 121 65 Total guarantor servicing and debt management fees $ 325 $ 255 $ 128 Other income: Late fees $ 56 $ 56 $ 42 Third party servicing fees 57 53 39 Other 75 75 72 Total other income $ 188 $ 184 $ 153 The $70 million increase in guarantor servicing and debt management fees from 2001 to 2002 is due to the $64 million increase in debt management fees, that is mainly the result of the acquisitions of GRC and PCR in January of 2002. The $127 million increase in guarantor servicing and debt management fees from 2000 to 2001 is mainly attributable to these services being acquired from the USA Group in July of 2000. Other income in 2001 includes an $18 million loss on the impairment of assets resulting from the sale of our Sallie Mae Solutions product line to Systems & Computer Technology Corporation that was completed in January 2002. The sale included our Exeter Student Suite&reg; and Perkins/Campus Loan Manager&reg; product lines and related operations based in Cambridge, MA. The sales agreement also included the sale of Sallie Mae Solutions India operations, which was completed on September 30, 2002. The total sale price was $19 million plus an earnout. The 2001 loss included a $22 million goodwill impairment. The net loss assumed no purchase price adjustment for potential earnouts. 29 EFFECTS OF SFAS NO. 133 DERIVATIVE ACCOUNTING SFAS No. 133 requires that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria as specified by SFAS No. 133 are met. We believe that our derivatives are effective economic hedges and they are a critical element of our interest rate risk management strategy. However, under SFAS No. 133, some of our derivatives, primarily basis swaps, Eurodollar futures contracts and Floor Income Contracts, are considered ineffective hedges because they hedge only a portion of the term of the underlying risk or are hedging an off balance sheet financial instrument. In these instances the derivatives are classified as "trading" securities and their stand alone fair value is recorded through the derivative market value adjustment. No consideration is made in the consolidated statements of income for the price fluctuation of the student loans or the Retained Interest that these derivatives are hedging. Floor Income Contracts are not considered effective hedges because the terms of the Floor Income Contracts are shorter than the average life of the student loans and or the Floor Income Contracts are hedging off balance sheet securitized student loans. We believe that the Floor Income Contracts effectively fix the amount of Floor Income the Company will earn over the contract period, thus eliminating the timing and uncertainty associated with Floor Income for that period. Basis swaps are used to convert the floating rate debt from one interest rate index to another to match the interest rate characteristics of the assets. We primarily use basis swaps to change the index of our LIBOR based debt, to better match the cash flows of our student loan assets. SFAS No. 133 requires that the change in the cash flows of the hedge effectively offset both the change in the cash flows of the asset and the change in the cash flows of the liability. Because student loans can earn at either a variable or a fixed interest rate depending on market interest rates or if the basis swap is economically hedging off balance sheet instruments, the SFAS No. 133 effectiveness test cannot be met. As a result, these swaps are recorded at fair value with subsequent changes in value reflected in the income statement. The table below quantifies the impact of SFAS No. 133 derivative accounting on our net income for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 when compared with the accounting principles employed in all years prior to the SFAS No. 133 implementation. Gains and losses on certain closed derivative positions that previously qualified as hedges were capitalized and amortized over the term of the hedged item. Under SFAS No. 133, these amounts are recorded immediately. Similarly, we previously accounted for Floor Income Contracts as hedges and amortized the upfront cash compensation ratably over the lives of the contracts. Under SFAS No. 133, the upfront payment is deemed a liability and changes in fair value are recorded through income throughout the life of the contract.

The decline in the value of Floor Income Contracts is caused by declining interest rates that cause the underlying student loans to earn additional Floor Income which is transferred to the counterparties. The decline in the market value of the Floor Income Contracts is economically offset by the increase in value of the student loan portfolio earning Floor Income, but that offsetting increase in value is not recognized under SFAS No. 133. OPERATING EXPENSES The following table summarizes the components of operating expenses: Years ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Servicing and acquisition expenses $ 419 $ 411 $ 320 General and administrative expenses 244 249 194 Goodwill and intangible amortization1 27 48 19 Integration charge 53 Total operating expenses $ 690 $ 708 $ 586 1No amortization of goodwill in 2002 Operating expenses include costs incurred to service our Managed student loan portfolio, to acquire student loans, to perform guarantor servicing and debt management operations, and general and administrative expenses. The increase in servicing and acquisition expenses for 2002 versus 2001 was due to operating expenses associated with the acquisitions of PCR and GRC in the first quarter of 2002. This increase was partially offset by operating expense synergies from acquisitions in prior years and productivity improvements. The decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 versus 2001 was principally due to productivity improvements in our operations and the sale of the student information software business. The $53 million integration charge that we recorded in 2000 related primarily to the acquisition of USA Group and covered severance costs, costs to close facilities and move functional responsibilities as well as costs to align system capabilities and consolidate our data center. Costs in 2000 were lower than the subsequent years which included the additional operating expenses from several acquisitions, most notably the acquisition of USA Group. FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES The Company is subject to federal and state taxes, while the GSE is exempt from all state, local and District of Columbia income, franchise, sales and use, personal property and other taxes, except for real property taxes. Our effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 was 35 percent, 36 percent and 33 percent, respectively. ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES In addition to evaluating our GAAP based data, management, credit rating agencies, lenders and analysts also evaluate us on certain non GAAP based performance measures, which we refer to as "core cash" measures. Under these non GAAP based performance measures, management analyzes the student loan portfolio on a Managed Basis and treats securitization transactions as financings versus sales. As such, the securitization gain on sale and subsequent servicing and securitization revenue is eliminated from income, and net interest income from securitized loans is recognized. These non GAAP based performance measures also eliminate the benefit of Floor Income and use pre SFAS No. 133 accounting for our derivative transactions, treating all of them as effective hedges. We also 31 exclude certain transactions that management does not consider part of our core business, such as: gains or losses on certain sales of securities and derivative contracts; changes in the market value and the amortization of goodwill and acquired intangible assets; and merger integration charges. For the years ended December 30, 2002, 2001 and 2000, the effect of these non GAAP performance measures on pre tax GAAP earnings are as follows: Years ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Non GAAP Performance Measures: Treatment of securitizations as financings versus sales $ 290 $ 84 $ 9 Floor Income on Managed loans 474 335 3 Net impact of derivative accounting (426 ) (570 ) (Losses) gains on sales of securities (155 ) (142 ) 18 Goodwill change in market value (18 ) Goodwill and intangible amortization (27 ) (48 ) (19 ) Merger integration charge (53 ) Total non GAAP performance measures $ 156 $ (359 ) $ (42 ) Management believes this information provides additional insight into the financial performance of the Companys core business activities. Student Loan Spread Analysis Managed Basis The following table analyzes the student loan spread, exclusive of Floor Income, from our portfolio of Managed student loans for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. Years ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Managed Basis student loan yields 4.94 % 6.77 % 8.92 % Consolidation Loan Rebate Fees (.26 ) (.20 ) (.18 ) Offset Fees (.06 ) (.07 ) (.08 ) Borrower benefits (.11 ) (.11 ) (.09 ) Premium and origination fee amortization (.25 ) (.26 ) (.26 ) Managed Basis student loan net yield 4.26 6.13 8.31 Managed Basis student loan cost of funds (2.38 ) (4.32 ) (6.61 ) Managed Basis student loan spread 1.88 % 1.81 % 1.70 % Average Balances (in millions of dollars) Managed student loans $ 75,362 $ 70,619 $ 60,348 The Managed Basis student loan spread combines both our on balance sheet and off balance sheet student loans. For 2002, the Managed Basis student loan spread increased by 7 basis points from 1.81 percent in 2001 to 1.88 percent in 2002. This was mainly due to the percentage of private credit student loans in the Managed student loan portfolio increasing to 6.9 percent in 2002, from 5.8 percent in 2001. These loans are subject to much higher credit risk than federally guaranteed student loans and therefore earn higher spreads, which for 2002, was 4.51 percent versus 1.49 percent for guaranteed student loans, before Floor Income. These positive effects are offset by the continued growth in our Consolidation Loans, which are lower yielding due mainly to Consolidation Loan Rebate Fees. The 2002 Managed Student loan spread also benefited from lower funding costs for on balance sheet loans achieved through the refinancing of some higher rate debt that was funding student loans. Losses on such refinancings are included in losses on sales of securities in other income. 32  Delinquencies Managed Basis The table below shows our private credit student loan delinquency trends for the last three years on a Managed Basis. Delinquencies have the potential to adversely impact earnings if the account charges off and results in increased servicing and collection costs. Years ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Index Balance % Balance % Balance % Loans in school/grace/deferment1 $ 2,289 $ 1,495 $ 906 Loans in forbearance2 423 327 218 Loans in repayment and percentage of each status: Loans current 3,074 93 % 2,348 90 % 1,744 84 % Loans delinquent 30 59 days3 107 3 105 4 211 10 Loans delinquent 60 89 days 45 2 47 2 37 2 Loans delinquent 90 days or greater 73 2 95 4 78 4 Total Managed loans in repayment 3,299 100 % 2,595 100 % 2,070 100 % Total Managed private credit student loans 6,011 4,417 3,194 Managed private credit student loan reserves (193 ) (194 ) (172 ) Managed private credit student loans, net $ 5,818 $ 4,223 $ 3,022 Percentage of Managed private credit student loans in repayment 55% 59% 65% 1Loans for borrowers who still may be attending school or engaging in other permitted educational activities and are not yet required to make payments on the loans, e.g., residency periods for medical students or a grace period for bar exam preparation. 2Loans for borrowers who have temporarily ceased making full payments due to hardship or other factors, according to a schedule approved by the servicer or HICA, or both, consistent with the established loan program servicing procedures and policies. 3The period of delinquency is based on the number of days scheduled payments are contractually past due and relate to repayment loans, that is, receivables not charged off, and not in school, grace, deferment or forbearance. 33 STUDENT LOAN ACQUISITIONS In 2002, 66 percent of our Managed student loan acquisitions had been originated through our Preferred Channel. The following tables summarize the components of both our on balance sheet and our Managed student loan acquisitions broken down by FFELP and private credit student loan activity: December 31, 2002 FFELP Private Total Preferred channel $ 8,828 $ 2,132 $ 10,960 Other commitment clients 859 35 894 Spot purchases 925 8 933 Consolidations from third parties 1,938 1,938 Consolidations from securitized trusts 4,121 4,121 Capitalized interest and other 1,073 (4 ) 1,069 Total on balance sheet student loan acquisitions 17,744 2,171 19,915 Consolidations to SLM Corporation from securitized trusts (4,121 ) (4,121 ) Capitalized interest and other 721 10 731 Total Managed student loan acquisitions $ 14,344 $ 2,181 $ 16,525 December 31, 2001 FFELP Private Total Preferred channel $ 8,025 $ 1,499 $ 9,524 Other commitment clients 917 32 949 Spot purchases 663 15 678 Consolidations from third parties 1,172 1,172 Consolidations from securitized trusts 1,305 1,305 Capitalized interest and other 1,094 115 1,209 Total on balance sheet student loan acquisitions 13,176 1,661 14,837 Consolidations to SLM Corporation from securitized trusts (1,305 ) (1,305 ) Capitalized interest and other 894 894 Total Managed student loan acquisitions $ 12,765 $ 1,661 $ 14,426 December 31, 2000 FFELP Private Total Preferred channel $ 5,625 $ 970 $ 6,595 Other commitment clients 1,346 59 1,405 Spot purchases 882 3 885 Consolidations from third parties 824 824 Consolidations from securitized trusts 663 663 Capitalized interest and other 1,052 97 1,149 USA Group acquisition1 1,408 13 1,421 SLFR acquisition2 3,090 13 3,103 Total on balance sheet student loan acquisitions 14,890 1,155 16,045 Consolidations to SLM Corporation from securitized trusts (663 ) (663 ) Capitalized interest and other3 5,912 5,912 Total Managed student loan acquisitions $ 20,139 $ 1,155 $ 21,294 1In July 2000, the Company completed the acquisition of USA Group, Inc. ("USA Group"). 2In July 2000, the Company completed the acquisition of Student Loan Funding Resources, Inc. ("SLFR"). 3Consists primarily of off balance sheet loans acquired from USA Group and SLFR. 34 Preferred Channel Originations A leading indicator of the success of our marketing strategy is the growth in our Preferred Channel Originations. These loans are either originated by us under our own brand name or they are originated on behalf of other lenders, and are acquired by us shortly after origination. Student loans originated through our Preferred Channel are acquired by us earlier in the life cycle and have lower purchase premiums versus loans acquired through our commitment clients and the spot market. As a result Preferred Channel student loans are higher earning assets. In 2002, we originated $11.9 billion in student loan volume through our Preferred Channel, an 18 percent increase over the $10.1 billion originated in 2001. Approximately 74 percent of our Preferred Channel originations was through our lender partners and 26 percent were originated through our own brands. The pipeline of loans that we currently service and are committed to purchase was $5.6 billion at December 31, 2002 and 2001. The following tables further break down our Preferred Channel originations by type of loan and source. Years ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Preferred Channel Originations Type of Loan Stafford $ 8,078 $ 7,182 $ 5,347 PLUS 1,440 1,262 893 Total FFELP 9,518 8,444 6,240 Private 2,352 1,649 1,081 Total $ 11,870 $ 10,093 $ 7,321 Preferred Channel Originations Source Sallie Mae Brands $ 3,083 $ 2,009 $ 1,226 Lender partners 8,787 8,084 6,095 $ 11,870 $ 10,093 $ 7,321 The following table summarizes the activity in our Managed portfolio of student loans for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. Years ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Beginning balance $ 71,726 $ 67,515 $ 53,276 Acquisitions 14,749 12,519 19,508 Capitalized interest 1,776 1,907 1,786 Repayments, claims, other (7,672 ) (7,639 ) (5,659 ) Charge offs to reserves and securitization trusts (96 ) (65 ) (30 ) Loan sales (143 ) (137 ) Loans consolidated from SLM Corporation (2,359 ) (2,368 ) (1,229 ) Ending balance $ 78,124 $ 71,726 $ 67,515 LEVERAGED LEASES At December 31, 2002, we had investments in leveraged leases, net of impairments, totaling $205 million, that are general obligations of three commercial airlines and Federal Express Corporation. The aircraft financing business continues to be adversely affected by the slowdown in the commercial aircraft industry that began in early 2001 and was exacerbated by the terrorist attacks of 35 September 11, 2001. In addition, the continuing reduction in aircraft passenger volume has resulted in the grounding of a significant number of aircraft. Based on an analysis of the expected losses on certain leveraged leases plus the increase in incremental tax obligations related to forgiveness of debt obligations and or the taxable gain on the sale of the aircraft, we recognized after tax impairment charges of $57 million, or $.36 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2002 to reflect the impairment of certain aircraft leased to United Airlines, who declared bankruptcy in December 2002. Should the reduction in aircraft passenger volume persist, the Company has exposure to the airline industry of $135 million. Additional information regarding our investments in leveraged leases is contained in Note 6 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements." LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES A primary funding objective is to maintain our student loan spread by continuing to match the interest rate characteristics of our assets and liabilities. To accomplish this we must broaden our already diverse funding sources to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity to refinance the GSE debt to meet our September 2006 target date for the GSE Wind Down. Currently our primary sources of liquidity are through debt issuances by the GSE, off balance sheet financings through securitizations, borrowings under our commercial paper and medium term note programs, other senior note issuances, and cash generated by our subsidiaries and distributed through dividends to the Company. Our Managed borrowings are broken down as follows: Years ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Average Balance Average Rate Average Balance Average Rate Average Balance Average Rate GSE $ 45,699 2.35 % $ 47,877 4.27 % $ 43,325 6.45 % Non GSE 4,223 2.88 1,822 4.45 641 6.94 Securitizations (off balance sheet) 32,385 2.57 30,489 4.58 25,705 6.97 Total Managed borrowings $ 82,307 2.47 % $ 80,188 4.39 % $ 69,671 6.64 % GSE Financing Activities The GSE secures financing to fund its on balance sheet portfolio of student loans, along with its other operations, by issuing debt securities in the domestic and overseas capital markets, through public offerings and private placements of U.S. dollar denominated and foreign currency denominated debt of varying maturities and interest rate characteristics. The GSEs debt securities are currently rated at the highest credit rating level by both Moodys and S&P. Historically, the agencies ratings of the GSE have been largely a factor of its status as a government sponsored enterprise. Since the Privatization Act did not modify the attributes of debt issued by the GSE, management anticipates that the GSE will retain its current credit ratings. The GSEs unsecured financing requirements are driven by the following factors: refinancing of existing liabilities as they mature; financing of the net growth in the student loan portfolio; the level of securitization activity; and the transfer and refinancing of GSE assets by non GSE entities of the Company. Securitization Activities Since the establishment of our program in 1995, securitization of student loans has been the principal source of non GSE long term funding for our Managed portfolio of student loans. During 2002, the Company completed nine securitization transactions totaling $13.7 billion versus four 36 transactions totaling $6.4 billion in student loans in 2001. At December 31, 2002, $35.8 billion or 46 percent of our Managed student loans outstanding were in off balance sheet securitized trusts. In 2002, our securitization activity not only accelerated in volume, but also diversified our securitization program. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we completed our first securitization of private credit student loans, and we also completed our first securitization consisting exclusively of Consolidation Loans. We expect to accelerate and diversify our securitization activity as we refinance long term GSE debt in anticipation of the GSE Wind Down. Our asset backed securities generally have a higher net cost to fund our student loans than our GSE on balance sheet financing because the asset backed securities are term match funded to the assets securitized and do not benefit from the federal governments implicit guarantee of GSE debt. The GSEs funding advantage over our securitizations is somewhat mitigated by the absence of Offset Fees on securitized loans. Our securitizations to date have been structured to achieve a triple "A" credit rating on over 96 percent of the asset backed securities sold. Securities issued in our typical FFELP student loan securitizations are indexed to LIBOR while the index on our securitized loans are either indexed to the 91 day or 52 week Treasury bill or commercial paper. We manage this off balance sheet basis risk through on balance sheet financing activities, principally through basis swaps. Non GSE Unsecured On Balance Sheet Financing Activities While the securitization market is the core of our long term financing strategy, it is supplemented by commercial paper, bank lines of credit, underwritten long term debt, and global and medium term note programs. The following table shows the senior unsecured credit ratings on our non GSE debt from the major rating agencies. S&P Moodys Fitch Short term unsecured debt A 1 P 1 F 1+ Long term unsecured debt A A 2 A+ The table below presents our non GSE unsecured on balance sheet funding by funding source for 2002 versus 2001: Debt Issued for the Years Ended December 31, Outstanding at December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2002 2001 2002 2001 Commercial paper $ 24,694 $ 113,660 $ 235 $ 450 Global notes 1,702 1,702 Medium term notes 3,655 1,617 5,148 2,117 We maintain $2 billion in revolving credit facilities to provide liquidity support for our commercial paper program that were renewed and expanded in 2002. They include a $1 billion 364 day revolving credit facility maturing October 2003 and a $1 billion 5 year revolving credit facility maturing October 2007. We have never drawn on these facilities. Interest on these facilities is based on LIBOR plus a spread that is determined by the amount of the facility utilized and the Companys credit rating. Cash Flows During 2002, the Company used the proceeds from student loan securitizations of $13.8 billion, repayments and claim payments on student loans of $4.7 billion, and the net proceeds from sales of student loans to acquire student loans either through purchase or origination ($15.8 billion) or through consolidating loans ($4.1 billion) from our securitized trusts and to repurchase $652 million of the Companys common stock. 37 Operating activities provided net cash inflows of $763 million in 2002, a decrease of $76 million from the net cash inflows of $839 million in 2001. Operating cash flows is driven by net income adjusted for various non cash items such as gains and losses on sales of student loans and securities, the derivative market value adjustment and the provision for loan losses. Operating cash flows are also affected by the timing of the receipt or payment of cash for other assets and liabilities. During 2002, the Company issued $20.4 billion of long term notes, of which $15.0 billion was issued by the GSE and $5.4 billion was issued by SLM Corporation, to refund maturing debt obligations and finance the acquisition of student loans. At December 31, 2002, the Company had $22.2 billion of long term debt, of which $16.4 billion is an obligation of the GSE and $5.8 billion is an obligation of SLM Corporation. $4.1 billion of the GSEs long term debt had stated maturities that could be accelerated through call provisions. RISKS Overview Managing risks is an essential part of successfully operating a financial services company. Our most prominent risk exposures are operational, market, political and regulatory, liquidity, credit, and Consolidation Loan refinancing risk. Operational Risk Operational risk can result from regulatory compliance errors, other servicing errors (see further discussion below), technology, breaches of the internal control system, and the risk of fraud or unauthorized transactions by employees or persons outside the Company. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards and contractual commitments, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. The federal guarantee on our student loans is conditioned on compliance with origination and servicing standards set by the DOE and guarantor agencies. A mitigating factor is our ability to cure servicing deficiencies and historically our losses have been small. Should we experience a high rate of servicing deficiencies, the cost of remedial servicing or the eventual losses on the student loans that are not cured could be material. Our servicing and operating processes are highly dependent on our information system infrastructure, and we face the risk of business disruption should there be extended failures of our information systems, any number of which could have a material impact on our business. We have a number of back up and recovery plans in the event of systems failures. These plans are tested regularly and monitored constantly. We manage operational risk through our risk management and internal control processes which involve each business line as well as executive management. The business lines have direct and primary responsibility and accountability for identifying, controlling, and monitoring operational risk, and each business line manager maintains a system of controls with the objective of providing proper transaction authorization and execution, proper system operations, safeguarding of assets from misuse or theft, and ensuring the reliability of financial and other data. While we believe that we have designed effective methods to minimize operational risks, our operations remain vulnerable to natural disasters, human error, technology and communication system breakdowns and fraud. Market and Interest Rate Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and or interest rates of our financial instruments. Our primary market risk is from changes in interest rates and interest spreads. We have an active interest rate risk management program that is designed to reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates and maintain consistent earning spreads in all interest rate environments. We 38 use derivative instruments extensively to hedge our interest rate exposure, but in our hedging activities is a risk that we are not hedging all potential interest rate exposures or that the hedges do not perform as designed. We measure interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for interest earning assets, interest bearing liabilities and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk. Many assumptions are utilized by management to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income, the more significant of which are related to student loan volumes and pricing, the timing of cash flows from our student loan portfolio, particularly the impact of Floor Income and the rate of student loan consolidations, interest spreads and the maturity of our debt and derivatives. (See also "Interest Rate Risk Management.") Political/Regulatory Risk Because we operate in a federally sponsored loan program, we are subject to political and regulatory risk. As part of the Higher Education Act, the student loan program is periodically amended and must be "reauthorized" every six years. Past changes included reduced loan yields paid to the lenders in 1993 and 1998, increased fees paid by lenders in 1993, decreased level of the government guaranty in 1993 and reduced fees to guarantors and collectors, among others. The program is scheduled to be reauthorized in 2003 although management expects reauthorization to be completed in 2004. There can be no assurances that the reauthorization will not result in changes that may have an adverse impact to the Company. The Secretary of Education oversees and implements the Higher Education Act and periodically issues regulations and interpretations that may impact our business. In addition, the activities and financial condition of the GSE are regulated by the U.S. Department of the Treasurys Office of Sallie Mae Oversight ("OSMO"). Liquidity Risk In connection with the Wind Down of the GSE, we must continue to diversify our funding sources outside of the government agency market. As such, we have increasing credit spread and liquidity exposure to the capital markets. A major disruption in the fixed income capital markets that limits our ability to raise funds or significantly increases the cost of those funds would have a material impact on our ability to acquire student loans, our results of operations and the timely and effective completion of the Privatization Plan. Credit Risk We bear full risk of any losses experienced in our private credit student loan portfolio. These loans are underwritten and priced according to risk, generally determined by a commercially available consumer credit scoring system, FICO. Additionally, for borrowers who do not meet our lending requirements, we require credit worthy co borrowers. We have defined credit policies, and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all private credit student loans. While the portfolio has not matured to a point where predictable loan loss patterns have developed, the performance to date has met our expectations, as net charge offs in 2002 were 1.3 percent of the average managed private credit loan balance. The performance of the private credit student loan portfolio is affected by the economy and a prolonged economic downturn may have an adverse effect on its credit performance. Management believes that it has provided sufficient allowances to cover the losses that may be experienced in both the federally guaranteed and private credit portfolios. There is, however, no guarantee that such allowances are sufficient enough to account for actual losses. (See "Activity in the Allowance for Student Loan Losses.") 39  The majority of our portfolio of federally insured student loans is subject to a two percent Risk Sharing loss in the event of default. Credit losses on this portfolio are minimal. We have credit risk exposure to the various counterparties with whom we have entered into derivative contracts. We review the credit standing of these companies. Our credit policies place limits on the amount of exposure we may take with any one party and in many cases, require collateral to secure the position. The credit risk associated with derivatives is measured based on the replacement cost should the counterparties with contracts in a gain position to the Company fail to perform under the terms of the contract. We also have credit risk with several commercial airlines related to our portfolio of leveraged leases. (See "Leveraged Leases.") Consolidation Loan Refinancing Risk Our portfolio of federal student loans is subject to refinancing through the Consolidation Loan Program. Consolidation Loans can have two detrimental effects. First, if we consolidate our borrowers loans, the new Consolidation Loans have a lower yield than the FFELP loans they replaced due to the federally mandated Consolidation Loan Rebate Fee of 1.05 percent per annum. This fee is somewhat mitigated by larger average balances, longer average lives, lower servicing costs, and slightly higher SAP margins. Second and more importantly, we may lose student loans in our portfolio that are consolidated with other lenders. Over the past two years the Company has experienced a net runoff of student loans from Consolidation Loan activity as more of our student loans were consolidated with other lenders. During 2002, we consolidated $1.9 billion of student loans and due to an increased marketing focus on Consolidation Loans, the net runoff of student loans was reduced from $1.2 billion in 2001 to $421 million in 2002. The success of our consolidation marketing campaign reversed this trend completely in the fourth quarter as the Company had a net increase in student loans from consolidations of $30 million. Interest Rate Risk Management Interest Rate Gap Analysis We manage our interest rate risk on a Managed Basis and as a result we use on balance sheet derivatives to hedge the basis risk in our securitization trusts as the trusts typically issue asset backed securities indexed to LIBOR to fund student loans indexed to either the 91 day Treasury bill, commercial paper or in the case of private credit loans, the prime rate. At December 31, 2002, there were approximately $27.0 billion of asset backed securities issued by our securitization trusts that were indexed to LIBOR, $500 million of securities indexed to commercial paper, $505 million of securities indexed to EURIBOR, and $654 million of auction rate securities. There were also $3.4 billion of PLUS student loans in the trusts that are funded by asset backed securities indexed to LIBOR or the 91 day Treasury bill. We hedge our off balance sheet basis risk through on balance sheet derivatives, the effect of which is included in the gap analysis table below as the impact of securitized student loans. In the table below the Companys variable rate assets and liabilities are categorized by reset date of the underlying index. Fixed rate assets and liabilities are categorized based on their maturity dates. An interest rate gap is the difference between volumes of assets and volumes of liabilities maturing or 40 repricing during specific future time intervals. The following gap analysis reflects rate sensitive positions at December 31, 2002 and is not necessarily reflective of positions that existed throughout the period. Interest Rate Sensitivity Period 3 months or less 3 months to 6 months 6 months to 1 year 1 to 2 years 2 to 5 years Over 5 years Assets Student loans $ 39,902 $ 1,854 $ 583 $ $ $ Academic facilities financings and other loans 402 94 204 79 103 320 Cash and investments 3,439 30 6 19 688 808 Other assets 1,064 40 80 254 562 2,644 Total assets 44,807 2,018 873 352 1,353 3,772 Liabilities and Stockholders Equity Short term borrowings 20,935 2,136 2,548 Long term notes 8,501 350 8,645 2,629 2,117 Other liabilities 1,758 1,558 Stockholders equity 1,998 Total liabilities and stockholders equity 31,194 2,486 2,548 8,645 2,629 5,673 Period gap before adjustments 13,613 (468 ) (1,675 ) (8,293 ) (1,276 ) (1,901 ) Adjustments for Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments Interest rate derivatives (9,577 ) (1,710 ) 3,615 6,280 (3 ) 1,395 Impact of securitized loans (3,421 ) 3,421 Total derivatives and other financial instruments (12,998 ) 1,711 3,615 6,280 (3 ) 1,395 Period gap $ 615 $ 1,243 $ 1,940 $ (2,013 ) $ (1,279 ) $ (506 ) Cumulative gap $ 615 $ 1,858 $ 3,798 $ 1,785 $ 506 $ Ratio of interest sensitive assets to interest sensitive liabilities 148.6% 79.6% 31.1% 1.1% 30.1% 53.3% Ratio of cumulative gap to total assets 1.2% 3.5% 7.1% 3.4% 1.0% % Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis The effect of short term movements in interest rates on our results of operations and financial position has been limited through our interest rate risk management. The following tables summarize the effect on earnings for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 and the effect on fair values at December 31, 2002 and 2001, based upon a sensitivity analysis performed by us assuming a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of 100 basis points and 300 basis points while funding spreads remain constant. We have chosen to show the effects of a hypothetical increase to interest rates, as an increase gives rise to a larger absolute value change to the financial statements. The effect on earnings was 41 performed on our variable rate assets, liabilities and hedging instruments while the effect on fair values was performed on our fixed rate assets, liabilities and hedging instruments. Year ended December 31, 2002 Year ended December 31, 2001 Interest Rates: Interest Rates: Change from increase of 100 basis points Change from increase of 300 basis points Change from increase of 100 basis points Change from increase of 300 basis points (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) $ % $ % $ % $ % Effect on Earnings Increase/(decrease) in pre tax net income before SFAS No. 133 $ (200 ) (14 )% $ (288 ) (20 )% $ (136 ) (13 )% $ 35 3 % SFAS No. 133 change in fair value 369 181 947 465 358 (79 ) 875 (193 ) Increase in net income before taxes $ 169 14 % $ 659 54 % $ 222 36 % $ 910 147 % Increase in diluted earnings per share $ .69 14 % $ 2.71 55 % $ .88 39 % $ 3.62 159 % At December 31, 2002 Interest Rates: Change from increase of 100 basis points Change from increase of 300 basis points (Dollars in millions) Fair Value $ % $ % Effect on Fair Values Assets Student loans $ 44,718 $ (497 ) (1 )% $ (1,100 ) (2 )% Other earning assets 6,248 (104 ) (2 ) (279 ) (4 ) Other assets 4,643 (391 ) (8 ) (693 ) (15 ) Total assets $ 55,609 $ (992 ) (2 )% $ (2,072 ) (4 )% Liabilities Interest bearing liabilities $ 48,721 $ (186 ) % $ (539 ) (1 )% Other liabilities 3,316 (558 ) (17 ) (1,270 ) (38 ) Total liabilities $ 52,037 $ (744 ) (1 )% $ (1,809 ) (3 )% At December 31, 2001 Interest Rates: Change from increase of 100 basis points Change from increase of 300 basis points (Dollars in millions) Fair Value $ % $ % Effect on Fair Values Assets Student loans $ 42,187 $ (403 ) (1 )% $ (845 ) (2 )% Other earning assets 7,581 (101 ) (1 ) (285 ) (4 ) Other assets 4,318 (272 ) (6 ) (408 ) (9 ) Total assets $ 54,086 $ (776 ) (1 )% $ (1,538 ) (3 )% Liabilities Interest bearing liabilities $ 48,690 $ (187 ) % $ (544 ) (1 )% Other liabilities 2,851 (394 ) (14 ) (770 ) (27 ) Total liabilities $ 51,541 $ (581 ) (1 )% $ (1,314 ) (3 )% 42 The Company follows a policy to minimize its sensitivity to changing interest rates by generally funding its floating rate student loan portfolio with floating rate debt. However, as discussed under "Student Loans Floor Income," in the current low interest rate environment, the FFELP student loan portfolio is earning Floor Income from the reduction in the variable rate liabilities funding student loans at the fixed borrower rate. Therefore, absent other hedges, in a low interest rate environment the hypothetical rise in interest rates in the above table has a greater adverse effect on earnings and fair values due to the reduction in potential Floor Income than in higher interest rate environments where the interest rate formula rises above the borrower rate and the student loans become a floating rate asset that is matched with floating rate debt. During the year ended December 31, 2002, certain FFELP student loans were earning Floor Income and we locked in a portion of that Floor Income through the use of futures and swap contracts. The result of these hedging transactions was to convert a portion of floating rate debt into fixed rate debt, matching the fixed rate nature of the student loans and fixing the relative spread between the student loan asset rate and the converted fixed rate liability. In low interest rate environments when certain student loans are earning Floor Income, under the scenario where interest rates increase 100 basis points, the decrease in pre tax net income before SFAS No. 133 reflects lower Floor Income on the unhedged portion of our student loan portfolio. Under the scenario where interest rates increase 300 basis points, the change in pre tax net income before SFAS No. 133 is not proportional to the change under the scenario where interest rates increase 100 basis points because of the additional spread earned on loans hedged with futures and swaps mentioned above and the greater proportion of loans earning at a floating rate under a 300 basis point increase in rates. Average Terms to Maturity The following table reflects the average terms to maturity for our Managed earning assets and liabilities at December 31, 2002 (in years): On Balance Sheet Off Balance Sheet Managed Earning assets Student loans 7.5 5.9 6.7 Academic facilities financings and other loans 6.1 6.1 Cash and investments 3.5 3.5 Total earning assets 7.1 5.9 6.6 Borrowings Short term borrowings .3 .3 Long term borrowings 3.7 5.9 5.1 Total borrowings 1.6 5.9 3.5 In the above table, Treasury receipts and variable rate asset backed securities, although generally liquid in nature, extend the weighted average remaining term to maturity of cash and investments to 3.8 years. As student loans are securitized, the need for long term on balance sheet financing will decrease. Long term debt issuances likely to be called have been categorized according to their call dates rather than their maturity dates. 43 The following schedule summarizes expirations of commitments and long term notes to the earlier of call date or maturity date outstanding at December 31, 2002.

The purpose of our common stock repurchase activity is to enhance share value more tax effectively than through dividends and to enable the remaining shareholders to own a greater percentage of outstanding shares. For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, we issued a net 4.4 million shares of common stock and treasury stock totaling $228 million and 10.7 million shares totaling $429 million, respectively, in connection with our benefit plans and acquisitions. For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, we repurchased 7.3 million shares totaling $523 million and 19.4 million shares totaling $859 million, respectively, through our open market purchases and through the settlement of equity forward contracts. The net result was to decrease outstanding shares to 153 million at December 31, 2002 from 155 million shares at December 31, 2001. Due to the highly predictable nature of our cash flow, we utilize equity forward contracts to better manage the cost associated with our share repurchases. In the equity forward agreements we contract to purchase shares from a third party at a future date. At or prior to the maturity date of the agreement, we, at our sole option, can purchase the shares from the third party at the contracted amount or we can net cash or net share settle the contract. At December 31, 2002, the total common shares that could potentially be acquired over the next four years under outstanding equity forward contracts was 9.5 million shares at an average price of $85.35 per share, and we have remaining authority to enter into additional share repurchases and equity forward contracts for 6.7 million shares. Years ended December 31, (Shares in millions) 2002 2001 Common shares repurchased: Open market .7 2.7 Equity forwards 6.6 16.7 Total shares repurchased 7.3 19.4 Average purchase price per share $ 71.65 $ 44.32 Equity forward contracts: Outstanding at beginning of year 11.2 18.2 New contracts 4.9 9.7 Exercises (6.6 ) (16.7 ) Outstanding at end of year 9.5 11.2 Board of director authority remaining at end of year 6.7 2.3 44 As of December 31, 2002, the expiration dates and range of purchase prices for outstanding equity forward contracts are as follows: (Contracts in millions) Year of maturity Outstanding contracts Range of market prices 2003 1.1 63.00 2004 4.9 74.38 103.30 2005 2.5 82.40 91.77 2006 1.0 101.47 105.04 9.5 The FASB has tentatively reached a conclusion on new rules governing the accounting for equity forward contracts. Under the proposed rules, for those contracts that allow a net settlement option either in cash or the Companys stock, we would account for the equity forward contract under SFAS No. 133 and periodically mark the contract to market through income. For those contracts that require physical settlement only, we would recognize a liability and contra equity. Our contracts typically allow net settlement, so if the rule were effective, based on a closing share price at December 31, 2002, we would have recognized an asset of $177 million from marking the equity forward contracts to market. STUDENT LOAN MARKETING ASSOCIATION Privatization Act GSE Wind Down Under the Privatization Act, the GSE must wind down its operations and dissolve on or before September 30, 2008, and until the GSE is dissolved, the Privatization Act places a number of limitations on the GSE. Management, however, plans to accelerate the Wind Down of the GSE to no later than September 2006. This plan was approved by the GSEs board of directors in January 2002. Any GSE debt obligations outstanding at the date of such dissolution are required to be defeased through creation of a fully collateralized trust, consisting of cash or financial instrument backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government with cash flows that match the interest and principal obligations of the defeased debt. The Privatization Act requires that on the dissolution date, the GSE shall repurchase or redeem, or make proper provisions for repurchase or redemption of any outstanding preferred stock. The GSE redeemed its Series A, Adjustable Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, its only outstanding preferred stock, in the fourth quarter of 2001. Also upon the GSEs dissolution, all of its remaining assets will transfer to the Company. The Privatization Act effectively requires that the GSE maintain a minimum statutory capital adequacy ratio (the ratio of the GSEs stockholders equity to total assets plus 50 percent of the credit equivalent amount of certain off balance sheet items) of at least 2.25 percent or be subject to certain "safety and soundness" requirements designed to restore such statutory ratio. While the GSE may not finance or guarantee the activities of its non GSE affiliates, it may, subject to its minimum capital requirements, dividend retained earnings and surplus capital to SLM Corporation, which in turn may contribute such amounts to its non GSE subsidiaries. At December 31, 2002, the GSEs statutory capital adequacy ratio was 4.83 percent. The GSE has also received guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasurys Office of Sallie Mae Oversight regarding safety and soundness considerations affecting its Wind Down. As a result, in connection with any dividend declarations, the GSE will supplement the statutory minimum capital ratio requirement with a risk based capital measurement formula. Management does not expect the capital levels of our consolidated balance sheet to change as a result of this supplemental formula. The Privatization Act imposes certain restrictions on intercompany relations between the GSE and its affiliates during the Wind Down Period. The GSE may, however, continue to issue new debt 45 obligations maturing on or before September 30, 2008 although, because of the accelerated Wind Down described above, the Company does not intend to issue any new GSE debt with maturities beyond September 30, 2006. The legislation further provides that the legal status and attributes of the GSEs debt obligations, including the exemptions from SEC registration and state taxes, will be fully preserved until their respective maturities. Such debt obligations will remain GSE debt obligations, whether such obligations were outstanding at the time of, or issued subsequent to, the reorganization of the GSE into the current holding company structure. In connection with the Wind Down of the GSE, we must either securitize, sell or defease the GSEs assets by the Wind Down date and retire or defease the GSEs debt obligations. The following table summarizes the GSEs asset sales and transfers for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001: Years ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2002 2001 FFELP student loan securitizations1 $ 13,265 $ 6,159 Private credit student loan sales1 3,443 Transfer of leveraged leases, net 22 1Includes accrued interest receivable. The private credit student loans were sold by the GSE to a subsidiary of the Company at fair market value and the GSE recognized gains on these sales of $165 million. OTHER RELATED EVENTS AND INFORMATION Legislative Developments The Higher Education Act of 1965 (the "HEA") generally is reauthorized every six years. The HEA was last reauthorized in 1998 and expires on September 20, 2003. Under current law, however, the HEA will automatically extend through September 30, 2004. At this time, management expects the reauthorization of the HEA to be completed in 2004.
