Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Years ended December 31, 2001 2003 (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) OVERVIEW We are the largest private source of funding, delivery and servicing support for education loans in the United States primarily through our participation in the FFELP. Our primary business is to originate, acquire and hold student loans. We also provide a wide range of financial services, processing capabilities and information technology to meet the needs of educational institutions, lenders, students and their families, and guarantee agencies. We earn fees for student loan servicing, guarantee processing, student loan default management and loan collections. SLM Corporation is a holding company that operates through a number of subsidiaries including the Student Loan Marketing Association, a federally chartered government sponsored enterprise. References in this annual report to "the Company" refer to SLM Corporation and its subsidiaries. We have provided the discussion of the GSE within the context of this "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" ("MD&A") because the GSEs primary function of financing the initial purchase of student loans is a subset of similar operations conducted by the Company. As we wind down the GSE, such operations will constitute less and less of the Companys operations. MD&A disclosures applicable solely to the GSE are included at the end of this MD&A in the section titled "Student Loan Marketing Association." The discussion that follows regarding our interest income and expenses from on balance sheet assets and liabilities is applicable to both the Company and the GSE. Likewise, because all of our FFELP securitizations to date have originated from the GSE, the discussion of securitization gains for FFELP student loans is applicable to the GSE only. The ongoing servicing and securitization revenue from those securitizations is primarily earned by the Company because the Retained Interests in FFELP securitizations are sold by the GSE to SLM Corporation shortly after completion of the securitization transaction. Discussions of Private Credit Student Loan securitizations are applicable to the Company only. The discussions of off balance sheet loans, our fee based businesses, and our operations on a Managed Basis, as well as the discussions set forth below under the headings "Selected Financial Data," "Other Income," "Federal and State Taxes" and "Alternative Performance Measures" do not involve the GSE and relate to the Company on a consolidated basis. In 2003, the majority of our student loan purchases were financed in the GSE and were initially financed through the issuance of short term GSE debt obligations and then through student loan securitizations that were conducted through the GSE. Once securitized, the GSE no longer owns the student loans and the bonds issued by the trust are not obligations of the GSE. As the Wind Down of the GSE continues, the liquidity provided to the Company by the GSE is being replaced by non GSE financing, including securitizations originated by non GSE subsidiaries of SLM Corporation. All student loans that the Company directly originates are owned by non GSE subsidiaries from inception. The GSE has no employees, so the management of its operations is provided by the Company under a management services agreement. We also service the majority of the GSEs student loans under a servicing agreement between the GSE and Sallie Mae, Inc., a wholly owned non GSE subsidiary of SLM Corporation which includes the division of Sallie Mae Servicing. See "STUDENT LOAN MARKETING ASSOCIATION Privatization Act GSE Wind Down" for a more detailed discussion of the GSE and the progress of the Companys Wind Down effort. 18 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY We have built the Company to be the dominant player in every phase of the student loan life cycle from origination of the student loans to servicing the student loans to debt management of delinquent and ultimately defaulted student loans. As the leading company in our industry, we are positioned to meet the growing demand for post secondary education credit across and related services. We have used both internal growth and strategic acquisitions to attain this leadership position. We now have the largest and most successful sales force in the industry, which is positioned to deliver our product offerings on campus. The core of our marketing strategy is to promote our on campus brands, which generate student loan originations through our Preferred Channel. Loans acquired through our Preferred Channel are more profitable than loans acquired through our forward purchase commitments or the spot market since they are acquired earlier in the student loans life and we generally pay lower premiums to acquire such loans. We have built brand leadership between the Sallie Mae name and those of our leading lender partners, Bank One and JP Morgan Chase, such that we capture the volume of three of the top five originators of FFELP loans. These sales and marketing efforts are supported by the largest and most technologically advanced servicing capabilities in the industry, providing an unmatched array of servicing capability to financial aid offices. Demand for post secondary education in the United States has grown steadily over the last decade and we expect this growth rate to continue in the future. The DOE predicts that the college age population will increase 11 to 13 percent by 2012. Demand for education credit will be further increased by more non traditional students (those not attending college directly from high school) and adult education. In addition, tuition costs have risen 47 percent for four year public institutions and 42 percent for four year private institutions on an inflation adjusted basis since the 1993 1994 academic year. Management believes that the twin factors of increasing demand for education coupled with rising tuition costs will drive growth in education financing well into the next decade. In 2003, we acquired $20.7 billion of student loans, a 25 percent increase over the $16.5 billion acquired in 2002. Of the student loans acquired, we originated $15.2 billion of student loans through our Preferred Channel, an increase of 23 percent over the $12.4 billion of student loans originated in 2002. The main driver of our earnings continues to be our Managed portfolio of student loans, which in 2003, grew by 14 percent to $89 billion at December 31, 2003. FFELP student loans are 98 percent guaranteed by the Federal government and as such represent high quality assets with very little credit risk and predictable earnings streams that are relatively easily financed. At December 31, 2003, our Managed FFELP student loan portfolio was $80.5 billion or 91 percent of total Managed student loans. FFELP loan limits have not been raised since 1992, so to meet the increasing cost of higher education, students have had to turn to alternative sources of education financing. A large and growing source of this supplemental education financing is provided through campus based Private Credit Student Loans, of which we are the largest provider. At December 31, 2003, we owned $8.3 billion of Private Credit Student Loans representing 9 percent of our Managed student loan portfolio. This portfolio grew by 43 percent in 2003. Private Credit Student Loans consist of two general types: those that are designed to bridge the gap between the cost of higher education and the amount financed through capped federally insured loans and the borrowers resources, and those that are used to meet the needs of students in alternative learning programs such as career training, distance learning and lifelong learning programs. Unlike FFELP loans, Private Credit Student Loans are subject to the full credit risk of the borrower. We manage this additional risk through industry tested loan underwriting standards and a combination of higher interest rates and loan origination fees that compensate us for the higher risk. As a result, we earn much higher spreads on Private Credit Student Loans than on FFELP loans. We believe that they are an important driver of future earnings growth. 19 The growth in the Managed portfolio of student loans will drive future earnings growth only if we maintain the student loan spread earned on those loans. As we continue to wind down the GSE, the cost of funding our Managed student loan portfolio will increase as we replace GSE funding with higher cost non GSE funding sources. The increased funding costs coupled with the rapid growth in Consolidation Loans puts pressure on our student loan spread. We have actively managed these adverse effects by acquiring a higher percentage of student loans through our Preferred Channel and by the increasing percentage of Private Credit Student Loans in our Managed portfolio. The Managed student loan spread for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, exclusive of Floor Income and changes in estimates, was 2.00 percent and 1.88 percent, respectively. In recent years, the Managed spread has also benefited from Floor Income Contracts. While student loans remain the core of our business, we are committed to extending and diversifying our business in higher education related fee based services, primarily guarantor servicing, debt management services, and loan servicing. For 2003, these businesses generated 26 percent of net revenues (net interest income plus other income on a Managed Basis), up from 8 percent in 1999. In total, the debt management businesses generated gross revenue of $259 million in 2003, an increase of 39 percent from the $186 million earned in 2002, and guarantor servicing fees increased by 21 percent to $128 million in 2003 versus $106 million in 2002. The growth in these businesses has also increased operating expenses at approximately the same rate. We are committed to expanding these businesses further both through internal business development and selective strategic acquisitions. Our biggest funding challenge in winding down the GSE is to maintain cost effective liquidity and access to the capital markets as we transition from GSE funding to SLM Corporation non GSE funding. The main source of non GSE funding is student loan securitizations and we have built a highly liquid and deep market for such financings as evidenced by the over $30 billion of student loans securitized in sixteen transactions in 2003 versus $13.7 billion in nine transactions in 2002. While the growth in our securitizations was very important to the GSE Wind Down plan, equally as important was the myriad of new unsecured non GSE short and long term funding vehicles that we introduced in 2003. We issued almost $15 billion of SLM Corporation, term, non GSE unsecured debt in 2003 which increased the balance of such debt to $20.3 billion at December 31, 2003, a 187 percent increase over December 31, 2002. This shift in funding was accomplished through the introduction of several new funding programs that further diversified our funding sources and substantially increased our fixed income investor base. We believe that the record volume of non GSE financing, which, combined with securitization, equaled 2.4 times our student acquisitions in 2003, is indicative of our ability to successfully finance the Company in a post GSE environment. At December 31, 2003, we financed 78 percent of our Managed student loans with non GSE sources versus 54 percent at December 31, 2002. We face a number of challenges and risks that can materially affect our future results such as changes in: applicable laws and regulations, which may change the volume, average term, effective yields and refinancing options of student loans under the FFELP or provide advantages to competing FEELP and non FFELP loan providers; demand and competition for education financing; financing preferences of students and their families; borrower default rates on privately insured loans; prepayment rates on student loans, particularly prepayments through loan consolidation; access to the capital markets for non GSE funding at favorable spreads; and our operating execution and efficiencies, including errors, omissions, and breakdowns in internal control. 20 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES MD&A discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions. Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, particularly those that include the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and are often about matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates relate to the following accounting policies that are discussed in more detail below: securitization accounting and Retained Interests, provision for loan losses, and derivative accounting. Also, as part of our regular quarterly evaluation of the critical estimates used by the Company, we have updated a number of estimates to account for the increase in Consolidation Loan activity. Effects of Consolidation Loan Activity on Estimates The combination of aggressive marketing in the student loan industry and low interest rates has led to record levels of Consolidation Loan volume, which, in turn, had a significant effect on a number of accounting estimates. As long as interest rates remain at historically low levels, and absent any changes in the HEA, we expect the Consolidation Loan program to continue to be an attractive option for borrowers. Accordingly, we updated our assumptions that are affected primarily by Consolidation Loan activity and updated the estimates used in developing the cash flows and effective yield calculations as they relate to the amortization of student loan premiums and discounts, borrower benefits, residual interest income and the valuation of the Residual Interest. Loan consolidation activity affects each estimate differently depending on whether the original FFELP Stafford loans being consolidated are on or off balance sheet and whether the resulting Consolidation Loan is retained by us or consolidated with a third party. When we consolidate a FFELP Stafford loan that was in our portfolio, the term of that loan is extended and the term of the amortization is likewise extended to match the new term of the loan. In that process the capitalized acquisition costs (premium) must be adjusted from inception to reflect the new term of the consolidated loan. The following schedule summarizes the impact of loan consolidation on each affected financial statement line item. See also "NET INTEREST INCOME Student Loans" and "OTHER INCOME Servicing and Securitization Revenue" for financial results of these changes. 21 Effect of Increasing Consolidation Activity On Balance Sheet Student Loans Estimate Consolidating Lender Effect on Estimate CPR 2003 Accounting Effect Premium Sallie Mae Term extension Decrease Estimate Adjustment* increase unamortized balance of premium. Reduced annual amortization expense going forward. Premium Other lenders Stafford loan "sold" Increase Estimate Adjustment* decrease unamortized balance of premium. Borrower Benefits Sallie Mae Term extension N/A Original expected benefit expense reversed new lower benefit amortized over a longer term. Borrower Benefits Other lenders Stafford loan "sold" N/A Original expected benefit revised to reflect lower Consolidation Loan benefit and the longer average life. Off Balance Sheet Student Loans Estimate Consolidating Lender Effect on Estimate CPR 2003 Accounting Effect Residual Interest Sallie Mae or other lenders FFELP Stafford Loan is "sold" from Trust reduced term Increase Reduction in fair market value of Residual Interest asset resulting in impairment charge or reduction in prior market value gains recorded in other comprehensive income. Decrease in prospective effective yield used to recognize interest income. * As estimates are updated, the premium balance must be adjusted from inception to reflect the new expected term of the loan. Consolidation Loans in Securitizations The estimate of the CPR also affects the estimate of the average life of securitized trusts and therefore affects the valuation estimate of the Residual Interest. Prepayments shorten the average life of the trust, and if all other factors remain equal, will reduce the value of the Residual Interest asset, the securitization gain on sale and the effective yield used to recognize interest income. Prepayments on student loans in securitized trusts are primarily driven by the rate at which securitized FFELP loans are consolidated. When a loan is consolidated from the trust either by us or a third party, the loan is repurchased from the trust and is treated as a prepayment. In cases where the loan is consolidated by us, it will be recorded as an on balance sheet asset. 22 Securitization Accounting and Retained Interests We regularly engage in securitization transactions as part of our financing strategy. As described in more detail in "OTHER INCOME Servicing and Securitization Revenue," in a securitization we sell student loans to a trust that issues bonds backed by the student loans as part of the transaction. When our securitizations meet the sale criteria of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities a Replacement of SFAS No. 125," we record a gain on the sale of the student loans which includes using a discounted cash flow analysis to calculate the fair value of the Retained Interest. The Retained Interests in each of our securitizations are treated as available for sale securities in accordance with SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," and therefore must be marked to market with temporary unrealized gains and losses recognized, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. Since there are no quoted market prices for our Retained Interests, we estimate their fair value both initially and each subsequent quarter using the key assumptions listed below: the projected net interest yield from the underlying securitized loans, which can be impacted by the forward yield curve; the calculation of the Embedded Floor Income associated with the securitized loan portfolio (see below); the CPR; the discount rate used to calculate the Residual Interest commensurate with the risks involved; and the expected credit losses from the underlying securitized loan portfolio. We earn interest income and periodically evaluate our Retained Interests for other than temporary impairment in accordance with the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 99 20 "Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets." Under this standard, on a quarterly basis we estimate the cash flows to be received from our Retained Interests and these revised cash flows are used prospectively to calculate a yield for income recognition. In cases where our estimate of future cash flows results in a decrease in the yield used to recognize interest income compared to the prior quarter, the Retained Interest is written down to fair value, first to the extent of any unrealized gain in accumulated other comprehensive income, then through earnings as an other than temporary impairment. These estimates are the same as those used for the valuation of the Residual Interest discussed above. We also receive income for servicing the loans in our securitization trusts. We assess the amounts received as compensation for these activities at inception and on an ongoing basis to determine if the amounts received are adequate compensation as defined in SFAS No. 140. To the extent such compensation is determined to be no more or less than adequate compensation, no servicing asset or obligation is recorded. Provision for Loan Losses The provision for loan losses represents the periodic expense of maintaining an allowance sufficient to absorb losses, net of recoveries, inherent in the student loan portfolios. The allowance for Private Credit Student Loan losses is an estimate of losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date that will be charged off in subsequent periods. We estimate our losses using historical data from our Private Credit Student Loan portfolios, extrapolations of FFELP loan loss data, current trends and relevant industry information. As our Private Credit Student Loan portfolios continue to mature, more reliance is placed on our own historic Private Credit Student Loan charge off and recovery data. 23 Accordingly, during the fourth quarter, we updated our expected default assumptions to further align the allowance estimate with our collection experience and the terms and policies of the individual Private Credit Student Loan programs. We use this data in internally developed models to estimate the amount of losses, net of subsequent collections, projected to occur in the Private Credit Student Loan portfolios. When calculating the Private Credit Student Loan loss reserve, we divide the portfolio into categories of similar risk characteristics based on loan program type, underwriting criteria, existence or absence of a co borrower, repayment begin date and repayment status. We then apply default and collection rate projections to each category. The repayment begin date indicates when the borrower is required to begin repaying their loan. Our career training Private Credit Student Loan programs (15 percent of the Managed Private Credit Student Loan portfolio at December 31, 2003) generally require the borrowers to start repaying their loan immediately. Our higher education Private Credit Student Loan programs (85 percent of the Managed Private Credit Student Loan portfolio at December 31, 2003) do not require the borrowers to begin repayment until six months after they have graduated or otherwise left school. Consequently, our loss estimates for these programs are minimal while the borrower is in school. At December 31, 2003, 41 percent of the principal balance in the higher education Managed Private Credit Student Loan portfolio relates to borrowers who are still in school (not required to make payments). As the current portfolio ages, an increasing percentage of the borrowers will leave school and be required to begin payments on their loans. The allowance for losses will change accordingly with the percentage of borrowers in repayment. Our loss estimates include losses to be incurred over the loss confirmation period, which is the period of the highest concentration of defaults. The loss confirmation period is two years for career training loans beginning when the loan is originated and five years for higher education loans beginning when the borrower leaves school, similar to the rules governing FFELP payment requirements. Our collection policies allow for periods of nonpayment for borrowers experiencing temporary difficulty meeting payment obligations (typically, very early in the repayment term when they are starting their career). This is referred to as forbearance status (see "NET INTEREST INCOME Student Loans Delinquencies"). At December 31, 2003, 6 percent of the Managed Private Credit Student Loan portfolio was in forbearance status. The loss confirmation period is in alignment with our typical collection cycle and considers these periods of nonpayment. Private Credit Student Loan principal and accrued interest is charged off against the allowance at 212 days delinquency. Private Credit Student Loans continue to accrue interest until they are charged off and removed from the active portfolio. Recoveries on loans charged off are recorded directly to the allowance. Accordingly, the evaluation of the provision for loan losses is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant changes. Management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover probable losses in the student loan portfolio. Derivative Accounting We use interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps, interest rate futures contracts, Floor Income Contracts and interest rate cap contracts as an integral part of our overall risk management strategy to manage interest rate risk arising from our fixed rate and floating rate financial instruments. We account for these instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," which requires that every derivative instrument, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability. We determine the fair value for our derivative instruments using pricing models that consider current market values and the contractual terms of the derivative contracts. Pricing models and their underlying assumptions impact the amount and timing of unrealized gains and losses 24 recognized; the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different financial results. As a matter of policy, we compare the fair values of our derivatives that we calculate to those provided by our counterparties on a monthly basis. Any significant differences are identified and resolved appropriately. We make certain judgments in the application of hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133. The most significant judgment relates to the application of hedge accounting in connection with our forecasted debt issuances. Under SFAS No. 133, if the forecasted transaction is probable to occur then hedge accounting may be applied. We regularly update our probability assessment related to such forecasted debt issuances. This assessment includes analyzing prior debt issuances and assessing changes in our future funding strategies. SFAS No. 133 requires that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria as specified by SFAS No. 133 are met. We believe that all of our derivatives are effective economic hedges and they are a critical element of our interest rate risk management strategy. However, under SFAS No. 133, some of our derivatives, primarily Floor Income Contracts, Eurodollar futures contracts, certain basis swaps and equity forwards, do not qualify for "hedge treatment" under SFAS No. 133. Therefore, changes in market value along with the periodic net settlements must be recorded through the derivative market value adjustment in the income statement with no consideration for the corresponding change in fair value of the hedged item. The derivative market value adjustment is primarily caused by interest rate volatility and changing credit spreads during the period and the volume and term of derivatives not receiving hedge accounting treatment. See also "EFFECTS OF SFAS NO. 133 Derivative Accounting" for a detailed discussion of our accounting for derivatives. 25  SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA Condensed Statements of Income Increase (decrease) Years ended December 31, 2003 vs. 2002 2002 vs. 2001 2003 2002 2001 $ % $ % Net interest income $ 1,326 $ 1,425 $ 1,126 $ (99 ) (7 )% $ 299 27 % Less: provision for losses 147 117 66 30 26 51 77 Net interest income after provision for losses 1,179 1,308 1,060 (129 ) (10 ) 248 23 Gains on student loan securitizations 744 338 75 406 120 263 351 Servicing and securitization revenue 667 839 755 (172 ) (21 ) 84 11 Derivative market value adjustment (238 ) (1,082 ) (1,006 ) 844 78 (76 ) (8 ) Guarantor servicing fees 128 106 112 22 21 (6 ) (5 ) Debt management fees 259 186 121 73 39 65 54 Other income 252 218 208 34 16 10 5 Operating expenses 808 690 708 118 17 (18 ) (3 ) Income taxes 779 431 223 348 81 208 93 Minority interest in net earnings of subsidiary 10 (10 ) (100 ) Cumulative effect of accounting change 130 130 Net income 1,534 792 384 742 94 408 106 Preferred stock dividends 12 12 12 Net income attributable to common stock $ 1,522 $ 780 $ 372 $ 742 95 % $ 408 110 % Basic earnings per common share, before cumulative effect of accounting change $ 3.08 $ 1.69 $ .78 $ 1.68 99 % $ .91 117 % Basic earnings per common share, after cumulative effect of accounting change $ 3.37 $ 1.69 $ .78 $ 1.68 99 % $ .91 117 % Diluted earnings per common share, before cumulative effect of accounting change $ 3.01 $ 1.64 $ .76 $ 1.65 101 % $ .88 116 % Diluted earnings per common share, after cumulative effect of accounting change $ 3.29 $ 1.64 $ .76 $ 1.65 101 % $ .88 116 % Dividends per common share $ .59 $ .28 $ .24 $ .31 111 % $ .04 17 % 26 Condensed Balance Sheets Increase (decrease) December 31, 2003 vs. 2002 2002 vs. 2001 2003 2002 $ % $ % Assets Federally insured student loans, net $ 29,217 $ 37,172 $ (7,955 ) (21 )% $ 395 1 % Federally insured student loans in trust, net 16,355 16,355 Private Credit Student Loans, net 4,476 5,167 (691 ) (13 ) 943 22 Academic facilities financings and other loans 1,031 1,202 (171 ) (14 ) (796 ) (40 ) Cash and investments 8,001 4,990 3,011 60 (567 ) (10 ) Retained Interest in securitized receivables 2,476 2,146 330 15 287 15 Goodwill and acquired intangible assets 592 586 6 1 20 4 Other assets 2,463 1,912 551 29 19 1 Total assets $ 64,611 $ 53,175 $ 11,436 22 % $ 301 1 % Liabilities and Stockholders Equity Short term borrowings $ 18,735 $ 25,619 $ (6,884 ) (27 )% $ (5,446 ) (18 )% Long term notes 39,808 22,242 17,566 79 4,957 29 Other liabilities 3,438 3,316 122 4 464 16 Total liabilities 61,981 51,177 10,804 21 (25 ) Stockholders equity before treasury stock 3,180 4,703 (1,523 ) (32 ) 953 25 Common stock held in treasury at cost 550 2,705 (2,155 ) (80 ) 627 30 Total stockholders equity 2,630 1,998 632 32 326 19 Total liabilities and stockholders equity $ 64,611 $ 53,175 $ 11,436 22 % $ 301 1 % RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NET INTEREST INCOME Net interest income is derived largely from our portfolio of student loans that remain on balance sheet.

In response to this interpretation, we believe that it is helpful to the understanding of our business to include two presentations of net interest income and net interest margin. The first is a GAAP presentation that includes the net settlement income/expense on derivatives and realized gains/losses in the derivative market value adjustment line and thus does not include these items in net interest income or the net interest margin. The second is a non GAAP presentation that assumes that these net settlements have been reclassified to the financial statement line item of the economically hedged item, which then includes them in the net interest income and margin. We believe that this second presentation is meaningful and reflects how management manages interest rate risk through the match funding of interest sensitive assets and liabilities. The presentations of our taxable equivalent net interest income, average balance sheet, rate volume analysis, student loan spread and funding costs in the following tables will reflect these reclassifications. The table below details the reclassification of the derivative net settlements and realized gains/losses related to derivative dispositions that is used in the subsequent presentations as discussed above.

This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in Floor Income and other student loan spread related items as discussed under "Student Loans Student Loan Spread Analysis." The decrease in the net interest margin was also due to the increase in lower yielding short term investments caused by the increase in non GSE funding that is temporarily being held pending future asset transfers from the GSE to SLM Holding. The net interest margin was also negatively impacted by the increase in student loan securitizations because the Retained Interest asset earns securitization income instead of net interest income while being funded by interest bearing liabilities. Taxable equivalent net interest income after reclassification for 2002 versus 2001 increased by $136 million while the net interest margin increased by 26 basis points. The increase in taxable equivalent net interest income was primarily due to the lower interest rate environment in 2002, which led to an increase of $100 million in Floor Income, and the $3.1 billion increase in the average balance of student loans. The increase in the net interest margin reflects the higher average balance of student loans as a percentage of average total earning assets, the increase in Floor Income, and the increased proportion of higher yielding Private Credit Student Loans. Student Loans For both federally insured and Private Credit Student Loans, we account for premiums paid, discounts received and certain origination costs incurred on the acquisition of student loans in accordance with SFAS No. 91, "Accounting for Nonrefundable Fees and Costs Associated with Originating or Acquiring Loans and Initial Direct Costs of Leases." The unamortized portion of the premiums and discounts are included in the carrying value of the student loan on the consolidated balance sheet. We recognize income on our student loan portfolio based on the expected yield of the student loan after giving effect to the amortization of purchase premiums and the accretion of student loan discounts, as well as borrower incentive programs. Origination fees charged on Private Credit Student Loans are deferred and amortized to income over the lives of the student loans. In the table below, this amortization is netted with the amortization of the premiums. Student Loan Spread Analysis After Reclassification Non GAAP (see "NET INTEREST INCOME Derivative Reclassification Presentation") The following table analyzes the reported earnings from student loans both on balance sheet and those off balance sheet in securitization trusts. For student loans off balance sheet, we will continue to earn securitization and servicing fee revenues over the life of the securitized loan portfolios. The off balance sheet information presented in "Liquidity and Capital Resources Securitization Activities Servicing and Securitization Revenue" analyzes the on going servicing revenue and Residual Interest earned on the securitized portfolios of student loans. For an analysis of our student loan spread for the entire portfolio of Managed student loans on a similar basis to the on balance sheet analysis, see "Alternative Performance Measures Student Loan Spread Analysis Managed Basis." 32 Years ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 On Balance Sheet Student loan yield, before Floor Income 4.28 % 5.01 % 6.72 % Floor Income .32 .47 .33 Consolidation Loan Rebate Fees (.50 ) (.40 ) (.30 ) Offset Fees (.07 ) (.10 ) (.13 ) Borrower benefits (.06 ) (.08 ) (.07 ) Premium and origination fee amortization (.18 ) (.19 ) (.23 ) Student loan net yield 3.79 4.71 6.32 Student loan cost of funds (1.65 ) (2.31 ) (4.31 ) Student loan spread, non GAAP 2.14 % 2.40 % 2.01 % Off Balance Sheet Servicing and securitization revenue, before Floor Income and impairment of Residual Interest 1.52 % 1.62 % 1.50 % Floor Income, net of Floor Income previously recognized in gain on sale calculation .47 1.11 .97 Impairment of Residual Interest (.25 ) (.13 ) Servicing and securitization revenue 1.74 % 2.60 % 2.47 % Average Balances On balance sheet student loans $ 45,127 $ 43,082 $ 40,025 Securitized student loans 38,205 32,280 30,594 Managed student loans $ 83,332 $ 75,362 $ 70,619 Accounting Estimates Effect on the On Balance Sheet Student Loan Spread As discussed at "CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Effects of Consolidation Loan Activity," the high rate of Consolidation Loan activity affects the estimates for capitalizing and amortizing student loan premiums and discounts and borrower benefits. In response to the increase in Consolidation Loan activity, we decreased the CPR for FFELP Stafford loans to reflect the extension of the term of these loans when consolidated into a Sallie Mae Consolidation Loan, which increased the unamortized student loan premium and decreased premium amortization. At the same time, we increased the CPR for the Consolidation Loan portfolio, which had the opposite effect on the premium balance and premium amortization. The on balance sheet portfolio of Consolidation Loans now constitutes 59 percent of the FFELP student loan portfolio and, as a result, the change in the CPR estimate for Consolidation Loans had a greater effect than on the Managed portfolio. The net effect of the two changes in estimate was a $19 million estimate adjustment to decrease the unamortized student loan premium and to increase current period amortization expense. Consolidation Loan activity also affects the effective interest calculation of our borrower benefits programs. When a student loan consolidates, the borrower is no longer eligible for the FFELP Stafford borrower benefit, but is eligible for a lower Consolidation Loan benefit. Based on higher projected rates of consolidation, we reduced our estimate of the number of borrowers who eventually qualify for FFELP Stafford borrower benefits. This change in estimate resulted in a $10 million estimate adjustment to reduce the estimated borrower benefit liability and increase student loan income. We also projected that our Private Credit Student Loan portfolio is amortizing slower than previously anticipated and we therefore increased the average term of Private Credit Student Loans in connection with the calculation of the amortization of the student loan discount. This resulted in a 33 $23 million estimate adjustment to increase the balance of the unamortized student loan discount and to decrease current period discount amortization. The net effect of these updates to our estimates was a $32 million or 7 basis points reduction in the student loan spread. Discussion of On Balance Sheet Student Loan Spread Exclusive of Floor Income and Changes in Accounting Estimates The decrease in the 2003 student loan spread, exclusive of Floor Income and updated estimates discussed above, versus the 2002 student loan spread was primarily due to higher spreads on our debt funding student loans and the increase in the average balance of Consolidation Loans as a percentage of the on balance sheet portfolio. The increase in the spreads on the cost of funds is due to the replacement of lower cost GSE funding with non GSE funding in connection with the GSE Wind Down. This higher cost is the result of both higher credit spreads on non GSE funding sources and the significantly longer duration of non GSE liabilities. Also, we use higher cost, longer term debt to fund Consolidation Loans. The average balance of Consolidation Loans grew as a percentage of the average on balance sheet FFELP student loan portfolio from 47 percent in 2002 to 56 percent in 2003. Consolidation Loans have lower spreads due to the 105 basis point Consolidation Loan Rebate Fee, which is partially offset by the absence of the 30 basis point offset fee on GSE student loans, higher SAP yield and lower student loan premium amortization. The student loan spread, exclusive of Floor Income, increased by 25 basis points from 2001 to 2002. This increase was due primarily to lower funding costs for on balance sheet loans through lower funding spreads and through the refinancing of some higher rate debt, and to an increase in Private Credit Student Loans in the on balance sheet student loan portfolio. These loans are subject to credit risk and therefore earn higher spreads. These positive effects were offset by the continued growth in our Consolidation Loans, which are lower yielding due mainly to the Consolidation Loan Rebate Fee. Floor Income For on balance sheet student loans, Floor Income is included in student loan income. For off balance student loans, future Fixed Rate Embedded Floor Income is estimated using a discounted cash flow option pricing model and is included in the Residual Interest valuation which is initially recognized as a gain on sale. Variable Rate Embedded Floor Income is recognized as earned in servicing and securitization revenue. The following table summarizes the components of Floor Income from on balance sheet student loans, net of payments under Floor Income Contracts, for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. Years ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Fixed Rate Floor Income $ 115 $ 104 $ 43 Variable Rate Floor Income 31 115 76 Total Floor Income $ 146 $ 219 $ 119 The decrease in Variable Rate Floor Income in 2003 versus 2002 is primarily due to the decline in Treasury bill and commercial paper rates from the July 1, 2001 reset of borrower rates to December 31, 2001, which resulted in $106 million of Variable Rate Floor Income earned in the first half of 2002. Treasury bill and commercial paper rates did not decline as steeply in the second half of 2002 or in 2003. The increase in Fixed Rate Floor Income is primarily due to the increase in the average balance of Consolidation Loans, partially offset by slightly higher Treasury bill rates. 34 The increase in Variable Rate Floor Income for the year ended December 31, 2002 versus 2001 was largely driven by higher average interest rates in 2000, such that minimal Variable Rate Floor Income was earned in the first half of 2001. The increase in Fixed Rate Floor Income in 2002 versus 2001 was due to the higher average balance of Consolidation Loans earning Fixed Rate Floor Income. Student Loan Floor Income Contracts At December 31, 2003, the notional amount of student loan Floor Income Contracts totaled $32.6 billion of which $18.6 billion are contracts that commence in 2004 to 2007. The following table analyzes the ability of the FFELP student loans in our Managed student loan portfolio to earn Floor Income after December 31, 2003 and 2002. Three month Treasury bill loans are based on the last Treasury bill auctions of December 2003 and 2002 of .90 percent and 1.21 percent, respectively. Commercial paper rate loans are based on the last commercial paper rates of 1.05 percent and 1.30 percent for December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. One year Treasury bill loans are based on the last Treasury bill auctions of May 2003 and 2002 of 1.12 percent and 1.76 percent, respectively.

The following table summarizes changes in the allowance for student loan losses for on balance sheet Private Credit Student Loans for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.

During the third quarter of 2003, we reclassified these uninsured FFELP student loans and the related reserves to the Private Credit Student Loan portfolio. In the above table, the reclassification is reflected for all periods presented. The increase in the provision for Private Credit Student Loans of $18 million from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due to the increase in Private Credit Student Loans entering repayment prior to being securitized over the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2003, Private Credit Student Loan charge offs increased by $6 million over the prior year, which is due to the increase in securitization activity as we primarily securitize loans that are current leaving a higher percentage of delinquent loans on balance sheet and to the increase of career training loans as a percentage of the on balance sheet portfolio. 36 The $55 million increase in the provision for Private Credit Student Loans from 2001 to 2002 was primarily due to a reclassification in 2002 related to a change in presentation for student loan discounts discussed below, to the 21 percent increase in the volume of Private Credit Student Loans in 2002 versus 2001, and to the continued aging of the portfolio. We charge the borrower fees on Private Credit Student Loans, both at origination and when the loan enters repayment. Such fees are deferred and recognized into income as a component of interest over the average life of the related pool of loans. These fees are charged to compensate for anticipated loan losses and, prior to 2002, we reflected the unamortized balance of these fees as a component of the allowance for loan losses. In the second quarter of 2002, we reclassified the unamortized balance of these fees from the allowance for loan losses to a student loan discount and this is reflected as "other" in the above table. The unamortized balance of deferred origination fee revenue at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $130 million and $95 million, respectively. Delinquencies The table below shows our Private Credit Student Loan delinquency trends as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. Delinquencies have the potential to adversely impact earnings if the account charges off and results in increased servicing and collection costs.

Additionally, the forbearance balance at December 31, 2003 includes $9 million of career training loans in "closed school" status, whose ultimate disposition is uncertain. 3The period of delinquency is based on the number of days scheduled payments are contractually past due. 37 The increase in delinquent loans in the on balance sheet portfolio is primarily due to the increase in career training loans as a percentage of the on balance sheet Private Credit Student Loan portfolio as all Private Credit Student Loan securitizations to date have been of higher education Private Credit Student Loans. Career training loans enter repayment immediately, have a higher risk profile and less flexible repayment alternatives. On Balance Sheet Funding Costs After Non GAAP Reclassification (see "NET INTEREST INCOME Derivative Reclassification Presentation") Our borrowings are generally variable rate indexed principally to LIBOR, the 91 day Treasury bill or the commercial paper rate. The following table summarizes the average balance of on balance sheet debt (by index, after giving effect to the impact of interest rate swaps) for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.

LIBOR based debt, swapped to the daily reset LIBOR index, funds a portion of our daily reset commercial paper indexed assets, as we expect daily reset LIBOR indexed debt to remain highly correlated with daily reset commercial paper indexed assets. OTHER INCOME Servicing and Securitization Revenue Servicing and securitization revenue, the ongoing revenue from securitized loan pools, which includes interest earned on the Residual Interest asset, revenue we receive for servicing the loans in the securitization trusts, and Embedded Floor Income on securitized student loans not previously included in the gain on sale calculation, is discussed in detail in "LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Securitization Activities." 38 Guarantor Servicing Fees, Debt Management Fees and Other Income The following table summarizes the components of guarantor servicing fees, debt management fees and other income for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Guarantor servicing and debt management fees: Guarantor servicing fees $ 128 $ 106 $ 112 Debt management fees 259 186 121 Total guarantor servicing and debt management fees $ 387 $ 292 $ 233 Other income: Late fees $ 65 $ 56 $ 55 Third party servicing fees 58 61 58 Mortgage and consumer loan gains 42 13 Other 87 88 95 Total other income $ 252 $ 218 $ 208 The $95 million increase in guarantor servicing and debt management fees from 2002 to 2003 is mainly due to a $31 million increase in revenues from the percentage of collections via rehabilitation versus other less economic collection options, a $28 million increase from guarantor servicing due mainly to increased volume from United Student Aid Funds, Inc. ("USA Funds") and a $31 million increase in fees earned by our debt collections subsidiaries. The $29 million increase in mortgage and consumer loan gains from 2002 to 2003 is mainly attributed to an increase in gains on sales of mortgage loans due to the acquisition of Pioneer Mortgage in the second quarter of 2003 and to the strong market for mortgage refinancings due to historically low interest rates. In the third quarter of 2003, we changed our method of accounting for fees earned through performing information technology enhancements under an agreement with USA Funds. Under the new accounting method, we will earn revenue ratably over the life of the contract. We previously recognized revenue as services were performed. This change resulted in an $18 million deferral of revenue previously recognized under this contract and $8 million lower fee revenue over the second half of 2003. In December 2003, we sold our headquarters building for $122 million and recorded a gain on the sale of $42 million. Both of these items are included in "other" in the above table. The $59 million increase in guarantor servicing and debt management fees from 2001 to 2002 is primarily the result of the acquisitions of General Revenue Corporation ("GRC") and Pioneer Credit Recovery, Inc. ("PCR") in January 2002. Other income in 2001 includes an $18 million loss on the impairment of assets resulting from the sale of our Sallie Mae Solutions product line to Systems & Computer Technology Corporation that was completed in January 2002. The sale included our Exeter Student Suite&reg; and Perkins/Campus Loan Manager&reg; product lines and related operations based in Cambridge, MA. The sales agreement also included the sale of Sallie Mae Solutions India operations, which was completed on September 30, 2002. The total sale price was $19 million. The 2001 loss included a $22 million goodwill impairment. The net loss assumed no purchase price adjustment for potential earnouts. 39 OPERATING EXPENSES The following table summarizes the components of operating expenses: Years ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Servicing and acquisition expenses $ 485 $ 419 $ 411 General and administrative expenses 296 244 249 Goodwill and intangible amortization1 27 27 48 Total operating expenses $ 808 $ 690 $ 708 1No amortization of goodwill and indefinite life trademarks in 2003 or 2002 in accordance with SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets." Operating expenses include costs incurred to service our Managed student loan portfolio, acquire student loans, perform guarantor servicing and debt management operations, and general and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses in 2003 include a $40 million contribution to the Sallie Mae Fund. The $66 million increase in servicing and acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2003 versus 2002 is mainly attributable to an increase in mortgage operating expenses due to the acquisition of Pioneer Mortgage in the second quarter of 2003 and to increased debt management and servicing expenses consistent with the growth in the business. In addition, in the first quarter of 2003, we recognized $9 million for servicing adjustments related to an underbilling error (see "Other Related Events and Information"). Student loan servicing expenses as a percentage of the average balance of student loans serviced was .16 percent and .20 percent for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 40  STUDENT LOAN ACQUISITIONS In 2003, 67 percent of our Managed student loan acquisitions were originated through our Preferred Channel. The following tables summarize the components of our student loan acquisition activity for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.

In 2003, we grew the Sallie Mae brand Preferred Channel Originations by 37 percent and our own brands now constitute 28 percent of our Preferred Channel Originations, up from 25 percent in 2002. The pipeline of loans that we currently service and are committed to purchase was $6.6 billion and $5.6 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The following tables further break down our Preferred Channel Originations by type of loan and source. Years ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Preferred Channel Originations Type of Loan Stafford $ 10,077 $ 8,537 $ 7,182 PLUS 1,882 1,482 1,262 Total FFELP 11,959 10,019 8,444 Private 3,270 2,352 1,649 Total $ 15,229 $ 12,371 $ 10,093 Preferred Channel Originations Source Sallie Mae brands $ 4,233 $ 3,082 $ 2,009 Lender partners 10,996 9,289 8,084 $ 15,229 $ 12,371 $ 10,093 The following table summarizes the activity in our Managed portfolio of student loans for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. Years ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Beginning balance $ 78,124 $ 71,726 $ 67,515 Acquisitions, including capitalized interest 20,662 16,525 14,426 Repayments, claims, other (7,517 ) (7,672 ) (7,639 ) Charge offs to reserves and securitization trusts (108 ) (96 ) (65 ) Loan sales (38 ) (143 ) Loans consolidated from SLM Corporation (2,334 ) (2,359 ) (2,368 ) Ending balance $ 88,789 $ 78,124 $ 71,726 LEVERAGED LEASES At December 31, 2003, we had investments in leveraged and direct financing leases, net of impairments, totaling $199 million that are general obligations of three commercial airlines and Federal Express Corporation. Aircraft passenger volume began to show improvement in 2003, however, it is still below levels experienced prior to September 11, 2001 and a significant number of aircraft remain grounded. During the year, we restructured two of our leases with American Airlines and we now account for these as direct financing leases. We wrote down the net asset value of these leases and reduced unearned income by $8 million, which had no effect on current income but will reduce future earnings by the $8 million. Based on an analysis of the expected losses on certain leveraged leases plus the incremental increase in tax obligations related to forgiveness of debt obligations and or the taxable gain on the sale of the aircraft, our remaining exposure to the airline industry is $125 million. In 2002, we recognized an after tax charge of $57 million or $.12 per share to reflect the impairment of certain 42 aircraft leased to United Airlines. Additional information regarding our investments in leveraged leases is included in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES The Company is subject to federal and state income taxes, while the GSE is exempt from all state, local and District of Columbia income taxes. Our effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was 36 percent, 35 percent and 36 percent, respectively. EFFECTS OF SFAS NO. 133 DERIVATIVE ACCOUNTING SFAS No. 133 requires that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria as specified by SFAS No. 133 are met. We believe that our derivatives are effective economic hedges and they are a critical element of our interest rate risk management strategy. However, under SFAS No. 133, some of our derivatives, primarily Floor Income Contracts, Eurodollar futures contracts, certain basis swaps and equity forward contracts (discussed in detail below), do not qualify for "hedge treatment" under SFAS No. 133 and the standalone derivative must be marked to market in the income statement with no consideration for the corresponding change in fair value of the hedged item. The derivative market value adjustment is primarily caused by interest rate volatility and changing credit spreads during the period and the volume and term of derivatives not receiving hedge accounting treatment. "Core cash" earnings exclude the periodic unrealized gains and losses caused by the one sided derivative valuations, and recognize the economic effect of these hedges, which results in any cash paid or received being recognized ratably as an expense or revenue over the hedged items life. Our Floor Income Contracts are written options. SFAS No. 133s hedge criteria regarding effectiveness when using written options is more stringent than other hedging relationships. Because the paydown of principal of the student loans underlying the Floor Income embedded in those student loans does not exactly match the change in the notional amount of our written Floor Income Contracts, the written Floor Income Contracts do not qualify as effective hedges under SFAS No. 133. The Floor Income Contracts effectively fix the amount of Floor Income we will earn over the contract period, thus eliminating the timing and uncertainty associated with Floor Income for that period. Prior to SFAS No. 133, we accounted for Floor Income Contracts as hedges and amortized the upfront cash compensation ratably over the lives of the contracts. Under SFAS No. 133, the upfront payment is deemed a liability and changes in fair value are recorded through income throughout the life of the contract. The change in the value of Floor Income Contracts is caused by changing interest rates that cause the amount of Floor Income earned on the underlying student loans and transferred to the counterparties to vary. The change in the market value of the Floor Income Contracts is economically offset by the change in value of the student loan portfolio earning Floor Income, but that offsetting change in value is not recognized under SFAS No. 133. Basis swaps are used to convert the floating rate debt from one interest rate index to another to match the interest rate characteristics of the assets financed by that debt. We primarily use basis swaps to change the index of our fixed rate and LIBOR based debt to better match the cash flows of our student loan assets that are primarily indexed to commercial paper or the Treasury bill. SFAS No. 133 requires that the change in the cash flows of the hedge effectively offset both the change in the cash flows of the asset and the change in the cash flows of the liability. Our basis swaps hedge variable interest rate risk and do not meet this effectiveness test because student loans can earn at either a variable or a fixed interest rate depending on market interest rates. We also have basis swaps that do not meet the SFAS No. 133 effectiveness test that economically hedge off balance sheet instruments. As a result, these swaps are recorded at fair value with subsequent changes in value reflected in the income statement. 43 Generally, a decrease in current interest rates and the respective forward interest rate curves results in an unrealized loss related to our written Floor Income Contracts and Eurodollar futures contracts. Related to our basis swaps, if the two underlying indexes (and related forward curve) do not move in parallel we will experience unrealized gains/losses. In addition, under SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity," equity forward contracts that allow a net settlement option either in cash or the Companys stock are required to be accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 133 as derivatives. As a result, we now account for our equity forward contracts as derivatives in accordance with SFAS No. 133 and mark them to market through earnings. In accordance with SFAS No. 150, equity forward contracts that were entered into prior to June 1, 2003 and outstanding at July 1, 2003, were marked to market on July 1, which resulted in a $130 million gain that was reflected as a "cumulative effect of accounting change" in the consolidated statements of income. ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES In addition to evaluating the Companys GAAP based financial information, management, credit rating agencies, lenders and analysts also evaluate the Company on certain non GAAP performance measures that we refer to as "core cash" measures. While "core cash" measures are not a substitute for reported results under GAAP, we rely on "core cash" measures in operating our business because we believe they provide additional information on the operational and performance indicators that are most closely assessed by management. We report pro forma "core cash" measures, which is the primary financial performance measure used by management not only in developing the financial plans and tracking results, but also in establishing corporate performance targets and determining incentive compensation. Management also relies on several other non GAAP performance measures related to "core cash" measures to evaluate the Companys performance. Our "core cash" measures are not defined terms within GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. "Core cash" measures reflect only current period adjustments to GAAP as described below. Accordingly, the Companys "core cash" measures presentation does not represent another comprehensive basis of accounting. A more detailed discussion of the differences between GAAP and "core cash" measures follows. 1)Securitization: Under GAAP, certain securitization transactions are accounted for as sales of assets. Under "core cash," we present all securitization transactions as long term non recourse financings. The upfront "gains" on sale from securitization as well as ongoing "servicing and securitization revenue" presented by GAAP are excluded from "core cash" and replaced by the interest income, provision for loan losses, and interest expense as they are earned or incurred on the securitized loans. 2)Floor Income: The timing and amount (if any) of Floor Income earned is uncertain and in excess of expected spreads and, therefore, we exclude such income when it is not economically hedged from "core cash" measures. We employ derivatives, primarily Floor Income Contracts and futures, to economically hedge Floor Income. As discussed under "EFFECTS OF SFAS NO. 133 DERIVATIVE ACCOUNTING," these derivatives do not qualify as effective accounting hedges and therefore are marked to market through the derivative market value adjustment. For "core cash" measures, we reverse the fair value adjustments on the Floor Income Contracts and include the amortization of net premiums received in income. Since we exclude Floor Income that is not economically hedged, we also exclude net settlements on derivative contracts, amortization of certain derivative gains and losses, and gains and losses on sales of securities on financial instruments that were economically hedging 44 Floor Income. The following table summarizes the Floor Income adjustments for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. Years ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 "Core cash" Floor Income adjustments: Floor Income earned on Managed loans $ (292 ) $ (474 ) $ (336 ) Amortization of net premiums on Floor Income Contracts and futures in net interest income 161 227 109 Closed Eurodollar futures contracts economically hedging Floor Income in net interest income 14 109 73 Losses on sales of derivatives hedging Floor Income 94 46 69 Total "core cash" Floor Income adjustments $ (23 ) $ (92 ) $ (85 ) 3)Derivative Accounting: "Core cash" measures exclude the periodic unrealized gains and losses caused by the one sided mark to market derivative valuations prescribed by SFAS No. 133 and recognize the economic effect of these hedges, which results in any cash paid or received being recognized ratably as an expense or revenue over the hedged items life. See also "EFFECTS OF SFAS NO. 133 DERIVATIVE ACCOUNTING" for a more detailed discussion. We also exclude the gain or loss on equity forward contracts including the gain recorded upon the adoption of SFAS No. 150 that was recorded as a "cumulative effect of accounting change." The table below quantifies the adjustments for derivative accounting under SFAS No. 133 on our net income for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 when compared with the accounting principles employed in all years prior to the SFAS No. 133 implementation. Years ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 SFAS No. 133 income statement items: Derivative market value adjustment included in other income $ 238 $ 1,082 $ 1,006 Less: Realized derivative market value adjustment (see "Core Cash Derivative Reclassifications") (739 ) (878 ) (553 ) Unrealized derivative market value adjustment (501 ) 204 453 Net effect of pre SFAS No. 133 derivative accounting (1 ) (4 ) 8 Total net impact of SFAS No. 133 derivative accounting $ (502 ) $ 200 $ 461 4)Other items: We exclude certain transactions that are not considered part of our core business, including amortization of acquired intangibles, as well as gains and losses on certain sales of securities. 45  For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the pre tax effect of these non GAAP performance measures were as follows: Years ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Non GAAP Performance Measures: Net impact of securitization accounting $ (307 ) $ (282 ) $ (80 ) Net impact of derivative accounting (502 ) 200 461 Net impact of Floor Income (23 ) (92 ) (85 ) Amortization of acquired intangibles and other 34 18 63 Total non GAAP performance measures $ (798 ) $ (156 ) $ 359 Management believes this information provides additional insight into the financial performance of the Companys core business activities. Student Loan Spread Analysis Managed Basis The following table analyzes the student loan spread, exclusive of Floor Income, from our portfolio of Managed student loans for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. Years ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Managed student loan yields, before Floor Income 4.26 % 4.94 % 6.77 % Consolidation Loan Rebate Fees (.36 ) (.26 ) (.20 ) Offset Fees (.04 ) (.06 ) (.07 ) Borrower benefits (.05 ) (.11 ) (.11 ) Premium and origination fee amortization (.10 ) (.25 ) (.26 ) Managed Basis student loan net yield 3.71 4.26 6.13 Managed Basis student loan cost of funds (1.71 ) (2.38 ) (4.32 ) Managed Basis student loan spread 2.00 % 1.88 % 1.81 % Average Balances Managed student loans $ 83,332 $ 75,362 $ 70,619 Accounting Estimates Effect on the Student Loan Spread As discussed in "CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Effects of Consolidation Loan Activity" and "NET INTEREST INCOME Student Loans Accounting Estimates Effect on the On Balance Sheet Student Loan Spread," the high rate of Consolidation Loan activity affects the estimates for capitalizing and amortizing student loan premiums and discounts and borrower benefits. In response to the increase in Consolidation Loan activity, we decreased the CPR for FFELP Stafford loans to reflect the extension of the term of these loans when consolidated, which increased the unamortized student loan premium and decreased premium amortization. At the same time, we increased the CPR for the Consolidation Loan portfolio, which had the opposite effect on the premium balance and premium amortization. The net effect of this activity was a $51 million estimate adjustment to increase the unamortized student loan premium and reduce current period amortization expense for the Managed portfolio. For the Managed portfolio, the effect of Consolidation Loan activity resulted in an increase in the premium whereas the effect on balance sheet was a $19 million decrease in premium. This was 46 primarily due to Consolidation Loans making up 59 percent of the on balance sheet FFELP portfolio versus 43 percent of the Managed portfolio. Also, the portfolio of FFELP Stafford loans on balance sheet includes a greater percentage of newly acquired loans that have had little amortization and as a result any adjustment to reflect changes in estimates would be much less if all other factors remained equal. When a Stafford loan borrower consolidates, they forfeit the borrower benefit program offered on Stafford loans. As a result, we also reduced our estimate of the number of borrowers who eventually qualify for borrower benefits to reflect the loss in borrower benefits from the increase in consolidations. This resulted in an estimate adjustment of $39 million, recorded as a decrease in the estimated borrower benefit liability and an increase in student loan income. As our Private Credit Student Loan portfolio matures, we have more historic data, which we used to analyze the speed at which our private credit portfolio amortizes. Based on this review, we increased the period for which we amortize student loan discounts as a component of our Managed Private Credit Student Loan portfolio. The increase in the average term of Private Credit Student Loans resulted in a $23 million estimate adjustment to increase the unamortized student loan discount and decrease current period discount amortization income. The net effect of these updates to our estimates was a $67 million or 8 basis point increase in the Managed Student Loan spread. Discussion of Student Loan Spread Exclusive of Changes in Accounting Estimates The increase in the 2003 student loan spread exclusive of Floor Income and the estimate adjustments discussed above versus 2002 was primarily due to the lower premium amortization caused by the longer average lives of Consolidation Loans, the increase in the percentage of Private Credit Student Loans in the Managed student loan portfolio partially offset by the higher spreads on the cost of funds, and the increase of Consolidation Loans as a percentage of the total portfolio. The spreads on the cost of funds increased as we continue to replace GSE funding with non GSE funding in connection with the GSE Wind Down. We estimate that the increase in funding outside of the GSE reduced the Managed student loan spread by 8 basis points in 2003 and project that it will further reduce the spread by approximately 14 to 16 basis points upon completion of the Wind Down. The average balance of Consolidation Loans grew as a percentage of the average Managed FFELP student loan portfolio from 29 percent in 2002 to 39 percent in 2003. The negative effect of Consolidation Loans on the Managed student loan spread is driven by the same factors as the on balance sheet student loan spread, which is discussed in more detail at "NET INTEREST INCOME Discussion of On Balance Sheet Student Loan Spread Exclusive of Floor Income and Changes in Accounting Estimates." These negatives were offset by the increase in the average balance of Managed Private Credit Student Loans as a percentage of the average Managed student loan portfolio from 7 percent in 2002 to 9 percent in 2003. These loans are subject to credit risk and therefore earn higher spreads which average 4.75 percent for the Managed Private Credit Student Loan portfolio versus a spread of 1.65 percent for the Managed guaranteed student loan portfolio before Floor Income and the estimate adjustment. Private Credit Student Loans now comprise 9 percent of our Managed student loan portfolio at December 31, 2003, up from 7 percent at December 31, 2002. The increase in the Managed student loan spread from 2001 to 2002 was mainly due to the increase in the percentage of Private Credit Student Loans in the Managed student loan portfolio, partially offset by the growth in Consolidation Loans. The 2002 Managed student loan spread also benefited from lower funding costs for on balance sheet loans achieved through the refinancing of some higher rate debt that was funding student loans. Losses on such refinancings are included in losses on sales of securities in other income. 47 Allowance for Private Credit Student Loan Losses Managed Basis An analysis of our Managed allowance for loan losses for Private Credit Student Loans for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 is presented in the following table. Years ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Managed Private Credit Allowance balance at beginning of year $ 207 $ 208 $ 186 Provision for Managed Private Credit Student Loan losses 124 96 41 Other 7 (30 ) 19 Charge offs: Managed Private Credit Charge offs (83 ) (75 ) (39 ) Managed Private Credit Recoveries 13 11 10 Managed Private Credit Charge offs, net of recoveries (70 ) (64 ) (29 ) Non federally insured FFELP student loans charge offs (6 ) (3 ) (9 ) Total charge offs, net of recoveries (76 ) (67 ) (38 ) Managed Private Credit Allowance balance at end of year $ 262 $ 207 $ 208 Net Managed Private Credit charge offs as a percentage of average Managed Private Credit Student Loans (annualized) .96 % 1.25 % .78 % Net Managed Private Credit charge offs as a percentage of average Managed Private Credit Student Loans in repayment (annualized) 1.83 % 2.20 % 1.26 % Managed Private Credit allowance as a percentage of average Managed Private Credit Student Loans 3.58 % 3.97 % 5.51 % Managed Private Credit allowance as a percentage of the ending balance of Managed Private Credit Student Loans 3.05 % 3.44 % 4.70 % Managed Private Credit allowance as a percentage of the ending balance of Managed Private Credit Student Loans in repayment 6.03 % 6.27 % 8.00 % Average balance of Managed Private Credit Student Loans $ 7,311 $ 5,210 $ 3,781 Ending balance of Managed Private Credit Student Loans $ 8,571 $ 6,021 $ 4,432 Average balance of Managed Private Credit Student Loans in repayment $ 3,819 $ 2,954 $ 2,337 Ending balance of Managed Private Credit Student Loans in repayment $ 4,333 $ 3,305 $ 2,604 We own an immaterial portfolio of defaulted FFELP loans that have been rejected for reimbursement by the guarantor and are uninsured. During the third quarter of 2003, we reclassified these uninsured FFELP student loans to Private Credit Student Loans and also reclassified the related reserves. In the above table this reclassification is reflected for all periods presented. The increase in the provision for Private Credit Student Loans of $28 million from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due to the $905 million increase in Managed Private Credit Student Loans entering repayment over the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2003, Private Credit Student Loan charge offs increased by $8 million over the prior year, which is due primarily to the 31 percent increase in Managed Private Credit Student Loans in repayment; however, charge offs as a percentage of average Managed Private Credit Student Loans in repayment decreased to 1.83 percent from 2.20 percent. 48 Delinquencies Managed Basis The table below shows our Private Credit Student Loan delinquency trends as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 on a Managed Basis. Delinquencies have the potential to adversely impact earnings if the account charges off and results in increased servicing and collection costs.

Loans in forbearance represented 6 percent, 6 percent and 7 percent of total Managed Private Credit Student Loans at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Additionally, the forbearance balance at December 31, 2003 included $9 million of career training loans in "closed school" status, whose ultimate disposition is uncertain. 3The period of delinquency is based on the number of days scheduled payments are contractually past due. ACQUISITIONS On November 17, 2003, we acquired AMS. We accounted for this transaction under the purchase method of accounting as defined in SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations," and allocated the purchase price primarily to the $1.4 billion student loan portfolio and intangible assets including goodwill. In addition to the student loan portfolio, the purchase will expand our loan origination capability and enhance our offerings to college and university business offices. In addition to the AMS acquisition, we acquired several other companies during 2003, 2002 and 2001, which were not significant to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash 49 flows. These acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting as defined in APB No. 16 or SFAS No. 141 depending on the date of acquisition. The results of operations of the acquired companies were included prospectively from the date of acquisition and the acquisition cost was allocated to the acquired tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets based on fair values at the date of acquisition. Residual amounts were recorded as goodwill. In process research and development write offs have been insignificant. Unaudited pro forma statement of operations information has not been presented because the effects of these acquisitions were not material on either an individual or aggregated basis. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We depend on the debt capital markets to support our business plan and we have developed deep and diverse funding sources to ensure continued access to the capital markets as we transition from GSE funding to SLM Corporation non GSE funding. Our biggest funding challenge going forward is to maintain cost effective liquidity to fund the growth in the Managed Portfolio of student loans as well as refinancing previously securitized loans when consolidated back on balance sheet. At the same time we must maintain earnings spreads and control interest rate risk to preserve earnings growth. The main source of non GSE funding is student loan securitizations and in 2003 we had a record year in volume, securitizing over $30 billion in student loans in sixteen transactions versus $13.7 billion in nine transactions in 2002. Our securitizations backed by FFELP loans are unique securities in the asset backed class as they are backed by student loans with an explicit guarantee on 98 percent of principal and interest. This guarantee is subject to service compliance, but is not related to the Companys GSE subsidiary. At December 31, 2003, we financed 78 percent of our Managed student loans from non GSE sources versus 54 percent at December 31, 2002. As evidenced by the 2003 volume, we have built a highly liquid and deep market for student loan securitizations by broadening our investor base worldwide. Securitizations will continue to grow and are expected to comprise approximately 70 percent of total Managed debt by 2006, versus 58 percent at December 31, 2003. In addition to securitizations, we also significantly increased and diversified other non GSE financing through the issuance of almost $15 billion in SLM Corporation, term, unsecured non GSE debt. We strategically introduced several new non GSE long term issuances in 2003 to further diversify our funding sources and substantially increase our fixed income investor base. In total, at December 31, 2003, non GSE on balance sheet debt, exclusive of on balance sheet securitizations, totaled $20.3 billion, a 187 percent increase over December 31, 2002. In addition to liquidity, a major objective when financing our business is to minimize interest rate risk through match funding of our assets and liabilities. Generally, on a pooled basis to the extent practicable, we match the interest rate and reset characteristics of our Managed assets and liabilities. In this process we use derivative financial instruments extensively to reduce our interest rate and foreign currency exposure. This interest rate risk management helps us to achieve a stable student loan spread irrespective of the interest rate environment. (See also "Interest Rate Risk Management" below.) 50  The following tables present the ending and average balances and average interest rates of our Managed borrowings for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. The average interest rates include derivatives that are economically hedging the underlying debt, but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133.

SLM Corporations stand alone liquidity is derived from our modest debt maturities and use of commercial paper, $3 billion in committed bank lines of credit, short term investment portfolio and broad market acceptance of our principal asset, government guaranteed student loans. New or Increased Sources of Non GSE Financing in 2003 The total of revolving credit facilities was increased from $2 billion to $3 billion in October 2003. The current facilities consist of $1 billion maturing October 2004, $1 billion maturing October 2007 and $1 billion maturing October 2008. These facilities will continue to serve as commercial paper backstop and management does not expect to draw on this line. In May 2003, we completed a private offering of $2 billion aggregate principal amount of 32 year unsecured senior convertible debentures that are convertible, under certain conditions, into shares of SLM common stock, at an initial conversion price of $65.98. The investors generally can only convert the debentures if the Companys stock price has appreciated to 130 percent of the conversion price for a prescribed period, or the Company calls the debentures. The convertible debentures bear interest at a floating rate equal to three month LIBOR minus .05 percent, until July 25, 2007, after which the debentures can pay additional contingent interest under certain circumstances. Beginning on July 25, 2007, we may call the debentures and the investors may put the debentures, subject to certain conditions. In 2007 the convertible debentures potentially could be dilutive to earnings per share, which would be calculated using the "if converted" method. In the second quarter of 2003, we issued &euro;500 million of Euro denominated debt under our Euro medium term note program. The debt matures in July 2008 and pays interest at a fixed rate of 51 3.25 percent. Concurrently with the issuance of the Euro debt, we entered into a cross currency interest rate swap which converts (i) all Euro denominated fixed rate interest payments on the debt into dollar denominated variable rate 3 month LIBOR interest payments, (ii) initial net proceeds of this issuance into U.S. dollars and (iii) the principal maturity payment amount of &euro;500 million to $585 million which was the face amount of the issuance. Through the use of the cross currency swap agreement, we intend to hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk on this transaction. In the second quarter of 2003, we issued $1 billion of extendible notes that pay a variable rate of interest of 3 month LIBOR plus an escalating spread. The initial maturity date of the notes is May 2004. Every month, beginning the month after the date of issuance, the noteholders have the option to extend the notes maturity date to a date 13 months from the date the noteholder makes such an extension election. If the noteholder fails to extend his notes, those notes will be due 13 months after that failure to extend. In 2003, we expanded our securitization investor base internationally by issuing $4.9 billion of Euro and Sterling denominated trust debt. In the third quarter of 2003, we amended the terms of our domestic medium term note program to increase the amount that can be issued thereunder by $20 billion. In 2003, we raised over $1.1 billion in term, unsecured, non GSE debt from retail individual investors. Included in this amount was $420 million in notes linked to the consumer price index ("CPI"), further diversifying our funding sources. GSE Financing Activities The GSE secures financing to fund its on balance sheet portfolio of student loans, along with its other operations, by issuing debt securities in the domestic and overseas capital markets, through public offerings and private placements of U.S. dollar denominated and foreign currency denominated debt of varying maturities and interest rate characteristics. The GSEs debt securities are currently rated at the highest credit rating level by both Moodys and S&P. Historically, the rating agencies ratings of the GSE have been largely a factor of its status as a government sponsored enterprise. Since the Privatization Act did not modify the attributes of debt issued by the GSE, management anticipates that the GSE will retain its current credit ratings. The GSEs unsecured financing requirements are driven by the following factors: liquidity to meet the short term funding of new student loan acquisitions, refinancing of existing GSE liabilities as they mature and are not replaced by non GSE funding sources; the level of securitization activity; and the transfer and refinancing of GSE assets by non GSE entities of the Company. Non GSE Unsecured On Balance Sheet Financing Activities The following table shows the senior unsecured credit ratings on our non GSE debt from the major rating agencies.

Each of these transactions is structured to ensure that the holders of the beneficial interests issued by the QSPE are not constrained from pledging or exchanging their interests, and that we do not maintain effective control over the transferred assets. In all of our off balance sheet securitizations, we retain the right to receive the cash flows from the securitized student loans in excess of cash flows needed to pay interest and principal on the bonds issued by the trust and servicing and administration fees. Prior to 2003, all of our securitization structures were off balance sheet transactions. In certain 2003 Consolidation Loan securitization structures, we hold certain rights that can affect the remarketing of the bonds as well as a call option that gives us the right to acquire certain of the notes issued in the transaction. Thus we are deemed to maintain effective control over the transferred assets. As a result, these securitizations do not meet the criteria of being a QSPE and are accounted for on balance sheet as variable interest entities ("VIEs"). These securitization structures were developed to broaden and diversify the investor base for Consolidation Loan securitizations by allowing us to issue bonds with non amortizing, fixed rate and foreign currency denominated tranches. 53 The following table summarizes our securitization activity for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. Years ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Number of Transactions Amount Securitized Gain % Number of Transactions Amount Securitized Gain % Number of Transactions Amount Securitized Gain % FFELP Stafford/PLUS loans 4 $ 5,772 1.26% 7 $ 11,033 .92% 4 $ 6,441 1.16% Consolidation Loans 2 4,256 10.19 1 1,976 9.82 Private Credit Student Loans 3 3,503 6.79 1 690 6.18 Total securitization sales 9 13,531 5.50% 9 13,699 2.47% 4 6,441 1.16% On balance sheet Consolidation Loan VIEs 7 16,592 Total loans securitized 16 $ 30,123 9 $ 13,699 4 $ 6,441 The increase in the gains as a percentage of loans securitized in 2003 versus 2002 and 2001 is mainly due to the securitization of Consolidation Loans which have higher Embedded Fixed Rate Floor Income and the securitization of Private Credit Student Loans which have higher relative student loan spreads compared to FFELP Stafford loan securitizations. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, securitized student loans outstanding totaled $55.1 billion and $35.8 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, we held in our investment portfolio $513 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, of asset backed securities issued by our securitization trusts. We purchased these securities in the secondary market. Our asset backed securities generally have a higher net cost to fund our student loans than our GSE on balance sheet financing because the asset backed securities are term match funded to the assets securitized and do not benefit from the implicit guarantee of the federal government that investors attribute to GSE debt. The GSEs funding advantage over our securitizations is somewhat mitigated by the absence of Offset Fees on securitized loans. Our securitizations to date have been structured to achieve a triple "AAA" credit rating on over 96 percent of the asset backed securities sold. Securities issued in our typical FFELP student loan securitizations are issued with a variety of interest rate terms and in multiple currencies while the index on our securitized loans are either indexed to the 91 day or 52 week Treasury bill or commercial paper. We manage this off balance sheet interest rate and currency risk through trust and on balance sheet financing activities, principally interest rate and currency swaps. In 2004, we expect to maintain the 2003 level of securitization activity to fund new student loan purchases and continue the refinancing of GSE debt. Liquidity Risk As non GSE financing replaces GSE funding and becomes an ever larger percentage of our long term funding, our credit spread and liquidity exposure to the capital markets shifts from the agency capital markets to the corporate and asset backed markets. A major disruption in the fixed income capital markets that limits our ability to raise funds or significantly increases the cost of those funds could have a material impact on our ability to acquire student loans, or on our results of operations and the timely and effective completion of the GSE Wind Down. Our securitizations are structured such that we do not provide any level of financial, credit or liquidity support to any of the trusts and our exposure is limited to the recovery of the Retained Interest asset on the balance sheet. 54 Our Retained Interests are subject to prepayment risk primarily from consolidating loans that could materially impair their value. Our FFELP securitizations have minimal credit and interest rate risk and as a result, outside of the prepayment risk, we believe that, even in times of great stress in the capital markets, the likelihood is remote that any of these off balance sheet arrangements could be impaired to the point at which they could result in a material adverse impact on the Company. Retained Interest on Securitized Loans The Residual Interest plus any reserve or cash accounts constitute the Retained Interest asset on balance sheet. The Retained Interests are recorded at fair value at the time of sale and each subsequent quarter using a discounted cash flow analysis. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the fair value of the Retained Interest was $2.5 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. The average balance of the Retained Interest for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $2.6 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. Accounting Estimates Effect on the Residual Interest in Securitized Trust As discussed in detail under "CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Effects of Consolidation Loan Activity," there have been record levels of Consolidation Loan volume for the past two years that have a significant effect on a number of accounting estimates including the initial and subsequent valuations of the Residual Interest. As part of our ongoing evaluation of our critical estimates, we increased the CPR rate used to value the Residual Interest to reflect the increase in expected prepayments of trust FFELP Stafford loans as they are consolidated and removed from the trusts. Assuming all other estimates remain the same, increasing the CPR shortens the life of the securitization trust, which, in turn, reduces the value of the Residual Interest. We have also increased the discount rate used to value the Embedded Fixed Rate Floor Income which results in a lower valuation of the Residual Interest. We previously valued the Embedded Fixed Rate Floor Income using the LIBOR swap curve, which was consistent with the valuation methodology used in pricing and valuing Floor Income Contracts. We updated this estimate to be more consistent with the valuation of other cash flows that constitute the Residual Interest (see below for further discussion). In addition, we have responded to the recent decline in FFELP student loan default rates by lowering the projected default rates used in the valuation model. Lower projected default rates increased the value of the Residual Asset, partially offsetting other changes in estimates mentioned above. The following table summarizes the significant updated estimates made in the fourth quarter that were used in the valuation of our Residual Interest as of December 31, 2003: As of December 31, 2003 As of September 30, 2003 FFELP Stafford loan pre payment speed (CPR) 20% in 2004 9% 15% in 2005 6% thereafter FFELP expected credit losses (as a percentage of securitized loan balance outstanding) .17% .49% Floor Income discount rate LIBOR swap curve + 5.5% LIBOR swap curve Primarily as a result of these revised assumptions regarding future activity coupled with higher than projected prepayments during 2003, we recorded an after tax $161 million reduction in the value of the Residual Interest asset, of which an after tax $52 million was recorded as an other than temporary impairment and recognized through securitization revenue, and $109 million was recorded as an after tax reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains in other comprehensive income as a 55 component of equity. These changes in assumptions will also impact future gain on sale calculations and income recognition. Embedded Fixed Rate Floor Income Included in the gain on student loan securitizations of Consolidation Loans is an estimate of the Embedded Fixed Rate Floor Income from the loans securitized. Depending on interest rate levels, the ongoing re evaluation of this estimate of Embedded Fixed Rate Floor Income can cause volatility in the fair value of the Retained Interest asset. The fair value of the Embedded Fixed Rate Floor Income included in the Retained Interest asset as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $727 million and $629 million, respectively. Servicing and Securitization Revenue Servicing and securitization revenue, the ongoing revenue from securitized loan pools accounted for off balance sheet as QSPEs, includes the interest earned on the Residual Interest asset, the revenue we receive for servicing the loans in the securitization trusts, and Embedded Floor Income on securitized student loans not previously included in the gain on sale calculation. Interest income recognized on the Residual Interest is based on our anticipated yield determined by periodically estimating future cash flows. The following table summarizes the components of servicing and securitization revenue for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, of which $636 million, $839 million and $755 million, respectively, was realized in conjunction with off balance sheet transactions with QSPEs. Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Servicing revenue $ 314 $ 278 $ 266 Securitization revenue, exclusive of impairment of Residual Interest and Embedded Floor Income 269 243 192 Impairment of Residual Interest (96 ) (40 ) Servicing and securitization revenue, before Embedded Floor Income 487 481 458 Embedded Floor Income 337 364 297 Less: Floor Income previously recognized in gain calculation (157 ) (6 ) Net Embedded Floor Income 180 358 297 Total servicing and securitization revenue $ 667 $ 839 $ 755 Average off balance sheet student loans $ 38,205 $ 32,280 $ 30,594 Average balance of Retained Interest $ 2,615 $ 1,746 $ 1,396 Fluctuations in servicing and securitization revenue are generally driven by the amount of and the difference in the timing of Floor Income recognition on off balance sheet student loans. We receive annual servicing fees of 90 basis points, 50 basis points and 70 basis points of the outstanding securitized loan balance related to our Stafford, Consolidation Loan and Private Credit Student Loan securitizations, respectively. In off balance sheet securitizations which qualify as sales, we recognize a gain on the sale, which is calculated as the difference between the allocated cost basis of the assets sold and the relative fair value of the assets received. The carrying value of the student loan portfolio being securitized includes the applicable accrued interest, unamortized student loan premiums, loan loss reserves and borrower benefits reserves. The fair value is determined through a discounted cash flow analysis over the life of 56 the student loan portfolio using assumptions discussed in more detail below. We recognize no gain or loss or servicing and securitization revenue associated with on balance sheet securitizations. CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS The following table provides a summary of our obligations associated with long term notes and equity forward contracts at December 31, 2003. For further discussion of these obligations, see Notes 8, 10 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements. 1 Year or less 2 to 3 Years 4 to 5 Years Over 5 Years Total Long term notes GSE1 $ 418 $ 3,192 $ 105 $ 1,061 $ 4,776 Non GSE1,2 1,271 8,673 8,318 16,556 34,818 Total long term notes 1,689 11,865 8,423 17,617 39,594 Equity forward contracts3 1,125 467 1,592 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,689 $ 12,990 $ 8,890 $ 17,617 $ 41,186 1Excludes SFAS No. 133 derivative market value adjustments of $6 million for GSE long term notes and $209 million for non GSE long term notes. 2Includes FIN No. 46 long term beneficial interests of $16 billion of notes issued by consolidated variable interest entities in conjunction with our on balance sheet securitization transactions and included in long term notes in the consolidated balance sheet. 3Repurchase obligation has been calculated based on the expiration dates of our outstanding contracts at average purchase prices of the contracts each year. At or prior to the maturity date of the agreements, we can purchase shares at the contracted amount plus or minus an early break fee, or we can settle the contract on a net basis with either cash or shares. If our stock price declines to a certain level, the third party with whom we entered into the contract could liquidate the position prior to the maturity date. OFF BALANCE SHEET LENDING RELATED COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES The following table summarizes the commitments associated with student loan purchases and contractual amounts related to off balance sheet lending related financial instruments and guarantees at December 31, 2003. 1 Year or less 2 to 3 Years 4 to 5 Years Over 5 Years Total Student loan purchases1, 2 $ 6,060 $ 6,371 $ 2,020 $ 22,779 $ 37,230 Letters of credit2 1,437 130 1,567 Lines of credit2 905 905 $ 8,402 $ 6,501 $ 2,020 $ 22,779 $ 39,702 1Includes amounts committed at specified dates under forward contracts to purchase student loans and anticipated future requirements to acquire student loans from lending partners (discussed below) estimated based on future volumes at contractually committed rates. 2Expiration of commitments and guarantees reflect the earlier of call date or maturity date as of December 31, 2003. 57 We have forward purchase commitments to acquire student loans from various lenders including our largest lending partners, Bank One and JP Morgan Chase. With respect to JP Morgan Chase, we entered into a joint venture established solely to facilitate our acquisition of student loans originated by JP Morgan Chase. Under a renewable multi year agreement, we service and purchase a significant share of Bank Ones volume. For further discussion of our relationships with JP Morgan Chase and Bank One, see "Business Student Lending Marketplace" in Part I of this Annual Report. We have issued lending related financial instruments including letters of credit and lines of credit to meet the financing needs of our customers. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk should the counterparty draw down the commitment or if the GSE fulfills its obligation under the guarantee, and the counterparty subsequently fails to perform according to the terms of our contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees expire without a default occurring or without being drawn. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in our view, representative of our actual future credit exposure or funding requirements. Under the terms of the Privatization Act, any future activity under the line of credit and letters of credit activity by the GSE is limited to guarantee commitments which were in place on August 7, 1997. To the extent that letters of credit and lines of credit are drawn upon, the balance outstanding is collateralized by student loans. We earn fees associated with the maintenance of these financial instruments which totaled $7 million, $10 million and $11 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. At December 31, 2003, draws on lines of credit were approximately $85 million, which amount is reflected in other loans in the consolidated balance sheet. RISKS Overview Managing risks is an essential part of successfully operating a financial services company. Our most prominent risk exposures are operational, market and interest rate, political and regulatory, liquidity, credit, and Consolidation Loan refinancing risk. Operational Risk Operational risk can result from regulatory compliance errors, other servicing errors (see further discussion below), technology failures, breaches of the internal control system, and the risk of fraud or unauthorized transactions by employees or persons outside the Company. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards and contractual commitments, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. The federal guarantee on our student loans is conditioned on compliance with origination and servicing standards set by the DOE and guarantor agencies. A mitigating factor is our ability to cure servicing deficiencies and historically our losses have been small. Should we experience a high rate of servicing deficiencies, the cost of remedial servicing or the eventual losses on the student loans that are not cured could be material. Our servicing and operating processes are highly dependent on our information system infrastructure, and we face the risk of business disruption should there be extended failures of our information systems, any number of which could have a material impact on our business. We have a number of back up and recovery plans in the event of systems failures. These plans are tested regularly and monitored constantly. We manage operational risk through our risk management and internal control processes which involve each business line as well as executive management. The business lines have direct and primary responsibility and accountability for identifying, controlling, and monitoring operational risk, and each business line manager maintains a system of controls with the objective of providing proper transaction 58 authorization and execution, proper system operations, safeguarding of assets from misuse or theft, and ensuring the reliability of financial and other data. While we believe that we have designed effective methods to minimize operational risks, our operations remain vulnerable to natural disasters, human error, technology and communication system breakdowns and fraud. Market and Interest Rate Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and or interest rates of our financial instruments. Our primary market risk is from changes in interest rates and interest spreads. We have an active interest rate risk management program that is designed to reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates and maintain consistent earning spreads in all interest rate environments. We use derivative instruments extensively to hedge our interest rate exposure, but in our hedging activities is a risk that we are not hedging all potential interest rate exposures or that the hedges do not perform as designed. We measure interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for interest earning assets, interest bearing liabilities and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk. Many assumptions are utilized by management to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income, the more significant of which are related to student loan volumes and pricing, the timing of cash flows from our student loan portfolio, particularly the impact of Floor Income and the rate of student loan consolidations, basis risk, credit spreads and the maturity of our debt and derivatives.

We are also subject to market risk relative to our equity forward contracts that allow us to repurchase our common stock in the future from a third party at the market price at the time of entering the contract. Should the market value of our stock fall below certain predetermined levels, the counter party to the contract has a right to terminate the contract and settle all or a portion at the original contract price. Such settlements could result in material losses. Political/Regulatory Risk Because we operate in a federally sponsored loan program, we are subject to political and regulatory risk. As part of the HEA, the student loan program is periodically amended and must be "reauthorized" every six years. Past changes included reduced loan yields paid to the lenders in 1993 and 1998, increased fees paid by lenders in 1993, decreased level of the government guaranty in 1993 and reduced fees to guarantors and collectors, among others. The program is scheduled to be reauthorized in 2004 although management expects reauthorization to be completed in 2005. There can be no assurances that the reauthorization will not result in changes that may have a materially adverse impact to the Company. The Secretary of Education oversees and implements the HEA and periodically issues regulations and interpretations that may impact our business. In addition, the activities and financial condition of the GSE are regulated by the U.S. Department of the Treasurys Office of Sallie Mae Oversight ("OSMO"). Liquidity Risk (See "LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Securitization Activities Liquidity Risk") In connection with the Wind Down of the GSE, we have developed multiple funding sources outside of the government agency market. As a result, our credit spread and liquidity exposure to the capital markets shifts from the agency markets to the corporate and asset backed markets. A major disruption in these markets that limits our ability to raise funds or significantly increases the cost of those funds would have a material impact on our ability to acquire student loans, our results of operations and the timely and effective completion of the Privatization Plan. As discussed in detail 59 above, in 2003 we substantially diversified and broadened our investor base for both our securitizations and our non GSE debt. In 2004, we plan to continue to expand our presence in the global debt market to ensure a ready access to funding. Credit Risk We bear the full risk of borrower and closed school losses experienced in our Private Credit Student Loan portfolio. These loans are underwritten and priced according to risk, generally determined by a commercially available consumer credit scoring system, FICO. Additionally, for borrowers who do not meet our lending requirements, we require credit worthy co borrowers. When schools close, losses may be incurred when student borrowers have not completed their education. We have defined underwriting and collection policies, and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all Private Credit Student Loans. The performance of the Private Credit Student Loan portfolio is affected by the economy and a prolonged economic downturn may have an adverse effect on its credit performance. Management believes that it has provided sufficient allowances to cover the losses that may be experienced in both the federally guaranteed and private credit portfolios over the next 2 to 5 years depending on the portfolio. There is, however, no guarantee that such allowances are sufficient enough to account for actual losses. (See "NET INTEREST INCOME Student Loans Activity in the Allowance for Student Loan Losses.") We have credit risk exposure to the various counterparties with whom we have entered into derivative contracts. We review the credit standing of these companies. Our credit policies place limits on the amount of exposure we may take with any one party and in many cases, require collateral to secure the position. The credit risk associated with derivatives is measured based on the replacement cost should the counterparties with contracts in a gain position to the Company fail to perform under the terms of the contract. We also have credit risk with several commercial airlines related to our portfolio of leveraged leases. (See "Leveraged Leases.") Consolidation Loan Refinancing Risk Consolidation Loans can have three detrimental effects. First, we may lose student loans in our portfolio that are consolidated with other lenders. In 2003 and 2002, we experienced a net runoff of $84 million and $421 million, respectively, of student loans from Consolidation Loan activity as more of our FFELP Stafford student loans were consolidated with other lenders than were consolidated by us. In 2003, our increased marketing focus on Consolidation Loans generated a significant reduction in asset run off, a trend we expect to continue into the future. Second, Consolidation Loans have lower current yields than the FFELP Stafford loans they replace. This is somewhat offset by the longer average lives of Consolidation Loans. Third, as we wind down the GSE, we must maintain sufficient, short term non GSE liquidity to enable us to cost effectively refinance previously securitized FFELP Stafford loans as they are consolidated back on to our balance sheet. Interest Rate Risk Management Interest Rate Gap Analysis We manage our interest rate risk on a Managed Basis and as a result we use on and off balance sheet derivatives to hedge the basis, interest rate and foreign currency risk in our securitization trusts as the trusts typically issue asset backed securities with a variety of interest rate terms and in multiple currencies to fund student loans indexed to either the 91 day Treasury bill, commercial paper or in the case of Private Credit Student Loans, the Prime rate. 60  The following table shows funding by index, after considering the effects of derivatives, of our asset backed securities at December 31, 2003: (Dollars in billions) Index Amount LIBOR $ 17.3 91 day Treasury bill 21.0 Auction Rate 3.0 Commercial paper 9.6 Prime 2.5 Total Variable Rate 53.4 Fixed Rate 3.5 Total $ 56.9 In the table below, the Companys variable rate assets and liabilities are categorized by reset date of the underlying index. Fixed rate assets and liabilities are categorized based on their maturity dates. An interest rate gap is the difference between volumes of assets and volumes of liabilities maturing or repricing during specific future time intervals. The following gap analysis reflects rate sensitive positions at December 31, 2003 and is not necessarily reflective of positions that existed throughout the period. There were also $3.0 billion of PLUS student loans in the trusts that are funded by asset backed securities indexed to LIBOR or the 91 day Treasury bill. We hedge our off balance sheet basis risk 61 through on balance sheet derivatives, the effect of which is included in the "Interest Rate Gap Analysis" below as the impact of securitized student loans.

Long term debt issuances which are putable by the investor are categorized according to their put dates rather than their maturity dates. COMMON STOCK Earnings not invested in our business operations are used to pay dividends on our common stock and to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock. The purpose of our common stock repurchase activity is to enhance share value more tax effectively than through dividends and to enable the remaining shareholders to own a greater percentage of outstanding shares. For the year ended December 31, 2003, we repurchased 26.9 million shares totaling $822 million through equity forward settlements and open market purchases and issued 5.8 million shares totaling $40.2 million as a result of the exercise of stock warrants and a net 9.9 million shares totaling $206 million related to benefit plans. For the year ended December 31, 2002, we repurchased 21.9 million shares totaling $523 million primarily through equity forward settlements and issued a net 13.2 million shares totaling $228 million related to benefit plans. The net result was to decrease outstanding shares from 458 million shares at December 31, 2002 to 448 million shares at December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2003, the total common shares that could potentially be acquired over the next five years under outstanding equity forward contracts were 43.5 million shares at an average price of $36.56 per share. We have remaining authority to enter into additional share repurchases and equity forward contracts for 38.4 million shares. In May 2003, our shareholders approved an increase in the number of shares of common stock the Company is authorized to issue from 375 million shares to 1.1 billion shares. Subsequently, the Board of Directors approved a three for one split of our common stock to be effected in the form of a stock dividend. The additional shares were distributed on June 20, 2003, for all shareholders of record on June 6, 2003. All share and per share amounts presented have been retroactively restated for the stock split. Stockholders equity has been restated to give retroactive recognition to the stock split for all periods presented by reclassifying from additional paid in capital to common stock the par value of the additional shares issued as a result of the stock split. 63 In July 2003, the Board of Directors voted to retire 170 million shares of common stock held in treasury, effective in September 2003. Based on an average price of $18.04 per share, this retirement decreased the balance in treasury stock by $3.1 billion, with corresponding decreases of $34 million in common stock and $3.1 billion in retained earnings. Due to the highly predictable nature of our cash flow, we utilize equity forward contracts to better manage the cost associated with our share repurchases. In the equity forward agreements we contract to purchase shares from a third party at a future date. The following table summarizes our common share repurchase and issuance, and equity forward activity for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. Years ended December 31, (Shares in millions) 2003 2002 Common shares repurchased: Open market 6.7 2.1 Equity forwards 20.2 19.8 Benefit plans 2.4 4.0 Total shares repurchased 29.3 25.9 Average purchase price per share $ 31.18 $ 25.14 Common shares issued 18.1 16.3 Equity forward contracts: Outstanding at beginning of year 28.7 33.7 New contracts 35.0 14.8 Exercises (20.2 ) (19.8 ) Outstanding at end of year 43.5 28.7 Board of director authority remaining at end of year 38.4 20.1 As of December 31, 2003, the expiration dates and range and average purchase prices for outstanding equity forward contracts were as follows: (Contracts in millions of shares) Year of maturity Outstanding contracts Range of purchase prices Average purchase price 2005 10.9 $27.47 $40.17 $ 32.84 2006 20.5 33.82 41.88 37.37 2007 8.9 37.70 39.17 38.27 2008 3.2 38.64 40.00 39.28 43.5 $ 36.56 The closing price of the Companys common stock on December 31, 2003 was $37.68. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, which establishes standards for how a company classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS No. 150 also outlines new accounting for equity forward contracts. Under SFAS No. 150, equity forward contracts that allow a net settlement option either in cash or our stock are required to be accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 133 as derivative financial instruments. Those equity forward contracts that require physical settlement only (cash for the purchase of shares) must be accounted for as a liability. Our existing contracts provide for physical settlement, net share or net cash settlement options. In addition, we may be required to unwind portions or all of a contract if the price 64 of the Companys common stock falls below a certain percentage of the strike price (usually between 50 percent to 65 percent) or if our credit rating falls below a pre determined level. For equity forward contracts entered into after May 31, 2003, we accounted for these equity forward contracts as derivatives in accordance with SFAS No. 133 and recorded the change in fair value through earnings. In accordance with SFAS No. 150, equity forward contracts that we entered into prior to June 1, 2003 and outstanding at July 1, 2003, were recorded at fair value on July 1, and we recorded a gain of $130 million which was reflected as a "cumulative effect of accounting change" in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2003. For 2003, we recognized a $68 million loss related to the mark to market of our equity forward contracts. In addition, we recorded a $10 million loss related to net cost of carry of the equity forward contracts. Since adopting the standard in June, we settled equity forward contracts by repurchasing our common stock for $160 million. The repurchased shares were recorded as treasury stock at the market value at the time of settlement of $198 million. The $38 million realized gain on these settlements that was previously recognized through equity forward mark to market was reversed in the derivative market valuation account. Gains and losses on equity forward contracts are excluded from gross income for federal and state income tax purposes. STUDENT LOAN MARKETING ASSOCIATION Privatization Act GSE Wind Down Under the Privatization Act, the GSE must Wind Down its operations and dissolve on or before September 30, 2008, and until the GSE is dissolved, the Privatization Act places a number of limitations on the GSE. Management, however, plans to accelerate the Wind Down of the GSE to no later than June 2006 and is well ahead of the periodic milestones. Any GSE debt obligations outstanding at the date of such dissolution are required to be defeased through creation of a fully collateralized trust, consisting of cash or financial instruments backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government with cash flows that match the interest and principal obligations of the defeased debt. The Privatization Act requires that on the dissolution date, the GSE shall repurchase or redeem, or make proper provisions for repurchase or redemption of any outstanding preferred stock. The GSE redeemed its Series A, Adjustable Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, its only outstanding preferred stock, in the fourth quarter of 2001. Also upon the GSEs dissolution, all of its remaining assets will be transferred to the Company. The Privatization Act requires that the GSE maintain a minimum statutory capital adequacy ratio (the ratio of the GSEs stockholders equity to total assets plus 50 percent of the credit equivalent amount of certain off balance sheet items) of at least 2.25 percent or be subject to certain "safety and soundness" requirements designed to restore compliance. While the GSE may not finance or guarantee the activities of its non GSE affiliates, it may, subject to its minimum capital requirements, dividend retained earnings and surplus capital to SLM Corporation, which in turn may contribute such amounts to its non GSE subsidiaries. At December 31, 2003, the GSEs statutory capital adequacy ratio was 6.98 percent. The GSE has also received guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasurys Office of Sallie Mae Oversight ("OSMO") regarding safety and soundness considerations affecting its Wind Down. As a result, in connection with any dividend declarations, the GSE will supplement the statutory minimum capital ratio requirement with a risk based capital measurement formula. At December 31, 2003, the GSEs capital ratio under this measurement formula was 22.42 percent, which was above OSMOs minimum recommended level of 4.00 percent. Management does not expect the capital levels of our consolidated balance sheet to change as a result of this supplemental formula. The Privatization Act imposes certain restrictions on intercompany relations between the GSE and its affiliates during the Wind Down Period. The GSE may, however, continue to issue new debt 65 obligations maturing on or before September 30, 2008 although, because of the accelerated Wind Down described above, we are limiting the maturity on any new GSE debt to six months. The GSE has not issued any long term debt since July 2003. The legislation further provides that the legal status and attributes of the GSEs debt obligations, including the exemptions from Securities and Exchange Commission registration and state taxes, will be fully preserved until their respective maturities. Such debt obligations will remain GSE debt obligations, whether such obligations were outstanding at the time of, or issued subsequent to, the reorganization of the GSE into the current holding company structure. In connection with the Wind Down of the GSE, we must either securitize, sell, transfer or defease the GSEs assets by the Wind Down date and retire or defease the GSEs debt obligations. For loans securitized, the GSE retains an interest in the loans, which is recognized on the balance sheet as Retained Interest in securitized receivables. In connection with the GSE Wind Down, the GSE sold its Retained Interests to a non GSE subsidiary of the Company for $2.1 billion. The GSE will continue to finance student loans through securitizations in 2004, and intends to sell its Retained Interest in such securitizations as soon as practical after the sale. During the course of developing the Wind Down plan, management was advised by its tax counsel that, while the matter is not certain, under current authority, the defeasance of certain GSE bonds that mature after the dissolution of the GSE, could be construed to be a taxable event for taxable holders of those bonds. Management intends to commence discussions on this matter with the Internal Revenue Service and may seek a private letter ruling that the defeasance does not trigger a taxable event for such bondholders in the context of the GSEs privatization. Given the GSEs current exemption from state income taxes, management is continually evaluating the potential impact (if any) upon the Companys overall state tax position resulting from planned sales and transfers of GSE assets. The following table summarizes the GSEs asset sales (carrying value plus accrued interest) and transfers for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002.

All intercompany transactions between the GSE and the Company and its non GSE subsidiaries have been eliminated in the Companys consolidated financial statements. In connection with the acquisition of AMS, SLM Corporation contributed to the GSE $40 million of assets, net of liabilities assumed. The assets contributed consisted primarily of student loans. The following table shows the percentage of certain assets and income held by the GSE versus non GSE as of and for the year ended December 31, 2003.

The underlying derivatives from the realized gains and losses in the derivative market value adjustment on the income statement are economically hedging Floor Income (payments on Floor Income Contracts) and the debt funding the student loans in the cost of funds (primarily basis swaps) (see also "NET 68 INTEREST INCOME Derivative Reclassification Non GAAP Presentation").

The error has caused approximately 1.1 million of the Companys serviced student loan accounts to amortize too quickly or slowly, i.e., not in accordance with their repayment term. The Company took voluntary remedial action by crediting the affected borrowers accounts and took a $9 million charge for servicing adjustments in the first quarter of 2003 for the estimated interest credit. Payment amounts have been reset to the correctly amortizing amount and affected borrowers have been notified. The Company reported this matter to the DOE and met with its representatives on several occasions to discuss the impact of the under billing error on borrowers and the Companys remedial actions. Based upon these discussions and an agreement with the DOE, the Company will provide adjustments and additional future credits to the affected borrowers. The Company does not expect these future credits to materially effect the Companys financial condition or results of operations. Congress reauthorizes the Higher Education Act every five years. The Higher Education Act was originally scheduled to expire on September 30, 2003, but by its terms was automatically extended to September 30, 2004. We now expect that Congress will actively debate provisions of the Higher Education Act that govern the FFELP and the FDLP during 2004 and final action on the next reauthorization may not occur until 2005 (following another short extension of the current Act). 69 As with past Higher Education Act reauthorizations, there are many legislative proposals being advanced by schools, industry participants and other interested stakeholders. Sallie Mae has joined the "Coalition for Better Student Loans," a group of organizations representing colleges, universities, financial aid administrators, parents and other loan providers that has advanced a series of proposals designed to strengthen federal student loan programs, including: lowering the cost of borrowing by eliminating origination fees paid by needy students, raising Stafford loan limits to permit schools to offer students more federal student loans with their below market interest rates and student friendly repayment terms, making it easier for students to repay their loans by offering more flexible repayment options, maintaining a viable loan consolidation program, and extending loan forgiveness to borrowers who work in certain highly needed occupations. The Presidents budget also contains proposals to increase first year loan limits, expand extended repayment options for FFELP borrowers, mandate a one percent guaranty fee for borrowers, and phase out higher special allowance payments associated with certain tax exempt student loan bonds. Other proposals have already been introduced by Members of Congress, including proposals to provide financial incentives to schools to join the FDLP, repeal the "single holder rule," permit borrowers who already completed their higher education studies to refinance or reconsolidate previously consolidated loans and eliminate floor income on variable rate student loans. Under the single holder rule, if only one lender holds all of a borrowers loans, then another lender cannot consolidate the loan away from the current holder unless the current holder declines to consolidate loans for the borrower or is unwilling to offer income sensitive repayment terms. If the single holder rule is repealed, the Companys student loan portfolio could be subject to an increased level of consolidation activity. In addition, if the reconsolidation proposal is enacted, the Company could experience a significant increase in refinancing activity, which, in turn, would have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Finally, enactment of the proposal to eliminate floor income would decrease the Companys interest income in certain interest rate environments. Other Events Effective January 15, 2004, the President of the United States appointed Eloise Anderson to the Board of the Student Loan Marketing Association.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis The effect of short term movements in interest rates on our results of operations and financial position has been limited through our interest rate risk management. The following tables summarize the effect on earnings for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and the effect on fair values at December 31, 2003 and 2002, based upon a sensitivity analysis performed by management assuming a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of 100 basis points and 300 basis points while funding spreads remain constant. We have chosen to show the effects of a hypothetical increase to interest rates, as an increase gives rise to a larger absolute value change to the financial statements. The effect on earnings was performed on our variable rate assets, liabilities and hedging instruments while the effect on fair values was performed on our fixed rate assets, liabilities and hedging instruments.

However, as discussed under "Student Loans Floor Income," in the current low interest rate environment, we can have a fixed versus floating mismatch in funding as the student loan earns at the fixed borrower rate and the funding remains floating. Therefore, absent other hedges, in a low interest rate environment the hypothetical rise in interest rates in the above table has a greater adverse effect on earnings and fair values due to the reduction in potential Floor Income than in higher interest rate environments where the interest rate formula rises above the borrower rate and the student loans become a floating rate asset that is matched with floating rate debt. During the year ended December 31, 2003, certain FFELP student loans were earning Floor Income and we locked in a portion of that Floor Income through the use of futures and Floor Income 72 Contracts. The result of these hedging transactions was to convert a portion of floating rate debt into fixed rate debt, matching the fixed rate nature of the student loans and fixing the relative spread between the student loan asset rate and the converted fixed rate liability. In the above table under the scenario where interest rates increase 100 basis points, the decrease in pre tax net income before SFAS No. 133 reflects lower Floor Income on the unhedged portion of our student loan portfolio. Under the scenario where interest rates increase 300 basis points, the change in pre tax net income before SFAS No. 133 is not proportional to the change under the scenario where interest rates increase 100 basis points because of the additional spread earned on loans hedged with futures and swaps mentioned above and the greater proportion of loans earning at a floating rate under a 300 basis point increase in rates.
