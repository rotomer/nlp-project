Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Years ended December 31, 2003 2005 (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts, unless otherwise stated) FORWARD LOOKING AND CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS Some of the statements contained in this annual report discuss future expectations and business strategies or include other forward looking information. Those statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the statements. The forward looking information is based on various factors and was derived using numerous assumptions. OVERVIEW We are the largest source of funding, delivery and servicing support for education loans in the United States. Our primary business is to originate, acquire and hold both federally guaranteed student loans and Private Education Loans, which are not federally guaranteed. The primary source of our earnings is from net interest income earned on those student loans as well as gains on the sales of such loans in securitization transactions. We also earn fees for pre default and post default receivables management services on student loans, such that we are engaged in every phase of the student loan life cycle from originating and servicing student loans to default prevention and ultimately the collection on defaulted student loans. Through recent acquisitions, we have expanded our receivables management services to a number of different asset classes outside of student loans. We also provide a wide range of other financial services, processing capabilities and information technology to meet the needs of educational institutions, lenders, students and their families, and guarantee agencies. SLM Corporation, more commonly known as Sallie Mae, is a holding company that operates through a number of subsidiaries. References in this report to the Company refer to SLM Corporation and its subsidiaries. We have used both internal growth and strategic acquisitions to attain our leadership position in the education finance marketplace. Our sales force, which delivers our products on campuses across the country, is the largest in the student loan industry. The core of our marketing strategy is to promote our on campus brands, which generate student loan originations through our Preferred Channel. Loans generated through our Preferred Channel are more profitable than loans acquired through other acquisition channels because we own them earlier in the student loans life and generally incur lower costs to acquire such loans. We have built brand leadership through the Sallie Mae name, the brands of our subsidiaries and those of our lender partners. These sales and marketing efforts are supported by the largest and most diversified servicing capabilities in the industry, providing an unmatched array of services to financial aid offices. In recent years, we have diversified our business through the acquisition of several companies that provide receivables management and debt collections services, all of which are combined in our Debt Management Operations (DMO) operating segment. Initially these acquisitions were concentrated in the student loan industry, but through our acquisitions of AFS Holdings, LLC, the parent company of Arrow Financial Services, LLC (collectively, AFS) in September 2004 and GRP/AG Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries (GRP) in August 2005, we expanded our capabilities to include purchasing portfolios and collecting on debt in a number of different industries. The DMO business segment has been expanding rapidly such that revenue grew 55 percent in the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004, and we now employ approximately 3,500 people in this segment. 32 In December 2004, we completed the Wind Down of the GSE through the defeasance of all remaining GSE debt obligations and dissolution of the GSEs federal charter. The liquidity provided to the Company by the GSE has been replaced primarily by securitizations. In addition to securitizations, we have also increased and diversified our investor base over the last three years to enable us to access a number of additional sources of liquidity including an asset backed commercial paper program, unsecured revolving credit facilities, and other unsecured corporate debt and equity security issuances. We manage our business through two primary operating segments: the Lending operating segment and the DMO operating segment. Accordingly, the results of operations of the Companys Lending and DMO operating segments are presented separately below under BUSINESS SEGMENTS. These operating segments are considered reportable segments under the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, based on quantitative thresholds applied to the Companys financial statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Managments Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the Unites States (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions. Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, Significant Accounting Policies, includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, particularly those that include the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and are often about matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates relate to the following accounting policies that are discussed in more detail below: application of the effective interest method for loans (premiums, discounts and Borrower Benefits), securitization accounting and Retained Interests, provisions for loan losses, and derivative accounting. Also, as part of our regular quarterly evaluation of the critical estimates used by the Company, we have updated a number of estimates to account for the increase in Consolidation Loan activity. Premiums, Discounts and Borrower Benefits For both federally insured and Private Education Loans, we account for premiums paid, discounts received and certain origination costs incurred on the origination of student loans in accordance with SFAS No. 91, Accounting for Nonrefundable Fees and Costs Associated with Originating or Acquiring Loans and Initial Direct Costs of Leases. The unamortized portion of the premiums and the discounts is included in the carrying value of the student loan on the consolidated balance sheet. We recognize income on our student loan portfolio based on the expected yield of the student loan after giving effect to the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of student loan discounts, as well as the impact of Borrower Benefits. In arriving at the expected yield, we must make a number of estimates that when changed must be reflected as a cumulative catch up from the inception of the student loan. The most sensitive estimate for premium and discount amortization is the estimate of the Constant Prepayment Rate (CPR) which measures the rate at which loans in the portfolio pay before their stated maturity. The CPR is used in calculating the average life of the portfolio. A number of factors can affect the CPR estimate such as the rate of Consolidation Loan activity and default rates. Changes in CPR estimates are discussed in more detail below. 33 The impact of Borrower Benefits is dependent on the estimate of the number of borrowers who will eventually qualify for these benefits. For competitive purposes, we occasionally change Borrower Benefits programs in both amount and qualification factors. These programmatic changes must be reflected in the estimate of the Borrower Benefits discount. Securitization Accounting and Retained Interests We regularly engage in securitization transactions as part of our financing strategy (see also LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Securitization Activities). In a securitization, we sell student loans to a trust that issues bonds backed by the student loans as part of the transaction. When our securitizations meet the sale criteria of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities a Replacement of SFAS No. 125, we record a gain on the sale of the student loans, which is the difference between the allocated cost basis of the assets sold and the relative fair value of the assets received. The primary judgment in determining the fair value of the assets received is the valuation of the Residual Interest. The Residual Interests in each of our securitizations are treated as available for sale securities in accordance with SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and therefore must be marked to market with temporary unrealized gains and losses recognized, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. Since there are no quoted market prices for our Residual Interests, we estimate their fair value both initially and each subsequent quarter using the key assumptions listed below: the projected net interest yield from the underlying securitized loans, which can be impacted by the forward yield curve, as well as the Borrower Benefits program; the calculation of the Embedded Floor Income associated with the securitized loan portfolio; the CPR; the discount rate used, which is intended to be commensurate with the risks involved; and the expected credit losses from the underlying securitized loan portfolio. We recognize interest income and periodically evaluate our Residual Interests for other than temporary impairment in accordance with the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 99 20, Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Residual Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets. Under this standard, each quarter we estimate the remaining cash flows to be received from our Retained Interests and use these revised cash flows to prospectively calculate a yield for income recognition. In cases where our estimate of future cash flows results in a lower yield from that used to recognize interest income in the prior quarter, the Residual Interest is written down to fair value, first to the extent of any unrealized gain in accumulated other comprehensive income, then through earnings as an other than temporary impairment, and the yield used to recognize subsequent income from the trust is negatively impacted. We also receive income for servicing the loans in our securitization trusts. We assess the amounts received as compensation for these activities at inception and on an ongoing basis to determine if the amounts received are adequate compensation as defined in SFAS No. 140. To the extent such compensation is determined to be no more or less than adequate compensation, no servicing asset or obligation is recorded. Provisions for Loan Losses We maintain an allowance for loan losses at an amount sufficient to absorb losses inherent in our FFELP and Private Education Loan portfolios at the reporting date based on a projection of estimated 34 probable net credit losses. The maturing of our Private Education Loan portfolios has provided us with more historical data on borrower default behavior such that we now analyze those portfolios to determine the effects that the various stages of delinquency have on borrower default behavior and ultimate charge off. As a result, in the second quarter of 2005, we changed our estimate of the allowance for loan losses for our Managed loan portfolio to include a migration analysis of delinquent and current accounts, in addition to other considerations. A migration analysis is a technique used to estimate the likelihood that a loan receivable may progress through the various delinquency stages and ultimately charge off, and is a widely used reserving methodology in the consumer finance industry. Previously, we calculated the allowance for Private Education Loan losses by estimating the probable losses in the portfolio based primarily on loan characteristics and where pools of loans were in their life, with less emphasis on current delinquency status of the loan. Also, in our prior methodology for calculating the allowance, some Private Education Loan loss rates were based on proxies and extrapolations of FFELP loan loss data. We also transitioned to a migration analysis to revise our estimated losses associated with accrued interest income. Under the new methodology, we estimate the amount of uncollectible accrued interest on Private Education Loans and write it off against current period interest income. Under our prior methodology, Private Education Loans continued to accrue interest, even during periods of forbearance, until they were charged off, at which time, the loans were placed on non accrual status and all previously accrued interest was reversed against income in the month of charge off. The allowance for loan losses provided for a portion of the probable losses in accrued interest receivable prior to charge off. This change in reserving methodology has been accounted for as a change in estimate in accordance with the Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes. The effect of this change in estimate was to increase the allowance by $40 million and to reduce student loan interest income for the estimate of uncollectible accrued interest receivable by $14 million. On the income statement, adjustments to the allowance are recorded through the provisions for losses whereas adjustments to accrued interest are recorded in interest income. When calculating the Private Education Loan loss reserve, we divide the portfolio into categories of similar risk characteristics based on loan program type, loan status (in school, grace, repayment, forbearance, delinquency), underwriting criteria, existence or absence of a co borrower, and aging. We then apply default and collection rate projections to each category. Our higher education Private Education Loan programs (89 percent of the Managed Private Education Loan portfolio at December 31, 2005) do not require the borrowers to begin repayment until six months after they have graduated or otherwise left school. Consequently, our loss estimates for these programs are minimal while the borrower is in school. Our career training and alternative Private Education Loan programs (11 percent of the Managed Private Education Loan portfolio at December 31, 2005) generally require the borrowers to start repaying their loans immediately. At December 31, 2005, 46 percent of the principal balance in the higher education Managed Private Education Loan portfolio related to borrowers who are still in school and not required to make payments. As the current portfolio ages, an increasing percentage of the borrowers will leave school and be required to begin payments on their loans. The allowance for losses will change accordingly with the percentage of borrowers in repayment. Our loss estimates include losses to be incurred generally over a two year loss confirmation period. Similar to the rules governing FFELP payment requirements, our collection policies allow for periods of nonpayment for borrowers requesting additional payment grace periods upon leaving school or experiencing temporary difficulty meeting payment obligations. This is referred to as forbearance status. The majority of forbearance occurs early in the repayment term when borrowers are starting their careers (see LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENT Private Education Loans Delinquencies). At December 31, 2005, 10 percent of the Managed Private Education Loan portfolio in repayment and forbearance was in forbearance status. The loss confirmation period is in alignment with our typical collection cycle and takes into account these periods of nonpayment. 35 Private Education Loan principal is charged off against the allowance at 212 days delinquency. Recoveries on loans charged off are recorded directly to the allowance. Effective for a renewable one year period beginning in October 2005, Sallie Maes loan servicing division, Sallie Mae Servicing, was designated as an Exceptional Performer (EP) by the U.S. Department of Education (ED) in recognition of meeting certain performance standards set by ED in servicing FFELP loans. As a result of this designation, the Company received 100 percent reimbursement (declining to 99 percent on July 1, 2006 under new legislation discussed below) on default claims on federally guaranteed student loans that are serviced by Sallie Mae Servicing for a period of at least 270 days before the date of default and will no longer be subject to the two percent Risk Sharing on these loans. The Company is entitled to receive this benefit as long as the Company remains in compliance with the required servicing standards, which are assessed on an annual and quarterly basis through compliance audits and other criteria. The EP designation applies to all FFELP loans that are serviced by the Company as well as default claims on federally guaranteed student loans that the Company owns but are serviced by other service providers with the EP designation. At December 31, 2005, approximately 92 percent of the Companys on balance sheet federally insured loans are serviced under the EP designation. On February 8, 2006, the Reauthorization of the HEA was signed into law. (See OTHER RELATED EVENTS AND INFORMATION Reauthorization for a full update of the HEA.) The legislation reduces the level of default insurance to 97 percent from 98 percent (effectively increasing Risk Sharing from two percent to three percent) on loans disbursed after July 1, 2006 for lenders without the EP designation. Furthermore, the bill reduces the default insurance paid to lenders/servicers with the EP designation to 99 percent from 100 percent on claims filed on or after July 1, 2006. As a result of the amended insurance levels, we established a Risk Sharing allowance as of December 31, 2005 for an estimate of losses on FFELP student loans based on the one percent reduction in default insurance for servicers with the EP designation. The reserve was established using a migration analysis similar to that described above for the Private Education Loans before applying the appropriate Risk Sharing percentage. As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2005, we provided for additional reserves of $10 million for on balance sheet FFELP loans and $19 million for Managed FFELP loans. The evaluation of the provisions for loan losses is inherently subjective, as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant changes. Management believes that the allowance for loan losses is appropriate to cover probable losses in the student loan portfolio. Derivative Accounting We use interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps, interest rate futures contracts, Floor Income Contracts and interest rate cap contracts as an integral part of our overall risk management strategy to manage interest rate risk arising from our fixed rate and floating rate financial instruments. We account for these instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which requires that every derivative instrument, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability. We determine the fair value for our derivative instruments using pricing models that consider current market values and the contractual terms of the derivative contracts. Pricing models and their underlying assumptions impact the amount and timing of unrealized gains and losses recognized; the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different financial results. As a matter of policy, we compare the fair values of our derivatives that we calculate to those provided by our counterparties on a monthly basis. Any significant differences are identified and resolved appropriately. We make certain judgments in the application of hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133. The most significant judgment relates to the application of hedge accounting in connection with our forecasted debt issuances. Under SFAS No. 133, if the forecasted transaction is probable to occur then hedge accounting 36 may be applied. We regularly update our probability assessment related to such forecasted debt issuances. This assessment includes analyzing prior debt issuances and assessing changes in our future funding strategies. SFAS No. 133 requires that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria as specified by SFAS No. 133 are met. We believe that all of our derivatives are effective economic hedges and are a critical element of our interest rate risk management strategy. However, under SFAS No. 133, some of our derivatives, primarily Floor Income Contracts, certain Eurodollar futures contracts, basis swaps and equity forwards, do not qualify for hedge treatment under SFAS No. 133. Therefore, changes in market value along with the periodic net settlements must be recorded through the gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net line in the income statement with no consideration for the corresponding change in fair value of the hedged item. The derivative market value adjustment is primarily caused by interest rate volatility, changing credit spreads during the period, and changes in our stock price (related to equity forwards) and the volume and term of derivatives not receiving hedge accounting treatment. See also BUSINESS SEGMENTS Alternative Performance Measures Pre tax Differences between Core Earnings and GAAP Derivative Accounting for a detailed discussion of our accounting for derivatives. Effects of Consolidation Loan Activity on Estimates The combination of aggressive marketing in the student loan industry and the ability to obtain a long term, fixed rate loan at low interest rates coupled with the rise in short term interest rates has led to continued high levels of Consolidation Loan volume, which, in turn, has had a significant effect on a number of accounting estimates in recent years. As long as long term interest rates remain at historically low levels, we expect the Consolidation Loan program to continue to be an attractive option for borrowers. We have updated our assumptions that are affected primarily by Consolidation Loan activity and updated the estimates used in developing the cash flows and effective yield calculations as they relate to the amortization of student loan premiums and discounts, Borrower Benefits, residual interest income and the valuation of the Residual Interest. Consolidation Loan activity affects each estimate differently depending on whether the original FFELP loans being consolidated were on balance sheet or off balance sheet and whether the resulting Consolidation Loan is retained by us or consolidated with a third party. When we consolidate a FFELP loan that was in our portfolio, the term of that loan is generally extended and the term of the amortization of the capitalized acquisition costs (premium) is likewise extended to match the new term of the loan. In that process, the premium balance must be adjusted to reflect the new expected term of the consolidated loan as if it had been in place from inception. The estimate of the CPR also affects the estimate of the average life of securitized trusts and therefore affects the valuation of the Residual Interest. Prepayments shorten the average life of the trust, and if all other factors remain equal, will reduce the value of the Residual Interest, the securitization gain on sale and the effective yield used to recognize interest income. Prepayments on student loans in securitized trusts are primarily driven by the rate at which securitized FFELP loans are consolidated. When a loan is consolidated from the trust either by us or a third party, the loan is treated as a prepayment. In cases where the loan is consolidated by us, it will be recorded as an on balance sheet asset. We discuss the effects of changes in our CPR estimates in LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Securitization Activities and Liquidity Risk and Funding. Effect of Consolidation Activity The schedule below summarizes the impact of loan consolidation on each affected financial statement line item. 37 On Balance Sheet Student Loans Estimate Consolidating Lender Effect on Estimate CPR Accounting Effect Premium Sallie Mae Term extension Decrease Estimate Adjustment(1) increase unamortized balance of premium.

As discussed in detail above in the OVERVIEW section, we have two primary business segments, Lending and DMO, plus a Corporate and Other business segment. Since these business segments operate in distinct business environments, the discussion following the results of our operations is primarily presented on a segment basis. See BUSINESS SEGMENTS for further discussion on the components of each segment. Securitization gains and the ongoing servicing and securitization income is included in LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Securitization Activities. The discussion of derivative market value gains and losses is under BUSINESS SEGMENTS Alternative Performance Measures. CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS SUMMARY The main drivers of our net income are the growth in our Managed student loan portfolio, which drives net interest income and securitization transactions, market value gains and losses on derivatives that do not receive hedge accounting treatment, the timing and size of securitization gains, growth in our fee based business and expense control. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 For the year ended December 31, 2005, our net income decreased by 26 percent to $1.4 billion ($3.05 diluted earnings per share) from net income of $1.9 billion ($4.04 diluted earnings per share) in 40 2004. On a pre tax basis, income for the year ended December 31, 2005 decreased by 19 percent to $2.1 billion versus $2.6 billion in the year ended December 31, 2004. The larger percentage decrease in net income versus pre tax income from 2004 to 2005 is primarily due to the increase in the effective tax rate from 25 percent in the year ended 2004 to 34 percent in the year ended 2005. Fluctuations in the effective tax rate are driven by the permanent impact of the exclusion of the gains and losses on equity forward contracts with respect to the Companys stock for tax purposes. Under SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity, we are required to mark the equity forward contracts to market each quarter and recognize the change in their value in income. Conversely, these unrealized gains and losses are not recognized on a tax basis. In the year ended 2005, we recognized unrealized gains on our outstanding equity forward contracts of $121 million versus unrealized gains of $759 million in the year ended 2004. The decrease in pre tax income is primarily due to a $602 million decrease in the gain on derivative and hedging activities, which primarily relates to derivatives that do not receive hedge accounting treatment. Unrealized derivative gains and losses are primarily driven by the effect of changes in the fair market value of Floor Income Contracts and the effect of an increase in the value of our stock price on equity forward contracts. The smaller unrealized gains on our Floor Income Contracts in 2005 were due to fewer contracts being in the money to the counterparty due to spot interest rates, and to a smaller rise in forward interest rates in 2005 versus 2004. Our stock price increased in both 2005 and 2004, but the absolute increase was less in 2005 resulting in a smaller unrealized gain on our equity forward contracts in 2005. The year over year decrease in servicing and securitization revenue was due primarily to impairment of our Retained Interests in securitizations of $260 million in 2005 versus $80 million in 2004. These impairments are largely driven by the continued rise in Consolidation Loan activity. The increase in impairment losses was partially offset by an increase in securitization gains of $177 million primarily caused by higher percentage gains on the 2005 Private Education Loan securitizations. The year over year increase in debt management fees and collections revenue of $188 million is primarily due to a full year impact of collections revenue from AFS, acquired in the third quarter of 2004, and overall growth in the contingency fee businesses. Positive impacts to pre tax income were offset by the year over year increase in operating expenses of $243 million, primarily attributable to the expenses associated with three subsidiaries acquired in the second half of 2004: AFS, Southwest Student Services Corporation (Southwest) and Student Loan Finance Association (SLFA). Net income for the year ended December 31, 2004 was also negatively impacted by a $221 million pre tax loss related to the repurchase and defeasance of $3.0 billion of GSE debt in connection with the GSE Wind Down in 2004. Our Managed student loan portfolio grew by $15.1 billion, from $107.4 billion at December 31, 2004 to $122.5 billion at December 31, 2005. This growth was fueled by the acquisition of $30.2 billion of student loans in the year ended 2005, a 27 percent increase over the $23.7 billion acquired in 2004, exclusive of student loans acquired from the acquisition of Southwest and SLFA. In the year ended 2005, we originated $21.4 billion of student loans through our Preferred Channel, an increase of 19 percent over the $18.0 billion originated in the year ended 2004. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 For the year ended December 31, 2004, our net income was $1.9 billion ($4.04 diluted earnings per share) versus net income of $1.5 billion ($3.18 diluted earnings per share) in 2003. The increase in net income from 2003 to 2004 is due to several factors. The principal driver of the growth in net income was a $1.1 billion pre tax increase in the derivative market value adjustment. The derivative market value gain can primarily be attributed to the positive effect that the increase in forward interest rates had on the 41 valuation of our liability for Floor Income Contracts and to gains on our equity forward contracts caused by the increase in the market value of our common stock. In 2004, other income (which includes guarantor servicing fees, debt management fees and collections revenue, and other fee based income) increased by 18 percent to $749 million versus 2003. This increase can mainly be attributed to an increase in revenue from our DMO segment, late and other borrower fees and to termination fees from Bank One. In 2003, other income benefited from a $40 million gain on the sale of our prior headquarters building. The year over year increases in other income were offset by $369 million in lower securitization gains due to 2004 Consolidation Loan securitizations not qualifying for off balance sheet treatment and $106 million in lower servicing and securitization revenue due primarily to lower Embedded Floor Income. Net income in 2004 was also negatively impacted by a $221 million pre tax loss related to the repurchase and defeasance of $3.0 billion of GSE debt in connection with the GSE Wind Down and a 13 percent increase in other operating expenses to $895 million versus 2003. This increase can be attributed to acquisitions and increased servicing and debt management expenses consistent with the growth in borrowers and the growth in the debt management business. Also, in 2004, net interest income after provisions for loan losses was relatively flat versus 2003 caused by two offsetting factors: the increase in net interest income, driven by an $11 billion increase in our average balance of on balance sheet student loans, and offset by the reduction in Floor Income caused by higher interest rates. Our Managed student loan portfolio grew by $18.6 billion, from $88.8 billion at December 31, 2003 to $107.4 billion at December 31, 2004. This growth was fueled by the $29.9 billion in new Managed student loans acquired in 2004, a 45 percent increase over the $20.7 billion acquired in 2003. In 2004, we originated $18.0 billion of student loans through our Preferred Channel, an increase of 18 percent over the $15.2 billion originated in 2003. NET INTEREST INCOME Net interest income, including interest income and interest expense, is derived primarily from our portfolio of student loans that remain on balance sheet and to a lesser extent from other loans, cash and investments. The Taxable Equivalent Net Interest Income analysis below is designed to facilitate a comparison of non taxable asset yields to taxable yields on a similar basis. Additional information regarding the return on our student loan portfolio is set forth under Student Loans Student Loan Spread Analysis On Balance Sheet. Information regarding the provisions for losses is contained in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, Allowance for Student Loan Losses. Taxable Equivalent Net Interest Income The amounts in the following table are adjusted for the impact of certain tax exempt and tax advantaged investments based on the marginal federal corporate tax rate of 35 percent.

In addition to student loan spread related items, the net interest margin in 2004 was negatively 43 impacted by the higher average balances of lower yielding short term investments which were being built up during 2004 as additional liquidity in anticipation of the GSE Wind Down. Student Loans For both federally insured student loans and Private Education Loans, we account for premiums paid, discounts received and certain origination costs incurred on the origination of student loans in accordance with SFAS No. 91. The unamortized portion of the premiums and discounts are included in the carrying value of the student loan on the consolidated balance sheet. We recognize income on our student loan portfolio based on the expected yield of the student loan after giving effect to the amortization of purchase premiums and the accretion of student loan discounts, as well as the discount expected to be earned through Borrower Benefits programs. Discounts on Private Education Loans are deferred and accreted to income over the lives of the student loans. In the table below, this accretion of discounts is netted with the amortization of the premiums. Student Loan Spread Analysis On Balance Sheet The following table analyzes the reported earnings from student loans both on balance sheet and those off balance sheet in securitization trusts. For student loans off balance sheet, we will continue to earn securitization and servicing fee revenues over the life of the securitized loan portfolios. The off balance sheet information is discussed in more detail in LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Securitization Activities Servicing and Securitization Revenue where we analyze the on going servicing revenue and Residual Interest earned on the securitized portfolios of student loans. For an analysis of our student loan spread for the entire portfolio of Managed student loans on a similar basis to the on balance sheet analysis, see LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENT Student Loan Spread Analysis Managed Basis.

In 2005, 2004 and 2003, we earned gross Floor Income of $187 million (25 basis points), $408 million (73 basis points) and $554 million (123 basis points), respectively. Gross Floor Income is the amount of Floor Income earned on our on balance sheet portfolio of student loans without giving effect to payments under our Floor Income Contracts, which is discussed in more detail below. The reduction in gross Floor Income is due to the increase in short term interest rates. We believe that we have economically hedged most of the Floor Income through the sale of Floor Income Contracts, under which we receive an upfront fee and agree to pay the counterparty the Floor Income earned on a notional amount of student loans. These contracts do not qualify for accounting hedge treatment and as a result the payments on the Floor Income Contracts are included on the income statement with gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net rather than in student loan interest income. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, net Floor Income for on balance sheet student loans was $12 million (2 basis points), $40 million (7 basis points) and $146 million (32 basis points), respectively. Payments on Floor Income Contracts associated with on balance sheet student loans for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 totaled $175 million (23 basis points), $368 million (66 basis points) and $408 million (91 basis points), respectively. In addition to Floor Income Contracts, we also extensively use basis swaps to manage our basis risk associated with interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. These swaps generally do not qualify as accounting hedges and are likewise required to be accounted for in the gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net line on the income statement. As a result, they are not considered in the calculation of the cost of funds in the above table. Discussion of the Year over Year Effect of Changes in Accounting Estimates on the On Balance Sheet Student Loan Spread As discussed in detail and summarized in a table under CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES, we periodically update our estimates for changes in the student loan portfolio. Under SFAS No. 91, these changes in estimates must be reflected in the balance of the student loan from inception. We have also updated our estimates to reflect programmatic changes in our Borrower Benefits and Private Education Loan programs and have made modeling refinements to better reflect current and future conditions. The effects of the changes in estimates on the student loan spread are summarized in the table below: Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 Dollar Value Basis Points Dollar Value Basis Points Changes in critical accounting estimates: Effect on Private Education Loan discount $ $ (8 ) (1 ) Borrower Benefits 23 3 5 1 Total changes in estimates $ 23 3 $ (3 ) In 2005, we updated our estimates for the qualification of Borrower Benefits to account for programmatic changes as well as the effect of continued high levels of consolidations. These updates resulted in a reduction of $23 million or 3 basis points in our Borrower Benefits reserve for 2005. In 2004, based on our ongoing analysis of our Private Education Loan portfolio, we determined that the portfolio was repaying slower than previously estimated, and in response we increased the period for which we amortize student loan discounts resulting in an increase to the unamortized student loan discount balance of $8 million during 2004. In response to the continued high rate of Consolidation Loan activity, 45 we lowered our estimate of the number of Stafford borrowers who will eventually qualify for Borrower Benefits and revised the term over which benefits are expected to be realized. As a result, we recorded a $5 million reduction in the liability for Borrower Benefits. The net effect of these updates to our estimates in 2004 was $3 million. Discussion of Student Loan Spread Effects of Significant Events in 2005 and 2004 There was a record level of Consolidation Loan activity in the second quarter of 2005 caused primarily by FFELP Stafford borrowers locking in lower interest rates by consolidating their loans prior to the July 1 interest rate reset for FFELP Stafford loans. In addition, borrowers were permitted for the first time to consolidate their loans while still in school. This unprecedented volume of Consolidation Loan requests resulted in a majority of the applications being processed in the third and fourth quarters. The increase to premium amortization in 2005 can mainly be attributed to this surge in Consolidation Loan activity as we write off the balance of unamortized premiums associated with loans that consolidate away from the Company as a current period expense in accordance with SFAS No. 91 (as discussed under RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NET INTEREST INCOME Student Loans). In the fourth quarter of 2005, in addition to the Consolidation Loan activity discussed above, a significant volume of our Consolidation Loans were consolidated with third party lenders through the Direct Lending program (see LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENT Consolidation Loan Activity for further discussion). As discussed above, this also resulted in an increase in student loan premium write offs for loans consolidated with third parties. Conversely, loans lost through consolidation benefit the student loan spread through the write off of Borrower Benefits reserves associated with these loans. Discussion of Student Loan Spread Other Year over Year Fluctuations The decrease in the 2005 student loan spread versus the prior year is primarily due to the decrease in gross Floor Income discussed above. Additionally, higher average balance of Consolidation Loans as a percentage of the on balance sheet portfolio contributes to downward pressure on the spread. Consolidation Loans have lower spreads than other FFELP loans due to the 105 basis point Consolidation Loan Rebate Fee, more robust Borrower Benefits, and higher funding costs due to their longer terms. These negative effects are partially offset by lower student loan premium amortization due to the extended term and a higher Special Allowance Payment (SAP) yield. The average balance of Consolidation Loans grew as a percentage of the average on balance sheet FFELP student loan portfolio from 62 percent in 2004 to 69 percent in 2005. Other factors that impacted the student loan spread include higher spreads on our debt funding student loans as a result of the GSE Wind Down, partially offset by lower Borrower Benefits costs, and the absence of Offset Fees on GSE financed loans. The increase in funding costs is due to the replacement of lower cost, primarily short term GSE funding with longer term, higher cost funding. The decrease in Borrower Benefits costs can be attributed primarily to the write off of Borrower Benefits reserves due to the significant volume of Consolidation Loan activity as discussed above. The negative effects on the spread were partially offset by the 43 percent increase in Private Education Loans in the on balance sheet student loan portfolio. In addition to the effects of estimate adjustments, the student loan spread decreased by 74 basis points from 2003 to 2004. This decrease was primarily due to the higher average balance of Consolidation Loans, lower Floor Income and higher funding spreads on the debt. These negative effects were partially offset by the increase in Private Education Loans in the on balance sheet student loan portfolio. 46 FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES The Company is subject to federal and state income taxes, while the GSE was exempt from all state and local income taxes. Our effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was 34 percent, 25 percent and 36 percent, respectively. The effective tax rate reflects the permanent impact of the exclusion of gains and losses on equity forward contracts with respect to the Companys stock for tax purposes. The permanent differences were a $121 million gain in 2005, a $759 million gain in 2004 and a $62 million loss in 2003, the year of adoption of SFAS No. 150. BUSINESS SEGMENTS The results of operations of the Companys Lending and DMO operating segments are presented below. These defined business segments operate in distinct business environments and are considered reportable segments under SFAS No. 131 based on quantitative thresholds applied to the Companys financial statements. In addition, we provide other complementary products and services, including guarantor and student loan servicing, through smaller operating segments that do not meet such thresholds and are aggregated in the Corporate and Other reportable segment for financial reporting purposes. The management reporting process measures the performance of the Companys operating segments based on the management structure of the Company as well as the methodology used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. Management, including the Companys chief operating decision maker, evaluates the performance of the Companys operating segments based on their profitability as measured by core earnings. Accordingly, information regarding the Companys reportable segments is provided herein based on core earnings, which are discussed in detail below. Our core earnings are not defined terms within GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Core earnings reflect only current period adjustments to GAAP as described below. Unlike financial accounting, there is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance for management reporting and as a result, our management reporting is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. The Companys operating segments are defined by the products and services they offer or the types of customers they serve, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by management. Intersegment revenues and expenses are netted within the appropriate financial statement line items consistent with the income statement presentation provided to management. Changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial information. Core earnings are the primary financial performance measures used by management to develop the Companys financial plans, track results, and establish corporate performance targets and incentive compensation. While core earnings are not a substitute for reported results under GAAP, the Company relies on core earnings in operating its business because core earnings permit management to make meaningful period to period comparisons of the operational and performance indicators that are most closely assessed by management. Management believes this information provides additional insight into the financial performance of the core business activities of our operating segments. Accordingly, the tables presented below reflect core earnings which is reviewed and utilized by management to manage the business for each of the Companys reportable segments. Included below under Alternative Performance Measures is further discussion regarding core earnings and its limitations, including a table that details the pre tax differences between core earnings and GAAP by reportable segment. The Lending operating segment includes all discussion of income and related expenses associated with the net interest margin, the student loan spread and its components, the provisions for loan losses, and other fees earned on our Managed portfolio of student loans. The DMO operating segment reflects the fees earned and expenses incurred in providing accounts receivable management and collection services. Our Corporate and Other reportable segment includes our remaining fee businesses and other corporate expenses that do not pertain directly to the primary segments identified above. 47 Year ended December 31, 2005 Lending DMO Corporate and Other Managed interest income: Managed FFELP Stafford and Other Student Loans $ 2,298 $ $ Managed Consolidation Loans 3,014 Managed Private Education Loans 1,160 Other loans 85 Cash and investments 401 Total Managed interest income 6,958 Managed interest expense 4,823 Net interest income 2,135 Less: provisions for losses 138 Net interest income after provisions for losses 1,997 Fee income 360 115 Collections revenue 167 Other income 110 126 Operating expenses 479 283 308 Income tax expense (benefit)(1) 602 91 (25 ) Minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries 2 4 Managed net income (loss) $ 1,024 $ 149 $ (42 ) Year ended December 31, 2004 Lending DMO Corporate and Other Managed interest income: Managed FFELP Stafford and Other Student Loans $ 1,715 $ $ Managed Consolidation Loans 1,473 Managed Private Education Loans 613 Other loans 74 Cash and investments 267 Total Managed interest income 4,142 Managed interest expense 2,320 Net interest income 1,822 Less: provisions for losses 114 Net interest income after provisions for losses 1,708 Fee income 300 120 Collections revenue 39 Other income 131 130 Loss on GSE debt and extinguishment 221 Operating expenses 409 159 291 Income tax expense (benefit)(1) 430 65 (15 ) Minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries 1 Managed net income (loss) $ 779 $ 114 $ (26 ) (1) Income taxes are based on a percentage of net income before tax for the individual reportable segment. 48 Year ended December 31, 2003 Lending DMO Corporate and Other Managed interest income: Managed FFELP Stafford and Other Student Loans $ 1,494 $ $ Managed Consolidation Loans 1,172 Managed Private Education Loans 427 Other loans 77 Cash and investments 163 Total Managed interest income 3,333 Managed interest expense 1,681 Net interest income 1,652 Less: provisions for losses 130 Net interest income after provisions for losses 1,522 Fee income 259 128 Other income 121 123 Operating expenses 414 123 231 Income tax expense(1) 407 45 7 Cumulative effect of accounting change Managed net income $ 822 $ 91 $ 13 (1) Income taxes are based on a percentage of net income before tax for the individual reportable segment. Alternative Performance Measures In accordance with the Rules and Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), we prepare financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In addition to evaluating the Companys GAAP based financial information, management evaluates the Companys business segments under certain non GAAP performance measures that we refer to as core earnings for each business segment, and we refer to this information in our presentations with credit rating agencies and lenders. While core earnings are not a substitute for reported results under GAAP, we rely on core earnings to manage each operating segment because we believe these measures provide additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely assessed by management. Our core earnings are the primary financial performance measures used by management to evaluate performance and to allocate resources. Accordingly, financial information is reported to management on a core earnings basis by reportable segment, as these are the measures used regularly by our chief operating decision maker. Our core earnings are used in developing our financial plans and tracking results, and also in establishing corporate performance targets and determining incentive compensation. Management believes this information provides additional insight into the financial performance of the Companys core business activities. Our core earnings are not defined terms within GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Core earnings reflect only current period adjustments to GAAP as described below. Accordingly, the Companys core earnings presentation does not represent another comprehensive basis of accounting. A more detailed discussion of the differences between GAAP and core earnings follows. Limitations of Core Earnings While GAAP provides a uniform, comprehensive basis of accounting, for the reasons described above, management believes that core earnings are an important additional tool for providing a more complete understanding of the Companys results of operations. Nevertheless, core earnings are subject to certain general and specific limitations that investors should carefully consider. For example, as stated above, unlike financial accounting, there is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance for management reporting. Our core earnings are not defined terms within GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled 49 measures reported by other companies. Unlike GAAP, core earnings reflect only current period adjustments to GAAP. Accordingly, the Companys core earnings presentation does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Investors, therefore, may not compare our Companys performance with that of other financial services companies based upon core earnings. Core earnings results are only meant to supplement GAAP results by providing additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely used by management, the Companys board of directors, rating agencies and lenders to assess performance. Other limitations arise from the specific adjustments that management makes to GAAP results to derive core earnings results. For example, in reversing the unrealized gains and losses that result from SFAS No. 133 on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge treatment, as well as on derivatives that do qualify but are in part ineffective because they are not perfect hedges, we focus on the long term economic effectiveness of those instruments relative to the underlying hedged item and isolate the effects of interest rate volatility, changing credit spreads and changes in our stock price on the fair value of such instruments during the period. Under GAAP, the effects of these factors on the fair value of the derivative instruments (but not on the underlying hedged item) tend to show more volatility in the short term. While our presentation of our results on a Managed Basis provides important information regarding the performance of our Managed portfolio, a limitation of this presentation is that we are presenting the ongoing spread income on loans that have been sold to a trust managed by us. While we believe that our Managed Basis presentation presents the economic substance of our Managed loan portfolio, it understates earnings volatility from securitization gains. Our core earnings results exclude certain Floor Income, which is real cash income, from our reported results and therefore may understate earnings in certain periods. Managements financial planning and valuation of operating results, however, does not take into account Floor Income because of its inherent uncertainty, except when it is economically hedged through Floor Income Contracts.

Accordingly, financial information is reported to management on a core earnings basis by reportable segment, as these are the measures used regularly by our chief operating decision maker. Our core earnings are used in developing our financial plans and tracking results, and also in establishing corporate performance targets and determining incentive compensation. Management believes this information provides additional insight into the financial performance of the 50 Companys core business activities. Core earnings reflect only current period adjustments to GAAP, as described in the more detailed discussion of the differences between GAAP and core earnings that follows, which includes further detail on each specific adjustments required to reconcile our core earnings segment presentation to our GAAP earnings. 1) Securitization Accounting: Under GAAP, certain securitization transactions in our Lending operating segment are accounted for as sales of assets. Under core earnings for the Lending operating segment, we present all securitization transactions on a Managed Basis as long term non recourse financings. The upfront gains on sale from securitization transactions as well as ongoing servicing and securitization revenue presented in accordance with GAAP are excluded from core earnings and are replaced by the interest income, provisions for loan losses, and interest expense as they are earned or incurred on the securitization loans. We also exclude transactions with our off balance sheet trusts from core earnings as they are considered intercompany transactions on a Managed Basis. The following table summarizes core earnings securitization adjustments for the Lending operating segment the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Core earnings securitization adjustments: Net interest income on securitized loans, after provisions for losses $ (935 ) $ (1,065 ) $ (1,104 ) Gains on student loan securitizations 552 375 744 Servicing and securitization revenue 357 561 667 Intercompany transactions with off balance sheet trusts (34 ) (23 ) (7 ) Total core earnings securitization adjustments $ (60 ) $ (152 ) $ 300 2) Derivative Accounting: Core earnings exclude periodic unrealized gains and losses arising primarily in our Lending operating segment, and to a lesser degree in our Corporate and Other reportable segment, that are caused primarily by the one sided mark to market derivative valuations prescribed by SFAS No. 133 on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge treatment under GAAP. Under core earnings, we recognize the economic effect of these hedges, which generally results in any cash paid or received being recognized ratably as an expense or revenue over the hedged items life. Core earnings also exclude the gain or loss on equity forward contracts that under SFAS No. 133, are required to be accounted for as derivatives and are marked to market through earnings. SFAS No. 133 requires that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria, as specified by SFAS No. 133, are met. We believe that our derivatives are effective economic hedges, and as such, are a critical element of our interest rate risk management strategy. However, some of our derivatives, primarily Floor Income Contracts, certain Eurodollar futures contracts and certain basis swaps and equity forward contracts (discussed in detail below), do not qualify for hedge treatment as defined by SFAS No. 133, and the stand alone derivative must be marked to market in the income statement with no consideration for the corresponding change in fair value of the hedged item. Gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net are primarily caused by interest rate volatility, changing credit spreads and changes in our stock price during the period as well as the volume and term of derivatives not receiving hedge treatment. Our Floor Income Contracts are written options which must meet more stringent requirements than other hedging relationships to achieve hedge effectiveness under SFAS No. 133. Specifically, our Floor Income Contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment because the paydown of principal of the student loans underlying the Floor Income embedded in those student loans does not exactly match the change in the notional amount of our written Floor Income Contracts. Under SFAS No. 133, the upfront payment is deemed a liability and changes in fair value are recorded through 51 income throughout the life of the contract. The change in the value of Floor Income Contracts is primarily caused by changing interest rates that cause the amount of Floor Income earned on the underlying student loans and paid to the counterparties to vary. This is economically offset by the change in value of the student loan portfolio, including our Retained Interests, earning Floor Income but that offsetting change in value is not recognized under SFAS No. 133. We believe the Floor Income Contracts are economic hedges because they effectively fix the amount of Floor Income earned over the contract period, thus eliminating the timing and uncertainty that changes in interest rates can have on Floor Income for that period. Prior to SFAS No. 133, we accounted for Floor Income Contracts as hedges and amortized the upfront cash compensation ratably over the lives of the contracts. Basis swaps are used to convert floating rate debt from one interest rate index to another to better match the interest rate characteristics of the assets financed by that debt. We primarily use basis swaps to change the index of our fixed rate and LIBOR based debt to better match the cash flows of our student loan assets that are primarily indexed to a commercial paper, Prime or Treasury bill index. SFAS No. 133 requires that when using basis swaps, the change in the cash flows of the hedge effectively offset both the change in the cash flows of the asset and the change in the cash flows of the liability. Our basis swaps hedge variable interest rate risk, however they do not meet this effectiveness test because our FFELP student loans can earn at either a variable or a fixed interest rate depending on market interest rates. We also have basis swaps that do not meet the SFAS No. 133 effectiveness test that economically hedge off balance sheet instruments. As a result, under GAAP these swaps are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in the income statement. Generally, a decrease in current interest rates and the respective forward interest rate curves results in an unrealized loss related to our written Floor Income Contracts which is offset by an increase in the value of the economically hedged student loans. This increase is not recognized in income. We will experience unrealized gains/losses related to our basis swaps if the two underlying indices (and related forward curve) do not move in parallel. Under SFAS No. 150, equity forward contracts that allow a net settlement option either in cash or the Companys stock are required to be accounted for as derivatives in accordance with SFAS No. 133. As a result, we account for our equity forward contracts as derivatives in accordance with SFAS No. 133 and mark them to market through earnings. They do not qualify as effective SFAS No. 133 hedges, as a requirement to achieve hedge accounting is the hedged item must impact net income and the settlement of these contracts through the purchase of our own stock does not impact net income. The table below quantifies the adjustments for derivative accounting under SFAS No. 133 on our net income for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, when compared with the accounting principles employed in all years prior to the SFAS No. 133 implementation.

The table below summarizes the realized losses on derivative and hedging activities, and the associated reclassification on a core earnings basis for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Years ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Reclassification of realized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities: Net settlement expense on Floor Income Contracts reclassified to net interest income $ (259 ) $ (562 ) $ (603 ) Net settlement expense on interest rate swaps reclassified to net interest income (123 ) (88 ) (22 ) Net realized losses on closed Eurodollar futures contracts and terminated derivative contracts reclassified to other income (5 ) (63 ) (114 ) Total reclassifications of realized losses on derivative and hedging activities (387 ) (713 ) (739 ) Add: Unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net(1) 634 1,562 501 Gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net $ 247 $ 849 $ (238 ) (1) Unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net is comprised of the following unrealized mark to market gains (losses): Years ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Floor Income Contracts $ 481 $ 729 $ 607 Equity forward contracts 121 759 (68 ) Basis swaps 40 73 (8 ) Other (8 ) 1 (30 ) Total unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net $ 634 $ 1,562 $ 501 3) Floor Income: The timing and amount (if any) of Floor Income earned in our Lending operating segment is uncertain and in excess of expected spreads. Therefore, we exclude such income from core earnings when it is not economically hedged. We employ derivatives, primarily Floor Income Contracts and futures, to economically hedge Floor Income. As discussed above in Derivative Accounting, these derivatives do not qualify as effective accounting hedges, and therefore, under GAAP, they are marked to market through the gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net line on the income statement with no offsetting gain or loss recorded for the economically hedged items. For core earnings, we reverse the fair value adjustments on the Floor Income Contracts and futures economically hedging Floor Income and include the amortization of net premiums received (net of Eurodollar futures contracts realized gains or losses) in income. 53 The following table summarizes the Floor Income adjustments in our Lending operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENT In our Lending operating segment, we originate and acquire federally guaranteed student loans, which are administered by ED, and Private Education Loans, which are not federally guaranteed. The majority of our Private Education Loans is made in conjunction with a FFELP Stafford loan and as a result is marketed through the same marketing channels as FFELP Stafford loans. While FFELP student loans and Private Education Loans have different overall risk profiles due to the federal guarantee of the FFELP student loans, they share many of the same characteristics such as similar repayment terms, the same marketing channel and sales force, and are originated and serviced on the same servicing platform. Finally, where possible, the borrower receives a single bill for both the federally guaranteed and privately underwritten loans. The earnings growth in our Lending operating segment is a product of the growth in our Managed portfolio of student loans and the earning spread on those loans. In 2005, the Managed portfolio grew by 14 percent to $122.5 billion at December 31, 2005. As a result of receiving EP designation from ED, approximately 95 percent of our Managed FFELP student loans are 100 percent guaranteed by the federal government (declining to 99 percent guaranteed after July 1, 2006) and as such, represent high quality assets with minimal credit risk. At December 31, 2005, our Managed FFELP student loan portfolio was $106.1 billion or 87 percent of our total Managed student loans. Trends in the Lending Business Segment The growth in our Lending operating segment has been largely driven by the steady growth in the demand for post secondary education in the United States over the last decade. This growth is evident in the $30.2 billion of student loans we originated or acquired in 2005 through our normal acquisition channels, a 27 percent increase over the $23.7 billion of student loans acquired in 2004. Our normal acquisition channels exclude loans acquired in conjunction with business combinations. In 2005, we originated $21.4 billion of student loans through our Preferred Channel, an increase of 19 percent over the $18.0 billion of student loans originated through our Preferred Channel in 2004. We expect the growth in the demand for post secondary education to continue in the future due to a number of factors. First, the college age population will continue to grow as ED predicts that the college age population will increase approximately 12 percent from 2005 to 2014. Second, we project an increase in non traditional students (those not attending college directly from high school) and adult education. Third, tuition costs have risen 54 percent for four year public institutions and 37 percent for four year private 54 institutions on a constant, inflation adjusted basis since the academic year (AY) 1995 1996 and are projected to continue to rise at a pace greater than inflation. Management believes that these factors will drive growth in education financing well into the next decade. On March 22, 2005, the Company announced that it extended both its JPMorgan Chase and Bank One student loan and loan purchase commitments to August 31, 2010. This comprehensive agreement provided for the dissolution of the joint venture between Chase and Sallie Mae that had been making student loans under the Chase brand since 1996 and resolved a lawsuit filed by Chase on February 17, 2005. JPMorgan Chase will continue to sell substantially all student loans to the Company (whether made under the Chase or Bank One brand) that are originated or serviced on the Companys platforms. In addition, the agreement provides that substantially all Chase branded education loans made for the July 1, 2005 to June 30, 2006 academic year (and future loans made to these borrowers) will be sold to the Company, including certain loans that are not originated or serviced on Sallie Mae platforms. This agreement permits JPMorgan Chase to compete with the Company in the student loan marketplace and releases the Company from its commitment to market the Bank One and Chase brands on campus. The Company will continue to support its school customers through its comprehensive set of products and services, including its loan origination and servicing platforms, its family of lending brands and strategic lending partners. Over the past three years, we have experienced a surge in Consolidation Loan activity as a result of historically low interest rates and aggressive marketing in the industry which has substantially changed the composition of our student loan portfolio. Consolidation Loans earn a lower yield than FFELP Stafford loans due primarily to the 105 basis point Consolidation Loan Rebate Fee. This negative impact is somewhat mitigated by higher SAP spreads, the longer average life of Consolidation Loans and the greater potential to earn Floor Income. Since interest rates on Consolidation Loans are fixed to term for the borrower, older Consolidation Loans with higher borrower rates can earn Floor Income over an extended period of time. In both 2004 and 2005, substantially all Floor Income was earned on Consolidation Loans. The HEA requires lenders to rebate Floor Income on all FFELP loans originated after April 1, 2006, so this benefit will gradually decrease over time. During 2005, $17.1 billion of FFELP Stafford loans in our Managed loan portfolio consolidated either with us ($14.0 billion) or with other lenders ($3.1 billion). The net result of consolidation activity in 2005 was a net portfolio loss of $26 million. Consolidation Loans now represent over 73 percent of our on balance sheet federally guaranteed student loan portfolio and over 62 percent of our Managed federally guaranteed portfolio. During 2005, the surge in consolidations was abetted by new industry practices. First, borrowers, who elected to have their Consolidation Loans prematurely enter repayment, were permitted for the first time to consolidate their loans while still in school, due to an interpretation of the HEA that allows borrowers to voluntarily transfer into repayment status before graduation. Previously, borrowers typically only consolidated FFELP Stafford loans upon graduation. Second, a significant volume of our Consolidation Loans was consolidated with third party lenders using the Direct Lending program as a pass through entity to circumvent the statutory prohibition on the FFELP reconsolidation of Consolidation Loans. The HEA eliminates this practice by July 1, 2006, but we are working with others in the industry to end it before June 30, 2006, because we believe that this practice is improper and not permitted by current regulations. This practice contributed to a net run off of $540 million in our portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2005, which will continue at a high rate until this practice ceases. To meet the increasing cost of higher education, students and parents have turned to alternative sources of education financing outside of the FFELP. A large and growing source of this supplemental education financing is provided by Private Education Loans, for which we are the largest provider. These loans are primarily originated through campus based programs but this channel has recently been 55 supplemented by our direct to consumer Private Education Loans channel. The Private Education Loan portfolio grew by 43 percent in 2005 to $16.4 billion and now represents 13 percent of our Managed student loan portfolio, up from 11 percent in 2004. Private Education Loans consist of two general types: those that meet the needs of borrowers at higher education schools and other Title IV eligible schools, and those that are used to meet the needs of students in alternative learning programs such as career training, distance learning and lifelong learning programs. Unlike FFELP loans, Private Education Loans are subject to the full credit risk of the borrower. We manage this additional risk through clearly defined loan underwriting standards and a combination of higher interest rates and loan origination fees that compensate us for the higher risk. As a result, we earn higher spreads on Private Education Loans than on FFELP loans. Private Education Loans will continue to be an important driver of future earnings growth as the demand for post secondary education grows and costs increase much faster than increases in federal loan limits. We also originate lesser quantities of mortgage and consumer loans with the intent of immediately selling the majority of the mortgage loans. Mortgage and consumer loan originations and the mortgage loan portfolio we hold were nine percent and one percent, respectively, of total loan originations and total loans outstanding as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005. Student Loan Spread An important performance measure closely monitored by management is the student loan spread. The student loan spread is the difference between the income earned on the student loan assets and the interest paid on the debt funding those assets. A number of factors can affect the overall student loan spread such as: the mix of student loans in the portfolio, with Consolidation Loans having the lowest spread and Private Education Loans having the highest spread; the premiums paid, borrower fees charged and capitalized costs incurred to acquire student loans which impact the spread through subsequent amortization; the type and level of Borrower Benefits programs; the level of Floor Income; and when considering the core earnings managed spread, the amount of Floor Income eligible loans that have been hedged through Floor Income Contracts; and funding and hedging costs. The student loan spread is highly susceptible to liquidity, funding and interest rate risk. These risks are discussed separately at LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES and in the RISK FACTORS discussion at the front of the document. 56 The following table includes the core earnings results of operations for our Lending business segment.

Under SFAS No. 91, these changes in estimates must be reflected in the balance from inception of the student loan. We have also updated our estimates to reflect programmatic changes in our Borrower Benefits and Private Education Loan programs and have made modeling refinements to better reflect current and future conditions. The effects of the changes in estimates are summarized in the table below: Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 Dollar Value Basis Points Dollar Value Basis Points Changes in critical accounting estimates: Effect on premium/discount: FFELP Stafford and Consolidation Loans $ $ 36 4 Private Education Loans (24 ) (3 ) Total effect on premium/discount 12 1 Borrower Benefits 34 3 22 2 Total changes in estimates $ 34 3 $ 34 3 In 2005, we updated our estimates for the qualification for Borrower Benefits to account for programmatic changes as well as the effect of continued high levels of consolidations. These updates resulted in a reduction of $34 million or 3 basis points in the Borrower Benefits reserve for 2005 versus 2004. 61 In 2004, we increased our estimates of the average life of our FFELP Stafford and Consolidation Loan programs to recognize the shifting of the portfolio to Consolidation Loans that have longer lives. The net effect of these changes was a $36 million adjustment to increase the unamortized student loan premium. The difference between the effect for on balance sheet and off balance sheet was primarily due to a refinement in our estimates for off balance sheet loans that did not have the same effect on balance sheet and to the different mix of FFELP Stafford and Consolidation Loans on balance sheet versus the mix on a Managed Basis. In 2004, based on our ongoing analysis of our Managed Private Education Loan portfolio, we determined that the portfolio was repaying at a slower rate than previously estimated. In response, we increased the period for which we amortize student loan discounts resulting in an increase to the unamortized student loan discount balance of $24 million during 2004. Additionally, the continued high rate of Consolidation Loan activity results in fewer Stafford borrowers qualifying for Borrower Benefits. In response to this trend, we lowered our estimate of the number of Stafford borrowers who will eventually qualify for Borrower Benefits and revised the term over which benefits are expected to be realized. As a result, we recorded a $22 million reduction in the liability for Borrower Benefits during 2004. The net effect of these updates to our estimates in 2004 was a $34 million or 3 basis point increase in the Managed student loan spread. Discussion of Managed Basis Student Loan Spread Effects of Significant Events in 2005 and 2004 There was a record level of Consolidation Loan activity in the second quarter of 2005 caused primarily by FFELP Stafford borrowers locking in lower interest rates by consolidating their loans prior to the July 1 interest rate reset for FFELP Stafford loans. In addition, borrowers were permitted for the first time to consolidate their loans while still in school. This unprecedented volume of Consolidation Loan requests resulted in a majority of the applications being processed in the third quarter. The increase to premium amortization in 2005 can mainly be attributed to this surge in Consolidation Loan activity as we write off the balance of unamortized premiums associated with loans that consolidate away from the Company as a current period expense in accordance with SFAS No. 91 (as discussed under RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NET INTEREST INCOME Student Loans). Also, in the second half of 2005, a significant volume of our Consolidation Loans was reconsolidated with third party lenders through the FDLP (see LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENT Consolidation Loan Activity for further discussion of this practice), resulting in an increase in student loan premium write offs. Reconsolidation of student loans does benefit the student loan spread to a lesser extent through the write off of Borrower Benefits reserves associated with these loans. Discussion of Managed Basis Student Loan Spread Other Year over Year Fluctuations The decrease in the 2005 student loan spread versus 2004, exclusive of the changes in estimates disclosed above, is primarily due to the higher average balance of Consolidation Loans as a percentage of the Managed portfolio. Consolidation Loans have lower spreads than other FFELP loans due to the 105 basis point Consolidation Loan Rebate Fee, higher qualification rates for Borrower Benefits, and higher funding costs due to their longer terms. These negative effects are partially offset by lower student loan premium amortization due to the extended term and a higher SAP yield. The average balance of Consolidation Loans grew as a percentage of the average Managed FFELP student loan portfolio from 46 percent in 2004 to 56 percent in 2005. In 2005, our Managed student loan spread was impacted by higher spreads on our debt funding student loans, which was partially offset by the absence of Offset Fees. The increase in funding costs is due to the replacement of lower cost, primarily short term GSE funding with longer term, higher cost funding in connection with the GSE Wind Down. 62 The 2005 student loan spread benefited from the increase in the average balance of Managed Private Education Loans as a percentage of the average Managed student loan portfolio from 11 percent in 2004 to 12 percent in 2005. Private Education Loans are subject to credit risk and therefore earn higher spreads which averaged 4.62 percent for the year ended December 31, 2005 versus a spread of 1.39 percent for the Managed guaranteed student loan portfolio, excluding the impact from the update to our estimates for the qualification for Borrower Benefits. Floor Income For on balance sheet student loans, gross Floor Income is included in student loan income whereas payments on Floor Income Contracts are included in the gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net line in other income. The following table summarizes the components of Floor Income from on balance sheet student loans, net of payments under Floor Income Contracts, for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

These factors more than offset the increase in Consolidation Loans eligible to earn fixed rate Floor Income. As discussed in more detail under LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Securitization Activities, when we securitize a portfolio of student loans, we estimate the future Fixed Rate Embedded Floor Income earned on off balance sheet student loans using a discounted cash flow option pricing model and recognize the fair value of such cash flows in the initial gain on sale and subsequent valuations of the Residual Interest. Variable Rate Embedded Floor Income is recognized as earned in servicing and securitization revenue. 63 Student Loan Floor Income Contracts The following table analyzes the ability of the FFELP student loans in our Managed student loan portfolio to earn Floor Income after December 31, 2005 and 2004. December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 (Dollars in billions) Fixed borrower Rate Variable borrower rate Total Fixed borrower Rate Variable borrower rate Total Student loans eligible to earn Floor Income: On balance sheet student loans $ 53.4 $ 16.0 $ 69.4 $ 40.5 $ 14.0 $ 54.5 Off balance sheet student loans 10.3 18.4 28.7 7.4 24.6 32.0 Managed student loans eligible to earn Floor Income 63.7 34.4 98.1 47.9 38.6 86.5 Less: notional amount of floor swap/debt contracts (1.2 ) (1.2 ) Less: notional amount of Floor Income Contracts (25.1 ) (25.1 ) (26.6 ) (26.6 ) Total economically hedged Floor Income Contracts (25.1 ) (25.1 ) (27.8 ) (27.8 ) Net Managed student loans eligible to earn Floor Income $ 38.6 $ 34.4 $ 73.0 $ 20.1 $ 38.6 $ 58.7 Net Managed student loans earning Floor Income $ 0.8 $ $ 0.8 $ 2.4 $ $ 2.4 The reconsolidation of Consolidation Loans has had an impact on the Floor Income Contracts economically hedging the fixed borrower interest rate earned on Consolidation Loans. All Consolidation Loans are eligible to earn Floor Income, and over time we have sold Floor Income Contracts to hedge the potential Floor Income from specifically identified Consolidation Loans. The sale of the Floor Income Contracts did not anticipate the reconsolidation of Consolidation Loans and as a consequence we are losing higher rate Consolidation Loans that underlie the contracts. As a result, as of December 31, 2005, the notional amount of Floor Income Contracts roughly equals the outstanding balance of the Consolidation Loans that the Floor Income Contracts were sold against. Recently passed legislation discontinues reconsolidation June 30, 2006, although there is a chance it may be ended sooner. Since we are at parity between the loans and contracts at December 31, 2005, loans reconsolidating in 2006 would potentially put us in an oversold position during 2006 related to our Floor Income Contracts. However, we do not believe that the volume of reconsolidation will create a material oversold position vis vis the $25 billion of Consolidation Loans now hedged by Floor Income Contracts at December 31, 2005. The following table presents a projection of the average Managed balance of Consolidation Loans whose Fixed Rate Floor Income has already been economically hedged through Floor Income Contracts for the period January 1, 2006 to March 31, 2010. These loans are both on and off balance sheet and the related hedges do not qualify under SFAS No. 133 accounting as effective hedges. (Dollars in billions) 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Average balance of Consolidation Loans whose Floor Income is economically hedged (Managed Basis) $ 25 $ 16 $ 15 $ 10 $ 2 64 Private Education Loans Allowance for Private Education Loan Losses Change in Accounting Estimate to the Allowance for Loan Losses and the Recognition of Accrued Interest Income for Private Education Loans We maintain an allowance for loan losses at an amount sufficient to absorb losses inherent in our Private Education Loan portfolio at the reporting date based on a projection of probable net credit losses. The maturing of our Private Education Loan portfolios has provided us with more historical data on borrower default behavior such that we now analyze those portfolios to determine the effects that the various stages of delinquency have on borrower default behavior and ultimate charge off. As a result, in the second quarter of 2005, we changed our estimate of the allowance for loan losses for our Managed loan portfolio using a migration analysis of delinquent and current accounts. A migration analysis is a technique used to estimate the likelihood that a loan receivable may progress through the various delinquency stages and ultimately charge off. This is a widely used reserving methodology in the consumer finance industry. Previously, we calculated the allowance for Private Education Loan losses by estimating the probable losses in the portfolio based primarily on loan characteristics and where pools of loans were in their life with less emphasis on current delinquency status of the loan. Also, in our prior methodology for calculating the allowance, some loss rates were based on proxies and extrapolations of FFELP loan loss data. We also used a migration analysis to revise our estimates pertaining to our non accrual policy for interest income. Under the new methodology, we estimate the amount of uncollectible accrued interest on Private Education Loans and write it off against current period interest income. Under our prior methodology, Private Education Loans continued to accrue interest, including in periods of forbearance, until they were charged off, at which time the loans were placed on non accrual status and all previously accrued interest was reversed against income in the month of charge off. The allowance for loan losses provided for a portion of the probable losses in accrued interest receivable prior to charge off. This change in reserving methodology has been accounted for as a change in estimate in accordance with APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes. The effect of this change in estimate was to increase the value of the allowance by $40 million and to reduce student loan interest income for the estimate of uncollectible accrued interest receivable by $14 million. On the income statement, adjustments to the allowance are recorded through the provisions for loan losses whereas adjustments to accrued interest are recorded in interest income. On a Managed Basis, we decreased the allowance for loan losses by $20 million and reduced student loan interest income by $16 million for uncollectible accrued interest. We continue to gain experience in analyzing our Private Education Loan portfolios and as a result, we have developed additional data to better estimate the amount of recoveries on defaulted loans. During the third quarter of 2005, we changed our methodology for estimating the amount of charged off student loans that will ultimately be recovered, which resulted in a $49 million decrease in the value of the allowance through the provisions for loan losses. On a Managed Basis, we decreased the allowance for loan losses by $65 million to recognize the effect of this change. The following table provides a summary of the income statement impact of the change in accounting estimate and change in recovery methodology on the allowance for loan losses. On Balance Sheet Off Balance Sheet Managed Basis Impact on provisions: Impact of change in allowance estimate $ 40 $ (60 ) $ (20 ) Impact of change in recovery estimate (49 ) (16 ) (65 ) Total impact from changes in estimates $ (9 ) $ (76 ) $ (85 ) 65 The difference in the impact of the change in estimate on the allowance for loan losses between our on balance sheet and our Managed results is due to the difference in the mix of Private Education Loans on and off balance sheet. Certain loan types with higher expected default rates, such as career training and those loan programs targeted to borrowers with lower FICO scores, have not yet been securitized and as such the on balance sheet portfolio contains loans with higher delinquency rates. Because the required allowance under the new methodology is more directly tied to the current status of the portfolio, the on balance sheet portfolio reserve requirements increased while at the same time the off balance sheet portfolio reserve requirements decreased with the net effect being a decrease in the Managed Basis allowance. The difference in the composition of our on balance sheet and off balance sheet portfolios also caused the disparity in the impact of the change in recovery methodology for loans on balance sheet versus off balance sheet. The on balance sheet portfolio has higher expected gross charge offs and was therefore more heavily affected by the change in estimate on the related expected recoveries. During the year there is seasonality in the provisions for loan losses that is primarily driven by the seasonality of loans entering repayment. The majority of loans typically enter repayment in the second and fourth quarters. This increase in loans entering repayment often leads to a near term increase in early stage delinquencies or forbearance usage in the first and third quarters for the affected borrowers, which in turn leads to a spike in the provisions for those quarters. Therefore, all other factors being equal, the provisions for loan losses will be higher in the first and third quarters. Activity in the Allowance for Private Education Loan Losses As discussed in detail under CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES, the provisions for student loan losses represents the periodic expense of maintaining an allowance sufficient to absorb losses, net of recoveries, inherent in the portfolio of Private Education Loans. 66 The following table summarizes changes in the allowance for Private Education Loan losses for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

When we securitize Private Education Loans, we no longer legally own the loans and they are accounted for off balance sheet. For our Managed presentation in the table above, we reduce the on balance sheet allowance for amounts previously provided and then provide for these loans in the off balance sheet section with the total of both on and off balance sheet residing in the Managed presentation. When Private Education Loans in the majority of our securitized trusts become 180 days delinquent, we typically exercise our contingent call option to repurchase these loans at par value out of the trust and record a loss for the difference in the par value paid and the fair market value of the loan at the time of purchase. If these loans reach the 212 day delinquency, a charge off for the remaining balance of the loan is triggered. On a Managed Basis, the losses recorded under GAAP for loans repurchased at day 180 are reversed and the full amount is charged off at day 212. The off balance sheet allowance is increasing as more loans are securitized but is lower than the on balance sheet percentage when measured as a percentage of ending loans in repayment because of the different mix of loans on balance sheet and off balance sheet, as described above. Additionally, a larger percentage of the off balance sheet loan borrowers are still in school status and not required to make payments on their loans. Once repayment begins, the allowance requirements increase to reflect the increased risk of loss as loans enter repayment. 67 Managed Basis Private Education Loan Loss Allowance Discussion The decrease in the allowance as a percentage of ending loans in repayment is due to the change in methodology for estimating the allowance for loan loss primarily by reducing the loss confirmation period, and to the increase in the period of time for estimating future recoveries discussed in detail above. The year over year allowance on a Managed Basis increased by $52 million from 2004 to 2005, exclusive of the adjustments related to these changes in estimate and methodology. This increase was primarily driven by the 37 percent year over year increase in average loans in repayment. As a result of the change in the loan loss and recovery estimates discussed above, the allowance as a percentage of ending loans in repayment decreased from 5.08 percent to 3.40 percent, and consequently the year over year growth rate in the provision is less than the growth rate in the portfolio. The increase in the provision for Managed Private Education Loans of $41 million from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to the $2.3 billion increase in Managed Private Education Loans that have transitioned to out of school status over the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2004, Private Education Loan charge offs increased by $33 million over the prior year, which is due primarily to the continued growth and maturity of loans in repayment. As discussed further below, while the delinquency and forbearance amounts fluctuate from quarter to quarter, they will increase with the growth in the repayment portfolio. We utilize our debt management operations to minimize charge offs in our own portfolio and to increase recoveries on charged off loans. The allowance as a percentage of loans in repayment decreased year over year from 5.86 percent to 5.08 percent. This reduction is primarily attributable to updates in our default assumptions in the third quarter of 2004. Delinquencies The table below presents our Private Education Loan delinquency trends as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Delinquencies have the potential to adversely impact earnings through increased servicing and collection costs in the event the delinquent accounts charge off.

These loans generally supplement federally guaranteed student loans, which are subject to federal lending caps. Private Education Loans are not guaranteed or insured against any loss of principal or interest. Traditional student borrowers use the proceeds of these loans to obtain higher education, which increases the likelihood of obtaining employment at higher income levels than would be available without the additional education. As a result, the borrowers repayment capability improves between the time the loan is made and the time they enter the post education work force. We generally allow the loan repayment period on traditional Private Education Loans, except those generated by our SLM Financial subsidiary, to begin six to nine months after the student leaves school. This provides the borrower time to obtain a job to service his or her debt. For borrowers that need more time or experience other hardships, we permit additional delays in payment or partial payments (both referred to as forbearances) when we believe additional time will improve the borrowers ability to repay the loan. Forbearance is also granted to borrowers who may experience temporary hardship after entering repayment, when we believe that it will increase the likelihood of ultimate collection of the loan. Such forbearance is only granted within established guidelines and is closely monitored for compliance. Our policy does not grant any reduction in the repayment obligation (principal or interest) but does allow the borrower to stop or reduce monthly payments for an agreed period of time. When a loan that was delinquent prior to receiving forbearance, ends forbearance and re enters repayment, that loan is considered current. Forbearance is used most heavily immediately after the loan enters repayment. As indicated in the tables below showing the composition and status of the Managed Private Education Loan portfolio by number of months aged from the first date of repayment, the percentage of loans in forbearance decreases the longer the loans have been in repayment. At December 31, 2005, loans in forbearance as a percentage of loans in repayment and forbearance is 12.2 percent for loans that have been in repayment one to twenty four months. The percentage drops to 4.7 percent for loans that have been in repayment more than 48 months. Approximately 73 percent of our Managed Private Education Loans in forbearance have been in repayment less than 24 months. These borrowers are essentially extending their grace period as they transition to the workforce. Forbearance continues to be a positive collection tool for the Private Education Loans as we believe it can provide the borrower with sufficient time to obtain employment and income to support his or her obligation. We consider the potential impact of forbearance in the determination of the loan loss reserves. 70 The tables below show the composition and status of the Private Education Loan portfolio by number of months aged from the first date of repayment: Months since entering repayment December 31, 2005 1 to 24 months 25 to 48 months More than 48 months After Dec. 31, 2005(1) Total Loans in school/grace/deferment $ $ $ $ 7,980 $ 7,980 Loans in forbearance 667 173 77 917 Loans in repayment current 4,508 1,796 1,453 7,757 Loans in repayment delinquent 31 60 days 168 78 56 302 Loans in repayment delinquent 61 90 days 63 30 19 112 Loans in repayment delinquent greater than 90 days 72 44 28 144 Total $ 5,478 $ 2,121 $ 1,633 $ 7,980 $ 17,212 Unamortized discount (493 ) Allowance for loan losses (282 ) Total Managed Private Education Loans, net $ 16,437 Loans in forbearance as a percentage of loans in repayment and forbearance 12.2 % 8.2 % 4.7 % % 9.9 % Months since entering repayment December 31, 2004 1 to 24 months 25 to 48 months More than 48 months After Dec. 31, 2004(1) Total Loans in school/grace/deferment $ $ $ $ 5,409 $ 5,409 Loans in forbearance 350 103 47 500 Loans in repayment current 3,228 1,401 1,117 5,746 Loans in repayment delinquent 31 60 days 110 59 39 208 Loans in repayment delinquent 61 90 days 43 26 15 84 Loans in repayment delinquent greater than 90 days 67 56 33 156 Total $ 3,798 $ 1,645 $ 1,251 $ 5,409 $ 12,103 Unamortized discount (306 ) Allowance for loan losses (315 ) Total Managed Private Education Loans, net $ 11,482 Loans in forbearance as a percentage of loans in repayment and forbearance 9.2 % 6.3 % 3.8 % % 7.5 % Months since entering repayment December 31, 2003 1 to 24 months 25 to 48 months More than 48 months After Dec. 31, 2003(1) Total Loans in school/grace/deferment $ $ $ $ 3,828 $ 3,828 Loans in forbearance 342 100 49 491 Loans in repayment current 2,192 1,074 798 4,064 Loans in repayment delinquent 31 60 days 75 46 33 154 Loans in repayment delinquent 61 90 days 34 27 16 77 Loans in repayment delinquent greater than 90 days 48 42 36 126 Total $ 2,691 $ 1,289 $ 932 $ 3,828 $ 8,740 Unamortized discount (176 ) Allowance for loan losses (259 ) Total Managed Private Education Loans, net $ 8,305 Loans in forbearance as a percentage of loans in repayment and forbearance 12.7 % 7.8 % 5.3 % % 10.0 % (1) Includes all loans in school/grace/deferment. 71 The year over year increase in forbearance as a percentage of loans in repayment and forbearance is due primarily to the increase in collections staffing in response to the seasonality of the loans entering repayment. This increase in staffing has resulted in an increase in cash collections, lower delinquency percentages, as well as an increase in the use of forbearance for those student borrowers that are in need of short term forbearance in order to make timely payments as they have recently graduated. On a percentage basis, the figures are within management expectations. The table below stratifies the portfolio of Managed Private Education Loans in forbearance by the cumulative number of months the borrower has used forbearance as of the dates indicated. As detailed in the table below, seven percent of loans currently in forbearance have cumulative forbearance of more than 24 months, which is a decrease from the prior two years.

(See OTHER RELATED EVENTS AND INFORMATION Reauthorization for a detailed discussion on the Reauthorization Legislation and its impact on the Company.) The Reauthorization Legislation reduces the level of default insurance to 97 percent from 98 percent (effectively increasing Risk Sharing from two percent to three percent) on loans disbursed after July 1, 2006 for lenders without EP designation. Furthermore, the Reauthorization Legislation reduces the default insurance paid to lenders/servicers with the EP designation to 99 percent from 100 percent on claims filed on or after July 1, 2006. As a result of the amended insurance levels, we established a Risk Sharing allowance as of December 31, 2005 for an estimate of losses on FFELP student loans based on the one percent reduction in default insurance for servicers with the EP designation. The reserve was established using a migration analysis similar to that described above for the Private Education Loans before applying the appropriate Risk Sharing percentage. As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2005, we provided for additional reserves of $10 million for on balance sheet FFELP loans and $19 million for Managed FFELP loans. Total Loan Net Charge offs The following tables summarize the net charge offs for all loan types on both an on balance sheet basis and a Managed Basis for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. 72 Total on balance sheet loan net charge offs Years ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Private Education Loans $ 135 $ 96 $ 72 FFELP Stafford and Other Student Loans 4 7 10 Mortgage and consumer loans 5 6 5 Total on balance sheet loan net charge offs $ 144 $ 109 $ 87 Total Managed loan net charge offs Years ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Private Education Loans $ 137 $ 102 $ 72 FFELP Stafford and Other Student Loans 4 19 23 Mortgage and consumer loans 5 6 5 Total Managed loan net charge offs $ 146 $ 127 $ 100 The decrease in FFELP Stafford and Other Student Loans charge offs in 2005 is due to the Company earning the EP designation in the fourth quarter of 2004. However, recently passed legislation will reduce the default insurance on loans serviced under the EP designation to 99 percent from 100 percent for claims filed on or after July 1, 2006. Other Income, Net The following table summarizes the components of other income, net, for our Lending business segment for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Years ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Late fees $ 89 $ 92 $ 65 Gains on sales of mortgages and other loan fees 18 22 42 Losses on investments, net (32 ) (23 ) (1 ) Other 35 40 15 Total other income, net $ 110 $ 131 $ 121 The net losses on investments in 2005 primarily relates to the $39 million leveraged lease impairment for an aircraft leased to Northwest Airlines, which declared bankruptcy in September 2005. In 2004 we recorded a $27 million impairment in recognition of the adverse conditions affecting the aircraft financing business, particularly the deteriorating financial condition of Delta Airlines. At December 31, 2005, we had investments in leveraged and direct financing leases, net of impairments, totaling $122 million that are the general obligations of American Airlines and Federal Express Corporation. Based on an analysis of the potential losses on certain leveraged leases plus the increase in current tax obligations related to the forgiveness of debt obligations and or the taxable gain on the sale of the aircraft, our remaining after tax accounting exposure from our investment in leveraged leases is $74 million at December 31, 2005, of which $56 million relates to American Airlines. Other income in 2004 benefited from a $29 million increase in late fees due to higher loan volume and an update in our estimate of uncollected late fees. Gains on sales of mortgages and other loan fees 73 decreased by $4 million from 2004 to 2005 and by $20 million from 2003 to 2004. These decreases were primarily due to higher interest rates causing a slowdown in mortgage refinancings over the last two years. Student Loan Acquisitions In 2005, 75 percent of our Managed student loan acquisitions (exclusive of loans acquired through business acquisitions and capitalized interest, premiums and discounts) were originated through our Preferred Channel. The following tables summarize the components of our student loan acquisition activity for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. December 31, 2005 FFELP Private Total Preferred Channel $ 14,847 $ 6,046 $ 20,893 Other commitment clients 500 56 556 Spot purchases 1,880 1,880 Consolidations from third parties 4,671 1 4,672 Acquisitions from off balance sheet securitized trusts, primarily consolidations 9,487 9,487 Acquisition of Idaho Transferee Corporation(1) 43 43 Capitalized interest, premiums and discounts 1,364 (10 ) 1,354 Total on balance sheet student loan acquisitions 32,792 6,093 38,885 Consolidations to SLM Corporation from off balance sheet securitized trusts (9,487 ) (9,487 ) Capitalized interest, premiums and discounts off balance sheet securitized trusts 533 275 808 Total Managed student loan acquisitions $ 23,838 $ 6,368 $ 30,206 December 31, 2004 FFELP Private Total Preferred Channel $ 12,756 $ 3,982 $ 16,738 Other commitment clients 368 45 413 Spot purchases 1,804 4 1,808 Consolidations from third parties 2,609 2,609 Acquisitions from off balance sheet securitized trusts, primarily consolidations 5,554 5,554 Acquisition of Southwest(1) 4,776 4 4,780 Acquisition of SLFA(1) 1,435 1,435 Capitalized interest, premiums and discounts 1,398 (2 ) 1,396 Total on balance sheet student loan acquisitions 30,700 4,033 34,733 Consolidations to SLM Corporation from off balance sheet securitized trusts (5,554 ) (5,554 ) Capitalized interest, premiums and discounts off balance sheet securitized trusts 565 172 737 Total Managed student loan acquisitions $ 25,711 $ 4,205 $ 29,916 (1) See Note 11, Acquisitions, to the consolidated financial statements. 74 December 31, 2003 FFELP Private Total Preferred Channel $ 10,884 $ 2,901 $ 13,785 Other commitment clients 344 33 377 Spot purchases 864 2 866 Consolidations from third parties 2,250 2,250 Acquisitions from off balance sheet securitized trusts, primarily consolidations 6,156 6,156 Capitalized interest, premiums and discounts 1,024 16 1,040 Acquisition of AMS(1) 1,246 177 1,423 Total on balance sheet student loan acquisitions 22,768 3,129 25,897 Consolidations to SLM Corporation from off balance sheet securitized trusts (6,156 ) (6,156 ) Capitalized interest, premiums and discounts off balance sheet securitized trusts 842 79 921 Total Managed student loan acquisitions $ 17,454 $ 3,208 $ 20,662 (1) See Note 11, Acquisitions, to the consolidated financial statements. As shown in the above tables, off balance sheet FFELP loans that consolidate with us become an on balance sheet interest earning asset. This activity results in impairments of our Residual Interests in FFELP securitizations because it shortens the time that the Residual Interest is an earning asset. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, consolidation activity resulted in $26 million of net run off, $504 million of net new student loan acquisitions, and $84 million of net run off, respectively. The following table illustrates the amount and rate of the student loan premiums paid. Years ended December 31, 2005 2004 Volume Rate Premium Volume Rate Premium Student loan premiums paid: Sallie Mae brands $ 9,074 .35 % $ 32 $ 6,197 .36 % $ 22 Lender partners 11,819 1.82 215 10,541 1.60 169 Total Preferred Channel 20,893 1.18 247 16,738 1.14 191 Other purchases(1) 2,479 3.83 95 8,436 4.60 388 Subtotal base purchases 23,372 1.46 342 25,174 2.30 579 Consolidations 4,672 2.24 105 2,609 2.18 57 Total $ 28,044 1.59 % $ 447 $ 27,783 2.29 % $ 636 (1) Primarily includes spot purchases, other commitment clients, and subsidiary acquisitions. The increase in the lender partner premium rate from 2004 to 2005 is primarily due to the increase in zero fee lending, where we pay an origination fee on behalf of the borrower, and school as lender volume. The borrower origination fee related to zero fee lending will be gradually phased out by Reauthorization Legislation from 2007 to 2010. This legislation also ends new schools as lender after April 1, 2006 and adds additional requirements for schools already participating in this program. (See OTHER RELATED EVENTS AND INFORMATION Reauthorization.) 75 The following table includes on balance sheet asset information for our Lending business segment.

(2) Other assets include accrued interest receivable, goodwill and acquired intangible assets and other non interest earning assets. Preferred Channel Originations In 2005, we originated $21.4 billion in student loan volume through our Preferred Channel, a 19 percent increase over the $18.0 billion originated in 2004. In 2005, we grew the Sallie Mae brand Preferred Channel Originations by 57 percent and our own brands now constitute 43 percent of our Preferred Channel Originations, up from 32 percent in 2004. At the same time, the JPMorgan/Bank One volume decreased by 15 percent and was 28 percent of our Preferred Channel Originations, down from 38 percent in 2004. The pipeline of loans that we currently service and are committed to purchase was $6.8 billion and $7.2 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The following tables further break down our Preferred Channel Originations by type of loan and source. Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Preferred Channel Originations Type of Loan Stafford $ 12,547 $ 11,383 $ 10,077 PLUS 2,570 2,303 1,882 Total FFELP 15,117 13,686 11,959 Private 6,236 4,307 3,270 Total $ 21,353 $ 17,993 $ 15,229 Preferred Channel Originations Source Sallie Mae brands $ 9,109 $ 5,790 $ 4,233 Lender partners 12,244 12,203 10,996 Total $ 21,353 $ 17,993 $ 15,229 76 The following table summarizes the activity in our Managed portfolio of student loans for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

(2) On a Managed Basis, internal consolidations include FFELP student loans in securitization trusts that were consolidated back on balance sheet. Such loans totaled $8.7 billion, $5.5 billion and $5.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 respectively. The increase in FFELP Stafford and other consolidations to third parties is primarily due to some FFELP lenders consolidating these loans using the FDLP as a pass through entity to circumvent the statutory prohibition on the FFELP reconsolidation of FFELP Consolidation Loans. Recently passed legislation eliminates this practice by June 30, 2006, but we are working with others in the industry to end it before June 30, 2006 because we believe that it is improper and not permitted by current regulations. If this practice is not ended before June 30, 2006, we expect to experience additional run off of Consolidation Loans to third parties through such time. 77 Operating Expenses The following table summarizes the components of operating expenses for our Lending business segment for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Years ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Sales and originations $ 286 $ 259 $ 256 Servicing and information technology 193 150 158 Total operating expenses $ 479 $ 409 $ 414 Loss on GSE debt extinguishment and defeasance $ $ 221 $ Operating expenses for our Lending operating segment include non capitalizable costs incurred to acquire student loans and service our Managed student loan portfolio, as well as other selling, general and administrative expenses. The $221 million loss in 2004 relates to the repurchase and defeasance of approximately $3.0 billion of GSE debt in connection with the Wind Down of the GSE. 2005 versus 2004 Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005, increased by 17 percent to $479 million versus $409 million in the prior year, exclusive of the loss on GSE debt extinguishment and defeasance. The increase is due to increased sales and marketing costs related to the Consolidation Loan program, new Private Education Loan initiatives and the launch of our direct to consumer initiative, Tuition Answer. Operating expenses were also higher due to a full year of expenses of sales and marketing personnel from Southwest and SLFA, acquired in the fourth quarter of 2004. The $43 million increase in servicing and information technology expenses is consistent with the growth in borrowers. 2004 versus 2003 Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004, exclusive of the loss on GSE debt extinguishment and defeasance discussed above, were relatively flat at $409 million versus $414 million in 2003. DEBT MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS (DMO) BUSINESS SEGMENT Through the six operating units that comprise our DMO operating segment, we provide a wide range of accounts receivable and collections services including student loan default aversion services, defaulted student loan portfolio management services, contingency collections services for student loans and other asset classes, and accounts receivable management and collection for purchased portfolios of receivables that are delinquent or have been charged off by their original creditors as well as sub performing and non performing mortgage loans. In our DMO segment, nearly half of our revenues are still earned from our student loan contingency collection fee business in which we provide default management services to guarantor agencies, colleges and universities and ED. In recent years, we have diversified our DMO contingency revenue stream away from student loans, mainly through the acquisition of AFS in 2004 and GRP in 2005. These acquisitions also diversified our revenue from purely contingency fee collections to purchased paper collections. As a result, student loan contingency fees contributed 49 percent of total DMO revenue in 2005, versus 75 percent in 2004. 78 The private sector collections industry is highly fragmented with few large public companies and a large number of small scale privately held companies. The collections industry is highly competitive with credit card collections being the most competitive in both contingency collections and purchased paper activities. We are responding to these competitive challenges through enhanced servicing efficiencies and by continuing to build on customer relationships through value added services. In the purchased receivables business, we focus on a variety of consumer debt types with emphasis on charged off credit card receivables and distressed mortgage receivables. We purchase these portfolios at a discount to their face value, and then use both our internal collections operations coupled with third party collection agencies to maximize the recovery on these receivables. A major success factor in the purchased receivables business is the ability to effectively price the portfolios. We conduct both quantitative and qualitative analysis to appropriately price each portfolio to yield a return consistent with DMO financial targets. We account for our investments in charged off receivables in accordance with the AICPAs Statement of Position (SOP) 03 3, Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer. Under this standard, we establish static pools of relatively homogeneous accounts and initially record them at fair value. Under SOP 03 3, the yield that may be accreted as interest income on such loans is limited to the excess of our estimate of undiscounted expected principal, interest and other cash flows from the loan over our initial investment in the loan. We recognize income each month based on each static pools effective interest rate. Subsequent increases in estimated future cash flows are recognized prospectively through a yield adjustment over the remaining life of the static pool. Decreases in estimated future cash flows to be collected are recognized as an impairment expense. We record impairments to purchased receivable assets when the actual yield on a pool of portfolios is less than the expected yield based on the cash flows generated by the pool. The pools consist of portfolios of like kind assets. The following table includes the results of operations for our DMO operating segment. Condensed Statements of Income Years ended December 31, % Increase (Decrease) 2005 2004 2003 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 Fee income $ 360 $ 300 $ 259 20 % 16 % Collections revenue 167 39 328 100 Total revenue 527 339 259 55 31 Operating expenses 283 159 123 78 29 Income before income taxes and minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries 244 180 136 36 32 Income taxes 91 65 45 40 44 Income before minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries 153 115 91 33 26 Minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries 4 1 300 100 Net income $ 149 $ 114 $ 91 31 % 25 % 79 Revenues from USA Funds represented 34 percent, 56 percent, and 66 percent, respectively, of total DMO revenue in 2005, 2004, and 2003. The percentage of revenue generated from services provided to USA Funds should continue to decrease due to the impact of recent acquisitions and the continued diversification into new asset classes in both the purchased paper and contingency collection businesses. DMO Revenue by Product Years ended December 31, 2005(2) 2004(3) 2003 Purchased paper collections revenue $ 167 $ 39 $ Contingency: Student loans 258 253 217 Other 55 18 10 Total contingency 313 271 227 Other 47 29 32 Total $ 527 $ 339 $ 259 USA Funds(1) $ 180 $ 190 $ 171 % of total DMO revenue 34 % 56 % 66 % (1) United Student Aid Funds, Inc. (USA Funds). (2) Includes revenue attributed to GRP for the period from August 31 to December 31. (3) Includes revenue attributed to AFS for the period from September 16 to December 31. Fee Income and Collections Revenue On August 31, 2005, we acquired 100 percent of GRP, a debt management company that acquires and manages portfolios of sub performing and non performing mortgage loans, substantially all of which are secured by one to four family residential real estate. On December 22, 2005, we acquired an additional 12 percent ownership stake in AFS, increasing our ownership to 76 percent. The $188 million increase in DMO revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005 over 2004 can be primarily attributed to the year over year growth in the purchased paper businesses of AFS (acquired in September 2004) and to revenue generated by GRP. Contingency fee revenue increased by $42 million, or 15 percent, to $313 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 versus the year ago period. The year over year growth in contingency fee revenue was primarily driven by the addition of fees earned from state tax collections and by the growth in contingent fee revenues from non student loan asset classes. The rapid growth in Consolidation Loan activity has had a negative impact on our student loan contingency collection business. When a borrower consolidates a FFELP Stafford loan, the borrower is effectively refinancing his or her Stafford loan to a longer term at a fixed interest rate, which significantly reduces the borrowers monthly payment. The overall effect of the record Consolidation Loan activity is lower industry wide student loan defaults and lower contingency collection inventory. The recently passed HEA reduces fees paid for collections via loan consolidation and also puts a cap on collections for loan consolidations. These fee reductions will also negatively impact student loan contingency fees going forward. 80 Purchased Paper Non Mortgage Years ended December 31, 2005 2004(1) Face value of purchases $ 2,830 $ 426 Purchase price 198 19 % of face value purchased 7.0 % 4.5 % Gross Cash Collections (GCC) $ 250 $ 59 Collections revenue 157 39 % of GCC 63 % 66 % Carrying value of purchases $ 158 $ 52 (1) AFS was purchased in September 2004. Prior to this acquisition, the Company was not in the purchased paper business. The amount of face value of purchases in any quarter is a function of a combination of factors including the amount of receivables available for purchase in the marketplace, average age of each portfolio, the asset class of the receivables, and competition in the marketplace. As a result, the percentage of principal purchased will vary from quarter to quarter. The decrease in purchase paper revenue as a percentage of GCC can primarily be attributed to the increase in new portfolio purchases in the second half of 2005. Typically, revenue recognition based on a portfolios effective interest rate is a lower percentage of cash collections in the early stages of servicing a portfolio. Purchased Paper Mortgage/Properties Year ended December 31, 2005(1) Face value of purchases $ 165 Collections revenue 10 Collateral value of purchases 232 Purchase price 141 % of collateral value 61 % Carrying value of purchases $ 298 (1) GRP was purchased in August 2005. Prior to this acquisition, the Company was not in the mortgage purchased paper business. The purchase price for sub performing and non performing mortgage loans is generally determined as a percentage of the underlying collateral. Fluctuations in the purchase price as a percentage of collateral value can be caused by a number of factors including the percentage of second mortgages in the portfolio and the level of private mortgage insurance associated with particular assets. 81 Contingency Inventory The following table presents the outstanding inventory of receivables serviced through our DMO business. Years ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Contingency: Contingency Student loans $ 7,205 $ 6,869 $ 6,628 Contingency Other 2,178 1,756 589 Total $ 9,383 $ 8,625 $ 7,217 Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the DMO business segment for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 totaled: Years ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Total operating expenses $ 283 $ 159 $ 123 Operating expenses increased by $124 million, or 78 percent, to $283 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. A significant portion of the 2005 increase is attributable to the inclusion of a full year of AFS expenses and GRP expenses since the acquisition on August 31, 2005. The increase is also attributable to the growth in contingency revenue and accounts serviced, as a high percentage of DMO expenses are variable which contributes to our stable margins. We continue to make substantial investments in the infrastructure of the DMO business to accommodate current and future growth, and we believe this investment will provide significant operating efficiencies in the future. At December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the DMO operating segment had total assets of $1.1 billion, $519 million, and $272 million, respectively. CORPORATE AND OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENT Our Corporate and Other reportable segment reflects the aggregate activity of our smaller operating units including our Guarantor Servicing and Loan Servicing operating units, other products and services, as well as corporate expenses that do not pertain directly to our operating segments. In our Guarantor Servicing operating unit, we provide a full complement of administrative services to FFELP guarantors including guarantee issuance, processing, account maintenance, and guarantee fulfillment. In our Loan Servicing operating unit, we originate and service student loans on behalf of lenders who are unrelated to SLM Corporation. Such activities include processing correspondence and filing claims, originating and disbursing Consolidation Loans on behalf of the lender, and other administrative activities required by ED. 82 Condensed Statements of Income Years ended December 31, % Increase (Decrease) 2005 2004 2003 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 Fee income $ 115 $ 120 $ 128 (4 )% (6 )% Other income 126 130 123 (3 ) 6 Total revenue 241 250 251 (4 ) Operating expenses 308 291 231 6 26 Income (loss) before income taxes (67 ) (41 ) 20 (63 ) (305 ) Income tax expense (benefit) (25 ) (15 ) 7 (67 ) (314 ) Net income (loss) $ (42 ) $ (26 ) $ 13 (62 )% (300 )% Fee and Other Income The following table summarizes the components of fee and other income for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Years ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Guarantor servicing fees $ 115 $ 120 $ 128 Loan servicing fees 44 52 58 Other 82 78 65 Total fee and other income $ 241 $ 250 $ 251 USA Funds, the nations largest guarantee agency, accounted for 82 percent, 85 percent, and 86 percent, respectively, of guarantor servicing fees and 27 percent, 16 percent, and 2 percent, respectively, of revenues associated with other products and services for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. 2005 versus 2004 The decrease is guarantor servicing fees in 2005 versus 2004 is due to the full year effect of the lower issuance fee rate (see below) and to an $8 million reduction in account maintenance fees caused by a cap on payments from ED to guarantors. This cap is removed by recently passed legislation that will go into effect on October 1, 2006, however, it will continue to negatively impact guarantor servicing fees through that date. 2004 versus 2003 The $8 million decrease in guarantor servicing fees in 2004 versus the prior year is due to a $13 million decrease in issuance fees caused by the reduction in the issuance fee from 65 basis points to 40 basis points, which was partially offset by higher account maintenance fees. The increase in other income in 2004 versus 2003 is primarily due to a $14 million fee received from Bank One in the third quarter of 2004 in connection with the termination of the marketing services agreement, $13 million in fees earned on the tuition payment plan business that was acquired in connection with the November 2003 AMS acquisition, and $9 million in higher marketing servicing fees. Items that affected 2003 that did not recur in 2004 were a $42 million gain recognized in the fourth quarter of 2003 for the sale of our prior headquarters building, partially offset by an $18 million deferral in 2003 of previously recognized income earned for performing information technology enhancements. 83 Operating Expenses The following table summarizes the components of operating expenses for our Corporate and Other operating segment. Years ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Operating expenses $ 149 $ 152 $ 107 General and administrative expenses 159 139 124 Total operating expenses $ 308 $ 291 $ 231 Operating expenses include direct costs incurred to service loans for unrelated third parties and to perform guarantor servicing on behalf of guarantor agencies, as well as information technology expenses related to these functions. General and administrative expenses include unallocated corporate overhead expenses for centralized headquarters functions such as executive management, accounting and finance, human resources and marketing. 2005 versus 2004 The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2005 versus 2004 was primarily due to a $14 million net settlement in the College Loan Corporation (CLC) lawsuit. 2004 versus 2003 The 12 percent increase in general and administrative expenses from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to the growth in the business and additional administrative costs related to compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. We also incurred additional expenses related to AMS, acquired in December of 2003, primarily to manage the tuition payment plan product. At December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Corporate and Other operating segment had total assets of $719 million, $524 million, and $447 million, respectively. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Except in the case of acquisitions, which are discussed separately, our DMO and Corporate and Other business segments are not capital intensive businesses and as such a minimal amount of debt and equity capital is allocated to these segments. Therefore, the following liquidity and capital resource discussion is concentrated on our Lending business segment. We depend on the debt capital markets to support our business plan. We have developed deep and diverse funding sources to ensure continued access to funding now that the GSE has been dissolved. Our biggest funding challenge going forward is to maintain cost effective liquidity to fund the growth in the Managed portfolio of student loans as well as to refinance previously securitized loans when borrowers choose to refinance their loans through a Consolidation Loan with the Company. At the same time, we must maintain earnings spreads by controlling interest rate risk. Our main source of funding is student loan securitizations and we have built a highly liquid market for such financings as evidenced by the $26.1 billion in student loans securitized in twelve transactions in 2005, and $33.8 billion in thirteen transactions, including the amount funded through our asset backed commercial paper program (ABCP) transaction in 2004. We are the largest issuer in the student loan asset backed sector. FFELP securitizations are unique securities in the asset backed market and are backed by student loans with an explicit guarantee on 100 percent of principal and interest. This guarantee is subject to service compliance and the amount guaranteed will be lowered to 99 percent after July 1, 2006 through legislation (see OTHER RELATED EVENTS AND INFORMATION Reauthorization). As evidenced by the 84 volume of the past three years, we have built a highly liquid and deep market for student loan backed securities by developing an investor base worldwide. Securitizations now comprise 67 percent of our financing, versus 66 percent at December 31, 2004. In addition to securitizations, we also significantly increased and diversified our sources of funds through the issuance of $10.3 billion in SLM Corporation term, unsecured debt in 2005. In 2003 and 2004, we strategically introduced several new SLM Corporation long term debt structures that further diversify our funding sources and substantially increased our fixed income investor base. In total, at December 31, 2005, on balance sheet debt, exclusive of on balance sheet securitizations and secured indentured trusts, totaled $41.7 billion versus $33.3 billion at December 31, 2004. Liquidity at SLM Corporation is important to enable us to effectively fund our student loan acquisitions, to meet maturing debt obligations, and to fund operations. The following table details our sources of liquidity and the available capacity at December 31, 2005. December 31, 2005 Available Capacity Sources of Liquidity Sources of Primary Liquidity: Unrestricted cash and investments $ 3,934 Commercial paper and bank lines of credit 5,500 ABCP 41 Total Sources of Primary Liquidity 9,475 Stand by Liquidity: Unencumbered FFELP student loans 24,530 Total Sources of Primary and Stand by Liquidity $ 34,005 We believe that our unencumbered FFELP student loan portfolio provides an additional source of potential or stand by liquidity because the maturation of the government guaranteed securitization marketplace has created a wide and deep marketplace for such transactions, and the whole loan sale market can provide a source of stand by liquidity. In addition, we have $666 million of investments at December 31, 2005 on our balance sheet that has not been included in the above table as it is pledged as collateral related to certain derivative positions. In addition to liquidity, a major objective when financing our business is to minimize interest rate risk by matching the interest rate and reset characteristics of our Managed assets and liabilities, generally on a pooled basis, to the extent practicable. In this process we use derivative financial instruments extensively to reduce our interest rate and foreign currency exposure. This interest rate risk management helps us to stabilize our student loan spread in various and changing interest rate environments. (See also RISKS Interest Rate Risk Management below.) 85 The following tables present the ending and average balances and average interest rates of our Managed borrowings for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. The average interest rates include derivatives that are economically hedging the underlying debt, but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133.

The average balance of commercial paper outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $345 million and $126 million, respectively. The maximum daily amount outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $2.8 billion and $274 million, respectively. Preferred Stock Issuance On June 8, 2005, we sold four million shares of Floating Rate Non Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series B (the Series B Preferred Stock) in a registered public offering. Net proceeds from the sale of the Series B Preferred Stock, after deducting underwriting fees and before other fees and expenses of the offering, totaled $397 million and are being used for general corporate purposes. Dividends on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock are not mandatory. When, as, and if declared by our Board of Directors, holders of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive quarterly dividends, based on 3 month LIBOR plus 70 basis points per annum in arrears, on and until June 15, 2011, increasing to 3 month LIBOR plus 170 basis points per annum in arrears, after and including the period beginning on June 15, 2011. The Series B Preferred Stock does not have a maturity date. We can redeem the Series B Preferred Stock at our option on any dividend payment date on or after June 15, 2010, at the redemption price of $100 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends for the then quarterly dividend period, if any. The Series B Preferred Stock is not convertible into or exchangeable for any of our other securities or property. Upon liquidation or dissolution of the Company, holders of our Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive $100 per share, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends for the then current quarterly dividend period, if any, pro rata with holders of our Series A Preferred Stock and before any distribution of assets are made to holders of our common stock. Contingently Convertible Debentures In 2003, we issued approximately $2 billion Contingently Convertible Debentures (Co Cos). The Co Cos are convertible, under certain conditions, into shares of SLM common stock at an initial conversion price of $65.98. The investors generally can only convert the debentures if the Companys common stock has appreciated for a prescribed period to 130 percent of the conversion price, which would amount to $85.77. The convertible debentures bear interest at a floating rate equal to three month LIBOR minus .05 percent, until July 25, 2007, after which, the debentures can pay additional contingent interest under certain circumstances. Beginning on July 25, 2007, the Company may call the debentures and the investors may put the debentures, subject to certain conditions. In December 2004, the Company adopted EITF Issue No. 04 8, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share, which requires the shares underlying the Co Cos to be included in diluted earnings per share (diluted EPS) computations regardless of whether the market price trigger or the conversion price has been met, using the if converted accounting method, while the after tax interest expense of the Co Cos is added back to earnings. Diluted EPS amounts disclosed prior to December 2004 have been retroactively restated to give effect to the application of EITF No. 04 8 as it relates to the Companys $2 billion in Co Cos issued in May 2003. 87 The following table provides the historical effect of our Co Cos on our common stock equivalents (CSEs) and after tax interest expense in connection with the retroactive implementation of EITF No. 04 8 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

The holders of the beneficial interests issued by the special purpose entity are not constrained from pledging or exchanging their interests. In all of our securitizations, we retain the right to receive cash flows from the student loans and reserve accounts in excess of the amounts needed to pay servicing, derivative costs (if any), other fees, and the principal and interest on the bonds backed by the student loans. The investors of the securitization trusts have no recourse to the Companys other assets should there be a failure of the securities backed by student loans to pay when due. Some of our securitizations meet the requirements for GAAP sale treatment through a two step sale to a qualifying special purpose entity (QSPE) according to the criteria of SFAS No. 140. Under these criteria, we do not maintain effective control over the transferred assets. Accordingly, these transactions receive off balance sheet accounting treatment. In certain Consolidation Loan securitization structures, we hold rights that can affect the remarketing of the bonds, such that these trusts did not qualify as QSPEs and as a result are required to be accounted for on balance sheet as variable interest entities (VIEs). These securitization structures were developed to broaden and diversify the investor base for Consolidation Loan securitizations by allowing us to issue bonds with shorter expected maturities and with non amortizing, fixed rate and foreign currency denominated tranches. As of December 31, 2005, we had $40.9 billion of securitized student loans in on balance sheet securitization trusts. These securitizations are included as financings in the table below. We recognize a gain on sales related to securitizations that qualify as off balance sheet transactions. The gain is calculated as the difference between the allocated cost basis of the assets sold and the relative fair value of the assets received. The carrying value of the student loan portfolio being securitized includes the applicable accrued interest, unamortized student loan premiums or discounts, loan loss reserves and Borrower Benefits reserves. The fair value of the Residual Interest is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology using assumptions discussed in more detail below. The ongoing earnings from our off balance sheet securitizations are recognized in servicing and securitization revenue. 88 The following table summarizes our securitization activity for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Those securitizations listed as sales are off balance sheet transactions and those listed as financings remain on balance sheet. Year ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 No. of Transactions Loan Amount Securitized Per Tax Gain Gain % No. of Transactions Loan Amount Securitized Pre Tax Gain Gain % No. of Transactions Loan Amount Securitized Pre Tax Gain Gain % FFELP Stafford/PLUS loans 3 $ 6,533 $ 68 1.1 % 4 $ 10,002 $ 134 1.3 % 4 $ 5,772 $ 73 1.3 % Consolidation Loans 2 4,011 31 .8 2 4,256 433 10.2 Private Education Loans 2 3,005 453 15.1 2 2,535 241 9.5 3 3,503 238 6.8 Total securitizations sales 7 13,549 $ 552 4.1 % 6 12,537 $ 375 3.0 % 9 13,531 $ 744 5.5 % Asset backed commercial paper(1) 1 4,186 Consolidation Loans(2) 5 12,503 6 17,124 7 16,592 Total securitizations financings 5 12,503 7 21,310 7 16,592 Total securitizations 12 $ 26,052 13 $ 33,847 16 $ 30,123 (1) The ABCP is a revolving 364 day multi seller conduit that allows the Company to borrow up to $5 billion subject to annual extensions. The Company may purchase loans out of this trust at its discretion and as a result, the trust does not qualify as a QSPE and is accounted for on balance sheet as a VIE. (2) In certain Consolidation Loan securitization structures, the Company holds certain rights that can affect the remarketing of certain bonds, such that these securitizations did not qualify as QSPEs. Accordingly, they are accounted for on balance sheet as VIEs. The increase in the gain as a percentage of the amount securitized for the 2005 Private Education Loan securitizations versus the prior years transactions is primarily due to the higher earnings spreads on the loans securitized in 2005, improved funding spreads, and a decrease in the CPR assumption used in the calculation of the 2005 gains on sale. The 15.1 percent average gain on the Private Education Loan securitizations basically reflects the average interest spread of 4.3 percent earned over an average life of 8.9 years less life of trust loan losses discounted at 12.3 percent. The decrease in the gain as a percentage of the amount securitized for the 2005 Consolidation Loan securitizations versus the 2003 transactions is primarily due to significantly less Embedded Floor Income due to interest rates increasing and fewer higher rate loans being securitized. In 2004 we had record levels of securitization transactions due to funding new student loans acquired through the acquisitions of Southwest and SLFA and to the refinancing of GSE debt in connection with the Wind Down. In 2005, as expected, there was a decline in our securitization activity to a level that correlates with the volume of student loan purchases. Liquidity Risk and Funding Long Term With the dissolution of the GSE, our long term funding, credit spread and liquidity exposure to the corporate and asset backed capital markets has increased significantly. A major disruption in the fixed income capital markets that limits our ability to raise funds or significantly increases the cost of those funds could have a material impact on our ability to acquire student loans, or on our results of operations. Going forward, securitizations will continue to be the primary source of long term financing and liquidity. Our securitizations are structured such that we are not obligated to provide any material level of financial, credit or liquidity support to any of the trusts, thus limiting our exposure to the recovery of the Retained Interest asset on the balance sheet for off balance sheet securitizations to the loss of the earnings spread for loans securitized on balance sheet. While all of our Retained Interests are subject to some prepayment risk, Retained Interests from our FFELP Stafford securitizations have significant prepayment risk primarily arising from borrowers opting to consolidate their Stafford/PLUS loans. When consolidation activity is higher than projected, the increase in prepayment could materially impair the value of our Retained Interest. However, this negative effect on our Retained Interest is somewhat offset by the loans that consolidate back on our balance sheet, which we view as trading one interest bearing asset for another, whereas loans that consolidate with third parties represent a complete economic loss to the Company. We discuss our short term liquidity risk, including a table of our sources of liquidity at the beginning of this LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES section. 89 Retained Interest in Securitized Receivables The following table summarizes the fair value of our Retained Interests along with the underlying student loans that relate to those securitizations that were treated as sales. As of December 31, 2005 As of December 31, 2004 Retained Interest Fair Value Underlying Securitized Loan Balance Retained Interest Fair Value Underlying Securitized Loan Balance FFELP Stafford/PLUS loans $ 774 $ 20,371 $ 1,037 $ 27,445 Consolidation Loans(1) 483 10,272 585 7,393 Private Education Loans 1,149 8,946 694 6,308 Total(2) $ 2,406 $ 39,589 $ 2,316 $ 41,146 (1) Includes $235 million and $399 million related to the fair value of the Embedded Floor Income as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in the fair value of the Embedded Floor Income is primarily due to rising interest rates during the period. (2) Unrealized gains (pre tax) included in accumulated other comprehensive income related to the Retained Interests totaled $370 million and $445 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Changes in Accounting Estimates Affecting the Residual Interest in Securitized Loans The Company updated certain assumptions during 2005 that it uses in the valuation of the Residual Interest. The following are the significant assumption changes that were made: As of December 31, 2005 As of December 31, 2004 FFELP Stafford/PLUS loan CPR(1) 20% 2006 20% 2005 15% 2007 15% 2006 10% thereafter 6% thereafter FFELP expected credit losses (as a% of securitized loan balance outstanding)(2) .17% 0% (1) The FFELP Stafford/PLUS loan CPR assumption was increased to account for the continued high levels of Consolidation Loan activity over the last several years. (2) Due to reintroduction of a one percent Risk Sharing loss assumption related to the reauthorization of the HEA (see Note 4, Allowance for Student Loan Losses for further discussion). Servicing and Securitization Revenue Servicing and securitization revenue, the ongoing revenue from securitized loan pools accounted for off balance sheet as QSPEs, includes the interest earned on the Residual Interest and the revenue we receive for servicing the loans in the securitization trusts. Interest income recognized on the Residual Interest is based on our anticipated yield determined by estimating future cash flows each quarter. 90 The following table summarizes the components of servicing and securitization revenue for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Years ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Servicing revenue $ 323 $ 326 $ 314 Securitization revenue, before Embedded Floor Income and impairment 270 230 269 Servicing and securitization revenue, before Embedded Floor Income and impairment 593 556 583 Embedded Floor Income 81 241 337 Less: Floor Income previously recognized in gain calculation (57 ) (156 ) (157 ) Net Embedded Floor Income 24 85 180 Servicing and securitization revenue, before impairment 617 641 763 Retained Interest impairment (260 ) (80 ) (96 ) Total servicing and securitization revenue $ 357 $ 561 $ 667 Average off balance sheet student loans $ 41,220 $ 40,558 $ 38,205 Average balance of Retained Interest $ 2,476 $ 2,434 $ 2,615 Servicing and securitization revenue as a percentage of the average balance of off balance sheet student loans (annualized) .87 % 1.38 % 1.74 % Servicing and securitization revenue is primarily driven by the average balance of off balance sheet student loans and the amount of and the difference in the timing of Embedded Floor Income recognition on off balance sheet student loans. Servicing and securitization revenue can also be negatively impacted by impairments of the value of our Retained Interest, caused primarily by the effect of higher than expected Consolidation Loan activity on FFELP Stafford/PLUS student loan securitizations and the effect of market interest rates on the Embedded Floor Income included in the Retained Interest. When loans in a securitization trust consolidate, they are a prepayment to the trust resulting in a shorter average life. We use a CPR assumption to estimate the effect of trust prepayments from loan consolidation and other factors on the life of the trust. When consolidation activity is higher than forecasted, the Residual Interest asset can be impaired and the yield used to recognize subsequent income from the trust is negatively impacted. The majority of the consolidations bring the loans back on balance sheet so for those loans we retain the value of the asset on balance sheet versus in the trust. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we recorded impairments to the Retained Interests of $260 million, $80 million and $96 million, respectively. The impairment charge in 2005 was primarily caused by the effect of record levels of consolidation activity as well as the increase of expected future CPR assumptions used to value the Residual Interest. This surge in Consolidation Loan activity was due to FFELP Stafford borrowers locking in lower interest rates by consolidating their loans prior to the July 1 interest rate reset for FFELP Stafford loans. The level and timing of Consolidation Loan activity is highly volatile, and in response we continue to revise our estimates of the effects of Consolidation Loan activity on our Retained Interests and it may result in additional impairment recorded in future periods if Consolidation Loan activity remains higher than projected. Our FFELP Retained Interests were also impaired by $23 million to account for the effect of the one percent Risk Sharing loss applied to student loans receiving the EP designation. The increase in Risk Sharing was included in legislation reauthorizing the Higher Education Act (see OTHER RELATED EVENTS AND INFORMATION Reauthorization). See LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENT Allowance for FFELP Student Loans for further discussion regarding the change in the Risk Sharing exposure. 91 The impairment charge for 2004 is primarily the result of (a) FFELP Stafford loans consolidating at levels faster than projected resulting in $47 million of impairment and (b) rising interest rates during the second quarter 2004 which decreased the value of the Floor Income component of our Retained Interest resulting in $33 million of impairment. Impairment for 2003 was primarily due to FFELP Stafford loans prepaying faster than projected. These impairment charges are recorded as a loss and are included as a reduction to securitization revenue. We receive annual servicing fees of 90 basis points, 50 basis points and 70 basis points of the outstanding securitized loan balance related to our FFELP Stafford/PLUS, Consolidation Loan and Private Education Loan securitizations, respectively. CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS The following table provides a summary of our obligations associated with long term notes and equity forward contracts at December 31, 2005. For further discussion of these obligations, see Note 8, Long Term Debt, Note 10, Derivative Financial Instruments, and Note 14, Stockholders Equity, to the consolidated financial statements. 1 Year or less 2 to 3 Years 4 to 5 Years Over 5 Years Total Long term notes(1)(2) $ 3,388 $ 26,441 $ 16,351 $ 42,371 $ 88,551 Equity forward contracts(3) 693 1,643 2,336 Total contractual cash obligations $ 3,388 $ 27,134 $ 17,994 $ 42,371 $ 90,887 (1) Excludes SFAS No. 133 derivative market value adjustment reductions of $432 million for long term notes; only includes principal obligations, does not include interest on the debt obligations or on our interest rate swaps. (2) Includes FIN No. 46 long term beneficial interests of $47.2 billion of notes issued by consolidated variable interest entities in conjunction with our on balance sheet securitization transactions and included in long term notes in the consolidated balance sheet. (3) Our obligation to repurchase shares under equity forward contracts is calculated using the average purchase prices for outstanding contracts in the year the contracts expire. At or prior to the maturity date of the agreements, we can purchase shares at the contracted amount plus or minus an early break fee, or we can settle the contract on a net basis with either cash or shares. If our stock price declines to certain levels, the third parties with whom we entered into the contracts can liquidate their positions prior to the maturity date. OFF BALANCE SHEET LENDING ARRANGEMENTS The following table summarizes the commitments associated with student loan purchases and contractual amounts related to off balance sheet lending related financial instruments and guarantees at December 31, 2005. 1 Year or less 2 to 3 Years 4 to 5 Years Over 5 Years Total Student loan purchases(1),(2) $ 11,297 $ 35,304 $ 3,876 $ 225 $ 50,702 Lines of credit(2) 75 1,161 153 100 1,489 $ 11,372 $ 36,465 $ 4,029 $ 325 $ 52,191 (1) Includes amounts committed at specified dates under forward contracts to purchase student loans and anticipated future requirements to acquire student loans from lending partners (discussed below) estimated based on future volumes at contractually committed rates. These commitments are not accounted for as derivatives under SFAS No. 133 as they do not meet the definition of a derivative due to the lack of a fixed and determinable purchase amount. (2) Expiration of commitments and guarantees reflect the earlier of call date or maturity date as of December 31, 2005. 92 We have issued lending related financial instruments including lines of credit to meet the financing needs of our customers. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk should the counterparty draw down the commitment and the counterparty subsequently fails to perform according to the terms of our contract. The remaining total contractual amount available to be borrowed under these commitments is $1.5 billion. We do not believe that these instruments are representative of our actual future credit exposure or funding requirements. To the extent that the lines of credit are drawn upon, the balance outstanding is collateralized by student loans. At December 31, 2005, draws on lines of credit were approximately $241 million, which amount is reflected in other loans in the consolidated balance sheet. For additional information, see Note 13, Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees, to the consolidated financial statements. RISKS Overview Managing risks is an essential part of successfully operating a financial services company. Our most prominent risk exposures are operational, market and interest rate, political and regulatory, liquidity, credit, and Consolidation Loan refinancing risk. We discuss these and other risks in the Risk Factors section (Item 1A) of this document. The discussion that follows enhances that disclosure by discussing the risk management strategies employed by the Company to mitigate these risks. Operational Risk Operational risk can result from regulatory compliance errors, servicing errors (see further discussion below), technology failures, breaches of the internal control system, and the risk of fraud or unauthorized transactions by employees or persons outside the Company. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards and contractual commitments, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. The federal guarantee on our student loans and our designation as an Exceptional Performer by ED is conditioned on compliance with origination and servicing standards set by ED and guarantor agencies. A mitigating factor is our ability to cure servicing deficiencies and historically our losses have been small. Should we experience a high rate of servicing deficiencies, the cost of remedial servicing or the eventual losses on the student loans that are not cured could be material. Our servicing and operating processes are highly dependent on our information system infrastructure, and we face the risk of business disruption should there be extended failures of our information systems, any number of which could have a material impact on our business. To mitigate these risks we have a number of back up and recovery plans in the event of systems failures, which are tested regularly and monitored constantly. We manage operational risk through our risk management and internal control processes, which involve each business line including independent cost centers, such as servicing, as well as executive management. The business lines have direct and primary responsibility and accountability for identifying, controlling, and monitoring operational risk, and each business line manager maintains a system of controls with the objective of providing proper transaction authorization and execution, proper system operations, safeguarding of assets from misuse or theft, and ensuring the reliability of financial and other data. We have centralized certain staff functions such as accounting, human resources and legal to further strengthen our operational controls. While we believe that we have designed effective methods to minimize operational risks, our operations remain vulnerable to natural disasters, human error, technology and communication system breakdowns and fraud. 93 Market and Interest Rate Risk Market and interest rate risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices, interest rates, and or foreign currency exchange rates of our financial instruments. Our primary market risk is from changes in interest rates and interest spreads. We have an active interest rate risk management program that is designed to reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates and maintain consistent earning spreads in all interest rate environments. We use derivative instruments extensively to hedge our interest rate exposure, but there still is a risk that we are not hedging all potential interest rate exposures or that the hedges do not perform as designed. We measure interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for interest earning assets, interest bearing liabilities and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk. Many assumptions are utilized by management to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income, the more significant of which are related to student loan volumes and pricing, the timing of cash flows from our student loan portfolio, particularly the impact of Floor Income and the rate of student loan consolidations, basis risk, credit spreads and the maturity of our debt and derivatives. (See also Interest Rate Risk Management.) Even though we believe our derivatives are economic hedges, changes in interest rates can cause volatility in our earnings for the market value of our derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133. Under SFAS No. 133, these changes in derivative market values are recorded through earnings with no consideration for the corresponding change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result, our earnings are highly susceptible to changes in interest rates caused by these one sided marks to market. Changes in interest rates can also have a material effect on the amount of Floor Income earned in our student loan portfolio and the valuation of our Retained Interest asset. Our earnings can also be materially affected by changes in our estimate of the rate at which loans may prepay in our portfolios as measured by the CPR. The value of the Retained Interests on FFELP Stafford securitizations is particularly affected by the level of Consolidation Loan activity. We face a number of other challenges and risks that can materially affect our future results such as changes in: applicable laws and regulations, which may change the volume, average term, effective yields and refinancing options of student loans under the FFELP or provide advantages to competing FFELP and non FFELP loan providers; demand and competition for education financing; financing preferences of students and their families; borrower default rates on Private Education Loans; continued access to the capital markets for funding at favorable spreads particularly for our non federally insured Private Education Loan portfolio; and our operating execution and efficiencies, including errors, omissions, and effectiveness of internal control. Our foreign currency exchange rate exposure is the result of foreign denominated liabilities issued by the Company. Cross currency interest rate swaps are used to lock in the exchange rate for the term of the liability. We are also subject to market risk relative to our equity forward contracts that allow us to repurchase our common stock in the future from a third party at the market price at the time of entering the contract. Should the market value of our stock fall below certain predetermined levels, the counterparty to the contract has a right to terminate the contract and settle all or a portion at the original contract price. We are required to mark our equity forwards to market, so decreases in our stock price could result in material losses. 94 Political/Regulatory Risk Because we operate in a federally sponsored loan program, we are subject to political and regulatory risk. As part of the HEA, the student loan program is periodically amended and must be reauthorized every six years. Past changes included reduced loan yields paid to lenders in 1993 and 1998, increased fees paid by lenders in 1993, decreased level of the government guaranty in 1993 and reduced fees to guarantors and collectors, among others. On February 8, 2006, the Reauthorization Legislation was signed into law. There are a number of changes that could have a material impact on the Company. For a detailed discussion on the Reauthorization Legislation and its impact on the Company see OTHER RELATED EVENTS AND INFORMATION Reauthorization. The Secretary of Education oversees and implements the HEA and periodically issues regulations and interpretations that may impact our business. 95 Liquidity Risk (See also LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Securitization Activities Liquidity Risk and Funding Long Term) Credit Risk We bear the full risk of borrower and closed school losses experienced in our Private Education Loan portfolio. These loans are underwritten and priced according to risk, generally determined by a commercially available consumer credit scoring system, FICO(TM). Because of the nature of our lending, after an initial decrease, borrower FICO scores will generally improve over time. Additionally, for borrowers who do not meet our lending requirements or who desire more favorable terms, we require credit worthy co borrowers. Our higher education Private Education Loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy, except in certain limited circumstances. We have defined underwriting and collection policies, and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all Private Education Loans. Potential credit losses are considered in our risk based pricing model. The performance of the Private Education Loan portfolio may be affected by the economy, and a prolonged economic downturn may have an adverse effect on its credit performance. Management believes that it has provided sufficient allowances to cover the losses that may be experienced in both the federally guaranteed and Private Education Loan portfolios over the next two years depending on the portfolio. In addition, when a school closes, losses may be incurred for student borrowers who have not completed their education and in certain states are not required to repay their student loans. We have provided for these potential losses in our allowance for loan losses. There is, however, no guarantee that such allowances are sufficient enough to account for actual losses. (See LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENT Private Education Loans Activity in the Allowance for Private Education Loan Losses.) We have credit risk exposure to the various counterparties with whom we have entered into derivative contracts. We review the credit standing of these companies. Our credit policies place limits on the amount of exposure we may take with any one party and in most cases, require collateral to secure the position. The credit risk associated with derivatives is measured based on the replacement cost should the counterparties with contracts in a gain position to the Company fail to perform under the terms of the contract. We also have credit risk with two commercial airlines related to our portfolio of leveraged leases. (See LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENT Other Income, Net.) Consolidation Loan Refinancing Risk The consolidation of our loan portfolio can have detrimental effects. First, we may lose student loans in our portfolio that are consolidated with other lenders. In 2005, we experienced a net decrease of $26 million of student loans from Consolidation Loan activity as more of our FFELP student loans were consolidated with other lenders than were consolidated by us. This was primarily caused by the run off of Consolidation Loans through the reconsolidation through the Direct Lending Program, as discussed in LENDING SEGMENT Consolidation Loan Activity. Absent reconsolidation, we would have had a net increase in student loans from consolidation for the second year in a row. Second, Consolidation Loans have lower net yields than the FFELP Stafford loans they replace. This is somewhat offset by the longer average lives of Consolidation Loans. Third, we must maintain sufficient, short term liquidity to enable us to cost effectively refinance previously securitized FFELP loans as they are consolidated back on to our balance sheet.

In the following GAAP presentation, the funding gap only includes derivatives that qualify as effective SFAS No. 133 hedges (those derivatives which are reflected in net interest margin, as opposed to in the derivative market value adjustment). The difference between the asset and the funding is the funding gap for the specified index. This represents our exposure to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk, which is the risk that the different indices may reset at different frequencies or may not move in the same direction or at the same magnitude. Management analyzes interest rate risk on a Managed basis, which consists of both on balance sheet and off balance sheet assets and liabilities and includes all derivatives that are economically hedging our debt whether they qualify as effective hedges under SFAS No. 133 or not. Accordingly, we are also presenting the asset and liability funding gap on a Managed basis in the table that follows the GAAP presentation. GAAP Basis Index (Dollars in billions) Frequency of Variable Resets Assets Funding(1) Funding Gap 3 month Commercial paper daily $ 62.0 $ $ 62.0 3 month Treasury bill weekly 9.0 .3 8.7 Prime annual 1.0 1.0 Prime quarterly 1.2 1.2 Prime monthly 5.6 5.6 PLUS Index annual 2.6 2.6 3 month LIBOR daily 3 month LIBOR quarterly 1.6 77.0 (75.4 ) 1 month LIBOR monthly 0.1 2.5 (2.4 ) CMT/CPI index monthly/quarterly 2.0 (2.0 ) Non Discreet reset(2) monthly 7.9 (7.9 ) Non Discreet reset(3) daily/weekly 5.9 5.9 Fixed Rate(4) 10.3 9.6 0.7 Total $ 99.3 $ 99.3 $ (1) Includes all derivatives that qualify as hedges under SFAS No. 133. (2) Consists of asset backed commercial paper and auction rate securities, which are discount note type instruments that generally roll over monthly. (3) Includes restricted and non restricted cash equivalents and other overnight type instruments. (4) Includes receivables/payables, other assets (including Retained Interest), other liabilities and stockholders equity (excluding Series B Preferred Stock). The funding gaps in the above table are primarily interest rate mismatches in short term indices between our assets and liabilities. We address this issue primarily through the use of basis swaps that primarily convert quarterly 3 month LIBOR to other indices that are more correlated to our asset indices. These basis swaps do not qualify as effective hedges under SFAS No. 133 and as a result the effect on the funding index is not included in our interest margin and is therefore excluded from the GAAP presentation. 97 Managed Basis Index (Dollars in billions) Frequency of Variable Resets Assets Funding(1) Funding Gap 3 month Commercial paper daily $ 82.1 $ 16.3 $ 65.8 3 month Treasury bill weekly 18.5 18.5 Prime annual 1.0 1.0 Prime quarterly 7.4 5.5 1.9 Prime monthly 7.5 3.3 4.2 PLUS Index annual 4.5 4.9 (0.4 ) 3 month LIBOR daily 64.8 (64.8 ) 3 month LIBOR quarterly 1.5 8.8 (7.3 ) 1 month LIBOR monthly 0.1 2.5 (2.4 ) Non Discreet reset(2) monthly 8.2 (8.2 ) Non Discreet reset(3) daily/weekly 9.7 9.7 Fixed Rate(4) 9.2 8.7 0.5 Total $ 141.5 $ 141.5 $ (1) Includes all derivatives that management considers economic hedges of interest rate risk and reflects how we internally manage our interest rate exposure. (2) Consists of asset backed commercial paper and auction rate securities, which are discount note type instruments that generally roll over monthly. (3) Includes restricted and non restricted cash equivalents and other overnight type instruments. (4) Includes receivables/payables, other assets, other liabilities and stockholders equity (excluding Series B Preferred Stock). To the extent possible, we generally fund our assets with debt (in combination with derivatives) that has the same underlying index (index type and index reset frequency). When it is more economical, we also fund our assets with debt that has a different index and or reset frequency than the asset, but only in instances where we believe there is a high degree of correlation between the interest rate movement of the two indices. For example, we use daily reset 3 month LIBOR to fund a large portion of our daily reset 3 month commercial paper indexed assets. In addition, we use quarterly reset 3 month LIBOR to fund a portion of our quarterly reset Prime rate indexed Private Education Loans. We also use our monthly Non Discreet reset funding (asset backed commercial paper program and auction rate securities) to fund various asset types. In using different index types and different index reset frequencies to fund our assets, we are exposed to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk, which is the risk that the different indices that may reset at different frequencies will not move in the same direction or at the same magnitude. We believe that this risk is low as all of these indices are short term with rate movements that are highly correlated over a long period of time. We use interest rate swaps and other derivatives to achieve our risk management objectives. When compared with the GAAP presentation, the Managed basis presentation includes all of our off balance sheet assets and funding, and also includes basis swaps that primarily convert quarterly 3 month LIBOR to other indices that are more correlated to our asset indices. Interest Rate Gap Analysis In the table below, the Companys variable rate assets and liabilities are categorized by reset date of the underlying index. Fixed rate assets and liabilities are categorized based on their maturity dates. An interest rate gap is the difference between volumes of assets and volumes of liabilities maturing or 98 repricing during specific future time intervals. The following gap analysis reflects rate sensitive positions at December 31, 2005 and is not necessarily reflective of positions that existed throughout the period. Interest Rate Sensitivity Period 3 months or less 3 months to 6 months 6 months to 1 year 1 to 2 years 2 to 5 years Over 5 years Assets Student loans $ 79,230 $ 2,513 $ 784 $ 10 $ 64 $ 3 Other loans 277 43 85 14 8 711 Cash and investments, including restricted 6,151 110 142 598 672 494 Other assets 1,971 93 186 314 546 4,319 Total assets 87,629 2,759 1,197 936 1,290 5,527 Liabilities and Stockholders Equity Short term borrowings 3,289 5 516 Long term notes 63,250 271 1,326 11,233 12,039 Other liabilities 1,590 2,019 Minority interest in subsidiaries 9 Stockholders equity 3,791 Total liabilities and stockholders equity 68,129 5 787 1,326 11,233 17,858 Period gap before adjustments 19,500 2,754 410 (390 ) (9,943 ) (12,331 ) Adjustments for Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments Interest rate swaps (16,040 ) (5,177 ) (208 ) (741 ) 10,240 11,926 Impact of securitized student loans (2,103 ) 2,103 Total derivatives and other financial instruments (18,143 ) (3,074 ) (208 ) (741 ) 10,240 11,926 Period gap $ 1,357 $ (320 ) $ 202 $ (1,131 ) $ 297 $ (405 ) Cumulative gap $ 1,357 $ 1,037 $ 1,239 $ 108 $ 405 $ Ratio of cumulative gap to total assets 1.4 % 1.0 % 1.2 % .1 % .4 % % Weighted Average Life The following table reflects the weighted average life for our Managed earning assets and liabilities at December 31, 2005. (Averages in years) On Balance Sheet Off Balance Sheet Managed Earning assets Student loans 9.4 5.0 9.0 Other loans 7.1 7.1 Cash and investments 1.0 .1 .7 Total earning assets 8.6 4.5 8.3 Borrowings Short term borrowings .4 .4 Long term borrowings 7.0 5.0 6.3 Total borrowings 6.8 5.0 6.2 99 In the above table, Treasury receipts and variable rate asset backed securities, although generally liquid assets, extend the weighted average remaining term to maturity of cash and investments to .7 years. Long term debt issuances likely to be called by us or putable by the investor have been categorized according to their call or put dates rather than their maturity dates. In recent years the shift in the composition of our FFELP student loan portfolio from Stafford loans to Consolidation Loans has lengthened the Managed weighted average life of the student loan portfolio from 8.2 years at December 31, 2004, to 9.0 years at December 31, 2005. COMMON STOCK The following table summarizes our common share repurchases, issuances and equity forward activity for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Years ended December 31, (Shares in millions) 2005 2004 Common shares repurchased: Open market .5 Equity forwards 17.3 32.7 Benefit plans(1) 1.5 1.5 Total shares repurchased 18.8 34.7 Average purchase price per share(2) $ 49.94 $ 38.03 Common shares issued 8.3 10.7 Equity forward contracts: Outstanding at beginning of period 42.8 43.5 New contracts 17.2 32.0 Exercises (17.3 ) (32.7 ) Outstanding at end of period 42.7 42.8 Authority remaining at end of period to repurchase or enter into equity forwards 18.7 35.8 (1) Includes shares withheld from stock option exercises and vesting of performance stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations and shares tendered by employees to satisfy option exercise costs. (2) The average purchase price per share for 2005 and 2004 is calculated based on the average strike price of all equity forward contracts including those that were net settled in the cashless transactions discussed above. The average cash purchase price per share for 2005 and 2004 is $38.97 and $22.38, respectively, when a zero cash cost is reflected for those shares acquired in the cashless transactions. During December 2005, September 2004 and November 2004, we amended substantially all of our outstanding equity forward purchase contracts. The strike prices on these contracts were adjusted to the then current market share prices of the common stock and the total number of shares under contract was reduced from 46.5 million, 53.4 million and 49.0 million shares to 42.4 million, 46.7 million and 42.2 million shares, respectively. As a result of these amendments, we received a total of 4.1 million and 13.4 million shares that settled in 2005 and 2004, respectively, free and clear in cashless transactions. This reduction of shares covered by the equity forward contracts is shown on a net basis in the exercises row of the table above. 100 As of December 31, 2005, the expiration dates and range of and average purchase prices for outstanding equity forward contracts were as follows: Year of maturity (Contracts in millions of shares) Outstanding Contracts Range of purchase prices Average purchase price 2007 5.4 $54.74 $ 54.74 2008 7.3 54.74 54.74 2009 14.8 54.74 54.74 2010 15.2 54.74 54.96 54.74 42.7 $ 54.74 The closing price of the Companys common stock on December 30, 2005 was $55.09. In December 2005, the Company retired 65 million shares of common stock held in treasury at an average price of $37.35 per share. This retirement decreased the balance in treasury stock by $2.4 billion, with corresponding decreases of $13 million in common stock and $2.4 billion in retained earnings. OTHER RELATED EVENTS AND INFORMATION Reauthorization On February 8, 2006, the President signed the Higher Education Reconciliation Act of 2005 (Reauthorization Legislation). The Reauthorization Legislation was included as Title VIII of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (S. 1932), an omnibus budget bill that cut nearly $40 billion in spending over five years, with $12 billion coming from federal student loan programs. The vast majority of the savings are generated by requiring lenders to rebate Floor Income under the new loans issued after April 1, 2006. The major new student loan provisions include the following, with effective dates generally July 1, 2006 unless otherwise indicated: Lenders rebate Floor Income on new loans after April 1, 2006. Borrower origination fees are gradually reduced to zero in FFELP by 2010, and to one percent in Direct Loan program by 2010. Collection of one percent FFELP guaranty fee is mandated for all guarantors, including those with voluntary flexible agreements, but can be paid on behalf of the borrower by lenders or guarantors. Lender reinsurance is reduced to 99 percent with Exceptional Performer designation for claims filed after July 1, 2006, and 97 percent without designation on loans disbursed after July 1, 2006. Super 2 Step and in school consolidation loopholes will be closed as of July 1, 2006. Recycling of 9.5 percent loans is prohibited for loan holders with more than $100 million in 9.5 percent loans, as of date of enactment, and other 9.5 percent reforms enacted in 2004 are made permanent. The limitation on SAP for PLUS loans made after January 1, 2000 is repealed. Loan limits are increased as of July 1, 2007. A moratorium on new schools as lender is created after April 1, 2006, and additional requirements are created for schools continuing to participate in this program. Graduate students become eligible to take out PLUS loans. Compensation for guarantor collections via loan consolidation is reduced from a maximum of 18.5 percent to 10 percent, along with a cap on the proportion of collection via consolidations. Requirements for collections via loan rehabilitations are made somewhat easier. New grant programs are available for Pell eligible students. 101 The Reauthorization Legislation does not change the interest rates on Stafford loans which, under legislation enacted in 2002, are scheduled to become fixed 6.8 percent for all loans disbursed after July 1, 2006. Under the previous legislation, the PLUS rate was scheduled to become fixed at 7.9 percent after July 1, 2006. The Reauthorization Legislation raises this rate to 8.5 percent for FFELP PLUS loans. Due to a drafting error in the bill, the PLUS rate for the FDLP was not changed and remains at 7.9 percent in the statute. Committee Staff have acknowledged this error and we expect it to be corrected prior to the July 1st effective date. The rates for Consolidation Loans are unchanged by the Reauthorization Legislation; the formula remains the weighted average of the rates on the underling loans, rounded up to the nearest eighth. The Reauthorization Legislation does not end the single holder rule affecting loan consolidations, although Congress may do so in the future.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis The effect of short term movements in interest rates on our results of operations and financial position has been limited through our interest rate risk management. The following tables summarize the effect on earnings for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 and the effect on fair values at December 31, 2005 and 2004, based upon a sensitivity analysis performed by management assuming a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of 100 basis points and 300 basis points while funding spreads remain constant. Year ended December 31, 2005 Year ended December 31, 2004 Interest Rates: Interest Rates: Change from increase of 100 basis points Change from increase of 300 basis points Change from increase of 100 basis points Change from increase of 300 basis points (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) $ % $ % $ % $ % Effect on Earnings Increase/(decrease) in pre tax net income before unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities $ 12 1 % $ 14 1 % $ 31 3 % $ 138 14 % Unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities 202 32 347 55 279 18 576 37 Increase in net income before taxes $ 214 10 % $ 361 17 % $ 310 12 % $ 714 28 % Increase in diluted earnings per share $ .323 11 % $ .580 19 % $ .424 10 % $ .975 24 % At December 31, 2005 Interest Rates: Change from increase of 100 basis points Change from increase of 300 basis points (Dollars in millions) Fair Value $ % $ % Effect on Fair Values Assets Total FFELP student loans $ 76,492 $ (215 ) % $ (385 ) (1 )% Private Education Loans 9,189 Other earning assets 9,344 (57 ) (1 ) (164 ) (2 ) Other assets 7,429 (292 ) (4 ) (377 ) (5 ) Total assets $ 102,454 $ (564 ) (1 )% $ (926 ) (1 )% Liabilities Interest bearing liabilities $ 92,026 $ (1,437 ) (2 )% $ (3,612 ) (4 )% Other liabilities 3,609 975 27 2,863 79 Total liabilities $ 95,635 $ (462 ) % $ (749 ) (1 )% 103 At December 31, 2004 Interest Rates: Change from increase of 100 basis points Change from increase of 300 basis points (Dollars in millions) Fair Value $ % $ % Effect on Fair Values Assets Total FFELP student loans $ 61,531 $ (315 ) (1 )% $ (636 ) (1 )% Private Education Loans 5,900 Other earning assets 10,285 (120 ) (1 ) (333 ) (3 ) Other assets 7,878 (652 ) (8 ) (1,154 ) (15 ) Total assets $ 85,594 $ (1,087 ) (1 )% $ (2,123 ) (2 )% Liabilities Interest bearing liabilities $ 78,295 $ (1,202 ) (2 )% $ (3,356 ) (4 )% Other liabilities 2,798 276 10 1,503 54 Total liabilities $ 81,093 $ (926 ) (1 )% $ (1,853 ) (2 )% A primary objective in our funding is to minimize our sensitivity to changing interest rates by generally funding our floating rate student loan portfolio with floating rate debt. However, as discussed under LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENT Summary of our Managed Student Loan Portfolio Floor Income, in the current low interest rate environment, we can have a fixed versus floating mismatch in funding if the student loan earns at the fixed borrower rate and the funding remains floating. During the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, certain FFELP student loans were earning Floor Income and we locked in a portion of that Floor Income through the use of futures and Floor Income Contracts. The result of these hedging transactions was to convert a portion of the fixed rate nature of student loans to variable rate, and to fix the relative spread between the student loan asset rate and the variable rate liability. In the above table under the scenario where interest rates increase 100 and 300 basis points, the increase in pre tax net income before the unrealized derivative market value adjustment for 2005 and 2004 is primarily due to the impact of (i) our off balance sheet hedged Consolidation Loan securitizations and the related Embedded Floor Income recognized as part of the gain on sale, which results in no change in the Embedded Floor Income as a result of the increase in rates but does result in a decrease in payments on the written Floor contracts; offset by (ii) our unhedged on balance sheet loans earning in a fixed rate mode as discussed above. Due to the continued increase in interest rates during 2005, the above factors had less impact on pre tax net income for the year ended December 31, 2005. The change in pre tax net income before the unrealized derivative market value adjustment under a 300 basis point increase in rates is not proportional to the change under the scenario where interest rates increase 100 basis points because of the additional spread earned on loans hedged with futures and swaps mentioned above and the greater proportion of loans earning at a floating rate under a 300 basis point increase in rates. In addition to interest rate risk addressed in the preceding tables, the Company is also exposed to risks related to foreign currency exchange rates and the equity price of its own stock. Foreign currency exchange risk is the result of foreign denominated debt issued by the Company. The Companys policy is to use cross currency interest rate swaps to swap all foreign denominated debt payments (fixed and floating) to U.S. dollar LIBOR using a fixed exchange rate. In the tables above, there would be an immaterial impact on earnings if exchange rates were to decrease or increase, due to the terms of the hedging instrument and hedged items matching. The balance sheet interest bearing liabilities would be affected by a change in exchange rates, however, the change would be materially offset by the cross currency interest rate swaps in other assets or other liabilities. Equity price risk of the Companys own stock is due to equity forward 104 contracts used in the Companys share repurchase program. A hypothetical decrease in the Companys stock price per share of $5.00 and $10.00 would decrease unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities by $213 million and $426 million, respectively. In addition to the net income impact, other assets would decrease by the aforementioned amounts. Stock price decreases can also result in the counterparty exercising its right to demand early settlement on a portion of or the total contract depending on trigger prices set in each contract. With the $5.00 and $10.00 decrease in unit stock price above, none of these triggers would be met and no counterparty would have the right to early settlement.
