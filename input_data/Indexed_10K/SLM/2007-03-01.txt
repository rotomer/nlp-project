Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Years ended December 31, 2004 2006 (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts, unless otherwise stated) FORWARD LOOKING AND CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS Some of the statements contained in this Annual Report discuss future expectations and business strategies or include other forward looking information. Those statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the statements. The forward looking information is based on various factors and was derived using numerous assumptions. OVERVIEW We are the largest source of funding, delivery and servicing support for education loans in the United States. Our primary business is to originate, acquire and hold both federally guaranteed student loans and Private Education Loans, which are not federally guaranteed or privately insured. The primary source of our earnings is from net interest income earned on those student loans as well as gains on the sales of such loans in securitization transactions. We also earn fees for pre default and post default receivables management services on student loans, such that we are engaged in every phase of the student loan life cycle from originating and servicing student loans to default prevention and ultimately the collection on defaulted student loans. Through recent acquisitions, we have expanded our receivables management services to a number of different asset classes outside of student loans. We also provide a wide range of other financial services, processing capabilities and information technology to meet the needs of educational institutions, lenders, students and their families, and guarantee agencies. SLM Corporation, more commonly known as Sallie Mae, is a holding company that operates through a number of subsidiaries. References in this report to the Company refer to SLM Corporation and its subsidiaries. We have used both internal growth and strategic acquisitions to attain our leadership position in the education finance marketplace. Our sales force, which delivers our products on campuses across the country, is the largest in the student loan industry. The core of our marketing strategy is to promote our on campus brands, which generate student loan originations through our Preferred Channel. Loans generated through our Preferred Channel are more profitable than loans acquired through other acquisition channels because we own them earlier in the student loans life and generally incur lower costs to acquire such loans. We have built brand leadership through the Sallie Mae name, the brands of our subsidiaries and those of our lender partners. These sales and marketing efforts are supported by the largest and most diversified servicing capabilities in the industry, providing an unmatched array of services to financial aid offices. In recent years, borrowers have been consolidating their FFELP Stafford loans into FFELP Consolidation Loans in much greater numbers such that FFELP Consolidation Loans now constitute 56 percent of our Managed loan portfolio. FFELP Consolidation Loans are marketed directly to consumers and we believe they will continue to be an important loan acquisition channel. We have expanded into a number of fee based businesses, most notably, our Debt Management Operations (DMO) business. Our DMO business provides a wide range of accounts receivable and collections services including student loan default aversion services, defaulted student loan portfolio management services, contingency collections services for student loans and other asset classes, and accounts receivable management and collection for purchased portfolios of receivables that are delinquent or have been charged off by their original creditors. We also purchase and managed portfolios of sub performing and non performing mortgage loans. In December 2004, we completed the Wind Down of the GSE through the defeasance of all remaining GSE debt obligations and dissolution of the GSEs federal charter. The liquidity provided to the Company by 32 Table of Contents the GSE has been replaced primarily by securitizations. In addition to securitizations, we have access to a number of additional sources of liquidity including an asset backed commercial paper program, unsecured revolving credit facilities, and other unsecured corporate debt and equity security issuances. We manage our business through two primary operating segments: the Lending operating segment and the DMO operating segment. Accordingly, the results of operations of the Companys Lending and DMO operating segments are presented separately below under BUSINESS SEGMENTS. These operating segments are considered reportable segments under the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, based on quantitative thresholds applied to the Companys financial statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations addresses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions. Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, Significant Accounting Policies, includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates its estimates, particularly those that include the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and are often about matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates relate to the following accounting policies that are discussed in more detail below: application of the effective interest method for loans (premiums, discounts and Borrower Benefits), securitization accounting and Retained Interests, allowance for loan losses, and derivative accounting. In recent years, we have frequently updated a number of estimates to account for the continued high level of FFELP Consolidation Loan activity. Also, a number of these estimates affect life of loan calculations. Since our student loans have long average lives, the cumulative effect of relatively small changes in estimates can be material. Premiums, Discounts and Borrower Benefits For both federally insured and Private Education Loans, we account for premiums paid, discounts received, capitalized direct origination costs incurred on the origination of student loans, and the impact of Borrower Benefits in accordance with SFAS No. 91, Accounting for Nonrefundable Fees and Costs Associated with Originating or Acquiring Loans and Initial Direct Costs of Leases. The unamortized portion of the premiums and the discounts is included in the carrying value of the student loans on the consolidated balance sheet. We recognize income on our student loan portfolio based on the expected yield of the student loan after giving effect to the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of student loan discounts, as well as the impact of Borrower Benefits. Premiums, capitalized direct origination costs and discounts received are amortized over the estimated life of the loan, which includes an estimate of prepayment speeds. Estimates for future prepayments are incorporated in an estimated Constant Prepayment Rate (CPR), which is primarily based upon the historical prepayments due to consolidation and defaults, extensions from the utilization of forbearance, as well as, managements expectation of future prepayments and extensions. For Borrower Benefits, the estimates of their effect on student loan yield are based on analyses of historical payment behavior of borrowers who are eligible for the incentives, and the evaluation of the ultimate qualification rate for these incentives. We periodically evaluate the assumptions used to estimate the loan life and qualification rates, and in instances where there are modifications to the assumptions, amortization is adjusted on a cumulative basis to reflect the change. The estimate of the CPR measures the rate at which loans in the portfolio pay before their stated maturity. A number of factors can affect the CPR estimate such as the rate of consolidation activity and default rates. Changes in CPR estimates are discussed in more detail below. The impact of Borrower Benefits is dependent 33 Table of Contents on the estimate of the number of borrowers who will eventually qualify for these benefits. For competitive purposes, we occasionally change Borrower Benefits programs in both amount and qualification factors. These programmatic changes must be reflected in the estimate of the Borrower Benefits discount. Securitization Accounting and Retained Interests We regularly engage in securitization transactions as part of our financing strategy (see also LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Securitization Activities). In a securitization, we sell student loans to a trust that issues bonds backed by the student loans as part of the transaction. When our securitizations meet the sale criteria of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities a Replacement of SFAS No. 125, we record a gain on the sale of the student loans, which is the difference between the allocated cost basis of the assets sold and the relative fair value of the assets received. The primary judgment in determining the fair value of the assets received is the valuation of the Residual Interest. The Residual Interests in each of our securitizations are treated as available for sale securities in accordance with SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and therefore must be marked to market with temporary unrealized gains and losses recognized, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. Since there are no quoted market prices for our Residual Interests, we estimate their fair value both initially and each subsequent quarter using the key assumptions listed below: the projected net interest yield from the underlying securitized loans, which can be impacted by the forward yield curve, as well as the Borrower Benefits program; the calculation of the Embedded Floor Income associated with the securitized loan portfolio; the CPR; the discount rate used, which is intended to be commensurate with the risks involved; and the expected credit losses from the underlying securitized loan portfolio. We recognize interest income and periodically evaluate our Residual Interests for other than temporary impairment in accordance with the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 99 20, Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Residual Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets. Under this standard, each quarter we estimate the remaining cash flows to be received from our Retained Interests and use these revised cash flows to prospectively calculate a yield for income recognition. In cases where our estimate of future cash flows results in a lower yield from that used to recognize interest income in the prior quarter, the Residual Interest is written down to fair value, first to the extent of any unrealized gain in accumulated other comprehensive income, then through earnings as an other than temporary impairment, and the yield used to recognize subsequent income from the trust is negatively impacted. We also receive income for servicing the loans in our securitization trusts. We assess the amounts received as compensation for these activities at inception and on an ongoing basis to determine if the amounts received are adequate compensation as defined in SFAS No. 140. To the extent such compensation is determined to be no more or less than adequate compensation, no servicing asset or obligation is recorded. Allowance for Loan Losses We maintain an allowance for loan losses at an amount sufficient to absorb losses inherent in our FFELP and Private Education Loan portfolios at the reporting date based on a projection of estimated probable net credit losses. We analyze those portfolios to determine the effects that the various stages of delinquency have on borrower default behavior and ultimate charge off. We estimate the allowance for loan losses and losses on accrued interest income for our Managed loan portfolio using a migration analysis of delinquent and current accounts. A migration analysis is a technique used to estimate the likelihood that a loan receivable may progress through the various delinquency stages and ultimately charge off, and is a widely used reserving methodology in the consumer finance industry. We also use the migration analysis to estimate the amount of 34 Table of Contents uncollectible accrued interest on Private Education Loans and write off that amount against current period interest income. When calculating the allowance for loan loses on Private Education Loan loss, we divide the portfolio into categories of similar risk characteristics based on loan program type, loan status (in school, grace, repayment, forbearance, delinquency), underwriting criteria, existence or absence of a co borrower, and aging. We then apply default and collection rate projections to each category. Our higher education Private Education Loan programs (90 percent of the Managed Private Education Loan portfolio at December 31, 2006) do not require the borrowers to begin repayment until six months after they have graduated or otherwise left school. Consequently, our loss estimates for these programs are minimal while the borrower is in school. Our career training and alternative Private Education Loan programs (10 percent of the Managed Private Education Loan portfolio at December 31, 2006) generally require the borrowers to start repaying their loans immediately. At December 31, 2006, 46 percent of the principal balance in the higher education Managed Private Education Loan portfolio is related to borrowers who are still in school and not required to make payments. As the current portfolio ages, an increasing percentage of the borrowers will leave school and be required to begin payments on their loans. The allowance for losses will change accordingly with the percentage of borrowers in repayment. Our loss estimates are based on a loss emergence period of two years. Similar to the rules governing FFELP payment requirements, our collection policies allow for periods of nonpayment for borrowers requesting additional payment grace periods upon leaving school or experiencing temporary difficulty meeting payment obligations. This is referred to as forbearance status and is considered separately in our allowance of loan losses. The majority of forbearance occurs early in the repayment term when borrowers are starting their careers (see LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENT Private Education Loans Delinquencies). At December 31, 2006, 9 percent of the Managed Private Education Loan portfolio in repayment and forbearance was in forbearance status. The loss emergence period is in alignment with our typical collection cycle and takes into account these periods of nonpayment. In general, Private Education Loan principal is charged off against the allowance when the loan exceeds 212 days delinquency. Recoveries on loans charged off are considered when calculating the allowance for loan losses, and actual cash recoveries are therefore recorded directly to the allowance. As a result of Sallie Mae Servicings Exceptional Performer (EP) designation for ED, the Company received 100 percent reimbursement (declining to 99 percent on July 1, 2006 under the Reconciliation Legislation, discussed below) on default claims on federally guaranteed student loans that are serviced by Sallie Mae Servicing for a period of at least 270 days before the date of default. The Company is entitled to receive this benefit as long as the Company remains in compliance with the required servicing standards, which are assessed on an annual and quarterly basis through compliance audits and other criteria. The EP designation applies to all FFELP loans that are serviced by the Company as well as default claims on federally guaranteed student loans that the Company owns but are serviced by other service providers with the EP designation. The Reconciliation Legislation, signed into law on February 8, 2006, reduced the level of default insurance from 98 percent to 97 percent (effectively increasing Risk Sharing from two percent to three percent) on loans disbursed after July 1, 2006 for lenders without the EP designation. Furthermore, the bill reduced the default insurance paid to lenders/servicers with the EP designation to 99 percent from 100 percent on claims filed on or after July 1, 2006. As a result of the amended insurance levels, we established a Risk Sharing allowance as of December 31, 2005 for an estimate of losses on FFELP student loans based on the one percent reduction in default insurance for servicers with the EP designation. The reserve was established using a migration analysis similar to that described above for the Private Education Loans before applying the appropriate Risk Sharing percentage. The evaluation of the provisions for loan losses is inherently subjective, as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant changes. Management believes that the allowance for loan losses is appropriate to cover probable losses in the student loan portfolio. 35 Table of Contents Effects of Consolidation Activity on Estimates Consolidation activity continued at high levels in 2006 and we expect it to continue as borrowers respond to aggressive marketing in the student loan industry and look to lengthen the term of their loans and lower their monthly payments. This, in turn, has had a significant effect on a number of accounting estimates in recent years. We have updated our assumptions that are affected primarily by consolidation activity and updated the estimates used in developing the cash flows and effective yield calculations as they relate to the amortization of student loan premiums and discounts, Borrower Benefits, residual interest income and the valuation of the Residual Interest. Consolidation activity affects each estimate differently depending on whether the original loans being consolidated were on balance sheet or off balance sheet and whether the resulting consolidation is retained by us or consolidated with a third party. When we consolidate a loan that was in our portfolio, the term of that loan is generally extended and the term of the amortization of associated student loan premiums and discounts is likewise extended to match the new term of the loan. In that process, the unamortized premium balance must be adjusted to reflect the new expected term of the consolidated loan as if it had been in place from inception. The estimate of the CPR also affects the estimate of the average life of securitized trusts and therefore affects the valuation of the Residual Interest. Prepayments shorten the average life of the trust, and if all other factors remain equal, will reduce the value of the Residual Interest, the securitization gain on sale and the effective yield used to recognize interest income. Prepayments on student loans in our securitized trusts are significantly impacted by the rate at which securitized loans are consolidated. When a loan is consolidated from the trust either by us or a third party, the loan is treated as a prepayment. In cases where the loan is consolidated by us, it will be recorded as an on balance sheet asset. We discuss the effects of changes in our CPR estimates in LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Securitization Activities and Liquidity Risk and Funding Long Term. The increased activity in FFELP Consolidation Loans has led to demand for the consolidation of Private Education loans. Private Education Consolidation Loans provide an attractive refinancing opportunity to certain borrowers because they allow borrowers to lower their monthly payments and extend the life of the loan. Consolidation of Private Education Loans from off balance sheet Private Education Loan trusts will increase the CPR used to value the Residual Interest. 36 Table of Contents Effect of Consolidation Activity The schedule below summarizes the impact of loan consolidation on each affected financial statement line item.

Decrease in prospective effective yield used to recognize interest income. Derivative Accounting We use interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps, interest rate futures contracts, Floor Income Contracts and interest rate cap contracts as an integral part of our overall risk management strategy to manage interest rate and foreign currency risk arising from our fixed rate and floating rate financial instruments. We account for these instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which requires that every derivative instrument, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability. We determine the fair value for our derivative instruments primarily by using pricing models that consider current market inputs and the contractual terms of the derivative contracts. The fair value of some derivatives are determined using counterparty valuations. Pricing models and their underlying assumptions impact the amount and timing of unrealized gains and losses recognized; the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different financial results. As a matter of policy, we compare the fair values of our derivatives that we 37 Table of Contents calculate to those provided by our counterparties on a monthly basis. Any significant differences are identified and resolved appropriately. SFAS No. 133 requires that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria as specified by SFAS No. 133 are met. We believe that all of our derivatives are effective economic hedges and are a critical element of our interest rate risk management strategy. However, under SFAS No. 133, some of our derivatives, primarily Floor Income Contracts, certain Eurodollar futures contracts, basis swaps and equity forwards, do not qualify for hedge treatment under SFAS No. 133. Therefore, changes in market value along with the periodic net settlements must be recorded through the gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net line in the income statement with no consideration for the corresponding change in fair value of the hedged item. The derivative market value adjustment is primarily caused by interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate volatility, changing credit spreads during the period, and changes in our stock price (related to equity forwards) as well as, the volume and term of derivatives not receiving hedge accounting treatment.

As discussed in detail above in the OVERVIEW section, we have two primary business segments, Lending and DMO, plus a Corporate and Other business segment. Since these business segments operate in distinct business environments, the discussion following the results of our operations is primarily presented on a segment basis. See BUSINESS SEGMENTS for further discussion on the components of each segment. Securitization gains and the ongoing servicing and securitization income are included in LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Securitization Activities. The discussion of derivative market value gains and losses is under BUSINESS SEGMENTS Limitations of Core Earnings Pre tax Differences between Core Earnings and GAAP by Business Segment Derivative Accounting. CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS SUMMARY The main drivers of our net income are the growth in our Managed student loan portfolio, which drives net interest income and securitization transactions, market value gains and losses on derivatives that do not receive hedge accounting treatment, the timing and size of securitization gains, growth in our fee based business and expense control. 39 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 For the year ended December 31, 2006, net income was $1.2 billion ($2.63 diluted earnings per share), a 16 percent decrease from the $1.4 billion in net income ($3.05 diluted earnings per share) for the year ended December 31, 2005. On a pre tax basis, year to date 2006 net income of $2.0 billion was a 6 percent decrease from the $2.1 billion in pre tax net income earned in the year ended December 31, 2005. The larger percentage decrease in year over year, after tax net income versus pre tax net income is driven by the tax accounting permanent impact of excluding $360 million in unrealized equity forward losses from 2006 taxable income and excluding $121 million of unrealized equity forward gains from 2005 taxable income. Fluctuations in the effective tax rate are driven by the permanent impact of the exclusion of the gains and losses on equity forward contracts with respect to the Companys stock for tax purposes. Under SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity, we are required to mark the equity forward contracts to market each quarter and recognize the change in their value in income. Conversely, these unrealized gains and losses are not recognized on a tax basis. The net effect from excluding non taxable gains and losses on equity forward contracts from taxable income was an increase in the effective tax rate from 34 percent in the year ended December 31, 2005 to 42 percent in the year ended December 31, 2006. Securitization gains increased by $350 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 versus 2005. The securitization gains for 2006 were primarily driven by the three off balance sheet Private Education Loan securitizations, which had total pre tax gains of $830 million or 16 percent of the amount securitized, versus two off balance sheet Private Education Loan securitizations in 2005, which had pre tax gains of $453 million or 15 percent of the amount securitized. For the year ended December 31, 2006, servicing and securitization revenue increased by $196 million to $553 million. The increase in servicing and securitization revenue can be attributed to $103 million in lower impairments on our Retained Interests and the growth in the average balance of off balance sheet student loans. Impairments are primarily caused by the effect of FFELP Consolidation Loan activity on our FFELP Stafford securitization trusts. Pre tax impairments on our Retained Interests in securitizations totaled $157 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 versus $260 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. In 2006, net losses on derivative and hedging activities were $339 million, a decrease of $586 million from the net gains of $247 million in 2005. This decrease primarily relates to $230 million of unrealized losses in 2006, versus unrealized gains of $634 million in the prior year, which resulted in a year over year reduction in pre tax income of $864 million. The effect of the unrealized losses was partially offset by a $278 million reduction in realized losses on derivatives and hedging activities on instruments that were not accounted for as hedges. The decrease in unrealized gains was primarily due to the impact of a lower SLM stock price on our equity forward contracts which resulted in a mark to market unrealized loss of $360 million in 2006 versus an unrealized gain of $121 million in the year ago period, and to a decrease of $305 million in unrealized gains on Floor Income Contracts. The smaller unrealized gains on our Floor Income Contracts were primarily caused by the relationship between the Floor Income Contracts strike prices versus the estimated forward interest rates during 2006 versus 2005. Year over year interest income is roughly unchanged as the $12 billion increase in average interest earning assets was offset by a 23 basis point decrease in the net interest margin. The year over year decrease in the net interest margin is due to higher average interest rates which reduced gross Floor Income by $155 million, and to the increase in the average balance of lower yielding cash and investments. Our Managed student loan portfolio grew by $19.6 billion (or 16 percent), from $122.5 billion at December 31, 2005 to $142.1 billion at December 31, 2006. In 2006 we acquired $37.4 billion of student loans, a 24 percent increase over the $30.2 billion acquired in the year ago period. The 2006 acquisitions included $8.4 billion in Private Education Loans, a 31 percent increase over the $6.4 billion acquired in 2005. In the year ended December 31, 2006, we originated $23.4 billion of student loans through our Preferred Channel, an increase of 9 percent over the $21.4 billion originated in the year ago period. 40 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 For the year ended December 31, 2005, our net income decreased by 26 percent to $1.4 billion ($3.05 diluted earnings per share) from net income of $1.9 billion ($4.04 diluted earnings per share) in 2004. On a pre tax basis, income for the year ended December 31, 2005 decreased by 19 percent to $2.1 billion versus $2.6 billion in the year ended December 31, 2004. The larger percentage decrease in net income versus pre tax income from 2004 to 2005 is primarily due to the increase in the effective tax rate from 25 percent in the year ended 2004 to 34 percent in the year ended 2005. In the year ended 2005, we recognized unrealized gains on our outstanding equity forward contracts of $121 million versus unrealized gains of $759 million in the year ended 2004. The decrease in pre tax income is primarily due to a $602 million decrease in the gain on derivative and hedging activities, which primarily relates to derivatives that do not receive hedge accounting treatment. Unrealized derivative gains and losses are primarily driven by the effect of changes in the fair market value of Floor Income Contracts and the effect of an increase in the value of our stock price on equity forward contracts. The smaller unrealized gains on our Floor Income Contracts in 2005 were due to fewer contracts being in the money to the counterparty due to spot interest rates, and to a smaller rise in forward interest rates in 2005 versus 2004. Our stock price increased in both 2005 and 2004, but the absolute increase was less in 2005 resulting in a smaller unrealized gain on our equity forward contracts in 2005. The year over year decrease in servicing and securitization revenue was due primarily to impairments of our Retained Interests in securitizations of $260 million in 2005 versus $80 million in 2004. These impairments are largely driven by the continued rise in FFELP Consolidation Loan activity. The increase in impairment losses was partially offset by an increase in securitization gains of $177 million primarily caused by higher percentage gains on the two off balance sheet Private Education Loan securitizations in 2005, versus the two off balance sheet Private Education Loan securitizations in 2004. The year over year increase in debt management fees and collections revenue of $188 million is primarily due to a full year impact of collections revenue from AFS, acquired in the third quarter of 2004, and overall growth in the contingency fee businesses. Positive impacts to pre tax income were offset by the year over year increase in operating expenses of $243 million, primarily attributable to the expenses associated with three subsidiaries acquired in the second half of 2004: AFS, Southwest Student Services Corporation (Southwest) and Student Loan Finance Association (SLFA). Net income for the year ended December 31, 2004 was also negatively impacted by a $221 million pre tax loss related to the repurchase and defeasance of $3.0 billion of GSE debt in connection with the GSE Wind Down in 2004. Our Managed student loan portfolio grew by $15.1 billion, from $107.4 billion at December 31, 2004 to $122.5 billion at December 31, 2005. This growth was fueled by the acquisition of $30.2 billion of student loans in the year ended 2005, a 27 percent increase over the $23.7 billion acquired in 2004, exclusive of student loans acquired from the acquisition of Southwest and SLFA. In the year ended 2005, we originated $21.4 billion of student loans through our Preferred Channel, an increase of 19 percent over the $18.0 billion originated in the year ended 2004. 41 Table of Contents Average Balance Sheets The following table reflects the rates earned on interest earning assets and paid on interest bearing liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. This table reflects the net interest margin for the entire Company on a consolidated basis. It is included in the Lending segment discussion because that segment includes substantially all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities.

The net interest margin was also negatively impacted by the increase in lower yielding cash and investments being held as collateral for on balance sheet securitization trusts and by the higher average balance of non interest earning assets. In 2004, the net interest margin was negatively impacted by the higher average balances of lower yielding short term investments which were being built up during 2004 as additional liquidity in anticipation of the GSE Wind Down. Student Loans For both federally insured and Private Education Loans, we account for premiums paid, discounts received and certain origination costs incurred on the origination and acquisition of student loans in accordance with SFAS No. 91, Accounting for Nonrefundable Fees and Costs Associated with Originating or Acquiring Loans and Initial Direct Costs of Leases. The unamortized portion of the premiums and discounts is included in the carrying value of the student loan on the consolidated balance sheet. We recognize income on our student loan portfolio based on the expected yield of the student loan after giving effect to the amortization of purchase premiums and the accretion of student loan discounts, as well as interest rate reductions and rebates expected to be earned through Borrower Benefits programs. Discounts on Private Education Loans are deferred and accreted to income over the lives of the student loans. In the table below, this accretion of discounts is netted with the amortization of the premiums. Student Loan Spread An important performance measure closely monitored by management is the student loan spread. The student loan spread is the difference between the income earned on the student loan assets and the interest paid on the debt funding those assets. A number of factors can affect the overall student loan spread such as: the mix of student loans in the portfolio, with FFELP Consolidation Loans having the lowest spread and Private Education Loans having the highest spread; the premiums paid, borrower fees charged and capitalized costs incurred to acquire student loans which impact the spread through subsequent amortization; the type and level of Borrower Benefits programs for which the student loans are eligible; 43 Table of Contents the level of Floor Income and, when considering the Core Earnings spread, the amount of Floor Income eligible loans that have been hedged through Floor Income Contracts; and funding and hedging costs. Wholesale Consolidation Loans During 2006, we implemented a new loan acquisition strategy under which we began purchasing FFELP Consolidation Loans outside of our normal origination channels, primarily via the spot market. We refer to this new loan acquisition strategy as our Wholesale Consolidation Channel. FFELP Consolidation Loans acquired through this channel are considered incremental volume to our core acquisition channels, which are focused on the retail marketplace with an emphasis on our internal brand strategy. Wholesale Consolidation Loans generally command significantly higher premiums than our originated FFELP Consolidation Loans, and as a result, Wholesale Consolidation Loans have lower spreads. Since Wholesale Consolidation Loans are acquired outside of our core loan acquisition channels and have different yields and return expectations than the rest of our FFELP Consolidation Loan portfolio, we have excluded the impact of the Wholesale Consolidation Loan volume from the student loan spread analysis to provide more meaningful period over period comparisons on the performance of our student loan portfolio. We will therefore discuss the volume and its effect on the spread of the Wholesale Consolidation Loan portfolio separately. The student loan spread is highly susceptible to liquidity, funding and interest rate risk. These risks are discussed separately in LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES and in the RISK FACTORS discussion. Student Loan Spread Analysis On Balance Sheet The following table analyzes the reported earnings from on balance sheet student loans. For an analysis of our student loan spread for the entire portfolio of Managed student loans on a similar basis to the on balance sheet analysis, see LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENT Student Loan Spread Analysis Core Earnings Basis. Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 On Balance Sheet Student loan yield, before Floor Income 7.94 % 6.22 % 4.53 % Gross Floor Income .04 .25 .73 Consolidation Loan Rebate Fees (.67 ) (.65 ) (.58 ) Offset Fees (.03 ) Borrower Benefits (.12 ) (.11 ) (.18 ) Premium and discount amortization (.14 ) (.16 ) (.13 ) Student loan net yield 7.05 5.55 4.34 Student loan cost of funds (5.36 ) (3.69 ) (2.01 ) Student loan spread(1) 1.69 % 1.86 % 2.33 % Average Balances On balance sheet student loans(1) $ 84,173 $ 74,724 $ 55,885 (1) Excludes the impact of the Wholesale Consolidation Loan portfolio on the student loan spread and average balance for the year ended December 31, 2006. Discussion of Student Loan Spread Effects of Floor Income and Derivative Accounting In low interest rate environments, one of the primary drivers of fluctuations in our on balance sheet student loan spread is the level of gross Floor Income (Floor Income earned before payments on Floor Income 44 Table of Contents Contracts) earned in the period. Since 2004, average short term interest rates have steadily increased resulting in a significant reduction in the level of gross Floor Income earned since 2004. We believe that we have economically hedged most of the long term Floor Income through the sale of Floor Income Contracts, under which we receive an upfront fee and agree to pay the counterparty the Floor Income earned on a notional amount of student loans. These contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and as a result the payments on the Floor Income Contracts are included on the income statement with gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net rather than in student loan interest income, where the offsetting Floor Income is recorded. In addition to Floor Income Contracts, we also extensively use basis swaps to manage our basis risk associated with interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. These swaps generally do not qualify as accounting hedges and are likewise required to be accounted for in the gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net line on the income statement. As a result, they are not considered in the calculation of the cost of funds in the above table. Discussion of the Year over Year Effect of Changes in Accounting Estimates on the On Balance Sheet Student Loan Spread As discussed in detail and summarized in a table under CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES, we periodically update our estimates for changes in the student loan portfolio. Under SFAS No. 91, these changes in estimates must be reflected in the balance of the student loan from inception. We have also updated our estimates to reflect programmatic changes in our Borrower Benefits and Private Education Loan programs and have made modeling refinements to better reflect current and future conditions. The cumulative effects of the changes in estimates on the student loan spread are summarized in the table below: Years ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Dollar Basis Dollar Basis Dollar Basis Value Points Value Points Value Points Cumulative effect of changes in critical accounting estimates: Premium and discount amortization $ $ $ (8 ) (1 ) Borrower Benefits 10 1 23 3 5 1 Total cumulative effect of changes in estimates $ 10 1 $ 23 3 $ (3 ) In 2006, we changed our policy related to Borrower Benefit qualification requirements and updated our assumptions to reflect this policy. In both 2005 and 2004, we updated our estimates for the qualification of Borrower Benefits to account for programmatic changes, as well as, the effect of continued high levels of consolidations. Discussion of Student Loan Spread Effects of Significant Events in 2006 and 2005 In addition to changes in estimates discussed above, FFELP Consolidation Loan activity has the greatest effect on fluctuations in our premium amortization and Borrower Benefits as we write off the balance of unamortized premium and the Borrower Benefit reserve when loans are consolidated away, in accordance with SFAS No. 91. See below for a further discussion of the effects of FFELP Consolidation Loans on the student loan spread versus Stafford Loans. Also see CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Effects of Consolidation Activity on Estimates. Also, there were high levels of FFELP Consolidation Loan activity in the second quarter of both 2006 and 2005 caused primarily by FFELP Stafford borrowers locking in lower interest rates by consolidating their loans prior to the July 1 interest rate reset for FFELP Stafford loans. In addition, there were two new methods of consolidation practiced by the industry in 2005 and the first half of 2006 that increased the amount of FFELP Stafford loans consolidated out of our portfolio resulting in increased premium write offs. First, 45 Table of Contents borrowers were permitted for the first time to consolidate their loans while still in school. Second, a significant volume of our FFELP Consolidation Loans was reconsolidated with third party lenders through the FDLP, resulting in an increase in student loan premium write offs. In addition, the repeal of the Single Holder Rule also increased the amount of loans that consolidated with third parties. Consolidation of student loans does benefit the student loan spread to a lesser extent through the write off of Borrower Benefits reserves associated with these loans. Both in school consolidation and reconsolidation with third party lenders through the FDLP were restricted as of July 1, 2006 through the Higher Education Act of 2005. While FFELP Consolidation Loan activity remained high in 2006, it was lower than 2005, which contributed to lower student loan premium amortization in 2006. Discussion of Student Loan Spread Other Year over Year Fluctuations 2006 versus 2005 The decrease in the 2006 student loan spread versus 2005 is primarily due to the decrease in gross Floor Income discussed above. Additionally, a higher average balance of FFELP Consolidation Loans as a percentage of the on balance sheet portfolio contributes to downward pressure on the spread. FFELP Consolidation Loans have lower spreads than other FFELP loans due to the 105 basis point Consolidation Loan Rebate Fee, higher Borrower Benefits, and funding costs due to their longer terms. These negative effects are partially offset by lower student loan premium amortization due to the extended term and a higher Special Allowance Payment (SAP) yield. The average balance of FFELP Consolidation Loans grew as a percentage of the average on balance sheet FFELP student loan portfolio from 69 percent in 2005 to 72 percent in 2006. Discussion of Student Loan Spread Other Year over Year Fluctuations 2005 versus 2004 The decrease in the 2005 student loan spread versus 2004 is primarily due to the decrease in gross Floor Income discussed above. Additionally, higher average balance of FFELP Consolidation Loans as a percentage of the on balance sheet portfolio contributes to downward pressure on the spread. The average balance of FFELP Consolidation Loans grew as a percentage of the average on balance sheet FFELP student loan portfolio from 62 percent in 2004 to 69 percent in 2005. Other factors that impacted the student loan spread include higher spreads on our debt funding student loans as a result of the GSE Wind Down, partially offset by lower Borrower Benefits costs, and the absence of Offset Fees on GSE financed loans. The increase in funding costs is due to the replacement of lower cost, primarily short term GSE funding with longer term, higher cost funding. The negative effects on the spread were partially offset by the 43 percent increase in Private Education Loans in the on balance sheet student loan portfolio. Wholesale Consolidation Loans As discussed above, the on balance sheet student loan spread excludes the impact of our Wholesale Consolidation Loan portfolio whose average balance was $683 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Had the impact of the Wholesale Consolidation Loan volume been included in the on balance sheet student loan spread it would have reduced the spread by approximately 1 basis point for the year ended December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, Wholesale Consolidation Loans totaled $3.6 billion, or 5.9 percent, of our total on balance sheet FFELP Consolidation Loan portfolio. 46 Table of Contents Floor Income For on balance sheet student loans, gross Floor Income is included in student loan income whereas payments on Floor Income Contracts are included in the gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net line in other income. The following table summarizes the components of Floor Income from on balance sheet student loans, net of payments under Floor Income Contracts, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Fixed Variable Fixed Variable Fixed Variable Borrower Borrower Borrower Borrower Borrower Borrower Rate Rate Total Rate Rate Total Rate Rate Total Floor Income: Gross Floor Income $ 32 $ $ 32 $ 187 $ $ 187 $ 406 $ 2 $ 408 Payments on Floor Income Contracts (34 ) (34 ) (175 ) (175 ) (368 ) (368 ) Net Floor Income $ (2 ) $ $ (2 ) $ 12 $ $ 12 $ 38 $ 2 $ 40 Net Floor Income in basis points 2 2 7 7 Floor Income is primarily earned on fixed rate FFELP Consolidation Loans. During the first nine months of 2006, FFELP lenders reconsolidated FFELP Consolidation Loans using the Direct Loan Program as a pass through entity. This reconsolidation has left us in a slightly oversold position on our Floor Income Contracts and as a result net Floor Income in 2006 was a loss of $2 million. The Higher Education Act of 2005 has restricted the use of reconsolidation as of July 1, 2006, so we do not foresee any material impact on our Floor Income in the future. (See also RECENT DEVELOPMENTS for further discussion regarding the Higher Education Act of 2005.) As discussed in more detail under LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Securitization Activities, when we securitize a portfolio of student loans, we estimate the future Fixed Rate Embedded Floor Income earned on off balance sheet student loans using a discounted cash flow option pricing model and recognize the fair value of such cash flows in the initial gain on sale and subsequent valuations of the Residual Interest. Variable Rate Embedded Floor Income is recognized as earned in servicing and securitization revenue. FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES The Company is subject to federal and state income taxes, while the GSE was exempt from all state and local income taxes. Our effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was 42 percent, 34 percent and 25 percent, respectively. The effective tax rate reflects the permanent impact of the exclusion of gains and losses on equity forward contracts with respect to the Companys stock for tax purposes. These permanent differences were a $360 million loss in 2006, a $121 million gain in 2005 and a $759 million gain in 2004. BUSINESS SEGMENTS The results of operations of the Companys Lending and Debt Management Operations (DMO) operating segments are presented below. These defined business segments operate in distinct business environments and are considered reportable segments under SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, based on quantitative thresholds applied to the Companys financial statements. In addition, we provide other complementary products and services, including guarantor and student loan servicing, through smaller operating segments that do not meet such thresholds and are aggregated in the Corporate and Other reportable segment for financial reporting purposes. 47 Table of Contents The management reporting process measures the performance of the Companys operating segments based on the management structure of the Company as well as the methodology used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. In accordance with the Rules and Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), we prepare financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP). In addition to evaluating the Companys GAAP based financial information, management, including the Companys chief operation decision maker, evaluates the performance of the Companys operating segments based on their profitability on a basis that, as allowed under SFAS No. 131, differs from GAAP. We refer to managements basis of evaluating our segment results as Core Earnings presentations for each business segment and we refer to these performance measures in our presentations with credit rating agencies and lenders. Accordingly, information regarding the Companys reportable segments is provided herein based on Core Earnings, which are discussed in detail below. Our Core Earnings are not defined terms within GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Core Earnings net income reflects only current period adjustments to GAAP net income as described below. Unlike financial accounting, there is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance for management reporting and as a result, our management reporting is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Our operating segments are defined by the products and services they offer or the types of customers they serve, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by management. Intersegment revenues and expenses are netted within the appropriate financial statement line items consistent with the income statement presentation provided to management. Changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial information. Core Earnings are the primary financial performance measures used by management to develop the Companys financial plans, track results, and establish corporate performance targets and incentive compensation. While Core Earnings are not a substitute for reported results under GAAP, we rely on Core Earnings in operating our business because Core Earnings permit management to make meaningful period to period comparisons of the operational and performance indicators that are most closely assessed by management. Management believes this information provides additional insight into the financial performance of the core business activities of our operating segments. Accordingly, the tables presented below reflect Core Earnings which is reviewed and utilized by management to manage the business for each of our reportable segments. A further discussion regarding Core Earnings is included under Limitations of Core Earnings and Pre tax Differences between Core Earnings and GAAP by Business Segment. 48 Table of Contents The Lending operating segment includes all discussion of income and related expenses associated with the net interest margin, the student loan spread and its components, the provisions for loan losses, and other fees earned on our Managed portfolio of student loans. The DMO operating segment reflects the fees earned and expenses incurred in providing accounts receivable management and collection services. Our Corporate and Other reportable segment includes our remaining fee businesses and other corporate expenses that do not pertain directly to the primary segments identified above.

Nevertheless, Core Earnings are subject to certain general and specific limitations that investors should carefully consider. For example, as stated above, unlike financial accounting, there is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance for management reporting. Our Core Earnings are not defined terms within GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Unlike GAAP, Core Earnings reflect only current period adjustments to GAAP. Accordingly, the Companys Core Earnings presentation does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Investors, therefore, may not compare our Companys performance with that of other financial services companies based upon Core Earnings. Core Earnings results are only meant to supplement GAAP results by providing additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely used by management, the Companys board of directors, rating agencies and lenders to assess performance. Other limitations arise from the specific adjustments that management makes to GAAP results to derive Core Earnings results. For example, in reversing the unrealized gains and losses that result from SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge treatment, as well as on derivatives that do qualify but are in part ineffective because they are not perfect hedges, we focus on the long term economic effectiveness of those instruments relative to the underlying hedged item and isolate the effects of interest rate volatility, changing credit spreads and changes in our stock price on the fair value of such instruments during the period. Under GAAP, the effects of these factors on the fair value of the derivative instruments (but not on the underlying hedged item) tend to show more volatility in the short term. While our presentation of our results on a Core Earnings basis provides important information regarding the performance of our Managed portfolio, a limitation of this presentation is that we are presenting the ongoing spread income on loans that have been sold to a trust managed by us. While we believe that our Core Earnings presentation presents the economic substance of our Managed loan portfolio, it understates earnings volatility from securitization gains. Our Core Earnings results exclude certain Floor Income, which is real cash income, from our reported results and therefore may understate earnings in certain periods. Managements financial planning and valuation of operating results, however, does not take into account Floor Income because of its inherent uncertainty, except when it is economically hedged through Floor Income Contracts. Pre tax Differences between Core Earnings and GAAP by Business Segment Our Core Earnings are the primary financial performance measures used by management to evaluate performance and to allocate resources. Accordingly, financial information is reported to management on a Core Earnings basis by reportable segment, as these are the measures used regularly by our chief operating decision maker. Our Core Earnings are used in developing our financial plans and tracking results, and also in establishing corporate performance targets and determining incentive compensation. Management believes this information provides additional insight into the financial performance of the Companys core business activities. Core Earnings net income reflects only current period adjustments to GAAP net income, as described in the more detailed discussion of the differences between Core Earnings and GAAP that follows, 51 Table of Contents which includes further detail on each specific adjustment required to reconcile our Core Earnings segment presentation to our GAAP earnings. Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Corporate Corporate Corporate Lending DMO and Other Lending DMO and Other Lending DMO and Other Core Earnings adjustments: Net impact of securitization accounting $ 532 $ $ $ (60 ) $ $ $ (152 ) $ $ Net impact of derivative accounting 131 (360 ) 516 121 794 759 Net impact of Floor Income (209 ) (204 ) (156 ) Net impact of acquired intangibles (49 ) (34 ) (11 ) (42 ) (15 ) (4 ) (27 ) (5 ) (4 ) Total Core Earnings adjustments to GAAP $ 405 $ (34 ) $ (371 ) $ 210 $ (15 ) $ 117 $ 459 $ (5 ) $ 755 1) Securitization Accounting: Under GAAP, certain securitization transactions in our Lending operating segment are accounted for as sales of assets. Under Core Earnings for the Lending operating segment, we present all securitization transactions on a Core Earnings basis as long term non recourse financings. The upfront gains on sale from securitization transactions as well as ongoing servicing and securitization revenue presented in accordance with GAAP are excluded from Core Earnings and are replaced by the interest income, provisions for loan losses, and interest expense as they are earned or incurred on the securitization loans. We also exclude transactions with our off balance sheet trusts from Core Earnings as they are considered intercompany transactions on a Core Earnings basis. The following table summarizes Core Earnings securitization adjustments for the Lending operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Core Earnings securitization adjustments: Net interest income on securitized loans, after provisions for losses $ (880 ) $ (935 ) $ (1,065 ) Gains on student loan securitizations 902 552 375 Servicing and securitization revenue 553 357 561 Intercompany transactions with off balance sheet trusts (43 ) (34 ) (23 ) Total Core Earnings securitization adjustments $ 532 $ (60 ) $ (152 ) 2) Derivative Accounting: Core Earnings exclude periodic unrealized gains and losses arising primarily in our Lending operating segment, and to a lesser degree in our Corporate and Other reportable segment, that are caused primarily by the one sided mark to market derivative valuations prescribed by SFAS No. 133 on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge treatment under GAAP. In our Core Earnings presentation, we recognize the economic effect of these hedges, which generally results in any cash paid or received being recognized ratably as an expense or revenue over the hedged items life. Core Earnings also exclude the gain or loss on equity forward contracts that under SFAS No. 133, are required to be accounted for as derivatives and are marked to market through earnings. SFAS No. 133 requires that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria, as specified by SFAS No. 133, are met. We believe that our derivatives are effective economic hedges, and as such, are a critical element of our interest rate risk management strategy. However, some of our derivatives, primarily Floor Income Contracts, certain basis swaps and equity forward contracts (discussed in detail below), do not qualify for hedge treatment as defined by SFAS No. 133, and the stand alone derivative must be marked to market in the income statement with no consideration for the corresponding change in fair value of the hedged item. The gains and losses described in Gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net are primarily caused by interest rate and foreign 52 Table of Contents currency exchange rate volatility, changing credit spreads and changes in our stock price during the period as well as the volume and term of derivatives not receiving hedge treatment. Our Floor Income Contracts are written options that must meet more stringent requirements than other hedging relationships to achieve hedge effectiveness under SFAS No. 133. Specifically, our Floor Income Contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment because the paydown of principal of the student loans underlying the Floor Income embedded in those student loans does not exactly match the change in the notional amount of our written Floor Income Contracts. Under SFAS No. 133, the upfront payment is deemed a liability and changes in fair value are recorded through income throughout the life of the contract. The change in the value of Floor Income Contracts is primarily caused by changing interest rates that cause the amount of Floor Income earned on the underlying student loans and paid to the counterparties to vary. This is economically offset by the change in value of the student loan portfolio, including our Retained Interests, earning Floor Income but that offsetting change in value is not recognized under SFAS No. 133. We believe the Floor Income Contracts are economic hedges because they effectively fix the amount of Floor Income earned over the contract period, thus eliminating the timing and uncertainty that changes in interest rates can have on Floor Income for that period. Prior to SFAS No. 133, we accounted for Floor Income Contracts as hedges and amortized the upfront cash compensation ratably over the lives of the contracts. Basis swaps are used to convert floating rate debt from one floating interest rate index to another to better match the interest rate characteristics of the assets financed by that debt. We primarily use basis swaps to change the index of our floating rate debt to better match the cash flows of our student loan assets that are primarily indexed to a commercial paper, Prime or Treasury bill index. In addition, we use basis swaps to convert debt indexed to the Consumer Price Index to 3 month LIBOR debt. SFAS No. 133 requires that when using basis swaps, the change in the cash flows of the hedge effectively offset both the change in the cash flows of the asset and the change in the cash flows of the liability. Our basis swaps hedge variable interest rate risk, however they generally do not meet this effectiveness test because most of our FFELP student loans can earn at either a variable or a fixed interest rate depending on market interest rates. We also have basis swaps that do not meet the SFAS No. 133 effectiveness test that economically hedge off balance sheet instruments. As a result, under GAAP these swaps are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected currently in the income statement. Under SFAS No. 150, equity forward contracts that allow a net settlement option either in cash or the Companys stock are required to be accounted for as derivatives in accordance with SFAS No. 133. As a result, we account for our equity forward contracts as derivatives in accordance with SFAS No. 133 and mark them to market through earnings. They do not qualify as effective SFAS No. 133 hedges, as a requirement to achieve hedge accounting is the hedged item must impact net income and the settlement of these contracts through the purchase of our own stock does not impact net income. The table below quantifies the adjustments for derivative accounting under SFAS No. 133 on our net income for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, when compared with the accounting principles employed in all years prior to the SFAS No. 133 implementation.

The table below summarizes the realized losses on derivative and hedging activities, and the associated reclassification on a Core Earnings basis for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Reclassification of realized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities: Net settlement expense on Floor Income Contracts reclassified to net interest income $ (50 ) $ (259 ) $ (562 ) Net settlement expense on interest rate swaps reclassified to net interest income (59 ) (123 ) (88 ) Net realized losses on terminated derivative contracts reclassified to other income (5 ) (63 ) Total reclassifications of realized losses on derivative and hedging activities (109 ) (387 ) (713 ) Add: Unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net(1) (230 ) 634 1,562 Gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net $ (339 ) $ 247 $ 849 (1) Unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net is comprised of the following unrealized mark to market gains (losses): Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Floor Income Contracts $ 176 $ 481 $ 729 Equity forward contracts (360 ) 121 759 Basis swaps (58 ) 40 73 Other 12 (8 ) 1 Total unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net $ (230 ) $ 634 $ 1,562 Unrealized gains and losses on Floor Income Contracts are primarily caused by changes in interest rates. In general, an increase in interest rates results in an unrealized gain and vice versa. Unrealized gains and losses on Equity Forward Contracts fluctuate with changes in the Companys stock price. Unrealized gains and losses on basis swaps result from changes in the spread between indices, primarily as it relates to Consumer Price Index (CPI) swaps economically hedging debt issuances indexed to CPI. 3) Floor Income: The timing and amount (if any) of Floor Income earned in our Lending operating segment is uncertain and in excess of expected spreads. Therefore, we exclude such income from Core Earnings when it is not economically hedged. We employ derivatives, primarily Floor Income Contracts and futures, to economically hedge Floor Income. As discussed above in Derivative Accounting, these derivatives do not qualify as effective accounting hedges, and therefore, under GAAP, they are marked to market through the gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net line on the income statement with no offsetting gain or loss recorded for the economically hedged items. For Core Earnings, we reverse the fair value adjustments on the Floor Income Contracts and futures economically hedging Floor Income and include the amortization of net premiums received in income. 54 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the Floor Income adjustments in our Lending operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Core earnings Floor Income adjustments: Floor Income earned on Managed loans, net of payments on Floor Income Contracts $ $ 19 $ 88 Amortization of net premiums on Floor Income Contracts and futures in net interest income (209 ) (223 ) (194 ) Net losses related to closed Eurodollar futures contracts economically hedging Floor Income (50 ) Total Core Earnings Floor Income adjustments $ (209 ) $ (204 ) $ (156 ) 4) Acquired intangibles: Our Core Earnings exclude goodwill and intangible impairment and the amortization of acquired intangibles. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, goodwill and intangible impairment and the amortization of acquired intangibles totaled $94 million, $61 million and $36 million, respectively. In 2006, we recognized an intangible impairment of $21 million due to changes in projected interest rates and to a regulatory change related to our 9.5 percent SAP loans. LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENT In our Lending business segment, we originate and acquire federally guaranteed student loans, which are administered by the U.S. Department of Education (ED), and Private Education Loans, which are not federally or privately guaranteed. The majority of our Private Education Loans is made in conjunction with a FFELP Stafford loan and as a result is marketed through the same marketing channels as FFELP Stafford Loans. While FFELP student loans and Private Education Loans have different overall risk profiles due to the federal guarantee of the FFELP student loans, they share many of the same characteristics such as similar repayment terms, the same marketing channel and sales force, and are serviced on the same servicing platform. Finally, where possible, the borrower receives a single bill for both the federally guaranteed and privately underwritten loans. The earnings growth in our Lending operating segment is primarily derived from the growth in our Managed portfolio of student loans. In 2006, the total Managed portfolio grew by $19.6 billion (16 percent) from $122.5 billion at December 31, 2005 to $142.1 billion at December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, our Managed FFELP student loan portfolio was $119.5 billion or 84 percent of our total Managed student loans. In addition, our Managed portfolio of Private Education Loans grew to $22.6 billion. Private Education Loans are not insured by the federal government and are underwritten in accordance with the Companys credit policies. Our Managed FFELP loans are high quality assets with minimal credit risk as they are 99 percent guaranteed by the federal government. Trends in the Lending Business Segment The growth in our Lending operating segment has been largely driven by the steady growth in the demand for post secondary education in the United States over the last decade. This growth is evident in the $37.4 billion of student loans we originated or acquired in 2006 through our normal acquisition channels, a 24 percent increase over the $30.2 billion of student loans acquired in 2005. Our normal acquisition channels exclude loans acquired in conjunction with business combinations. In 2006, we originated $23.4 billion of student loans through our Preferred Channel, an increase of 9 percent over the $21.4 billion of student loans originated through our Preferred Channel in 2005. We expect the growth in the demand for post secondary education to continue in the future due to a number of factors. First, the college age population will continue to grow as ED predicts that the college age population will increase approximately 13 percent from 2006 to 2015. Second, we project an increase in non traditional students (those not attending college directly from high school) and adult education. Third, tuition 55 Table of Contents costs have risen 51 percent for four year public institutions and 32 percent for four year private institutions on a constant, inflation adjusted basis since the academic year (AY) 1996 1997 and are projected to continue to rise at a pace greater than inflation. Management believes that these factors will drive growth in education financing well into the next decade. On March 22, 2005, the Company announced that it extended both its JPMorgan Chase and Bank One student loan and loan purchase commitments to August 31, 2010. This comprehensive agreement provided for the dissolution of the joint venture between Chase and Sallie Mae. JPMorgan Chase will continue to sell substantially all student loans to the Company (whether made under the Chase or Bank One brand) that are originated or serviced on our platforms. In addition, the agreement provides that substantially all Chase branded education loans made for the July 1, 2005 to June 30, 2006 academic year (and future loans made to these borrowers) will be sold to us, including certain loans that are not originated or serviced on Sallie Mae platforms. This agreement permits JPMorgan Chase to compete with us in the student loan marketplace and releases the Company from its commitment to market the Bank One and Chase brands on campus. We will continue to support its school customers through its comprehensive set of products and services, including its loan origination and servicing platforms, its family of lending brands and strategic lending partners. Over the past three years, we have experienced a surge in FFELP Consolidation Loan activity as a result of historically low interest rates and aggressive marketing in the industry which has substantially changed the composition of our student loan portfolio. A number of new competitors have entered into the FFELP Consolidation Loan marketplace, as a result of very low barriers to entry for marketing and originating FFELP Consolidation Loans. For example, access to customers does not require an on campus presence, and a ready and available secondary market exists for these loans. This, coupled with the repeal of the Single Holder Rule have made the FFELP Consolidation Loans marketplace more competitive and has shortened the average life of FFELP Stafford loans, making them less valuable. FFELP Consolidation Loans earn a lower yield than FFELP Stafford loans due primarily to the 105 basis point Consolidation Loan Rebate Fee. This negative impact is somewhat mitigated by higher SAP spreads, the longer average life of FFELP Consolidation Loans and the greater potential to earn Floor Income. Since interest rates on FFELP Consolidation Loans originated prior to July 1, 2006 are fixed to term for the borrower, older FFELP Consolidation Loans with higher borrower rates can earn Floor Income over an extended period of time. In both 2005 and 2006, substantially all Floor Income was earned on FFELP Consolidation Loans. The Reconciliation Legislation requires lenders to rebate Floor Income on all FFELP loans originated on or after April 1, 2006, so this benefit will gradually decrease over time. During 2006, $15.8 billion of FFELP Stafford loans in our Managed loan portfolio consolidated either with us ($11.3 billion) or with other lenders ($4.5 billion). In addition, we consolidated $4.1 billion of loans from other lenders and had $2.7 billion of our FFELP Consolidation Loans reconsolidated with other lenders. The net result of consolidation activity in 2006 was a net portfolio loss of $3.1 billion. FFELP Consolidation Loans now represent 71 percent of our on balance sheet federally guaranteed student loan portfolio and over 66 percent of our Managed federally guaranteed portfolio. The increase in consolidations to third parties during 2006 is due to FFELP lenders reconsolidating FFELP Consolidation Loans using the Direct Loan Program as a pass through entity to circumvent the statutory prohibition on the reconsolidation of FFELP Consolidation Loans and to the repeal of the Single Holder Rule as of June 15, 2006. The Higher Education Reconciliation Act of 2005 restricted reconsolidation, and as of July 1, 2006, borrowers with a FFELP Consolidation Loan may only reconsolidate with the FDLP if they are delinquent, referred to the guaranty agency for default aversion activity, and enter into the income contingent repayment program (ICR) in the FDLP. Borrowers may also reconsolidate an existing FFELP Consolidation Loan with a new FFELP Stafford loan. To meet the increasing cost of higher education, students and parents have turned to alternative sources of education financing outside of the FFELP. A large and growing source of this supplemental education financing is provided by Private Education Loans, for which we are the largest provider. These loans are still 56 Table of Contents primarily originated through campus based programs but during 2006, we aggressively grew our direct to consumer Private Education Loans channel and expect it to be an increasing source of Private Education Loans in the future. The Private Education Loan portfolio grew by 38 percent in 2006 to $22.6 billion and now represents 16 percent of our Managed student loan portfolio, up from 13 percent in 2005. Private Education Loans consist of two general types: (1) those that are designed to bridge the gap between the cost of higher education and the amount financed through either capped federally insured loans or the borrowers resources, and (2) those that are used to meet the needs of students in alternative learning programs such as career training, distance learning and lifelong learning programs. Most higher education Private Education Loans are made in conjunction with a FFELP Stafford loan and as such are marketed through the same channel as FFELP loans by the same sales force. Unlike FFELP loans, Private Education Loans are subject to the full credit risk of the borrower. We manage this additional risk through clearly defined loan underwriting standards and a combination of higher interest rates and loan origination fees that compensate us for the higher risk. As a result, we earn higher spreads on Private Education Loans than on FFELP loans. Private Education Loans will continue to be an important driver of future earnings growth as the demand for post secondary education grows and costs increase much faster than increases in federal loan limits. We originate lesser quantities of mortgage and consumer loans with the intent of immediately selling the majority of the mortgage loans. Mortgage and consumer loan originations and the mortgage loan portfolio we hold were 7 percent and less than one percent, respectively, of total loan originations and total loans outstanding as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006. 57 Table of Contents The following table includes the Core Earnings results of operations for our Lending business segment.

Student Loan Spread An important performance measure closely monitored by management is the student loan spread. The student loan spread is the difference between the income earned on the student loan assets and the interest paid on the debt funding those assets. A number of factors can affect the overall student loan spread such as: the mix of student loans in the portfolio, with FFELP Consolidation Loans having the lowest spread and Private Education Loans having the highest spread; the premiums paid, borrower fees charged and capitalized costs incurred to acquire student loans which impact the spread through subsequent amortization; the type and level of Borrower Benefits programs; 60 Table of Contents the level of Floor Income; and when considering the Core Earnings managed spread, the amount of Floor Income eligible loans that have been hedged through Floor Income Contracts; and funding and hedging costs. The student loan spread is highly susceptible to liquidity, funding and interest rate risk. These risks are discussed separately at LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES and in the RISK FACTORS discussion at the front of the document. Student Loan Spread Analysis Core Earnings Basis The following table analyzes the earnings from our portfolio of Managed student loans on a Core Earnings basis (see BUSINESS SEGMENTS Pre tax Differences between Core Earnings and GAAP by Business Segment). The Core Earnings Basis Student Loan Spread Analysis presentation and certain components used in the calculation differ from the On Balance Sheet Student Loan Spread Analysis presentation. The Core Earnings basis presentation, when compared to our on balance sheet presentation, is different in that it: includes the net interest margin related to our off balance sheet student loan securitization trusts. This includes any related fees or costs such as the Consolidation Loan Rebate Fees, premium/discount amortization and Borrower Benefits yield adjustments; includes the reclassification of certain derivative net settlement amounts. The net settlements on certain derivatives that do not qualify as SFAS No. 133 hedges are recorded as part of the gain (loss) on derivative and hedging activities, net line item on the income statement and are therefore not recognized in the student loan spread. Under this presentation, these gains and losses are reclassified to the income statement line item of the economically hedged item. For our Core Earnings basis student loan spread, this would primarily include: (a) reclassifying the net settlement amounts related to our written Floor Income Contracts to student loan interest income and (b) reclassifying the net settlement amounts related to certain of our basis swaps to debt interest expense; excludes unhedged Floor Income earned on the Managed student loan portfolio; and includes the amortization of upfront payments on Floor Income Contracts in student loan income that we believe are economically hedging the Floor Income. As discussed above, these differences result in the Core Earnings basis student loan spread not being a GAAP basis presentation. Management relies on this measure to manage our Lending business segment. Specifically, management uses the Core Earnings basis student loan spread to evaluate the overall economic effect that certain factors have on our student loans either on or off balance sheet. These factors include the overall mix of student loans in our portfolio, acquisition costs, Borrower Benefits program costs, Floor Income and funding and hedging costs. Management believes that it is important to evaluate all of these factors on a Core Earnings basis to gain additional information about the economic effect of these factors on our student loans under management. Management believes that this additional information assists us in making strategic decisions about the Companys business model for the Lending business segment, including among other factors, how we acquire or originate student loans, how we fund acquisitions and originations, what Borrower Benefits we offer and what type of loans we purchase or originate. While management believes that the Core Earnings basis student loan spread is an important tool for evaluating the Companys performance for the reasons described above, it is subject to certain general and specific limitations that investors should carefully consider. See BUSINESS SEGMENTS Limitations of Core Earnings. One specific limitation is that the 61 Table of Contents Core Earnings basis student loan spread includes the spread on loans that we have sold to securitization trusts.

Discussion of the Year over Year Effect of Changes in Accounting Estimates on the Core Earnings basis Loan Spread As discussed in detail and summarized in a table at CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES, we periodically update our estimates for changes in the student loan portfolio. Under SFAS No. 91, these changes in estimates must be reflected in the balance from inception of the student loan. We have also updated our estimates to reflect programmatic changes in our Borrower Benefits and Private Education Loan programs and have made modeling refinements to better reflect current and future conditions. The cumulative effects of the changes in estimates are summarized in the table below: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Dollar Basis Dollar Basis Dollar Basis Value Points Value Points Value Points Cumulative effect of changes in critical accounting estimates: Premium and discount amortization $ $ $ 12 1 Borrower Benefits 15 1 34 3 22 2 Total cumulative effect of changes in estimates $ 15 1 $ 34 3 $ 34 3 In 2006, we changed our policy related to Borrower Benefit qualification requirements and updated our assumptions to reflect this policy. In 2005 and 2004, we updated our estimates for the qualification for Borrower Benefits to account for programmatic changes as well as the effect of continued high levels of consolidations. In 2004, we updated our estimates of the average life of our various loan programs to recognize the shifting mix of the portfolio. The net cumulative effect of these changes was a $12 million adjustment to increase the balance of the unamortized student loan premium. The difference between the effect for on balance sheet and off balance sheet was primarily due to a refinement in our estimates for off balance sheet loans that did not have the same effect on balance sheet and to the different mix of on balance sheet loans versus the mix on a Managed Basis. 62 Table of Contents Discussion of Core Earnings Basis Student Loan Spread Effects of Significant Events in 2006 and 2005 In addition to changes in estimates discussed above, FFELP Consolidation Loan activity has the greatest effect on fluctuations in our premium amortization and Borrower Benefits as we write off the balance of unamortized premium and the Borrower Benefit reserve when loans are consolidated away, in accordance with SFAS No. 91. See below for a further discussion of the effects of FFELP Consolidation Loans on the student loan spread versus Stafford Loans. See also, CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Effects of Consolidation Activity on Estimates, above. Also, there were high levels of FFELP Consolidation Loan activity in the second quarter of both 2006 and 2005 caused primarily by FFELP Stafford borrowers locking in lower interest rates by consolidating their loans prior to the July 1 interest rate reset for FFELP Stafford loans. In addition, there were two new methods of consolidation practiced by the industry in 2005 and the first half of 2006. First, borrowers were permitted for the first time to consolidate their loans while still in school. Second, a significant volume of our FFELP Consolidation Loans was reconsolidated with third party lenders through the FDLP, resulting in an increase in student loan premium write offs. Also, the repeal of the Single Holder Rule increased the amount of loans that consolidated with third parties resulting in increased premium write offs in the second half of the year. Consolidation of student loans does benefit the student loan spread to a lesser extent through the write off of Borrower Benefits reserves associated with these loans. Both in school consolidation and reconsolidation with third party through the FDLP were restricted as of July 1, 2006, through the Higher Education Act of 2005. While FFELP Consolidation Loan activity remained high in 2006, it was lower than 2005, which contributed to lower student loan premium amortization in 2006. Discussion of Student Loan Spread Other Year over Year Fluctuations 2006 versus 2005 The decrease in the 2006 student loan spread versus 2005 is primarily due to the higher average balance of FFELP Consolidation Loans as a percentage of the on balance sheet portfolio contributes to downward pressure on the spread. FFELP Consolidation Loans have lower spreads than other FFELP loans due to the 105 basis point Consolidation Loan Rebate Fee, higher Borrower Benefits, and funding costs due to their longer terms. These negative effects are partially offset by lower student loan premium amortization due to the extended term and a higher SAP yield. The average balance of FFELP Consolidation Loans grew as a percentage of the average Managed FFELP student loan portfolio from 56 percent in 2005 to 63 percent in 2006. The 2006 student loan spread benefited from the increase in the average balance of Managed Private Education Loans as a percentage of the average Managed student loan portfolio from 12 percent in 2005 to 15 percent in 2006. Private Education Loans are subject to credit risk and therefore earn higher spreads than the Managed guaranteed student loan portfolio. Discussion of Student Loan Spread Other Year over Year Fluctuations 2005 versus 2004 The decrease in the 2005 student loan spread versus 2004 is primarily due to the higher average balance of FFELP Consolidation Loans as a percentage of the on balance sheet portfolio contributes to downward pressure on the spread. The average balance of FFELP Consolidation Loans grew as a percentage of the average Managed FFELP student loan portfolio from 46 percent in 2004 to 56 percent in 2005. Other factors that impacted the student loan spread include higher spreads on our debt funding student loans as a result of the GSE Wind Down, partially offset by lower Borrower Benefits costs, and the absence of Offset Fees on GSE financed loans. The increase in funding costs is due to the replacement of lower cost, primarily short term GSE funding with longer term, higher cost funding. The negative effects on the spread were partially offset by the increase in Private Education Loans. 63 Table of Contents Wholesale Consolidation Loans As discussed under Student Loans Student Loan Spread Analysis Core Earnings Basis, we have excluded the impact of Wholesale Consolidation Loans from our student loan spread analysis both on balance sheet and on a Core Earnings basis. The average balance of Wholesale Consolidation Loans was $683 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Had the Wholesale Consolidation Loan volume been included in the Core Earnings basis student loan spread, it would have had no impact to the spread for the year ended December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, Wholesale Consolidation Loans totaled $3.6 billion, or 4.5 percent, of our total Managed Consolidation Loan portfolio. Core Earnings Basis Student Loan Spreads by Loan Type The student loan spread continues to reflect the changing mix of loans in our portfolio, specifically the shift from FFELP Stafford loans to FFELP Consolidation Loans and the higher overall growth rate in Private Education Loans as a percentage of the total portfolio. (See LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENT Summary of our Managed Student Loan Portfolio Average Balances.) The following table reflects the Core Earnings basis student loan spreads by product, excluding the impact of the Wholesale Consolidation Loan portfolio as discussed above, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 FFELP Loan Spreads (Core Earnings Basis): Stafford 1.40 % 1.48 % 1.73 % Consolidation 1.18 1.31 1.43 FFELP Loan Spread (Core Earnings Basis) 1.26 1.39 1.59 Private Education Loan Spreads (Core Earnings Basis): Before provision 5.13 % 4.62 % 4.22 % After provision 3.75 3.88 2.69 64 Table of Contents Floor Income Managed Basis The following table analyzes the ability of the FFELP student loans in our Managed student loan portfolio to earn Floor Income after December 31, 2006 and 2005 December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 Fixed Variable Fixed Variable Borrower Borrower Borrower Borrower Rate Rate Total Rate Rate Total (Dollars in billions) Student loans eligible to earn Floor Income: On balance sheet student loans $ 63.0 $ 18.3 $ 81.3 $ 53.4 $ 16.0 $ 69.4 Off balance sheet student loans 17.8 14.5 32.3 10.3 18.4 28.7 Managed student loans eligible to earn Floor Income 80.8 32.8 113.6 63.7 34.4 98.1 Less: notional amount of Floor Income Contracts (16.4 ) (16.4 ) (25.1 ) (25.1 ) Net Managed student loans eligible to earn Floor Income $ 64.4 $ 32.8 $ 97.2 $ 38.6 $ 34.4 $ 73.0 Net Managed student loans earning Floor Income $ 1.0 $ $ 1.0 $ .8 $ $ .8 The reconsolidation of FFELP Consolidation Loans described above has had an unanticipated impact on FFELP Consolidation Loans underlying the Floor Income Contracts that are economically hedging the fixed borrower interest rate earned on FFELP Consolidation Loans. We have sold Floor Income Contracts to hedge the potential Floor Income from specifically identified pools of FFELP Consolidation Loans that are eligible to earn Floor Income. Since reconsolidation of FFELP Consolidation Loans is limited by law, we did not anticipate that certain lenders would circumvent this law and reconsolidate loans through the FDLP. As a consequence, higher rate FFELP Consolidation Loans that underlie certain contracts were reconsolidated and no longer match the underlying Floor Income Contract, which resulted in the notional amount of Floor Income Contracts at December 31, 2006 being slightly higher than the outstanding balance of the underlying FFELP Consolidation Loans that the Floor Income Contracts were hedging. The Higher Education Act of 2005 has restricted the use of reconsolidation as of July 1, 2006, so we do not foresee any material impact on our Floor Income in the future. The following table presents a projection of the average Managed balance of FFELP Consolidation Loans whose Fixed Rate Floor Income has already been economically hedged through Floor Income Contracts for the period January 1, 2007 to March 31, 2010. These loans are both on and off balance sheet and the related hedges do not qualify under SFAS No. 133 accounting as effective hedges. 2007 2008 2009 2010 (Dollars in billions) Average balance of FFELP Consolidation Loans whose Floor Income is economically hedged (Managed Basis) $ 16 $ 15 $ 10 $ 2 65 Table of Contents Private Education Loans Allowance for Private Education Loan Losses 2005 Change in Accounting Estimate to the Allowance for Loan Losses and the Recognition of Accrued Interest Income for Private Education Loans As discussed under CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Allowance for Loan Losses, in 2005 we changed our estimate of the allowance for loan losses and accrued interest for our Managed loan portfolio to a migration analysis of delinquent and current accounts. This change in reserving methodology was accounted for as a change in estimate in accordance with APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes. Activity in the Allowance for Private Education Loan Losses As discussed in detail under CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES, the provisions for student loan losses represent the periodic expense of maintaining an allowance sufficient to absorb losses, net of recoveries, inherent in the portfolio of Private Education Loans. The following table summarizes changes in the allowance for Private Education Loan losses for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.

When we securitize Private Education Loans, we no longer legally own the loans and they are accounted for off balance sheet. For our Managed presentation in the table above, when loans are securitized, we reduce the on balance sheet allowance for amounts previously provided and then provide for these loans off balance sheet with the total of both on and off balance sheet being the Managed allowance. When Private Education Loans in our securitized trusts settling before September 30, 2005, become 180 days delinquent, we typically exercise our contingent call option to repurchase these loans at par value out of the trust and record a loss for the difference in the par value paid and the fair market value of the loan at the time of purchase. If these loans reach the 212 day delinquency, a charge off for the remaining balance of the loan is triggered. On a Managed Basis, the losses recorded under GAAP for loans repurchased at day 180 are reversed and the full amount is charged off at day 212. We do not hold the contingent call option for all trusts settled after September 30, 2005. When measured as a percentage of ending loans in repayment, the off balance sheet allowance is lower than the on balance sheet percentage because of the different mix of loans on balance sheet and off balance sheet, as described above. Additionally, a larger percentage of the off balance sheet loan borrowers are still in school status and not required to make payments on their loans. Once repayment begins, the allowance requirements increase to reflect the increased risk of loss as loans enter repayment. Managed Basis Private Education Loan Loss Allowance Discussion The allowance for Private Education Loan losses at December 31, 2006 grew 40 percent versus 2005, which was in direct proportion to the 40 percent growth in the balance of loans in repayment, while net charge offs increased 18 percent year over year. This resulted in an improvement in the ratio of net charge offs to average loans in repayment from 1.89 percent at December 31, 2005 to 1.62 percent at December 31, 2006. The ending balance of the allowance for Private Education Loans at December 31, 2006 resulted in an average coverage of annual net charge offs ratio of 2.44, which is an 18 percent increase over the December 31, 2005 ratio of 2.06. The seasoning and the changing mix of loans in the portfolio, coupled with the higher repayment levels associated with the growth in our Private Education Loan portfolio have more recently resulted in higher levels of charge offs and provision. We expect these levels to continue and likely to increase. The year over year allowance on a Managed Basis increased by $52 million from 2004 to 2005, exclusive of the adjustments related to the changes in estimate and methodology discussed above. This increase was primarily driven by the 37 percent year over year increase in average loans in repayment. As a result of the change in the loan loss and recovery estimates discussed above, the allowance as a percentage of ending loans in repayment decreased from 5.08 percent to 3.40 percent, and consequently the year over year growth rate in the provision is less than the growth rate in the portfolio. 67 Table of Contents Delinquencies The table below presents our Private Education Loan delinquency trends as of December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Delinquencies have the potential to adversely impact earnings as they are an initial indication of the borrowers potential to possibly default and as a result command a higher loan loss reserve than loans in current status. Delinquent loans also require increased servicing and collection efforts, resulting in higher operating costs.

(3) The period of delinquency is based on the number of days scheduled payments are contractually past due. Toward the end of 2006 and in early 2007, we experienced lower collections resulting in increased levels of charge off activity in our Private Education Loan portfolio. We believe that this is attributable in some degree to a number of operational challenges at our DMO in performing pre default and post default collections on the Companys Private Education Loan portfolio. In August 2006, we announced that we intended to relocate responsibility for certain Private Education Loan collections from our Nevada call center to a new call center in Indiana. This transfer presented us with unexpected operational challenges that resulted in lower collections that have negatively impacted the Private Education Loan portfolio. Management has taken several remedial actions, including transferring experienced collection personnel to the new call center. In addition, the DMO also revised certain procedures, including its use of forbearance, to better optimize our long term collection strategies. We expect that these developments will result in increased later stage delinquency levels and associated higher charge offs in the first and perhaps the second quarters of 2007. Forbearance Managed Basis Private Education Loans Private Education Loans are made to parent and student borrowers in accordance with our underwriting policies. These loans generally supplement federally guaranteed student loans, which are subject to federal lending caps. Private Education Loans are not federally guaranteed or insured against any loss of principal or 70 Table of Contents interest. Traditional student borrowers use the proceeds of these loans to obtain higher education, which increases the likelihood of obtaining employment at higher income levels than would be available without the additional education. As a result, the borrowers repayment capability improves between the time the loan is made and the time they enter the post education work force. We generally allow the loan repayment period on traditional higher education Private Education Loans to begin six months after the borrower leaves school (consistent with our federally regulated FFELP loans). This provides the borrower time after graduation to obtain a job to service the debt. For borrowers that need more time or experience other hardships, we permit additional delays in payment or partial payments (both referred to as forbearances) when we believe additional time will improve the borrowers ability to repay the loan. Forbearance is also granted to borrowers who may experience temporary hardship after entering repayment, when we believe that it will increase the likelihood of ultimate collection of the loan. Forbearance can be requested by the borrower or initiated by the Company and is granted within established policies that include limits on the number of forbearance months granted consecutively and limits on the total number of forbearance months granted over the life of the loan. In some instances of forbearance, we require good faith payments or continuing partial payments. Exceptions to forbearance policies are permitted in limited circumstances and only when such exceptions are judged to increase the likelihood of ultimate collection of the loan. Forbearance does not grant any reduction in the total repayment obligation (principal or interest) but does allow for the temporary cessation of borrower payments (on a prospective and or retroactive basis) or a reduction in monthly payments for an agreed period of time. The forbearance period extends the original term of the loan. While the loan is in forbearance, interest continues to accrue and is capitalized as principal upon the loan re entering repayment status. Loans exiting forbearance into repayment status are considered current regardless of their previous delinquency status. Forbearance is used most heavily immediately after the loan enters repayment. As indicated in the tables below that show the composition and status of the Managed Private Education Loan portfolio by number of months aged from the first date of repayment, the percentage of loans in forbearance decreases the longer the loans have been in repayment. At December 31, 2006, loans in forbearance as a percentage of loans in repayment and forbearance is 11.7 percent for loans that have been in repayment one to twenty four months. The percentage drops to 3.4 percent for loans that have been in repayment more than 48 months. Approximately 76 percent of our Managed Private Education Loans in forbearance have been in repayment less than 24 months. These borrowers are essentially extending their grace period as they transition to the workforce. Forbearance continues to be a positive collection tool for Private Education Loans as we believe it can provide the borrower with sufficient time to obtain employment and income to support his or her obligation. We consider the potential impact of forbearance in the determination of the loan loss reserves. 71 Table of Contents The tables below show the composition and status of the Private Education Loan portfolio by number of months aged from the first date of repayment: Months Since Entering Repayment After 1 to 24 25 to 48 More than Dec. 31, months months 48 months 2006(1) Total December 31, 2006 Loans in school/grace/deferment $ $ $ $ 10,826 $ 10,826 Loans in forbearance 898 209 74 1,181 Loans in repayment current 6,273 2,477 1,883 10,633 Loans in repayment delinquent 31 60 days 271 119 82 472 Loans in repayment delinquent 61 90 days 109 49 34 192 Loans in repayment delinquent greater than 90 days 157 117 72 346 Total $ 7,708 $ 2,971 $ 2,145 $ 10,826 $ 23,650 Unamortized discount (668 ) Allowance for loan losses (394 ) Total Managed Private Education Loans, net $ 22,588 Loans in forbearance as a percentage of loans in repayment and forbearance 11.7 % 7.1 % 3.4 % % 9.2 % (1) Includes all loans in school/grace/deferment.

On February 8, 2006, the Reconciliation Legislation reduced the level of default insurance for lenders with the EP designation to 99 percent from 100 percent on claims filed on or after July 1, 2006. As a result of the amended insurance levels, we established a Risk Sharing allowance as of December 31, 2005 for an estimate of losses on FFELP student loans based on the one percent reduction in default insurance for loans serviced with the EP designation. The reserve was established and has been maintained using a migration analysis similar to that described above for the Private Education Loans. As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2005, we provided for additional reserves of $10 million for on balance sheet FFELP loans and $19 million for Managed FFELP loans. At December 31, 2006, the reserve was $20 million for on balance sheet FFELP loans and $34 million for Managed FFELP loans. 73 Table of Contents Total Loan Net Charge offs The following tables summarize the net charge offs for all loan types on balance sheet and on a Managed Basis for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.

Student Loan Premiums as a Percentage of Principal The following table presents student loan premiums paid as a percentage of the principal balance of student loans acquired for the respective periods. Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Volume Rate Volume Rate Volume Rate Student loan premiums paid: Sallie Mae brands $ 12,271 .94 % $ 8,430 .38 % $ 6,197 .36 % Lender partners 11,738 1.97 12,463 1.77 10,541 1.60 Total Preferred Channel 24,009 1.44 20,893 1.21 16,738 1.14 Other purchases(1) 6,228 4.39 2,479 3.68 8,436 4.60 Subtotal base purchases 30,237 2.05 23,372 1.47 25,174 2.30 Consolidation originations 4,188 2.54 4,672 2.32 2,609 2.18 Total $ 34,425 2.11 % $ 28,044 1.61 % $ 27,783 2.29 % (1) Primarily includes spot purchases (including Wholesale Consolidation Loans), other commitment clients, and subsidiary acquisitions. The increase in premiums paid as a percentage of principal balance for Sallie Mae brands is primarily due to the increase in loans where we pay the origination fee and or federal guaranty fee on behalf of borrowers, a practice we call zero fee lending. Premiums paid on lender partners were similarly impacted by zero fee lending. The borrower origination fee will be gradually phased out by the Reconciliation Legislation from 2007 to 2010. 74 Table of Contents The other purchases category includes the acquisition of Wholesale Consolidation Loans which totaled $3.5 billion at an average premium percentage of 5.07 percent for the year ended December 31, 2006. Wholesale Consolidation Loans are discussed in more detail at Student Loan Spread Wholesale Consolidation Loans. In 2004, other purchases included loans acquired in business combinations. Included in consolidation originations is the 50 basis point FFELP Consolidation Loan origination fee paid on the total balance of new FFELP Consolidation Loans, including internally consolidated loans from our existing portfolio. The consolidation originations premium paid percentage is calculated on only consolidation volume that is incremental to our portfolio. This percentage is largely driven by the mix of internal consolidations. Student Loan Acquisitions In 2006, 76 percent of our Managed student loan acquisitions (exclusive of loans acquired through business combinations and capitalized interest, premiums and discounts) were originated through our Preferred Channel. The following tables summarize the components of our student loan acquisition activity for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.

This activity results in impairments of our Retained Interests in securitizations, but this is offset by an increase in on balance sheet interest earning assets, for which we do not record an offsetting gain. 76 Table of Contents The following table includes on balance sheet asset information for our Lending business segment.

Preferred Channel Originations In 2006, we originated $23.4 billion in student loan volume through our Preferred Channel, a 9 percent increase over the $21.4 billion originated in 2005. In 2006, we grew the internal lending brand Preferred Channel Originations by 43 percent and our own brands now constitute 56 percent of our Preferred Channel Originations, up from 43 percent in 2005. At the same time, the JPMorgan Chase volume decreased by 38 percent and was 16 percent of our Preferred Channel Originations, down from 28 percent in 2004. The pipeline of loans that we currently service and are committed to purchase was $5.4 billion and $6.8 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

(2) Represents FFELP/Stafford loans that we either own on balance sheet or in our off balance sheet securitization trusts that we consolidate. (3) The purchases line includes incremental consolidations from third parties and acquisitions. 81 Table of Contents The increase in consolidations to third parties in 2006 reflects FFELP lenders reconsolidating FFELP Consolidation Loans using the Direct Loan program as a pass through entity, a practice which was severely restricted by The Higher Education Reconciliation Act of 2005 as of July 1, 2006. The increase also reflects the effect of the repeal of the single holder rule, which was effective for applications received on or after June 15, 2006. The single holder rule had previously required that when a lender held all of the FFELP Stafford loans of a particular borrower whose loans were held by a single lender, in most cases that borrower could only obtain a FFELP Consolidation Loan from that lender. During 2006, Private Education Loan consolidations were introduced as a separate product line and during the year we had $50 million of net incremental volume on a Managed Basis. We expect this product line to grow in the future and will aggressively protect our portfolio against third party consolidation of Private Education Loans. Other Income Lending Business Segment The following table summarizes the components of other income, net, for our Lending business segment for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Late fees $ 107 $ 89 $ 92 Gains on sales of mortgages and other loan fees 15 18 22 Losses on securities, net (4 ) (36 ) (23 ) Other 59 40 40 Total other income, net $ 177 $ 111 $ 131 Other income in 2006 includes a settlement received on the final disposition of leveraged leases for which we had previously reserved, plus an increase in forbearance fees. The net losses on securities in 2005 and 2004 primarily relate to a $39 million leveraged lease impairment for an aircraft leased to Northwest Airlines and a $27 million impairment for aircraft leased to Delta Airlines, respectively. At December 31, 2006, we had investments in leveraged and direct financing leases, net of impairments, totaling $109 million that are the general obligations of American Airlines and Federal Express Corporation. Based on an analysis of the potential losses on certain leveraged leases plus the increase in current tax obligations related to the forgiveness of debt obligations and or the taxable gain on the sale of the aircraft, our remaining after tax accounting exposure from our investment in leveraged leases was $69 million at December 31, 2006, of which $52 million relates to American Airlines. Operating Expense Lending Business Segment The following table summarizes the components of operating expenses for our Lending business segment for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Sales and originations $ 327 285 $ 259 Servicing and information technology 201 193 150 Corporate overhead 117 69 78 Total operating expenses $ 645 $ 547 $ 487 Loss on GSE debt extinguishment and defeasance $ $ $ 221 82 Table of Contents Operating expenses for our Lending operating segment include non capitalizable costs incurred to acquire student loans and service our Managed student loan portfolio, as well as other selling, general and administrative expenses. The $221 million loss in 2004 relates to the repurchase and defeasance of approximately $3.0 billion of GSE debt in connection with the Wind Down of the GSE. 2006 versus 2005 Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006, increased by 18 percent to $645 million versus $547 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase is primarily due to sales and marketing expenses related to our direct to consumer initiatives and to higher sales expenses for higher education loan products. The increase was also due to an increase in origination and servicing costs, consistent with the increase in origination volume and the number of borrowers. In 2006, corporate overhead includes $34 million of stock option compensation expense, due to the implementation of SFAS No. 123(R). 2005 versus 2004 Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005, increased by 12 percent to $547 million versus $487 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, exclusive of the loss on GSE debt extinguishment and defeasance. The increase is due to increased sales and marketing costs related to the FFELP Consolidation Loan program, new Private Education Loan initiatives and the launch of our direct to consumer initiative, Tuition Answer. Operating expenses were also higher due to a full year of expenses of sales and marketing personnel from Southwest and SLFA, acquired in the fourth quarter of 2004. The $43 million increase in servicing and information technology expenses is consistent with the growth in borrowers. 83 Table of Contents DEBT MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS (DMO) BUSINESS SEGMENT In our DMO operating segment, we provide a wide range of accounts receivable and collections services including student loan default aversion services, defaulted student loan portfolio management services, contingency collections services for student loans and other asset classes, and accounts receivable management and collection for purchased portfolios of receivables that are delinquent or have been charged off by their original creditors as well as sub performing and non performing mortgage loans. In the purchased receivables business, we focus on a variety of consumer debt types with emphasis on charged off credit card receivables and distressed mortgage receivables. We purchase these portfolios at a discount to their face value, and then use both our internal collection operations coupled with third party collection agencies to maximize the recovery on these receivables. We account for our investments in charged off receivables in accordance with the AICPAs Statement of Position (SOP) 03 3, Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer. Under this standard, we establish static pools of each quarters purchases and aggregate them based on certain common risk characteristics and initially record them at fair value based on the pools estimated future cash flow and internal rate of return. Under SOP 03 3, the yield that may be accreted as collections revenue on such loans is limited to the excess of our estimate of undiscounted expected principal, interest and other cash flows from the pool over our initial investment in the pool. We recognize income each month based on each static pools effective interest rate. The static pools are tested quarterly for impairment by re estimating the future cash flows to be received from the pools. Subsequent increases in estimated future cash flows are recognized prospectively through a yield adjustment over the remaining life of the static pool. When estimates of future cash flows to be collected are projected to be lower than projected, the carrying value of the pool is impaired and written down through a valuation allowance to maintain the effective interest rate. Cash collected on pools whose principal has fully amortized is recognized 100 percent in income. The private sector collections industry is highly fragmented with few large public companies and a large number of small scale privately held companies. The collections industry is highly competitive with credit card collections being the most competitive in both contingency collections and purchased paper activities. We are responding to these competitive challenges through enhanced servicing efficiencies and by continuing to build on customer relationships through value added services and financings. The following table includes the results of operations for our DMO operating segment. Condensed Statements of Income Years Ended December 31, % Increase (Decrease) 2006 vs. 2005 vs. 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 Fee income 397 360 300 10 20 Collections revenue 239 167 39 43 328 Total income 636 527 339 21 55 Operating expenses 358 288 161 24 79 Net interest expense 23 19 13 21 46 Income before income taxes and minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries 255 220 165 16 33 Income taxes 94 81 65 15 25 Income before minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries 161 139 100 16 39 Minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries 4 4 1 300 Net income $ 157 $ 135 $ 99 16 % 36 % Revenues from USA Funds represented 32 percent, 34 percent and 56 percent, respectively, of total DMO revenue in 2006, 2005 and 2004. The percentage of revenue generated from services provided to USA Funds 84 Table of Contents decreased due to the full year impact of recent acquisitions and the continued diversification into new asset classes in the purchased paper business. DMO Revenue by Product Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005(2) 2004(3) Purchased paper collections revenue $ 239 $ 167 $ 39 Contingency: Student loans 305 258 253 Other 36 55 18 Total contingency 341 313 271 Other 56 47 29 Total $ 636 $ 527 $ 339 USA Funds(1) $ 204 $ 180 $ 190 % of total DMO revenue 32 % 34 % 56 % (1) United Student Aid Funds, Inc. (USA Funds). (2) Includes revenue attributed to GRP for the period from August 31 to December 31. (3) Includes revenue attributed to AFS for the period from September 16 to December 31. Contingency Fee Income The $47 million increase in DMO contingency revenue from student loans for the year ended December 31, 2006 over 2005 can be primarily attributed to a change in the federal regulations governing the rehabilitation loan policy along with the growth in guaranty agency collections. Under this change, the number of payments to qualify for a rehabilitated loan was reduced to nine months from twelve months, so all loans that had made nine to eleven consecutive payments at thet time of change immediately qualified as a rehabilitated loan. The decrease in contingency fee revenues from non student loan asset classes in 2006 versus the prior year was due to a non recurring state tax collection contract in 2005 and to the Company not renewing certain low margin contingency fee contracts. The rapid growth in Consolidation Loan activity has had a negative impact on our student loan contingency collection business. When a borrower consolidates a FFELP Stafford loan, the borrower is effectively refinancing his or her Stafford loan to a longer term at a fixed interest rate, which significantly reduces the borrowers monthly payment. The overall effect of the record Consolidation Loan activity is lower industry wide student loan defaults and lower contingency collection inventory. The recently passed HEA reduces fees paid for collections via loan consolidation and also puts a cap on collections for loan consolidations. These fee reductions will also negatively impact student loan contingency fees going forward. Contingency Inventory The following table presents the outstanding inventory of receivables serviced through our DMO business. Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Contingency: Student loans $ 6,971 $ 7,205 $ 6,869 Other 1,667 2,178 1,756 Total $ 8,638 $ 9,383 $ 8,625 85 Table of Contents Purchased Paper Our purchased paper collection business is comprised of the purchase of delinquent and charged off consumer receivables, primarily credit cards and the purchase of distressed mortgage receivables. Since these businesses operate in different segments of the marketplace with the primary distinguishing factor being the existence of collateral for the mortgage receivable, we have broken out their results separately in the presentations below. Non Mortgage Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004(1) Face value of purchases $ 3,438 $ 2,826 $ 426 Purchase price 278 198 19 % of face value purchased 8.1 % 7.0 % 4.5 % Gross Cash Collections (GCC) $ 348 $ 250 $ 59 Collections revenue 199 157 39 % of GCC 56 % 63 % 66 % Carrying value $ 274 $ 158 $ 52 (1) AFS was purchased in September 2004, so the results for that year reflect only three months of activity. The amount of face value of purchases in any quarter is a function of a combination of factors including the amount of receivables available for purchase in the marketplace, average age of each portfolio, the asset class of the receivables, and competition in the marketplace. As a result, the percentage of principal purchased will vary from quarter to quarter. The decrease in purchase paper revenue as a percentage of GCC can primarily be attributed to the increase in new portfolio purchases in the second half of 2005. Typically, revenue recognition based on a portfolios effective yield rate is a lower percentage of cash collections in the early stages of servicing a portfolio. On both December 22, 2005, and December 29, 2006, we acquired an additional 12 percent ownership stake in AFS, increasing our ownership first to 76 percent and then to 88 percent. Mortgage/Properties On August 31, 2005, we acquired 100 percent of GRP, a debt management company that acquires and manages portfolios of sub performing and non performing mortgage loans, substantially all of which are secured by one to four family residential real estate. GRP was purchased in August 2005, so the results for that year ended reflect only four months of activity. Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Face value of purchases $ 556 $ 165 Collections revenue 40 10 Collateral value of purchases 607 195 Purchase price 462 141 % of collateral value 76 % 72 % Carrying value of purchases $ 518 $ 298 The purchase price for sub performing and non performing mortgage loans is generally determined as a percentage of the underlying collateral. Fluctuations in the purchase price as a percentage of collateral value can be caused by a number of factors including cash flow characteristics, targeted yield, expected holding period, the percentage of second mortgages in the portfolio and the level of private mortgage insurance associated with particular assets. 86 Table of Contents Operating Expenses DMO Business Segment Operating expenses for the DMO business segment for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 totaled: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Total operating expenses $ 358 $ 288 $ 161 Operating expenses increased by $70 million, or 24 percent, to $358 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in operating expenses versus the prior year was primarily due to the increase in accounts serviced and to higher expenses for outsourced collections and recovery costs. Also, 2006 includes a full year of GRP expenses and $12 million of stock option compensation expense, due to the implementation of SFAS No. 123(R). A significant portion of the 2005 increase is attributable to the inclusion of a full year of AFS expenses and GRP expenses incurred since the acquisition on August 31, 2005. The increase is also attributable to the growth in contingency revenue and accounts serviced, as a high percentage of DMO expenses are variable which contributes to our stable margins. At December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the DMO operating segment had total assets of $1.5 billion, $1.1 billion and $519 million, respectively. CORPORATE AND OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENT Our Corporate and Other reportable segment reflects the aggregate activity of our smaller operating units including our Guarantor Servicing and Loan Servicing operating units, other products and services, as well as corporate expenses that do not pertain directly to our operating segments. Also, included in the Corporate and Other segment is Upromise, Inc. (Upromise), acquired in August of 2006. In our Guarantor Servicing operating unit, we provide a full complement of administrative services to FFELP guarantors including guarantee issuance, processing, account maintenance, and guarantee fulfillment. In our Loan Servicing operating unit, we originate and service student loans on behalf of lenders who are unrelated to SLM Corporation.

Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Guarantor servicing fees $ 132 $ 115 $ 120 Loan servicing fees 29 44 52 Upromise 42 Other 84 81 78 Total fee and other income $ 287 $ 240 $ 250 USA Funds, the nations largest guarantee agency, accounted for 83 percent, 82 percent, and 85 percent, respectively, of guarantor servicing fees and 25 percent, 27 percent, and 16 percent, respectively, of revenues associated with other products and services for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. 2006 versus 2005 The increase in guarantor servicing fees in 2006 versus 2005 is primarily due to a negotiated settlement with USA Funds such that USA Funds was able to pay account maintenance fees that were previously held up by the cap on payments from ED to guarantors in 2005. This cap was removed by legislation reauthorizing the student loan programs of the Higher Education Act on October 1, 2006. 2005 versus 2004 The decrease is guarantor servicing fees in 2005 versus 2004 is due to the full year effect of the lower issuance fee rate, the result of the reduction in the issuance fee from 65 basis points to 40 basis points, and to an $8 million reduction in account maintenance fees caused by a cap on payments from ED to guarantors, discussed above. Operating Expenses Corporate and Other Business Segment The following table summarizes the components of operating expenses for our Corporate and Other operating segment. Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Operating expenses $ 148 $ 149 $ 152 Upromise 33 General and administrative expenses 69 86 59 Total operating expenses $ 250 $ 235 $ 211 Operating expenses include direct costs incurred to perform guarantor servicing on behalf of guarantor agencies and to service loans for unrelated third parties, as well as information technology expenses related to these functions. General and administrative expenses include unallocated corporate overhead expenses for centralized headquarters functions such as executive management, accounting and finance, human resources and marketing. 2006 versus 2005 In 2006, operating expenses in the Corporate and Other segment include $17 million of stock option compensation expense, due to the implementation of SFAS No. 123(R) and the expenses of Upromise, acquired in August 2006. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is due to a $14 million net 88 Table of Contents settlement in the College Loan Corporation (CLC) lawsuit and to lower corporate information technology expenses. At December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Corporate and Other operating segment had total assets of $999 million, $719 million and $524 million, respectively. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Except in the case of acquisitions, which are discussed separately, our DMO and Corporate and Other business segments are not capital intensive businesses and as such a minimal amount of debt and equity capital is allocated to these segments. Therefore, the following LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES discussion is concentrated on our Lending business segment. We have developed deep and diverse funding sources to ensure continued access to funding to support our business plan. Our biggest funding challenge continues to be our ability to maintain cost effective liquidity to fund the growth in the Managed portfolio of student loans as well as to refinance previously securitized loans when borrowers choose to refinance their loans through a FFELP Consolidation Loan or a Private Education Consolidation Loan with us. At the same time, we maintain earnings spreads by controlling interest rate risk. Our main source of funding is student loan securitizations and we have built a highly liquid and deep market for such financings as evidenced by the $32.1 billion in student loans securitized in thirteen transactions in 2006, and $26.1 billion in twelve transactions in 2005. We are the largest issuer in the student loan asset backed sector. FFELP securitizations are unique securities in the asset backed market as they are backed by student loans with an explicit U.S. government guarantee on 99 percent of principal and interest (prior to July 1, the guarantee was 100 percent). The investor base for our student loan backed securities is worldwide and we believe that the market for these securities will be available to meet our long term funding needs for the foreseeable future. Securitizations comprised 69 percent of our Managed debt outstanding at December 31, 2006, unchanged from December 31, 2005. In addition to securitizations, we also continued to diversify our sources of funding and issued $11.7 billion in SLM Corporation long term, unsecured debt in 2006. Over the years we have strategically introduced several SLM Corporation long term debt structures that further diversified our funding sources and substantially increased our fixed income investor base. In total, at December 31, 2006, on balance sheet debt, exclusive of on balance sheet securitizations and secured indentured trusts, totaled $48.9 billion versus $41.7 billion at December 31, 2005. Liquidity at SLM Corporation is important to enable us to effectively fund our student loan acquisitions, to meet maturing debt obligations, and to fund operations. The following table details our sources of liquidity and the available capacity at December 31, 2006 and 2005. December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 Available Capacity Available Capacity Sources of primary liquidity: Unrestricted cash and liquid investments $ 4,720 $ 3,928 Unused commercial paper and bank lines of credit 6,500 5,500 ABCP borrowing capacity 1,047 41 Total sources of primary liquidity 12,267 9,469 Sources of stand by liquidity: Unencumbered FFELP student loans 28,070 24,530 Total sources of primary and stand by liquidity $ 40,337 $ 33,999 We believe our unencumbered FFELP student loan portfolio provides an additional source of potential or stand by liquidity because the maturation of government guaranteed student loan securitizations has created a wide and deep marketplace for such transactions. In addition to the securitization markets, we believe that the wholesale market for FFELP student loans provides an additional potential source of stand by liquidity. At 89 Table of Contents December 31, 2006, we had $365 million of investments on our balance sheet that were pledged as collateral related to certain derivative positions and $99 million of other non liquid investments, neither of which were included in the above table. In addition to liquidity, a major objective when financing our business is to minimize interest rate risk by matching the interest rate and reset characteristics of our Managed assets and liabilities, generally on a pooled basis, to the extent practicable. In this process we use derivative financial instruments extensively to reduce our interest rate and foreign currency exposure. This interest rate risk management helps us to stabilize our student loan spread in various and changing interest rate environments. (See also RISKS Interest Rate Risk Management below.) The following tables present the ending and average balances and average interest rates of our Managed borrowings for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The average interest rates include derivatives that are economically hedging the underlying debt but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133.

In addition to the term issuances reflected in the table above, we also use our commercial paper program for short term liquidity purposes. The average balance of commercial paper outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $82 million and $345 million, respectively. The maximum daily amount outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $2.2 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. Preferred Stock Issuance At December 31, 2006, we had 3.3 million shares of 6.97 percent Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, Series A (the Series A Preferred Stock) and 4.0 million shares of Floating Rate Non Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series B (the Series B Preferred Stock) outstanding. Neither series has a maturity date but can be redeemed at the Companys option beginning November 16, 2009 for Series A, and on any dividend payment date on or after June 15, 2010 for Series B. Redemption would include any accrued and unpaid dividends up to the redemption date. The shares have no preemptive or conversion rights and are not convertible into or exchangeable for any of the Companys other securities or property. Dividends on both series are not mandatory and are paid quarterly, when, as, and if declared by the Board of Directors. Upon liquidation or dissolution of the Company, holders of our Series A and Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive $50 and $100 per share, respectively, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends for the then current quarterly dividend period, if any, pro rata, and before any distribution of assets are made to holders of our common stock. Contingently Convertible Debentures We had approximately $2 billion Contingently Convertible Debentures (Co Cos) outstanding at December 31, 2006. The Co Cos are convertible, under certain conditions, into shares of SLM common stock at an initial conversion price of $65.98. The investors generally can only convert the debentures if the Companys common stock has appreciated for a prescribed period to 130 percent of the conversion price, which would amount to $85.77. The convertible debentures bear interest at a floating rate equal to three month LIBOR minus .05 percent, until July 25, 2007, after which, the debentures can pay additional contingent interest under certain circumstances. Beginning on July 25, 2007, we may call the debentures and the investors may put the debentures, subject to certain conditions. In calculating diluted earnings per share (diluted EPS) we follow the guidance of EITF Issue No. 04 8, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share, which requires the shares underlying the Co Cos to be included in diluted EPS computations regardless of whether the market price trigger or the conversion price has been met, using the if converted accounting method, while the after tax interest expense of the Co Cos is added back to earnings. Diluted EPS amounts disclosed prior to December 91 Table of Contents 2004 have been retroactively restated to give effect to the application of EITF No. 04 8 as it relates to the Companys $2 billion in Co Cos issued in May 2003. The following table provides the historical effect of our Co Cos on our common stock equivalents (CSEs) and after tax interest expense in connection with the retroactive implementation of EITF No. 04 8 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.

(2) SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share, and the additional guidance provided by EITF Topic No. D 72, Effect of Contracts That May Be Settled in Stock or Cash on the Computation of Diluted Earnings per Share, require both the denominator and the numerator to be adjusted in calculating the potential impact of the Companys equity forward contracts on diluted EPS. Under this guidance, when certain conditions are satisfied, the impact can be dilutive when the combination of the average share price during the period is lower than the respective strike prices on the Companys equity forward contracts, and when the reversal of an unrealized gain or loss on derivative and hedging activities related to its equity forward contracts results in a lower EPS calculation.

(5) For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, stock options and equity forwards of approximately 57 million shares, 30 million shares and 4 million shares, respectively, were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because they were antidilutive. 92 Table of Contents Securitization Activities Securitization Program Our FFELP Stafford, Private Education Loan and FFELP Consolidation Loan securitizations are structured such that they are legal sales of assets using a two step transaction with a special purpose entity that legally isolates the transferred assets from the Company and its creditors, even in the event of bankruptcy. The holders of the beneficial interests issued by the special purpose entity are not constrained from pledging or exchanging their interests. In all of our securitizations, we retain the right to receive cash flows from the student loans and reserve accounts in excess of the amounts needed to pay servicing costs, derivative costs (if any), administration and other fees, and the principal and interest on the bonds backed by the student loans. The investors of the securitization trusts have no recourse to the Companys other assets should there be a failure of the securities backed by student loans to pay when due. Some of our securitizations meet the requirements for sale treatment under GAAP, according to the criteria of SFAS No. 140. In these transactions we use a two step sale to a qualifying special purpose entity (QSPE), such that we do not maintain effective control over the transferred assets. Accordingly, these transactions are accounted for off balance sheet. In certain securitization structures, there are terms within the deal structure that result in such securitizations not qualifying for sale treatment and accordingly, they are accounted for on balance sheet as variable interest entities (VIEs). Terms that prevent sale treatment include: (1) allowing us to hold certain rights that can affect the remarketing of certain bonds, (2) allowing the trust to enter into interest rate cap agreements after the initial settlement of the securitization, which do not relate to the reissuance of third party beneficial interests or (3) allowing us to hold an unconditional call option related to a certain percentage of the securitized assets. The securitization structure where we can affect the remarketing of the bonds was developed to broaden and diversify the investor base for FFELP Consolidation Loan securitizations by allowing us to issue bonds with shorter expected maturities and with non amortizing, fixed rate and foreign currency denominated tranches. As of December 31, 2006, we had $48.6 billion of securitized student loans in on balance sheet FFELP Consolidation Loan securitization trusts. These securitizations are included as financings in the table below. We recognize a gain on sales related to securitizations that qualify as off balance sheet transactions. The gain is calculated as the difference between the allocated cost basis of the assets sold and the relative fair value of the assets received. The carrying value of the student loan portfolio being securitized includes the applicable accrued interest, unamortized student loan premiums or discounts, loan loss reserves and Borrower Benefits reserves. The fair value of the Residual Interest is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology using assumptions discussed in more detail below. The ongoing earnings from our off balance sheet securitizations are recognized in servicing and securitization revenue. 93 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our securitization activity for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Those securitizations listed as sales are off balance sheet transactions and those listed as financings remain on balance sheet.

The Company may purchase loans out of this trust at its discretion and as a result, the trust does not qualify as a QSPE and is accounted for on balance sheet as a variable interest entity (VIE). (2) In certain FFELP Consolidation Loan securitizations there are terms within the deal structure that result in such securitizations not qualifying for sale treatment and accordingly, they are accounted for on balance sheet as variable interest entities VIEs. Terms that prevent sale treatment include: (1) allowing us to hold certain rights that can affect the remarketing of certain bonds, (2) allowing the trust to enter into interest rate cap agreements after the initial settlement of the securitization, which do not relate to the reissuance of third party beneficial interests or (3) allowing us to hold an unconditional call option related to a certain percentage of the securitized assets. The decrease in the FFELP Stafford/PLUS loans gain as a percentage of loans securitized from 1.1 percent for the year ended December 31, 2005 to .3 percent for the year ended December 31, 2006 is primarily due to: 1) an increase in the CPR assumption to account for continued high levels of FFELP Consolidation Loan activity; 2) an increase in the discount rate to reflect higher long term interest rates; 3) the re introduction of Risk Sharing with the Reconciliation Legislation during 2005 reauthorizing the student loan programs of the Higher Education Act; and 4) an increase in the amount of student loan premiums included in the carrying value of the loans sold. The higher premiums also affected FFELP Consolidation Loan securitizations and were primarily due to the securitization of loans previously acquired through business combinations. These loans carried higher premiums based on the allocation of the purchase price through purchase accounting. Higher premiums were also due to loans acquired through zero fee lending and the school as lender channels. The increase in the Private Education Loans gain as a percentage of loans securitized from 15.1 percent for the year ended December 31, 2005 to 16.3 percent for the year ended December 31, 2006 is primarily due to a higher spread earned on the assets securitized. 94 Table of Contents Residual Interest in Securitized Receivables The following tables summarize the fair value of our Residual Interests and the assumptions used to value such Residual Interests, along with the underlying off balance sheet student loans that relate to those securitizations in securitization transactions that were treated as sales as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. As of December 31, 2006 FFELP FFELP Consolidation Private Stafford and Loan Education PLUS Trusts(1) Loan Trusts Total Fair value of Residual Interests(2) $ 701 $ 676 $ 1,965 $ 3,342 Underlying securitized loan balance(3) 14,794 17,817 13,222 45,833 Weighted average life 2.9 yrs. 7.3 yrs. 7.2 yrs Prepayment speed (annual rate)(4) Interim status(5) 0 % n/a 0 % Repayment status(5) 0 43 % 3 9 % 4 7 % Life of loan repayment status(5) 24 % 6 % 6 %(7) Expected credit losses (% of student loan principal) .06 % .07 % 4.36 % Residual cash flows discount rate 12.6 % 10.5 % 12.6 % As of December 31, 2005 FFELP FFELP Consolidation Private Stafford and Loan Education PLUS Trusts(1) Loan Trusts Total Fair value of Residual Interests(2) $ 774 $ 483 $ 1,149 $ 2,406 Underlying securitized loan balance(3) 20,372 10,272 8,946 39,590 Weighted average life 2.7 yrs. 8.0 yrs. 7.8 yrs.

Changes in the fair value of the Embedded Floor Income are primarily due to changes in the interest rates and the paydown of the underlying loans. (2) At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had unrealized gains (pre tax) in accumulated other comprehensive income of $389 million and $370 million, respectively, that primarily related to the Residual Interests. (3) In addition to student loans in off balance sheet trusts, we had $48.6 billion and $40.9 billion of securitized student loans outstanding (face amount) as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, in on balance sheet FFELP Consolidation Loan securitization trusts. (4) Effective December 31, 2006, we implemented CPR curves for Residual Interest valuations that are based on the number of months since entering repayment that better reflect the CPR as the loan seasons. Under this methodology, a different CPR is applied to each year of a loans seasoning. Previously, we applied a CPR that was based on a static life of loan assumption, irrespective of seasoning, or, in the case of FFELP Stafford and PLUS loans, we used a vector approach in applying the CPR. The change in CPR methodology resulted in an immaterial change in the fair value of the Residual Interest. The CPR assumption used for all periods includes the impact of projected defaults. (5) The repayment status CPR depends on the number of months since first entering repayment or as the loan seasons through the portfolio. Life of loan CPR is related to repayment status only and does not include the impact of the loan while in interim status. (6) The CPRs used for December 31, 2005 FFELP Stafford and PLUS valuations were 20 percent for 2006, 15 percent for 2007 and 10 percent thereafter. (7) During 2006, the Company and others in the industry began consolidating Private Education Loans. As a result we experienced an increase in actual prepayment speeds primarily related to this new consolidation activity. We expect such consolidation activity to continue going forward and, as a result, the life of loan CPR assumption was increased from 4 percent to 6 percent as of December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, $304 million of the $389 million in accumulated other comprehensive income relates to the Private Education Loan trusts. 95 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Net Assets The following table summarizes our off balance sheet net assets at December 31, 2006 and 2005 on a basis equivalent to our GAAP on balance sheet trusts, which presents the assets and liabilities in the off balance sheet trusts as if they were being accounted for on balance sheet rather than off balance sheet. This presentation, therefore, includes a theoretical calculation of the premiums on student loans, the allowance for loan losses, and the discounts and deferred financing costs on the debt. This presentation is not, nor is it intended to be, a liquidation basis of accounting. (See also LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENT Summary of our Managed Loan Portfolio Ending Balances (net of allowance for loan losses) and LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Managed Borrowings Ending Balances, earlier in this section.) December 31, December 31, 2006 2005 Off Balance Sheet Assets: Total student loans, net $ 46,172 $ 39,925 Restricted cash and investments 4,269 3,761 Accrued interest receivable 1,467 937 Total off balance sheet assets 51,908 44,623 Off Balance Sheet Liabilities: Debt, par value 50,058 43,331 Debt unamortized discount and deferred issuance costs (193 ) (193 ) Total debt 49,865 43,138 Accrued interest payable 405 250 Total off balance sheet liabilities 50,270 43,388 Off Balance Sheet Net Assets $ 1,638 $ 1,235 Liquidity Risk and Funding Long Term Our primary funding source is the corporate and asset backed capital markets and as a result we have significant long term funding, credit spread and liquidity exposure to those markets. A major disruption in the fixed income capital markets that limits our ability to raise funds or significantly increases the cost of those funds could have a material impact on our ability to acquire student loans, or on our results of operations. Securitizations are, and will continue to be, the primary source of long term financing and liquidity. Our securitizations are structured such that we are not obligated to provide any material level of financial, credit or liquidity support to any of the trusts, thus limiting our exposure to the recovery of the Retained Interest asset on the balance sheet for off balance sheet securitizations or to the loss of the earnings spread for loans securitized on balance sheet. While all of our Retained Interests are subject to some prepayment risk, Retained Interests from our FFELP Stafford securitizations have significant prepayment risk primarily arising from borrowers opting to consolidate their Stafford/PLUS loans. When consolidation activity is higher than projected, the increase in prepayment could materially impair the value of our Retained Interest. However, this negative effect on our Retained Interest is somewhat offset by the loans that consolidate back on our balance sheet, which we view as trading one interest bearing asset for another, whereas loans that consolidate with third parties represent a complete loss of future economics to the Company. We discuss our short term liquidity risk, including a table of our sources of liquidity at the beginning of this LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES section. During 2006, we, along with others in the industry, began consolidating Private Education Loans. This will increase the prepayment spreads in Private Education Loan trusts, which will have a similar effect on Retained Interests in Private Education Loan securitizations as discussed above in Private Education Loan securitizations (see the Retained Interest in Securitized Receivables table included in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements, Student Loan Securitization, for further discussion and the Companys response to this activity). 96 Table of Contents Servicing and Securitization Revenue Servicing and securitization revenue, the ongoing revenue from securitized loan pools accounted for off balance sheet as QSPEs, includes the interest earned on the Residual Interest and the revenue we receive for servicing the loans in the securitization trusts. Interest income recognized on the Residual Interest is based on our anticipated yield determined by estimating future cash flows each quarter. The following table summarizes the components of servicing and securitization revenue for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Servicing revenue $ 336 $ 323 $ 326 Securitization revenue, before Embedded Floor Income and impairment 368 270 230 Servicing and securitization revenue, before Embedded Floor Income and impairment 704 593 556 Embedded Floor Income 14 81 241 Less: Floor Income previously recognized in gain calculation (8 ) (57 ) (156 ) Net Embedded Floor Income 6 24 85 Servicing and securitization revenue, before impairment 710 617 641 Retained Interest impairment (157 ) (260 ) (80 ) Total servicing and securitization revenue $ 553 $ 357 $ 561 Average off balance sheet student loans $ 46,336 $ 41,220 $ 40,558 Average balance of Retained Interest $ 3,101 $ 2,476 $ 2,434 Servicing and securitization revenue as a percentage of the average balance of off balance sheet student loans (annualized) 1.19 % .87 % 1.38 % Servicing and securitization revenue is primarily driven by the average balance of off balance sheet student loans, the amount of and the difference in the timing of Embedded Floor Income recognition on off balance sheet student loans and Retained Interest impairments. The increase in securitization revenue, before net Embedded Floor Income and impairment, from 2004 to 2006, is primarily due to (1) the continued increase in the amount of Private Education Loan Residual Interests as a percentage of the total Residual Interest. Private Education Loan Residual Interests generate a higher yield than FFELP loan Residual Interests, and (2) an increase in the amount of off balance sheet loans. Servicing and securitization revenue can be negatively impacted by impairments of the value of our Retained Interest, caused primarily by the effect of higher than expected FFELP Consolidation Loan activity on FFELP Stafford/PLUS student loan securitizations and the effect of market interest rates on the Embedded Floor Income included in the Retained Interest. The majority of the consolidations bring the loans back on balance sheet, so for those loans, we retain the value of the asset on balance sheet versus in the trust. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we recorded impairments of $157 million, $260 million and $80 million, respectively. These impairment charges were primarily the result of FFELP Stafford loans prepaying faster than projected through loan consolidation ($104 million, $256 million and $47 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively), and the effect of market interest rates on the Embedded Floor Income which is part of the Retained Interest ($53 million, $4 million and $33 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 respectively). The level and timing of FFELP Consolidation Loan activity is highly volatile, and in response we continue to revise our estimates of the effects of FFELP Consolidation Loan activity on our Retained Interests and it may result in additional impairment recorded in future periods if FFELP Consolidation Loan activity remains higher than projected. These impairment charges are recorded as a loss and are included as a reduction to securitization revenue. 97 Table of Contents We receive annual servicing fees of 90 basis points, 50 basis points and 70 basis points of the outstanding securitized loan balance related to our FFELP Stafford/PLUS, FFELP Consolidation Loan and Private Education Loan securitizations, respectively. CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS The following table provides a summary of our obligations associated with long term notes and equity forward contracts at December 31, 2006. For further discussion of these obligations, see Note 8, Long Term Debt, Note 10, Derivative Financial Instruments, and Note 14, Stockholders Equity, to the consolidated financial statements. 1 Year 2 to 3 4 to 5 Over or Less Years Years 5 Years Total Long term notes(1)(2) $ 4,156 $ 29,684 $ 21,860 $ 47,753 $ 103,453 Equity forward contracts(3) 1,205 1,298 97 2,600 Total contractual cash obligations $ 4,156 $ 30,889 $ 23,158 $ 47,850 $ 106,053 (1) Only includes principal obligations and specifically excludes SFAS No. 133 derivative market value adjustments. (2) Includes Financial Interpretation (FIN) No. 46 long term beneficial interests of $55.1 billion of notes issued by consolidated variable interest entities in conjunction with our on balance sheet securitization transactions and included in long term notes in the consolidated balance sheet. (3) Our obligation to repurchase shares under equity forward contracts is calculated using the average purchase prices for outstanding contracts in the year the contracts expire. At or prior to the maturity date of the agreements, we can purchase shares at the contracted amount plus or minus an early break fee, or we can settle the contract on a net basis with either cash or shares. The equity forward contracts permit the counterparty to terminate a portion of the contracts prior to their maturity date and to force the Company to settle the contracts if the price of the Companys common stock falls below pre determined levels as defined by the contract as the initial trigger price. The counterparty can continue to terminate portions of the contract if the stock price continues to reach lower pre determined levels, until the price hits the final trigger price and the entire contract is terminated. Counterparties have a maximum of two triggers each. OFF BALANCE SHEET LENDING ARRANGEMENTS The following table summarizes the commitments associated with student loan purchases and contractual amounts related to off balance sheet lending related financial instruments at December 31, 2006. 1 Year 2 to 3 4 to 5 Over or Less Years Years 5 Years Total Student loan purchases(1) $ 19,163 $ 23,364 $ 9,796 $ 9,270 $ 61,593 Lines of credit 559 657 930 2,146 $ 19,722 $ 24,021 $ 10,726 $ 9,270 $ 63,739 (1) Includes amounts committed at specified dates under forward contracts to purchase student loans and anticipated future requirements to acquire student loans from lending partners (discussed below) estimated based on future volumes at contractually committed rates. These commitments are not accounted for as derivatives under SFAS No. 133 as they do not meet the definition of a derivative due to the lack of a fixed and determinable purchase amount. We have issued lending related financial instruments including lines of credit to meet the financing needs of our customers. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk should the counterparty draw down the commitment and the counterparty subsequently fails to perform according to the terms of our contract. The remaining total contractual amount available to be borrowed under these commitments is $2.1 billion. We do not believe that these instruments are representative of our actual future credit exposure or funding requirements. To the extent that the lines of credit are drawn upon, the balance outstanding is collateralized by student loans. At December 31, 2006, draws on lines of credit were approximately $418 million, and are reflected in other loans in the consolidated balance sheet. For additional information, see Note 13, Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees, to the consolidated financial statements. 98 Table of Contents RISKS Overview Managing risks is an essential part of successfully operating a financial services company. Our most prominent risk exposures are operational, market and interest rate, political and regulatory, liquidity, credit, and Consolidation Loan refinancing risk. We discuss these and other risks in the Risk Factors section (Item 1A) of this document. The discussion that follows enhances that disclosure by discussing the risk management strategies that we employ to mitigate these risks. Operational Risk Operational risk can result from regulatory compliance errors, servicing errors (see further discussion below), technology failures, breaches of the internal control system, and the risk of fraud or unauthorized transactions by employees or persons outside the Company. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards and contractual commitments, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. The federal guarantee on our student loans and our designation as an Exceptional Performer by ED is conditioned on compliance with origination and servicing standards set by ED and guarantor agencies. A mitigating factor is our ability to cure servicing deficiencies and historically our losses have been small. Should we experience a high rate of servicing deficiencies, the cost of remedial servicing or the eventual losses on the student loans that are not cured could be material. Our servicing and operating processes are highly dependent on our information system infrastructure, and we face the risk of business disruption should there be extended failures of our information systems, any number of which could have a material impact on our business. To mitigate these risks we have a number of back up and recovery plans in the event of systems failures, which are regularly tested and monitored. We manage operational risk through our risk management and internal control processes, which involve each business line including independent cost centers, such as servicing, as well as executive management. The business lines have direct and primary responsibility and accountability for identifying, controlling, and monitoring operational risk, and each business line manager maintains a system of controls with the objective of providing proper transaction authorization and execution, proper system operations, safeguarding of assets from misuse or theft, and ensuring the reliability of financial and other data. We have centralized certain staff functions such as accounting, human resources and legal to further strengthen our operational controls. While we believe that we have designed effective methods to minimize operational risks, our operations remain vulnerable to natural disasters, human error, technology and communication system breakdowns and fraud. Market and Interest Rate Risk Market and interest rate risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices, interest rates, and or foreign currency exchange rates of our financial instruments. Our primary market risk is from changes in interest rates and interest spreads. We have an active interest rate risk management program that is designed to reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates and maintain consistent earning spreads in all interest rate environments. We use derivative instruments extensively to hedge our interest rate exposure, but there still is a risk that we are not hedging all potential interest rate exposures or that the hedges do not perform as designed. We measure interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for interest earning assets, interest bearing liabilities and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk. Many assumptions are utilized by management to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income, the more significant of which are related to student loan volumes and pricing, the timing of cash flows from our student loan portfolio, particularly the impact of Floor Income and the rate of student loan consolidations, basis risk, credit spreads and the maturity of our debt and derivatives. (See also Interest Rate Risk Management.) 99 Table of Contents As discussed in more detail under BUSINESS SEGMENTS Limitations of Core Earnings, even though we believe our derivatives are economic hedges, some of them do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133. Therefore, changes in interest rates can cause volatility in those earnings for the market value of our derivatives. Under SFAS No. 133, these changes in derivative market values are recorded through earnings with no consideration for the corresponding change in the fair value of the hedged item. Changes in interest rates can also have a material effect on the amount of Floor Income earned in our student loan portfolio and the valuation of our Retained Interest asset. Our earnings can also be materially affected by changes in our estimate of the rate at which loans may prepay in our portfolios as measured by the CPR. The value of the Retained Interests on FFELP Stafford securitizations is particularly affected by the level of Consolidation Loan activity. We face a number of other challenges and risks that can materially affect our future results such as changes in: applicable laws and regulations, which may change the volume, average term, effective yields and refinancing options of student loans under the FFELP or provide advantages to competing FFELP and non FFELP loan providers; demand and competition for education financing; financing preferences of students and their families; borrower default rates on Private Education Loans; continued access to the capital markets for funding at favorable spreads particularly for our non federally insured Private Education Loan portfolio; and our operating execution and efficiencies, including errors, omissions, and effectiveness of internal control. Our foreign currency exchange rate exposure is primarily the result of foreign denominated liabilities issued by the Company. Cross currency interest rate swaps are used to lock in the exchange rate for the term of the liability. In addition, the Company has foreign exchange rate exposure as a result of international operations; however, the exposure is minimal at this time. We are also subject to market risk relative to our equity forward contracts that allow us to repurchase our common stock in the future from a third party at the market price at the time of entering the contract. Should the market value of our stock fall below certain predetermined levels, the counterparty to the contract has a right to terminate the contract and settle all or a portion at the original contract price. We are required to mark our equity forwards to market, so decreases in our stock price could result in material losses. See COMMON STOCK for more detail on equity forward contracts. Political/Regulatory Risk Because we operate in a federally sponsored loan program, we are subject to political and regulatory risk. As part of the HEA, the student loan program is periodically amended and must be reauthorized every six years. Past changes included reduced loan yields paid to lenders in 1993 and 1998, increased fees paid by lenders in 1993, decreased level of the government guaranty in 1993 and reduced fees to guarantors and collectors, among others. On February 8, 2006, the Reconciliation Legislation was signed into law. There are a number of changes that could have a material impact on the Company. Recently, a number of bills have been introduced in both houses of Congress that, if enacted in their current form, over time could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. See RECENT DEVELOPMENTS. The Secretary of Education oversees and implements the HEA and periodically issues regulations and interpretations that may impact our business. 100 Table of Contents Liquidity Risk (See also LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Securitization Activities Liquidity Risk and Funding Long Term) Credit Risk We bear the full risk of borrower and closed school losses experienced in our Private Education Loan portfolio. These loans are underwritten and priced according to risk, generally determined by a commercially available consumer credit scoring system, FICO. Because of the nature of our lending, after an initial decrease, borrower FICO scores will generally improve over time. Additionally, for borrowers who do not meet our lending requirements or who desire more favorable terms, we generally require credit worthy co borrowers. Our higher education Private Education Loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy, except in certain limited circumstances. We have defined underwriting and collection policies, and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all Private Education Loans. Potential credit losses are considered in our risk based pricing model. The performance of the Private Education Loan portfolio may be affected by the economy, and a prolonged economic downturn may have an adverse effect on its credit performance. Management believes that it has provided sufficient allowances to cover the losses that may be experienced in both the federally guaranteed and Private Education Loan portfolios over the next two years depending on the portfolio. In addition, when a school closes, losses may be incurred for student borrowers who have not completed their education and who may have deferred against repayment or on part of their loans. We have provided for these potential losses in our allowance for loan losses. There is, however, no guarantee that such allowances are sufficient enough to account for actual losses. (See LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENT Private Education Loans Activity in the Allowance for Private Education Loan Losses.) We have credit risk exposure to the various counterparties with whom we have entered into derivative contracts. We review the credit standing of these companies. Our credit policies place limits on the amount of exposure we may take with any one party and in most cases, require collateral to secure the position. The credit risk associated with derivatives is measured based on the replacement cost should the counterparties with contracts in a gain position to the Company fail to perform under the terms of the contract. We also have credit risk with one commercial airline and Federal Express Corporation related to our portfolio of leveraged leases. (See LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENT Other Income Lending Business Segment.) Consolidation Loan Refinancing Risk The process of consolidating FFELP Stafford loans into FFELP Consolidation loans can have detrimental effects. First, we lose student loans in our portfolio that are consolidated with other lenders. In 2006, we experienced a net decrease of $3.1 billion of student loans from Consolidation Loan activity as more of our FFELP student loans were consolidated with other lenders than were consolidated by us. This was primarily caused by the run off of FFELP Consolidation Loans through the reconsolidation through the Direct Loan Program, as discussed in LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENT Student Loan Activity and to the effects of the repeal of the Single Holder Rule. FFELP Consolidation Loans have lower net yields than the FFELP Stafford loans they replace, which is somewhat offset by the longer average lives of FFELP Consolidation Loans. When FFELP Stafford loans in our securitization trusts consolidate, they are a prepayment for the trust. In periods of high consolidation activity, the prepayments can be greater than we have anticipated which can result in an impairment of our on balance sheet Retained Interest in those trusts due to its shorter life. See CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Effects of Consolidation Activity on Estimates. Also, we must maintain sufficient, short term liquidity to enable us to cost effectively refinance previously securitized FFELP loans as they are consolidated back on to our balance sheet. See also the discussion of the effects of reconsolidation on the FFELP Consolidation Loan portfolio at LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENT Consolidation Activity and its effect on our Floor Income Contracts economically hedging FFELP Consolidation Loans at LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENT Summary of our Managed Student Loan Portfolio Student Loan Floor Income Contracts. 101 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Management Asset and Liability Funding Gap The tables below present our assets and liabilities (funding) arranged by underlying indices as of December 31, 2006. In the following GAAP presentation, the funding gap only includes derivatives that qualify as effective SFAS No. 133 hedges (those derivatives which are reflected in net interest margin, as opposed to those reflected in the gains/(losses) on derivatives and hedging activities, net line on the income statement). The difference between the asset and the funding is the funding gap for the specified index. This represents our exposure to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk, which is the risk that the different indices may reset at different frequencies or may not move in the same direction or at the same magnitude. Management analyzes interest rate risk on a Managed basis, which consists of both on balance sheet and off balance sheet assets and liabilities and includes all derivatives that are economically hedging our debt whether they qualify as effective hedges under SFAS No. 133 or not. Accordingly, we are also presenting the asset and liability funding gap on a Managed basis in the table that follows the GAAP presentation. GAAP Basis Frequency of Variable Funding Resets Assets Funding(1) Gap Index (Dollars in billions) 3 month Commercial paper daily $ 75.2 $ $ 75.2 3 month Treasury bill weekly 7.8 .2 7.6 Prime annual .6 .6 Prime quarterly 1.3 1.3 Prime monthly 8.0 8.0 PLUS Index annual 2.0 .3 1.7 3 month LIBOR daily 3 month LIBOR quarterly 1.5 89.0 (87.5 ) 1 month LIBOR monthly .1 3.0 (2.9 ) CMT/CPI index monthly/quarterly 3.8 (3.8 ) Non Discrete reset(2) monthly 7.6 (7.6 ) Non Discrete reset(3) daily/weekly 6.9 .3 6.6 Fixed Rate(4) 12.7 11.9 .8 Total $ 116.1 $ 116.1 $ (1) Includes all derivatives that qualify as hedges under SFAS No. 133. (2) Consists of asset backed commercial paper and auction rate securities, which are discount note type instruments that generally roll over monthly. (3) Includes restricted and non restricted cash equivalents and other overnight type instruments. (4) Includes receivables/payables, other assets (including Retained Interest), other liabilities and stockholders equity (excluding Series B Preferred Stock). The funding gaps in the above table are primarily interest rate mismatches in short term indices between our assets and liabilities. We address this issue primarily through the use of basis swaps that typically convert quarterly 3 month LIBOR to other indices that are more correlated to our asset indices. These basis swaps do not qualify as effective hedges under SFAS No. 133 and as a result the effect on the funding index is not included in our interest margin and is therefore excluded from the GAAP presentation. 102 Table of Contents Managed Basis Frequency of Variable Funding Resets Assets Funding(1) Gap Index (Dollars in billions) 3 month Commercial paper daily $ 101.1 $ 10.4 $ 90.7 3 month Treasury bill weekly 13.9 12.5 1.4 Prime annual 1.0 1.0 Prime quarterly 7.4 5.5 1.9 Prime monthly 13.9 12.8 1.1 PLUS Index annual 3.5 5.5 (2.0 ) 3 month LIBOR daily 84.7 (84.7 ) 3 month LIBOR quarterly 1.5 10.5 (9.0 ) 1 month LIBOR monthly .1 2.0 (1.9 ) Non Discrete reset(2) monthly 9.9 (9.9 ) Non Discrete reset(3) daily/weekly 11.1 .2 10.9 Fixed Rate(4) 10.2 9.7 .5 Total $ 163.7 $ 163.7 $ (1) Includes all derivatives that management considers economic hedges of interest rate risk and reflects how we internally manage our interest rate exposure. (2) Consists of asset backed commercial paper and auction rate securities, which are discount note type instruments that generally roll over monthly. (3) Includes restricted and non restricted cash equivalents and other overnight type instruments. (4) Includes receivables/payables, other assets, other liabilities and stockholders equity (excluding Series B Preferred Stock). To the extent possible, we generally fund our assets with debt (in combination with derivatives) that has the same underlying index (index type and index reset frequency). When it is more economical, we also fund our assets with debt that has a different index and or reset frequency than the asset, but only in instances where we believe there is a high degree of correlation between the interest rate movement of the two indices. For example, we use daily reset 3 month LIBOR to fund a large portion of our daily reset 3 month commercial paper indexed assets. In addition, we use quarterly reset 3 month LIBOR to fund a portion of our quarterly reset Prime rate indexed Private Education Loans. We also use our monthly Non Discrete reset funding (asset backed commercial paper program and auction rate securities) to fund various asset types. In using different index types and different index reset frequencies to fund our assets, we are exposed to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk, which is the risk that the different indices that may reset at different frequencies will not move in the same direction or at the same magnitude. We believe that this risk is low as all of these indices are short term with rate movements that are highly correlated over a long period of time. We use interest rate swaps and other derivatives to achieve our risk management objectives. When compared with the GAAP presentation, the Managed basis presentation includes all of our off balance sheet assets and funding, and also includes basis swaps that primarily convert quarterly 3 month LIBOR to other indices that are more correlated to our asset indices. 103 Table of Contents Weighted Average Life The following table reflects the weighted average life for our Managed earning assets and liabilities at December 31, 2006. On Balance Off Balance Sheet Sheet Managed (Averages in Years) Earning assets Student loans 9.7 5.7 9.5 Other loans 5.9 5.9 Cash and investments .6 .1 .4 Total earning assets 9.0 5.2 8.8 Borrowings Short term borrowings .3 .3 Long term borrowings 6.8 5.7 6.5 Total borrowings 6.6 5.7 6.3 Long term debt issuances likely to be called by us or putable by the investor have been categorized according to their call or put dates rather than their maturity dates. In recent years the shift in the composition of our FFELP student loan portfolio from Stafford loans to FFELP Consolidation Loans has lengthened the Managed weighted average life of the student loan portfolio from 9.0 years at December 31, 2005, to 9.5 years at December 31, 2006. COMMON STOCK The following table summarizes the Companys common share repurchase, issuance and equity forward activity for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (Shares in millions) Common shares repurchased: Open market 2.2 .5 Equity forward contracts 5.4 17.3 32.7 Benefit plans(1) 1.6 1.5 1.5 Total shares repurchased 9.2 18.8 34.7 Average purchase price per share(2) $ 52.41 $ 49.94 $ 38.03 Common shares issued 6.7 8.3 10.7 Equity forward contracts: Outstanding at beginning of period 42.7 42.8 43.5 New contracts 10.9 17.2 32.0 Settlements (5.4 ) (17.3 ) (32.7 ) Outstanding at end of period 48.2 42.7 42.8 Authority remaining at end of period to repurchase or enter into equity forwards 15.7 18.7 35.8 (1) Shares withheld from stock option exercises and vesting of performance stock for employees tax withholding obligations and shares tendered by employees to satisfy option exercise costs. (2) For equity forward contracts, the average purchase price per share for 2005 and 2004 is calculated based on the average strike price of all equity forward contracts including those whose strike prices were amended and were net settled in the cashless transactions discussed above. There were no such cashless transactions in 2006. During December 2005, September 2004 and November 2004, we amended substantially all of our outstanding equity forward purchase contracts. The strike prices on these contracts were adjusted to the then 104 Table of Contents current market share prices of the common stock and the total number of shares under contract was reduced from 46.5 million, 53.4 million and 49.0 million shares to 42.4 million, 46.7 million and 42.2 million shares, respectively. As a result of these amendments, we received a total of 4.1 million and 13.4 million shares that settled in 2005 and 2004, respectively, free and clear in cashless transactions. This reduction of shares covered by the equity forward contracts is shown on a net basis in the settlements row of the table above. As of December 31, 2006, the expiration dates and range of and weighted average purchase prices for outstanding equity forward contracts were as follows: Weighted Year of Maturity Outstanding Range of Average (Contracts in millions of shares) Contracts Purchase Prices Purchase Price 2008 7.3 $54.74 $ 54.74 2009 14.7 54.74 54.74 2010 15.0 54.74 54.74 2011 9.1 50.30 53.76 52.72 2012 2.1 46.30 46.70 46.40 48.2 $ 54.00 The closing price of the Companys common stock on December 29, 2006 was $48.77. Should the market value of our stock fall below certain initial trigger prices, the counterparty to the contract has a right to terminate the contract and settle all or a portion at the original contract price. For equity forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2006, these initial trigger prices range from $25.93 per share to $35.58 per share. In February 2007, the Company made payments to certain counterparties to lower the strike prices and trigger prices on their outstanding equity forward contracts. Also in February 2007, the Company agreed with certain counterparties to amend the trigger prices on their outstanding equity forward contracts. In total, the Company amended the terms of the contracts covering 18.5 million shares. As a result of these transactions, the Companys aggregate position on equity forward contracts is 48.2 million shares at an average strike price of $51.86. The highest trigger price on all outstanding equity forward contracts is now $30.11, down from $35.58. As of February 28, 2007, the expiration dates and range of and weighted average purchase prices for outstanding equity forward contracts were as follows: Weighted Year of maturity Outstanding Range of Average (Contracts in millions of shares) Contracts Purchase Prices Purchase Price 2008 7.3 $43.50 $44.00 $ 43.80 2009 14.7 46.00 54.74 53.66 2010 15.0 54.74 54.74 2011 9.1 49.75 53.76 51.91 2012 2.1 46.30 46.70 46.40 48.2 $ 51.86 In December 2005, the Company retired 65 million shares of common stock held in treasury at an average price of $37.35 per share. This retirement decreased the balance in treasury stock by $2.4 billion, with corresponding decreases of $13 million in common stock and $2.4 billion in retained earnings. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Student Aid Reward Act of 2007 On February 13, 2007, Senator Kennedy introduced the Student Aid Reward Act of 2007, which offers financial incentives to schools to participate in the Direct Loan Program. Under the bill, schools would receive payments from the government not to exceed 50 percent of the budget scored savings to the government as 105 Table of Contents a result of the school using the FDLP rather than the FFELP. The bill provides that schools could use such payments to supplement the amount awarded to Pell Grant recipients or could use such payment for grants to low or middle income graduate students. Schools would be required to join the Direct Loan Program for five years from the date the first payment is made to qualify for the payments. Because payments would be contingent on available funding, schools switching from the FFELP to the FDLP would be paid first and, then, other FDLP schools, if funds remained, would be paid on a pro rata basis. Presidents 2008 Budget Proposals On February 5, 2007, President Bush transmitted his fiscal 2008 budget proposals to Congress. The budget included several proposals that would reduce or alter payments to both lenders and guarantors in the FFELP. The specific proposals include: (1) reducing special allowance payments on new loans by 0.50 percentage points; (2) reducing the default guaranty from 97 percent to 95 percent; (3) reducing payments to Exceptional Performers by two percentage points; (4) doubling lender origination fee for FFELP Consolidation Loans, from 0.5 percent to 1.0 percent; (5) reducing collections retention to 16 percent beginning in fiscal 2008; (6) reducing administrative cost allowance payments to guaranty agencies, changing the formula from a percent of original principal to a unit cost basis; and (7) eliminating the Perkins loan program. If enacted in their current form, and the Company takes no remedial action, the FFELP programs cuts proposed in the Presidents budget proposal detailed above, which are to be implemented prospectively, could over time have a materially adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations, as new loans originated under the new proposal become a higher percentage of the portfolio. Student Loan Sunshine Act In February 2007, the Student Loan Sunshine Act was introduced in both the House and Senate with the stated purpose of protecting student loan borrowers by providing them with more information and disclosures about private student loans. The bill applies to all lenders that make private educational loans through colleges and universities, as well as to lenders of direct to consumer educational loans. The bills provisions also apply to post secondary educational institutions that receive federal funds. The legislation would impose significant new disclosure and reporting requirements on schools and lenders and would prohibit gifts with a value greater than $10 from lenders to financial aid professionals. The legislation would require schools to include at least three unaffiliated lenders on any preferred lender list. The legislation would amend the Truth in Lending Act to require lenders to notify the school if their student, or parent of their student, applies for a private education loan, regardless of whether the lender has an education loan arrangement with the school, and to require the school to notify the prospective borrower whether and to what extent the private education loan exceeds the cost of attendance, after consideration of all federal, state and institutional aid that the borrower has or is eligible to receive. If the Student Loan Sunshine Act is enacted in its current form, it could negatively impact the financial aid process and the timely disbursement of private education loans, including the efficiency of direct toconsumer loans, for borrowers at post secondary education institutions, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, the bill could adversely affect the strategy under which our primary marketing point of contact is the schools financial aid internal brand originations. Student Debt Relief Act of 2007 On January 22, 2007, Senator Edward Kennedy (D MA) introduced the Student Debt Relief Act of 2007 (S. 359) along with Senators Durbin (D IL), Lieberman (D CT), Mikulski (D MD), Obama (D IL), and Schumer (D NY) as co sponsors. The proposed legislation would, in addition to increasing Pell grants and providing other benefits to student loan borrowers, once again allow in school loan consolidation and allow reconsolidation of FFELP Consolidation Loans; make charging Direct Loan origination fees subject to the discretion of the Secretary of Education; and, 106 Table of Contents for borrowers with Direct Loans only, provide borrowers employed in public service with loan forgiveness after 120 payments under the income contingent repayment plan. The Student Debt Relief Act also contains the provisions of the Student Aid Reward Act of 2007 (see discussion below). If the Student Debt Relief Act becomes law in its current form, it could negatively impact the Companys future earnings. College Student Relief Act of 2007 On January 17, 2007, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 5, the College Student Relief Act of 2007. The bill was principally designed to lower student loan interest rates paid by borrowers of subsidized undergraduate FFELP and FDLP loans over a five year period beginning July 1, 2007, from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent in 2011. Because the lender rate is separate from the borrower rate, the interest rate cut does not affect lenders. The interest rate cut, however, does have a sizable budget effect because the federal government pays to the lender any positive difference between the lender rate and the borrower rate. To offset the additional budget cost, the legislation makes several changes to increase costs to lenders and guaranty agencies. The legislation would reduce default insurance from 97 percent to 95 percent, eliminate Exceptional Performer, double the lender origination fee on all new loans from 0.5 percent to 1 percent, reduce special allowance formula on all new Stafford, PLUS, and FFELP Consolidation Loans by 0.1 percent (exempting the smallest lenders) and increase the offset fee that consolidation lenders pay, to 1.3 percent for consolidation loan holders whose portfolio contains more than 90 percent FFELP Consolidation Loans. The legislation would reduce the amount that guaranty agencies may retain upon collecting on defaulted claim paid loans. The legislation will be transmitted in the Senate, where it will be referred to the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and is unlikely to be considered as a stand alone bill. The Senate HELP committee is expected to begin consideration of the Reconciliation of the Higher Education Act prior to its expiration in June and sections of H.R. 5 could be considered as part of that legislation. The Company has several loan pricing mechanisms, such as the level of Borrower Benefits, that would mitigate some of the negative impact of this proposal. Also, reduced profitability in the student loans could result in a number of our competitors leaving the industry which would benefit us. In addition, this legislation would be implemented prospectively, so its effect would gradually impact us over a number of years. Accordingly, we cannot predict the effect of this proposed legislation on the Companys financial condition and results of operation. SEC and House Committee Requests On February 13, 2007, the Company received a copy of a letter addressed to Albert L. Lord, the Companys Chairman of the Board of Directors, from the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and Labor. The letter requested that Mr. Lord and the Company provide the House Committee on Education and Labor and the House Financial Services Committee with information on communications with the White House and the U.S. Department of Education about the Presidents budget proposals and recent legislative initiatives for the period from November 1, 2006 through the date of the request. We are cooperating with committee counsel in order to provide the requested information. On February 15, 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission contacted the Company about Mr. Lords sales of SLM Corporation common stock and requested information and documents relating to sales of SLM Corporation common stock by the Companys Board of Directors, officers or employees. We are cooperating with the Securities and Exchange Commission in order to provide the requested information and documents. OTHER RELATED EVENTS AND INFORMATION ED Dear Colleague Letter Restating Requirements of 9.5 Percent Loan Special Allowance Payments Eligibility On January, 23, 2007, ED issued a Dear Colleague Letter to the industry. The letter restated the requirements of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, and EDs regulations that control whether 107 Table of Contents FFELP loans made or acquired with funds derived from tax exempt obligations are eligible for 9.5 percent SAP. The letters restatement is consistent with claims asserted by the EDs Office of Inspector General (OIG) in their Final Audit Report on Special Allowance Payments to Nelnet for Loans Funded by Tax Exempt Obligations issued on September 29, 2006. On January 24, 2007, ED sent a letter to the Company which sets forth the same restatement and also imposes audit and certification requirements for any 9.5 percent SAP billings after September 30, 2006. On February 15, 2007, the Company delivered a letter to ED, which, subject to certain conditions, including no successful challenge by an industry participant of EDs restated eligibility requirements for 9.5 percent SAP, stated that the Company would make no further claims for 9.5 percent SAP retroactive to October 1, 2006, and for those loans affected, would bill at the standard SAP rate. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company accrued $2.4 million in interest income in excess of income based upon the standard special allowance rate on its portfolio of loans that is entitled to receive 9.5 percent SAP. After adjusting for the fourth quarter accrual, we earned a total of $13.1 million in interest income in excess of standard special allowance payments during 2006. Regardless of the issuance of the Dear Colleague Letter, the Companys portfolio of 9.5 percent loans and associated SAP billings have been in a constant state of decline. As a result, our voluntary forgoing of future claims of 9.5 percent SAP will not have a material impact on future earnings. In addition, we will record an impairment of $9 million related to the intangible asset associated with the 9.5 percent loans acquired in business combinations. Extension of the Higher Education Act On September 30, 2006, the President signed into law P.L. 109 292, the Third Extension of the Higher Education Act (HEA), temporarily authorizing the rest of HEA until June 30, 2007. Included in the extension were several modifications to provisions passed in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. The first provision further limited the ability of schools to act as lenders in the FFELP, requiring that the statutory restrictions on school as lender apply to schools using eligible lender trusts. Another provision clarified the rate for the Account Maintenance Fee paid to guaranty agencies. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, Significant Accounting Policies Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements. 108 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis The effect of short term movements in interest rates on our results of operations and financial position has been limited through our interest rate risk management. The following tables summarize the effect on earnings for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 and the effect on fair values at December 31, 2006 and 2005, based upon a sensitivity analysis performed by management assuming a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of 100 basis points and 300 basis points while funding spreads remain constant. This analysis does not consider any potential impairment to our Residual Interests that may result from a higher discount rate that would be used to compute the present value of the cash flows if long term interest rates increased. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, Student Loan Securitization, which details the potential decrease to fair value that could occur.

However, as discussed under LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENT Summary of our Managed Student Loan Portfolio Floor Income, we can have a fixed versus floating mismatch in funding if the student loan earns at the fixed borrower rate and the funding remains floating. During the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, certain FFELP student loans were earning Floor Income and we locked in a portion of that Floor Income through the use of futures and Floor Income Contracts. The result of these hedging transactions was to convert a portion of the fixed rate nature of student loans to variable rate, and to fix the relative spread between the student loan asset rate and the variable rate liability. In the above table, under the scenario where interest rates increase 100 and 300 basis points, the changes in pre tax net income before the unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities is primarily due to the impact of (i) our off balance sheet hedged FFELP Consolidation Loan securitizations and the related Embedded Floor Income recognized as part of the gain on sale, which results in a decrease in payments on the written Floor contracts that more than offset impairment losses on the Embedded Floor Income in the Residual Interest; (ii) our unhedged on balance sheet loans not currently having significant Floor Income due to the recent increase in interest rates, which results in these loans being more variable rate; and (iii) a portion of our fixed rate assets being funded with variable debt. The first item will generally cause income to increase when interest rates increase from a low interest rate environment, whereas, the second and third items will generally offset this increase. In the 100 and 300 basis point scenario for the year ended December 31, 2006, item (iii) had a greater impact than item (i) resulting in a net loss. Item (i) had a bigger impact in both scenarios for the year ended December 31, 2005 due to the lower interest rate environment that existed relative to 2006. In addition to interest rate risk addressed in the preceding tables, the Company is also exposed to risks related to foreign currency exchange rates and the equity price of its own stock. Foreign currency exchange risk is primarily the result of foreign denominated debt issued by the Company. As it relates to the Companys corporate unsecured and securitization debt programs used to fund the Companys business, the Companys policy is to use cross currency interest rate swaps to swap all foreign denominated debt payments (fixed and floating) to U.S. dollar LIBOR using a fixed exchange rate. In the tables above, there would be an immaterial impact on earnings if exchange rates were to decrease or increase, due to the terms of the hedging instrument 110 Table of Contents and hedged items matching. The balance sheet interest bearing liabilities would be affected by a change in exchange rates, however, the change would be materially offset by the cross currency interest rate swaps in other assets or other liabilities. In addition, the Company has foreign exchange risk as a result of international operations, however, the exposure is minimal at this time. Equity price risk of the Companys own stock is due to equity forward contracts used in the Companys share repurchase program. A hypothetical decrease in the Companys stock price per share of $5.00 and $10.00 would result in a $241 million and $482 million unrealized loss on derivative and hedging, respectively. In addition to the net income impact, other liabilities would increase by the aforementioned amounts. Stock price decreases can also result in the counterparty exercising its right to demand early settlement on a portion of or the total contract depending on trigger prices set in each contract. The initial trigger prices as of December 31, 2006 range from approximately $25.93 to $35.58. At December 29, 2006, the closing price of the Companys stock was $48.77. With the $5.00 and $10.00 decrease in unit stock price above, none of these triggers would be met and no counterparty would have the right to early settlement.
