Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Years ended December 31, 2005 2007 (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts, unless otherwise stated) FORWARD LOOKING AND CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS Some of the statements contained in this Annual Report discuss future expectations and business strategies or include other forward looking information. Those statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the statements. The forward looking information is based on various factors and was derived using numerous assumptions. OVERVIEW We are the largest source of funding, delivery and servicing support for education loans in the United States. Our primary business is to originate, acquire and hold both federally guaranteed student loans and Private Education Loans, which are not federally guaranteed or privately insured. The primary source of our earnings is from net interest income earned on those student loans as well as gains on the sales of such loans in securitization transactions. We also earn fees for pre default and post default receivables management services on student loans, such that we are engaged in every phase of the student loan life cycle from originating and servicing student loans to default prevention and ultimately the collection on defaulted student loans. Through recent acquisitions, we have expanded our receivables management services to a number of different asset classes outside of student loans. We also provide a wide range of other financial services, processing capabilities and information technology to meet the needs of educational institutions, lenders, students and their families, and guarantee agencies. SLM Corporation, more commonly known as Sallie Mae, is a holding company that operates through a number of subsidiaries. References in this report to the Company refer to SLM Corporation and its subsidiaries. We have used both internal growth and strategic acquisitions to attain our leadership position in the education finance marketplace. Our sales force, which delivers our products on campuses across the country, is the largest in the student loan industry. The core of our marketing strategy is to promote our on campus brands, which generate student loan originations through our Preferred Channel. Loans generated through our Preferred Channel are more profitable than loans acquired through other acquisition channels because we own them earlier in the student loans life and generally incur lower costs to acquire such loans. We have built brand leadership through the Sallie Mae name, the brands of our subsidiaries and those of our lender partners. These sales and marketing efforts are supported by the largest and most diversified servicing capabilities in the industry. In recent years, borrowers have been consolidating their FFELP Stafford loans into FFELP Consolidation Loans in much greater numbers such that FFELP Consolidation Loans now constitute 55 percent of our Managed loan portfolio. We have expanded into a number of fee based businesses, most notably, our Asset Performance Group (APG), formerly known as Debt Management Operations (DMO) business. Our APG business provides a wide range of accounts receivable and collections services including student loan default aversion services, defaulted student loan portfolio management services, contingency collections services for student loans and other asset classes, and accounts receivable management and collection for purchased portfolios of receivables that are delinquent or have been charged off by their original creditors. We also purchase and manage portfolios of sub performing and non performing mortgage loans. We also earn fees for a number of services including student loan and guarantee servicing, 529 college savings plan administration services, and for providing processing capabilities and information technology to educational institutions. We also operate an affinity marketing program through Upromise, Inc. (Upromise). 37 We manage our business through two primary operating segments: the Lending operating segment and the APG operating segment. Accordingly, the results of operations of the Companys Lending and APG operating segments are presented separately below under BUSINESS SEGMENTS. These operating segments are considered reportable segments under the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, based on quantitative thresholds applied to the Companys financial statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations addresses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions. Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, Significant Accounting Policies, includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates its estimates, particularly those that include the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and are often about matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates relate to the following accounting policies that are discussed in more detail below: application of the effective interest method for loans (premiums, discounts and Repayment Borrower Benefits), securitization accounting and Retained Interests, allowance for loan losses, and derivative accounting. In recent years, we have frequently updated a number of estimates to account for the continued high level of FFELP Consolidation Loan activity. Also, a number of these estimates affect life of loan calculations. Since our student loans have long average lives, the cumulative effect of relatively small changes in estimates can be material. Premiums, Discounts and Repayment Borrower Benefits For both federally insured and Private Education Loans, we account for premiums paid, discounts received, capitalized direct origination costs incurred on the origination of student loans, and the impact of Repayment Borrower Benefits in accordance with SFAS No. 91, Accounting for Nonrefundable Fees and Costs Associated with Originating or Acquiring Loans and Initial Direct Costs of Leases. The unamortized portion of the premiums and the discounts is included in the carrying value of the student loans on the consolidated balance sheet. We recognize income on our student loan portfolio based on the expected yield of the student loan after giving effect to the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of student loan discounts, as well as the impact of Repayment Borrower Benefits. Premiums, capitalized direct origination costs and discounts received are amortized over the estimated life of the loan, which includes an estimate of prepayment speeds. Estimates for future prepayments are incorporated in an estimated Constant Prepayment Rate (CPR), which is primarily based upon the historical prepayments due to consolidation and defaults, extensions from the utilization of forbearance, as well as, managements expectation of future prepayments and extensions. For Repayment Borrower Benefits, the estimates of their effect on student loan yield are based on analyses of historical payment behavior of borrowers who are eligible for the incentives, and the evaluation of the ultimate qualification rate for these incentives. We periodically evaluate the assumptions used to estimate the loan life and qualification rates, and in instances where there are modifications to the assumptions, amortization is adjusted on a cumulative basis to reflect the change. The estimate of the CPR measures the rate at which loans in the portfolio pay before their stated maturity. A number of factors can affect the CPR estimate such as the rate of consolidation activity and default rates. Changes in CPR estimates are discussed in more detail below. The impact of Repayment Borrower Benefits is dependent on the estimate of the number of borrowers who will eventually qualify for these benefits. For competitive purposes, we occasionally change Repayment Borrower Benefits programs in both amount and qualification factors. These programmatic changes are reflected in the estimate of the Repayment Borrower Benefits discount when made. 38 Securitization Accounting and Retained Interests We regularly engage in securitization transactions as part of our financing strategy (see also LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Securitization Activities). In a securitization, we sell student loans to a trust that issues bonds backed by the student loans as part of the transaction. When our securitizations meet the sale criteria of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities a Replacement of SFAS No. 125, we record a gain on the sale of the student loans, which is the difference between the allocated cost basis of the assets sold and the relative fair value of the assets received. The primary judgment in determining the fair value of the assets received is the valuation of the Residual Interest. The Residual Interests in each of our securitizations are treated as either (1) available for sale securities in accordance with SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and therefore must be marked to market with temporary unrealized gains and losses recognized, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity or (2) securities marked to market through earnings under SFAS No. 155 Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments. Since there are no quoted market prices for our Residual Interests, we estimate their fair value both initially and each subsequent quarter using the key assumptions listed below: the projected net interest yield from the underlying securitized loans, which can be impacted by the forward yield curve, cost of funds for auction rate securities as well as the Repayment Borrower Benefits program; the calculation of the Embedded Floor Income associated with the securitized loan portfolio; the CPR; the expected credit losses from the underlying securitized loan portfolio; and the discount rate used, which is intended to be commensurate with the risks involved. We recognize interest income and periodically evaluate our Residual Interests for other than temporary impairment in accordance with the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 99 20, Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Residual Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets. Under this standard, each quarter we estimate the remaining cash flows to be received from our Retained Interests and use these revised cash flows to prospectively calculate a yield for income recognition. In cases where our estimate of future cash flows results in a lower yield from that used to recognize interest income in the prior quarter, the Residual Interest is written down to fair value, first to the extent of any unrealized gain in accumulated other comprehensive income, then through earnings as an other than temporary impairment, and the yield used to recognize subsequent income from the trust is negatively impacted. We also receive income for servicing the loans in our securitization trusts. We assess the amounts received as compensation for these activities at inception and on an ongoing basis to determine if the amounts received are adequate compensation as defined in SFAS No. 140. To the extent such compensation is determined to be no more or less than adequate compensation, no servicing asset or obligation is recorded. Allowance for Loan Losses We maintain an allowance for loan losses at an amount sufficient to absorb losses incurred in our FFELP loan and Private Education Loan portfolios at the reporting date based on a projection of estimated probable net credit losses. We analyze those portfolios to determine the effects that the various stages of delinquency have on borrower default behavior and ultimate charge off. We estimate the allowance for loan losses for our Managed loan portfolio using a migration analysis of delinquent and current accounts. A migration analysis is a technique used to estimate the likelihood that a loan receivable may progress through the various delinquency stages and ultimately charge off, and is a widely used reserving methodology in the consumer finance industry. We also use the migration analysis to estimate the amount of uncollectible accrued interest on Private Education Loans and write off that amount against current period interest income. 39 When calculating the allowance for loan losses on Private Education Loans, we divide the portfolio into categories of similar risk characteristics based on loan program type, loan status (in school, grace, repayment, forbearance, delinquency), underwriting criteria, existence or absence of a cosigner, and aging. We use historical experience coupled with qualitative factors regarding changes in portfolio mix, macroeconomic indicators, policies, procedures, laws, regulations, underwriting, and other factors to estimate default and collection rate projections. We then apply default and collection rate projections to each category. The vast majority of our Private Education Loan programs do not require the borrowers to begin repayment until six months after they have graduated or otherwise have left school. Consequently, our loss estimates for these programs are generally low while the borrower is in school. At December 31, 2007, 43 percent of the principal balance in the higher education Managed Private Education Loan portfolio is related to borrowers who are still in school or grace and not required to make payments. As the current portfolio ages, an increasing percentage of the borrowers will leave school and be required to begin payments on their loans. The allowance for losses will change accordingly with the percentage of borrowers in repayment. Our loss estimates are based on a loss emergence period of generally two years. Similar to the rules governing FFELP payment requirements, our collection policies allow for periods of nonpayment for borrowers requesting additional payment grace periods upon leaving school or experiencing temporary difficulty meeting payment obligations. This is referred to as forbearance status and is considered separately in our allowance for loan losses. The majority of forbearance occurs early in the repayment term when borrowers are starting their careers (see LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENT Private Education Loans Private Education Loan Delinquencies). At December 31, 2007, 13.9 percent of the Managed Private Education Loan portfolio in repayment and forbearance was in forbearance status. The loss emergence period is in alignment with our typical collection cycle and takes into account these periods of nonpayment. In general, Private Education Loan principal is charged off against the allowance when the loan exceeds 212 days delinquency. Recoveries on loans charged off are considered when calculating the allowance for loan losses, and actual cash recoveries are therefore recorded directly to the allowance. FFELP loans are guaranteed as to their principal and accrued interest in the event of default subject to a Risk Sharing level set based on the date of loan disbursement. For loans disbursed after October 1, 1993, and before July 1, 2006, the Company receives 98 percent reimbursement on all qualifying default claims. For loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2006, the Company receives 97 percent reimbursement. In October 2005, the Companys loan servicing division, Sallie Mae Servicing, was designated as an Exceptional Performer (EP) by ED which enabled the Company to receive 100 percent reimbursement on default claims filed from the date of designation through June 30, 2006 for loans that were serviced by Sallie Mae Servicing for a period of at least 270 days before the date of default. Legislation passed in early 2006 decreased the rate of reimbursement under the EP program from 100 percent to 99 percent for claims filed on or after July 1, 2006. As a result of this amended reimbursement level, the Company established an allowance at December 31, 2005 for loans that were subject to the one percent Risk Sharing. The College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 (CCRAA) repealed the EP program and returned loans to their previous disbursement date based guarantee rates of 98 percent or 97 percent. In reaction, the Company increased its provision for FFELP loans to cumulatively increase the allowance for loan losses to cover these higher Risk Sharing levels. The evaluation of the provisions for loan losses is inherently subjective, as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant changes. Management believes that the allowance for loan losses is appropriate to cover probable losses in the student loan portfolio. Effects of Consolidation Activity on Estimates Between 2003 and 2006, we experienced a surge in consolidation activity as a result of aggressive marketing and historically low interest rates. This, in turn, has had a significant effect on a number of accounting estimates in recent years. We updated our assumptions that are affected primarily by consolidation activity and updated the estimates used in developing the cash flows and effective yield calculations as they relate to the amortization of student loan premiums and discounts, Repayment Borrower Benefits, Residual Interest income and the valuation of the Residual Interest. 40 Consolidation activity affects each estimate differently depending on whether the original loans being consolidated were on balance sheet or off balance sheet and whether the resulting consolidation is retained by us or consolidated with a third party. When we consolidate a loan that was in our portfolio, the term of that loan is generally extended and the term of the amortization of associated student loan premiums and discounts is likewise extended to match the new term of the loan. In that process, the unamortized premium balance must be adjusted to reflect the new expected term of the consolidated loan as if it had been in place from inception. The estimate of the CPR also affects the estimate of the average life of securitized trusts and therefore affects the valuation of the Residual Interest. Prepayments shorten the average life of the trust, and if all other factors remain equal, will reduce the value of the Residual Interest, the securitization gain on sale and the effective yield used to recognize interest income. Prepayments on student loans in our securitized trusts are significantly impacted by the rate at which securitized loans are consolidated. When a loan is consolidated from the trust either by us or a third party, the loan is treated as a prepayment. In cases where the loan is consolidated by us, it will be recorded as an on balance sheet asset. We discuss the effects of changes in our CPR estimates in LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Securitization Activities and Liquidity Risk and Funding Long Term. The increased activity in FFELP Consolidation Loans has led to demand for the consolidation of Private Education loans. Private Education Consolidation Loans provide an attractive refinancing opportunity to certain borrowers because they allow borrowers to lower their monthly payments by extending the life of the loan and or lowering their interest rate. Consolidation of Private Education Loans from off balance sheet Private Education Loan trusts will increase the CPR used to value the Residual Interest.

Decrease in prospective effective yield used to recognize interest income. Derivative Accounting We use interest rate swaps, cross currency interest rate swaps, interest rate futures contracts, Floor Income Contracts and interest rate cap contracts as an integral part of our overall risk management strategy to manage interest rate and foreign currency risk arising from our fixed rate and floating rate financial instruments. In addition, we use equity forward contracts (see Note 12, Stockholders Equity, to the financial statements for further discussion) to lock in our future purchase price of the Companys stock to better manage share repurchases. We account for these instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which requires that every derivative instrument, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability. We determine the fair value for our derivative instruments primarily by using pricing models that consider current market conditions and the contractual terms of the derivative contracts. Market inputs into the model include interest rates, optionality, forward interest rate curves, volatility factors, forward foreign exchange rates, and the closing price of the Companys stock (related to our equity forward contracts). The fair values of some derivatives are determined using counterparty valuations. Pricing models and their underlying assumptions impact the amount and timing of unrealized gains and losses recognized; the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different financial results. As a matter of policy, we compare the fair values of our derivatives that we calculate to those provided by our counterparties on a monthly basis. Any significant differences are identified and resolved appropriately. SFAS No. 133 requires that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria as specified by SFAS No. 133 are met. We believe that all of our derivatives are effective economic hedges and are a critical element of our interest rate risk management strategy. However, under SFAS No. 133, some of our derivatives, primarily Floor Income Contracts, certain Eurodollar futures contracts, basis swaps and equity forwards, do not qualify for hedge treatment under SFAS No. 133. Therefore, changes in market value along with the periodic net settlements must be recorded through the gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net line in the consolidated statement of income with no consideration for the corresponding change in fair value of the hedged item. The derivative market value adjustment is primarily caused by interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate volatility, changing credit spreads during the period, and changes in our stock price (related to equity forwards) as well as, the volume and term of derivatives not receiving hedge accounting treatment.

As discussed in detail above in the OVERVIEW section, we have two primary business segments, Lending and APG, plus a Corporate and Other business segment. Since these business segments operate in distinct business environments, the discussion following the results of our operations is primarily presented on a segment basis. See BUSINESS SEGMENTS for further discussion on the components of each segment. Securitization gains and the ongoing servicing and securitization income are included in LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Securitization Activities. The discussion of derivative market value gains and losses is under BUSINESS SEGMENTS Limitations of Core Earnings Pre tax Differences between Core Earnings and GAAP by Business Segment Derivative Accounting. The discussion of goodwill and acquired intangible amortization and impairment is discussed under BUSINESS SEGMENTS Limitations of Core Earnings Pre tax Differences between Core Earnings and GAAP by Business Segment Acquired intangibles. CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS SUMMARY The main drivers of our net income are the growth in our Managed student loan portfolio, which drives net interest income and securitization transactions, the spread we earn on student loans, unrealized gains and losses on derivatives that do not receive hedge accounting treatment, the timing and size of securitization gains, growth in our fee based business and expense control. 44 Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 For the year ended December 31, 2007, our net loss was $896 million, or $2.26 diluted loss per share, compared to net income of $1.2 billion, or $2.63 diluted earnings per share, in the year ago period. The effective tax rate in those periods was (86) percent and 42 percent, respectively. The movement in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by the permanent tax impact of excluding non taxable gains and losses on equity forward contracts which are marked to market through earnings under the FASBs SFAS No. 133. Pre tax income decreased by $2.5 billion versus the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $1.0 billion increase in net losses on derivative and hedging activities, which was mostly comprised of losses on our equity forward contracts. Losses on derivative and hedging activities were $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $339 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2007 also decreased versus the year ended December 31, 2006 due to a $535 million decrease in gains on student loan securitizations. The securitization gain in 2007 was the result of one Private Education Loan securitization that had a pre tax gain of $367 million or 18.4 percent of the amount securitized. In the year ago period, there were three Private Education Loan securitizations that had total pre tax gains of $830 million or 16.3 percent of the amount securitized. For the year ended December 31, 2007, servicing and securitization income was $437 million, a $116 million decrease from the year ended December 31, 2006. This decrease was primarily due to a $97 million increase in impairment losses which was mainly the result of FFELP Stafford Consolidation Loan activity exceeding expectations, increased Private Education Consolidation Loan activity, increased Private Education Loan expected default activity, and an increase in the discount rate used to value the Private Education Loan Residual Interests (see LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Residual Interest in Securitized Receivables). Net interest income after provisions for loan losses decreased by $594 million versus the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease was due to the year over year increase in the provisions for loan losses of $728 million, which offset the year over year $134 million increase in net interest income. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to an increase of $30.8 billion in the average balance of on balance sheet interest earning assets offset by a decrease in the student loan spread, including the impact of Wholesale Consolidation Loans (see Student Loan Spread Student Loan Spread Analysis On Balance Sheet). The increase in provisions for loan losses relates to higher provision amounts for Private Education Loans, FFELP loans, and mortgage loans primarily due to a weakening U.S. economy (see LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENT Activity in the Allowance for Private Education Loan Losses; and Total Provisions for Loan Losses). Fee and other income and collections revenue increased $42 million from $1.11 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $1.15 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating expenses increased by $206 million year over year. This increase in operating expenses was primarily due to $56 million in Merger related expenses and $23 million in severance costs incurred in 2007. As part of the Companys cost reduction efforts, these severance costs were related to the elimination of approximately 350 positions (representing three percent of the overall employee population) across all areas of the Company. Operating expenses in 2007 also included $93 million related to a full year of expenses for Upromise compared to $33 million incurred in 2006 subsequent to the August 2006 acquisition of this subsidiary. Our Managed student loan portfolio grew by $21.5 billion (or 15 percent), from $142.1 billion at December 31, 2006 to $163.6 billion at December 31, 2007. In 2007 we acquired $40.3 billion of student loans, an 8 percent increase over the $37.4 billion acquired in the year ago period. The 2007 acquisitions included $9.3 billion in Private Education Loans, an 11 percent increase over the $8.4 billion acquired in 2006. In the year ended December 31, 2007, we originated $25.5 billion of student loans through our Preferred Channel, an increase of 9 percent over the $23.4 billion originated in the year ago period. Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 For the year ended December 31, 2006, net income was $1.2 billion ($2.63 diluted earnings per share), a 16 percent decrease from the $1.4 billion in net income ($3.05 diluted earnings per share) for the year ended 45 December 31, 2005. On a pre tax basis, year to date 2006 net income of $2.0 billion was a 6 percent decrease from the $2.1 billion in pre tax net income earned in the year ended December 31, 2005. The larger percentage decrease in year over year, after tax net income versus pre tax net income is driven by the tax accounting permanent impact of excluding $360 million in unrealized equity forward losses from 2006 taxable income and excluding $121 million of unrealized equity forward gains from 2005 taxable income. Fluctuations in the effective tax rate were primarily driven by the permanent tax impact of excluding non taxable gains and losses on equity forward contracts as discussed above. The net effect from excluding non taxable gains and losses on equity forward contracts from taxable income was an increase in the effective tax rate from 34 percent in the year ended December 31, 2005 to 42 percent in the year ended December 31, 2006. Year over year net interest income is roughly unchanged as the $12 billion increase in average interest earning assets was offset by a 23 basis point decrease in the net interest margin. The year over year decrease in the net interest margin is due to higher average interest rates which reduced Floor Income by $155 million, and to the increase in the average balance of lower yielding cash and investments. Securitization gains increased by $350 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 versus 2005. The securitization gains for 2006 were primarily driven by the three off balance sheet Private Education Loan securitizations, which had total pre tax gains of $830 million or 16 percent of the amount securitized, versus two off balance sheet Private Education Loan securitizations in 2005, which had pre tax gains of $453 million or 15 percent of the amount securitized. For the year ended December 31, 2006, servicing and securitization revenue increased by $196 million to $553 million. The increase in servicing and securitization revenue can be attributed to $103 million in lower impairments on our Retained Interests and the growth in the average balance of off balance sheet student loans. Impairments are primarily caused by the effect of FFELP Consolidation Loan activity on our FFELP Stafford securitization trusts. Pre tax impairments on our Retained Interests in securitizations totaled $157 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 versus $260 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. In 2006, net losses on derivative and hedging activities were $339 million, a decrease of $586 million from the net gains of $247 million in 2005. This decrease primarily relates to $230 million of unrealized losses in 2006, versus unrealized gains of $634 million in the prior year, which resulted in a year over year reduction in pre tax income of $864 million. The effect of the unrealized losses was partially offset by a $278 million reduction in realized losses on derivatives and hedging activities on instruments that were not accounted for as hedges. The decrease in unrealized gains was primarily due to the impact of a lower SLM stock price on our equity forward contracts which resulted in a mark to market unrealized loss of $360 million in 2006 versus an unrealized gain of $121 million in the year ago period, and to a decrease of $305 million in unrealized gains on Floor Income Contracts. The smaller unrealized gains on our Floor Income Contracts were primarily caused by the relationship between the Floor Income Contracts strike prices versus the estimated forward interest rates during 2006 versus 2005. Fee and other income and collections revenue increased $192 million from $915 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 to $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating expenses increased by $208 million year over year. This increase in operating expenses can primarily be attributed to $63 million of stock option compensation expense, due to the implementation of SFAS No. 123(R) in the first quarter of 2006 and to $33 million related to expenses for Upromise, acquired in August 2006. Our Managed student loan portfolio grew by $19.6 billion (or 16 percent), from $122.5 billion at December 31, 2005 to $142.1 billion at December 31, 2006. In 2006 we acquired $37.4 billion of student loans, a 24 percent increase over the $30.2 billion acquired in the year ago period. The 2006 acquisitions included $8.4 billion in Private Education Loans, a 31 percent increase over the $6.4 billion acquired in 2005. In the year ended December 31, 2006, we originated $23.4 billion of student loans through our Preferred Channel, an increase of 9 percent over the $21.4 billion originated in the year ago period. 46 Average Balance Sheets The following table reflects the rates earned on interest earning assets and paid on interest bearing liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. This table reflects the net interest margin for the entire Company for our on balance sheet assets. It is included in the Lending segment discussion because that segment includes substantially all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities.

Increase Attributable to Change in Increase Rate Volume 2007 vs. 2006 Interest income $ 2,096 $ (98 ) $ 2,194 Interest expense 1,962 301 1,661 Net interest income $ 134 $ (399 ) $ 533 2006 vs. 2005 Interest income $ 2,067 $ 1,370 $ 697 Interest expense 2,064 1,589 475 Net interest income $ 3 $ (219 ) $ 222 47 The changes in net interest income are primarily due to fluctuations in the student loan spread discussed below, as well as the growth of our student loan portfolio and the level of cash and investments we may hold on our balance sheet for liquidity purposes. In connection with the Merger Agreement, we increased our liquidity portfolio to higher than historical levels. The liquidity portfolio has a negative net interest margin and, as a result, the increase in this portfolio reduced net interest income by $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Student Loans For both federally insured and Private Education Loans, we account for premiums paid, discounts received and certain origination costs incurred on the origination and acquisition of student loans in accordance with SFAS No. 91, Accounting for Nonrefundable Fees and Costs Associated with Originating or Acquiring Loans and Initial Direct Costs of Leases. The unamortized portion of the premiums and discounts is included in the carrying value of the student loan on the consolidated balance sheet. We recognize income on our student loan portfolio based on the expected yield of the student loan after giving effect to the amortization of purchase premiums and the accretion of student loan discounts, as well as interest rate reductions and rebates expected to be earned through Repayment Borrower Benefits programs. Discounts on Private Education Loans are deferred and accreted to income over the lives of the student loans. In the table below, this accretion of discounts is netted with the amortization of the premiums. Student Loan Spread An important performance measure closely monitored by management is the student loan spread. The student loan spread is the difference between the income earned on the student loan assets and the interest paid on the debt funding those assets. A number of factors can affect the overall student loan spread, such as: the mix of student loans in the portfolio, with FFELP Consolidation Loans having the lowest spread and Private Education Loans having the highest spread; the premiums paid, borrower fees charged and capitalized costs incurred to acquire student loans, which impact the spread through subsequent amortization; the type and level of Repayment Borrower Benefits programs for which the student loans are eligible; the level of Floor Income and, when considering the Core Earnings spread, the amount of Floor Income eligible loans that have been hedged through Floor Income Contracts; and funding and hedging costs. 48 Student Loan Spread Analysis On Balance Sheet The following table analyzes the reported earnings from on balance sheet student loans. For an analysis of our student loan spread for the entire portfolio of Managed student loans on a similar basis to the on balance sheet analysis, see LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENT Student Loan Spread Analysis Core Earnings Basis. Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 On Balance Sheet Student loan yield, before Floor Income 7.96 % 7.94 % 6.22 % Gross Floor Income .05 .04 .25 Consolidation Loan Rebate Fees (.60 ) (.67 ) (.65 ) Repayment Borrower Benefits (.12 ) (.12 ) (.11 ) Premium and discount amortization (.16 ) (.14 ) (.16 ) Student loan net yield 7.13 7.05 5.55 Student loan cost of funds (5.56 ) (5.36 ) (3.69 ) Student loan spread, before Interim ABCP Facility Fees(1)(2) 1.57 % 1.69 % 1.86 % Interim ABCP Facility Fees(3) (.04 ) Student loan spread(1) 1.53 % 1.69 % 1.86 % Average Balances On balance sheet student loans(1) $ 104,740 $ 84,173 $ 74,724 (1) Excludes the effect of the Wholesale Consolidation Loan portfolio on the student loan spread and average balance for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. (2) Student loan spread including the effect of Wholesale Consolidation Loans 1.44 % 1.68 % 1.86 % (3) The Interim ABCP Facility Fees are the commitment and liquidity fees related to a financing facility in connection with the Merger Agreement. The table above shows the various items that impact our student loan spread. Gross Floor Income (Floor Income earned before payments on Floor Income Contracts) is impacted by the level of interest rates and the percentage of the FFELP portfolio eligible to earn Floor Income. The spread impact from Consolidation Loan Rebate Fees fluctuates as a function of the percentage of FFELP Consolidation Loans on our balance sheet. Repayment Borrower Benefits are generally impacted by the amount of Repayment Borrower Benefits being offered as well as the payment behavior of the underlying loans. Premium and discount amortization is generally impacted by the prices we pay for loans and amounts capitalized related to such purchases or originations. Premium and discount amortization is also impacted by prepayment behavior of the underlying loans. The decrease in our student loan spread, before Interim ABCP Facility Fees and the effect of Wholesale Consolidation Loans, for the year ended December 31, 2007 versus 2006 was primarily due to an increase in our cost of funds. Our cost of funds for on balance sheet student loans excludes the impact of basis swaps that economically hedge the re pricing and basis mismatch between our funding and student loan asset indices, but do not receive hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133. We use basis swaps extensively to manage our basis risk associated with our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. These swaps generally do not qualify as accounting hedges, and as a result, are required to be accounted for in the gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities, net line in the consolidated statement of income, as opposed to being accounted for in interest expense. As a result, these basis swaps are not considered in the calculation of the cost of funds in the above table, and in times of volatile movements of interest rates like those experienced in the second half of 2007, the student loan spread in the above table can significantly change. See LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENT Student Loan Spread Analysis Core Earnings Basis, which reflects these basis swaps in interest expense, and demonstrates the economic hedge effectiveness of these basis swaps. The 49 decrease in the student loan spread was also due to an increase in the estimate of uncollectible accrued interest related to our Private Education Loans (see LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENT Student Loan Spread Analysis Core Earnings Basis.) The decrease in the student loan spread before the effect of Wholesale Consolidation Loans in the year ended December 31, 2006 versus 2005 was primarily due to the reduction in Gross Floor Income earned. A primary driver of fluctuations in our on balance sheet student loan spread when interest rates significantly change from period to period can be the level of Gross Floor Income earned in the period. Interest rates increased significantly between 2005 and 2006 which reduced Gross Floor Income earned. We believe that we have economically hedged most of the long term Floor Income through the sale of Floor Income Contracts, under which we receive an upfront fee and agree to pay the counterparty the Floor Income earned on a notional amount of student loans. These contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and as a result the payments on the Floor Income Contracts are included in the consolidated statement of income with gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net rather than in student loan interest income, where the offsetting Floor Income is recorded. In the second half of 2006, we implemented a new loan acquisition strategy under which we began purchasing FFELP Consolidation Loans outside of our normal origination channels, primarily via the spot market. We refer to this volume as our Wholesale Consolidation Channel. FFELP Consolidation Loans acquired through this channel are considered incremental volume to our core acquisition channels, which are focused on the retail marketplace with an emphasis on our internal brand strategy. Wholesale Consolidation Loans generally command significantly higher premiums than our originated FFELP Consolidation Loans, and as a result, Wholesale Consolidation Loans have lower spreads. Since Wholesale Consolidation Loans are acquired outside of our core loan acquisition channels and have different yields and return expectations than the rest of our FFELP Consolidation Loan portfolio, we have excluded the impact of the Wholesale Consolidation Loan volume from the student loan spread analysis to provide more meaningful period over period comparisons on the performance of our student loan portfolio. We are no longer buying Wholesale Consolidation Loans. FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES The Company is subject to federal and state income taxes. Our effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was (86) percent, 42 percent and 34 percent, respectively. The effective tax rate reflects the permanent impact of the exclusion of gains and losses on equity forward contracts with respect to the Companys stock for tax purposes. These permanent differences were a $1.6 billion loss in 2007, a $360 million loss in 2006, and a $121 million gain in 2005. BUSINESS SEGMENTS The results of operations of the Companys Lending and APG operating segments are presented below. These defined business segments operate in distinct business environments and are considered reportable segments under SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, based on quantitative thresholds applied to the Companys financial statements. In addition, we provide other complementary products and services through smaller operating segments that do not meet such thresholds and are aggregated in the Corporate and Other reportable segment for financial reporting purposes. These products and services include guarantor and loan servicing, 529 college savings plan administration, and the operation of an affinity marketing program. The management reporting process measures the performance of the Companys operating segments based on the management structure of the Company as well as the methodology used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. In accordance with the Rules and Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), we prepare financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In addition to evaluating the Companys GAAP based financial information, management, including the Companys chief operation decision makers, evaluates the performance of the Companys operating segments based on their profitability on a basis that, as allowed under SFAS No. 131, differs from GAAP. We refer to managements basis of evaluating our segment results as Core Earnings presentations for each business segment and we 50 refer to these performance measures in our presentations with credit rating agencies and lenders. Accordingly, information regarding the Companys reportable segments is provided herein based on Core Earnings, which are discussed in detail below. Our Core Earnings are not defined terms within GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Core Earnings net income reflects only current period adjustments to GAAP net income as described below. Unlike financial accounting, there is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance for management reporting and as a result, our management reporting is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Our operating segments are defined by the products and services they offer or the types of customers they serve, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by management. Intersegment revenues and expenses are netted within the appropriate financial statement line items consistent with the income statement presentation provided to management. Changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial information. Core Earnings are the primary financial performance measures used by management to develop the Companys financial plans, track results, and establish corporate performance targets and incentive compensation. While Core Earnings are not a substitute for reported results under GAAP, we rely on Core Earnings in operating our business because Core Earnings permit management to make meaningful period to period comparisons of the operational and performance indicators that are most closely assessed by management. Management believes this information provides additional insight into the financial performance of the core business activities of our operating segments. Accordingly, the tables presented below reflect Core Earnings which are reviewed and utilized by management to manage the business for each of our reportable segments. A further discussion regarding Core Earnings is included under Limitations of Core Earnings and Pre tax Differences between Core Earnings and GAAP by Business Segment. 51 The Lending operating segment includes all discussion of income and related expenses associated with the net interest margin, the student loan spread and its components, the provisions for loan losses, and other fees earned on our Managed portfolio of student loans. The APG operating segment reflects the fees earned and expenses incurred in providing accounts receivable management and collection services. Our Corporate and Other reportable segment includes our remaining fee businesses and other corporate expenses that do not pertain directly to the primary segments identified above.

Limitations of Core Earnings While GAAP provides a uniform, comprehensive basis of accounting, for the reasons described above, management believes that Core Earnings are an important additional tool for providing a more complete understanding of the Companys results of operations. Nevertheless, Core Earnings are subject to certain general and specific limitations that investors should carefully consider. For example, as stated above, unlike financial accounting, there is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance for management reporting. Our Core Earnings are not defined terms within GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Unlike GAAP, Core Earnings reflect only current period adjustments to GAAP. Accordingly, the Companys Core Earnings presentation does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Investors, therefore, may not compare our Companys performance with that of other financial services companies based upon Core Earnings. Core Earnings results are only meant to supplement GAAP results by providing additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely used by management, the Companys board of directors, rating agencies and lenders to assess performance. Other limitations arise from the specific adjustments that management makes to GAAP results to derive Core Earnings results. For example, in reversing the unrealized gains and losses that result from SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge treatment, as well as on derivatives that do qualify but are in part ineffective because they are not perfect hedges, we focus on the long term economic effectiveness of those instruments relative to the underlying hedged item and isolate the effects of interest rate volatility, changing credit spreads and changes in our stock price on the fair value of such instruments during the period. Under GAAP, the effects of these 54 factors on the fair value of the derivative instruments (but not on the underlying hedged item) tend to show more volatility in the short term. While our presentation of our results on a Core Earnings basis provides important information regarding the performance of our Managed portfolio, a limitation of this presentation is that we are presenting the ongoing spread income on loans that have been sold to a trust managed by us. While we believe that our Core Earnings presentation presents the economic substance of our Managed loan portfolio, it understates earnings volatility from securitization gains. Our Core Earnings results exclude certain Floor Income, which is real cash income, from our reported results and therefore may understate earnings in certain periods. Managements financial planning and valuation of operating results, however, does not take into account Floor Income because of its inherent uncertainty, except when it is economically hedged through Floor Income Contracts. Pre tax Differences between Core Earnings and GAAP by Business Segment Our Core Earnings are the primary financial performance measures used by management to evaluate performance and to allocate resources. Accordingly, financial information is reported to management on a Core Earnings basis by reportable segment, as these are the measures used regularly by our chief operating decision makers. Our Core Earnings are used in developing our financial plans and tracking results, and also in establishing corporate performance targets and determining incentive compensation. Management believes this information provides additional insight into the financial performance of the Companys core business activities. Core Earnings net income reflects only current period adjustments to GAAP net income, as described in the more detailed discussion of the differences between Core Earnings and GAAP that follows, which includes further detail on each specific adjustment required to reconcile our Core Earnings segment presentation to our GAAP earnings. Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Corporate Corporate Corporate Lending APG and Other Lending APG and Other Lending APG and Other Core Earnings adjustments: Net impact of securitization accounting $ 247 $ $ $ 532 $ $ $ (60 ) $ $ Net impact of derivative accounting 217 (1,558 ) 131 (360 ) 516 121 Net impact of Floor Income (169 ) (209 ) (204 ) Net impact of acquired intangibles (55 ) (28 ) (29 ) (49 ) (34 ) (11 ) (42 ) (15 ) (4 ) Total Core Earnings adjustments to GAAP $ 240 $ (28 ) $ (1,587 ) $ 405 $ (34 ) $ (371 ) $ 210 $ (15 ) $ 117 1) Securitization Accounting: Under GAAP, certain securitization transactions in our Lending operating segment are accounted for as sales of assets. Under Core Earnings for the Lending operating segment, we present all securitization transactions on a Core Earnings basis as long term non recourse financings. The upfront gains on sale from securitization transactions as well as ongoing servicing and securitization revenue presented in accordance with GAAP are excluded from Core Earnings and are replaced by the interest income, provisions for loan losses, and interest expense as they are earned or incurred on the securitization loans. We also exclude transactions with our off balance sheet trusts from Core Earnings as they are considered intercompany transactions on a Core Earnings basis. 55 The following table summarizes Core Earnings securitization adjustments for the Lending operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Core Earnings securitization adjustments: Net interest income on securitized loans, before provisions for loan losses and before intercompany transactions $ (818 ) $ (896 ) $ (870 ) Provisions for loan losses 380 16 (65 ) Net interest income on securitized loans, after provisions for loan losses, before intercompany transactions (438 ) (880 ) (935 ) Intercompany transactions with off balance sheet trusts (119 ) (43 ) (34 ) Net interest income on securitized loans, after provisions for loan losses (557 ) (923 ) (969 ) Gains on student loan securitizations 367 902 552 Servicing and securitization revenue 437 553 357 Total Core Earnings securitization adjustments $ 247 $ 532 $ (60 ) Intercompany transactions with off balance sheet trusts in the above table relates primarily to the losses incurred through the repurchase of delinquent loans out of our off balance sheet securitization trusts. When Private Education Loans in our securitization trusts settling before September 30, 2005, become 180 days delinquent, we typically exercise our contingent call option to repurchase these loans at par value out of the trust and record a loss for the difference in the par value paid and the fair market value of the loan at the time of purchase. The significant increase in these intercompany transactions from 2006 to 2007 was driven primarily by the increase in delinquency trends and charge offs during 2007 associated with our Private Education Loan portfolio. We do not hold the contingent call option for any trusts settled after September 30, 2005. 2) Derivative Accounting: Core Earnings exclude periodic unrealized gains and losses that are caused primarily by the one sided mark to market derivative valuations prescribed by SFAS No. 133 on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge treatment under GAAP. These unrealized gains and losses occur in our Lending operating segment and in our Corporate and Other reportable segment as it relates to equity forwards. In our Core Earnings presentation, we recognize the economic effect of these hedges, which generally results in any cash paid or received being recognized ratably as an expense or revenue over the hedged items life. Core Earnings also exclude the gain or loss on equity forward contracts that under SFAS No. 133, are required to be accounted for as derivatives and are marked to market through earnings. SFAS No. 133 requires that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria, as specified by SFAS No. 133, are met. We believe that our derivatives are effective economic hedges, and as such, are a critical element of our interest rate risk management strategy. However, some of our derivatives, primarily Floor Income Contracts, certain basis swaps and equity forward contracts (discussed in detail below), do not qualify for hedge treatment as defined by SFAS No. 133, and the stand alone derivative must be marked to market in the income statement with no consideration for the corresponding change in fair value of the hedged item. The gains and losses described in Gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net are primarily caused by interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate volatility, changing credit spreads and changes in our stock price during the period as well as the volume and term of derivatives not receiving hedge treatment. Our Floor Income Contracts are written options that must meet more stringent requirements than other hedging relationships to achieve hedge effectiveness under SFAS No. 133. Specifically, our Floor Income Contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment because the paydown of principal of the student loans underlying the Floor Income embedded in those student loans does not exactly match the change in the notional amount of our written Floor Income Contracts. Under SFAS No. 133, the upfront payment is deemed a liability and changes in fair value are recorded through income throughout the life of the contract. The 56 change in the value of Floor Income Contracts is primarily caused by changing interest rates that cause the amount of Floor Income earned on the underlying student loans and paid to the counterparties to vary. This is economically offset by the change in value of the student loan portfolio, including our Retained Interests, earning Floor Income but that offsetting change in value is not recognized under SFAS No. 133. We believe the Floor Income Contracts are economic hedges because they effectively fix the amount of Floor Income earned over the contract period, thus eliminating the timing and uncertainty that changes in interest rates can have on Floor Income for that period. Prior to SFAS No. 133, we accounted for Floor Income Contracts as hedges and amortized the upfront cash compensation ratably over the lives of the contracts. Basis swaps are used to convert floating rate debt from one floating interest rate index to another to better match the interest rate characteristics of the assets financed by that debt. We primarily use basis swaps to change the index of our floating rate debt to better match the cash flows of our student loan assets that are primarily indexed to a commercial paper, Prime or Treasury bill index. In addition, we use basis swaps to convert debt indexed to the Consumer Price Index to 3 month LIBOR debt. SFAS No. 133 requires that when using basis swaps, the change in the cash flows of the hedge effectively offset both the change in the cash flows of the asset and the change in the cash flows of the liability. Our basis swaps hedge variable interest rate risk, however they generally do not meet this effectiveness test because most of our FFELP student loans can earn at either a variable or a fixed interest rate depending on market interest rates. We also have basis swaps that do not meet the SFAS No. 133 effectiveness test that economically hedge off balance sheet instruments. As a result, under GAAP these swaps are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected currently in the income statement. Under SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity, equity forward contracts that allow a net settlement option either in cash or the Companys stock are required to be accounted for as derivatives in accordance with SFAS No. 133. As a result, we account for our equity forward contracts as derivatives in accordance with SFAS No. 133 and mark them to market through earnings. They do not qualify as effective SFAS No. 133 hedges, as a requirement to achieve hedge accounting is the hedged item must impact net income and the settlement of these contracts through the purchase of our own stock does not impact net income. The table below quantifies the adjustments for derivative accounting under SFAS No. 133 on our net income for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, when compared with the accounting principles employed in all years prior to the SFAS No. 133 implementation.

The table below summarizes the realized losses on derivative and hedging activities, and the associated reclassification on a Core Earnings basis for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Reclassification of realized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities: Net settlement expense on Floor Income Contracts reclassified to net interest income $ (67 ) $ (50 ) $ (259 ) Net settlement income (expense) on interest rate swaps reclassified to net interest income 47 (59 ) (123 ) Net realized gains (losses) on terminated derivative contracts reclassified to other income 2 (5 ) Total reclassifications of realized losses on derivative and hedging activities (18 ) (109 ) (387 ) Add: Unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net(1) (1,343 ) (230 ) 634 Gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net $ (1,361 ) $ (339 ) $ 247 (1) Unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net comprises the following unrealized mark to market gains (losses): Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Floor Income Contracts $ (209 ) $ 176 $ 481 Equity forward contracts (1,558 ) (360 ) 121 Basis swaps 360 (58 ) 40 Other 64 12 (8 ) Total unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net $ (1,343 ) $ (230 ) $ 634 Unrealized gains and losses on Floor Income Contracts are primarily caused by changes in interest rates. In general, an increase in interest rates results in an unrealized gain and vice versa. Unrealized gains and losses on equity forward contracts fluctuate with changes in the Companys stock price. Unrealized gains and losses on basis swaps result from changes in the spread between indices, primarily as it relates to Consumer Price Index (CPI) swaps economically hedging debt issuances indexed to CPI and on changes in the forward interest rate curves that impact basis swaps hedging repricing risk between quarterly reset debt and daily reset assets. 3) Floor Income: The timing and amount (if any) of Floor Income earned in our Lending operating segment is uncertain and in excess of expected spreads. Therefore, we exclude such income from Core Earnings when it is not economically hedged. We employ derivatives, primarily Floor Income Contracts and futures, to economically hedge Floor Income. As discussed above in Derivative Accounting, these derivatives do not qualify as effective accounting hedges, and therefore, under GAAP, they are marked to market through the gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net line in the consolidated statement of income with no offsetting gain or loss recorded for the economically hedged items. For Core Earnings, we reverse the fair value adjustments on the Floor Income Contracts and futures economically hedging Floor Income and include the amortization of net premiums received in income. 58 The following table summarizes the Floor Income adjustments in our Lending operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Core earnings Floor Income adjustments: Floor Income earned on Managed loans, net of payments on Floor Income Contracts $ $ $ 19 Amortization of net premiums on Floor Income Contracts and futures in net interest income (169 ) $ (209 ) $ (223 ) Total Core Earnings Floor Income adjustments $ (169 ) $ (209 ) $ (204 ) 4) Acquired intangibles: Our Core Earnings exclude goodwill and intangible impairment and the amortization of acquired intangibles. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, goodwill and intangible impairment and the amortization of acquired intangibles totaled $112 million, $94 million and $61 million, respectively. The changes from year to year are mostly due to the amounts of impairment recognized. In 2007, we recognized impairments related principally to our mortgage origination and mortgage purchased paper businesses including approximately $20 million of goodwill and $10 million of value attributed to certain banking relationships. In connection with our acquisition of Southwest Student Services Corporation and Washington Transferee Corporation, we acquired certain tax exempt bonds that enabled us to earn a 9.5 percent SAP rate on student loans funded by those bonds in indentured trusts. In 2007 and 2006, we recognized intangible impairments of $9 million and $21 million, respectively, due to changes in projected interest rates used to initially value the intangible asset and to a regulatory change that restricts the loans on which we are entitled to earn a 9.5 percent yield. LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENT In our Lending business segment, we originate and acquire federally guaranteed student loans, which are administered by the U.S. Department of Education (ED), and Private Education Loans, which are not federally or privately guaranteed. The majority of our Private Education Loans is made in conjunction with a FFELP Stafford loan and as a result is marketed through the same marketing channels as FFELP Stafford Loans. While FFELP student loans and Private Education Loans have different overall risk profiles due to the federal guarantee of the FFELP student loans, they share many of the same characteristics, such as similar repayment terms, the same marketing channel and sales force, and are serviced on the same servicing platform. Finally, where possible, the borrower receives a single bill for both the federally guaranteed and privately underwritten loans. The earnings growth in our Lending business segment is primarily derived from the growth in our Managed portfolio of student loans. In 2007, the total Managed portfolio grew by $21.5 billion (15 percent) from $142.1 billion at December 31, 2006 to $163.6 billion at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2007, our Managed FFELP student loan portfolio was $135.2 billion or 83 percent of our total Managed student loans. In addition, our Managed portfolio of Private Education Loans grew to $28.3 billion from $22.6 billion. Private Education Loans are not insured by the federal government and are underwritten in accordance with the Companys credit policies. Our Managed FFELP loans are high quality assets with minimal credit risk as they are guaranteed by the federal government for at least 97 percent. (See Item 1. Business BUSINESS SEGMENTS LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENT.) 59 The following table includes the Core Earnings results of operations for our Lending business segment.

In connection with the Merger Agreement, we increased our liquidity portfolio to higher than historical levels. The liquidity portfolio has a negative net interest margin, and as a result, the increase in this portfolio reduced net interest income by $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. 60 Summary of our Managed Student Loan Portfolio The following tables summarize the components of our Managed student loan portfolio and show the changing composition of our portfolio.

Student Loan Spread Analysis Core Earnings Basis The following table analyzes the earnings from our portfolio of Managed student loans on a Core Earnings basis (see BUSINESS SEGMENTS Limitations of Core Earnings Pre tax Differences between Core Earnings and GAAP by Business Segment). The Core Earnings Basis Student Loan Spread Analysis presentation and certain components used in the calculation differ from the On Balance Sheet Student Loan Spread Analysis presentation. The Core Earnings basis presentation, when compared to our on balance sheet presentation, is different in that it: includes the net interest margin related to our off balance sheet student loan securitization trusts. This includes any related fees or costs such as the Consolidation Loan Rebate Fees, premium/discount amortization and Repayment Borrower Benefits yield adjustments; includes the reclassification of certain derivative net settlement amounts. The net settlements on certain derivatives that do not qualify as SFAS No. 133 hedges are recorded as part of the gain (loss) on derivative and hedging activities, net line item in the consolidated statement of income and are 62 therefore not recognized in the student loan spread. Under this presentation, these gains and losses are reclassified to the income statement line item of the economically hedged item. For our Core Earnings basis student loan spread, this would primarily include: (a) reclassifying the net settlement amounts related to our written Floor Income Contracts to student loan interest income and (b) reclassifying the net settlement amounts related to certain of our basis swaps to debt interest expense; excludes unhedged Floor Income earned on the Managed student loan portfolio; and includes the amortization of upfront payments on Floor Income Contracts in student loan income that we believe are economically hedging the Floor Income. The student loan spread is highly susceptible to liquidity, funding and interest rate risk. These risks are discussed separately at LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES and in the RISK FACTORS discussion at the front of the document. As discussed above, these differences result in the Core Earnings basis student loan spread not being a GAAP basis presentation. Management relies on this measure to manage our Lending business segment. Specifically, management uses the Core Earnings basis student loan spread to evaluate the overall economic effect that certain factors have on our student loans either on or off balance sheet. These factors include the overall mix of student loans in our portfolio, acquisition costs, borrower benefits program costs, Floor Income and funding and hedging costs. Management believes that it is important to evaluate all of these factors on a Core Earnings basis to gain additional information about the economic effect of these factors on our student loans under management. Management believes that this additional information assists us in making strategic decisions about the Companys business model for the Lending business segment, including among other factors, how we acquire or originate student loans, how we fund acquisitions and originations, what borrower benefits we offer and what type of loans we purchase or originate. While management believes that the Core Earnings basis student loan spread is an important tool for evaluating the Companys performance for the reasons described above, it is subject to certain general and specific limitations that investors should carefully consider. See BUSINESS SEGMENTS Limitations of Core Earnings. One specific limitation is that the 63 Core Earnings basis student loan spread includes the spread on loans that we have sold to securitization trusts.

(2) The Interim ABCP Facility Fees are the commitment and liquidity fees related to a financing facility in connection with the Merger Agreement. (3) Core Earnings basis student loan spread, including the effect of Wholesale Consolidation Loans 1.67 % 1.84 % 1.78 % The Companys Core Earnings basis student loan spread before Interim ABCP Facility Fees and the effect of Wholesale Consolidation Loans decreased 7 basis points from the prior year primarily due to the interest income reserve on our Private Education Loans. We estimate the amount of Private Education Loan accrued interest on our balance sheet that is not reasonably expected to be collected in the future using a methodology consistent with the status based migration analysis used for the allowance for Private Education Loans. We use this estimate to offset accrued interest in the current period through a charge to student loan interest income. As our provision for loan losses increased significantly in 2007, we had a similar rise in the estimate of uncollectable accrued interest receivable. The Company experienced a higher cost of funds in 2007 primarily due to the disruption in the credit markets, as previously discussed. This was mostly offset by the growth in the Private Education Loan portfolio which earns a higher margin (before considering provision). The Companys Core Earnings basis student loan spread before Interim ABCP Facility Fees and the effect of Wholesale Consolidation Loans remained relatively consistent over all periods presented above, 64 excluding the impact of the interest reserving method discussed above. The primary drivers of changes in the spread are changes in portfolio composition, borrower benefits, premium amortization, and cost of funds. The FFELP loan spread declined over all periods presented above primarily due to increased cost of funds, Front End Borrower Benefits (Stafford), and a decline in hedged Floor Income (Consolidation). The Private Education Loan spreads before provision, excluding the impact of the interest reserving method discussed above, continued to increase due primarily to a change in the mix of the portfolio to more direct to consumer loans (Tuition Answer loans). The changes in the Private Education Loan spreads after provision for all periods was primarily due to the timing and amount of provision associated with our allowance for Private Education Loan Losses as discussed below in Private Education Loans. Floor Income Managed Basis The following table analyzes the ability of the FFELP student loans in our Managed student loan portfolio to earn Floor Income after December 31, 2007 and 2006, based on interest rates as of those dates.

When we securitize Private Education Loans, we no longer legally own the loans and they are accounted for off balance sheet. For our Managed presentation in the table above, when loans are securitized, we reduce the on balance sheet allowance for amounts previously provided and then provide for these loans off balance sheet with the total of both on and off balance sheet being the Managed allowance. When Private Education Loans in our securitized trusts settling before September 30, 2005, become 180 days delinquent, we typically exercise our contingent call option to repurchase these loans at par value out of the trust and record a loss for the difference in the par value paid and the fair market value of the loan at the time of purchase. If these loans reach the 212 day delinquency, a charge off for the remaining balance of the loan is triggered. On a Managed Basis, the losses recorded under GAAP for loans repurchased at day 180 66 are reversed and the full amount is charged off at day 212. We do not hold the contingent call option for any trusts settled after September 30, 2005. When measured as a percentage of ending loans in repayment, the off balance sheet allowance is lower than the on balance sheet percentage because of the different mix of loans on balance sheet and off balance sheet, as described above. Managed Basis Private Education Loan Loss Allowance Discussion As the Private Education Loan portfolio seasons and due to shifts in its mix and certain economic factors, we expected and have seen charge off rates increase from the historically low levels experienced in prior years. Additionally, this increase was significantly impacted by other factors. Toward the end of 2006 and through mid 2007, we experienced lower pre default collections, resulting in increased levels of charge off activity in our Private Education Loan portfolio. In the second half of 2006, we relocated responsibility for certain Private Education Loan collections from our Nevada call center to a new call center in Indiana. This transfer presented us with unexpected operational challenges that resulted in lower collections that have negatively impacted the Private Education Loan portfolio. In addition, in late 2006, we revised certain procedures, including our use of forbearance, to better optimize our long term collection strategies. These developments resulted in lower pre default collections, increased later stage delinquency levels and higher charge offs. Due to the remedial actions in place, we anticipate the negative trends caused by the operational difficulties will improve in 2008. In the fourth quarter of 2007 the Company recorded provision expense of $667 million related to the Managed Private Education Loan portfolio. This significant increase in provision primarily relates to the non traditional portion of our loan portfolio (education loans made to certain borrowers that have or are expected to have a high default rate) which the Company had been expanding over the past few years. The non traditional portfolio is particularly impacted by the weakening U.S. economy, as evidenced by recently released economic indicators, certain credit related trends in the Companys portfolio and a further tightening of forbearance practices. The Company has recently taken actions to terminate these non traditional loan programs because the performance of these loans is materially different from our original expectations and from the rest of the Companys Private Education Loan programs. The Company charges off loans after 212 days of delinquency. Accordingly, the Company believes that charge offs occurring late in 2007 represent losses incurred at the onset of the current economic downturn and do not incorporate the full effect of the general economic downturn that became evident in the fourth quarter of 2007. In addition, the Company has historically been able to mitigate its losses during varying economic environments through the use of forbearance and other collection management strategies. With the continued weakening of the U.S. economy, and the projected continued recessionary conditions, the Company believes that those strategies as they relate to the non traditional portion of the loan portfolio will not be as effective as they have been in the past. For these reasons, the Company recorded additional provision in the fourth quarter of 2007. 67 The following table provides the detail for the traditional and non traditional Managed Private Education Loans at December 31, 2007. As noted above, we have not used these terms in prior filings with the SEC in our Annual Report on Form 10 K and quarterly reports on Form 10 Q, but believe these new measures will provide additional information regarding the actual and projected performance of the Private Education Loan portfolios that include non traditional loans. Because we have not measured or reported the performance of our Managed Private Education Loans in terms of traditional and non traditional loans in the past, we have extrapolated the data for 2006 based upon our recent analyses solely for comparative purposes. 2007 2006 Non Non Traditional Traditional Total Traditional Traditional Total Ending total loans (before allowance) $ 25,092 $ 4,456 $ 29,548 $ 19,533 $ 3,449 $ 22,982 Private Education Loan allowance for losses 438 782 1,220 179 215 394 Net charge offs as a percentage of average loans in repayment 1.50 % 11.93 % 3.07 % .63 % 7.17 % 1.62 % Allowance as a percentage of total ending loan balance 1.75 % 17.56 % 4.13 % .91 % 6.24 % 1.71 % Allowance as a percentage of ending loans in repayment 3.45 % 36.30 % 8.21 % 1.82 % 11.82 % 3.38 % Average coverage of net charge offs 2.58 3.30 3.00 3.33 2.01 2.44 68 Private Education Loan Delinquencies The table below presents our Private Education Loan delinquency trends as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Delinquencies have the potential to adversely impact earnings as they are an initial indication of the borrowers potential to possibly default and as a result command a higher loan loss reserve than loans in current status. Delinquent loans also require increased servicing and collection efforts, resulting in higher operating costs.

Forbearance Managed Basis Private Education Loans Private Education Loans are made to parent and student borrowers in accordance with our underwriting policies. These loans generally supplement federally guaranteed student loans, which are subject to federal lending caps. Private Education Loans are not federally guaranteed or insured against any loss of principal or interest. Student borrowers use the proceeds of these loans to obtain higher education, which increases the likelihood of obtaining employment at higher income levels than would be available without the additional education. As a result, the borrowers repayment capability improves between the time the loan is made and the time they enter the post education work force. We generally allow the loan repayment period on most higher education Private Education Loans to begin six months after the borrower leaves school (consistent with our federally regulated FFELP loans). This provides the borrower time after graduation to obtain a job to service the debt. For borrowers that need more time or experience other hardships, we permit additional delays in payment or partial payments (both referred to as forbearances) when we believe additional time will improve the borrowers ability to repay the loan. Forbearance is also granted to borrowers who may experience 71 temporary hardship after entering repayment, when we believe that it will increase the likelihood of ultimate collection of the loan. Forbearance can be requested by the borrower or initiated by the Company and is granted within established policies that include limits on the number of forbearance months granted consecutively and limits on the total number of forbearance months granted over the life of the loan. In some instances of forbearance, we require good faith payments or continuing partial payments. Exceptions to forbearance policies are permitted in limited circumstances and only when such exceptions are judged to increase the likelihood of ultimate collection of the loan. Forbearance does not grant any reduction in the total repayment obligation (principal or interest) but does allow for the temporary cessation of borrower payments (on a prospective and or retroactive basis) or a reduction in monthly payments for an agreed period of time. The forbearance period extends the original term of the loan. While the loan is in forbearance, interest continues to accrue and is capitalized as principal upon the loan re entering repayment status. Loans exiting forbearance into repayment status are considered current regardless of their previous delinquency status. Forbearance is used most heavily immediately after the loan enters repayment. As indicated in the tables below that show the composition and status of the Managed Private Education Loan portfolio by number of months aged from the first date of repayment, the percentage of loans in forbearance decreases the longer the loans have been in repayment. At December 31, 2007, loans in forbearance as a percentage of loans in repayment and forbearance is 17.2 percent for loans that have been in repayment one to twenty four months. The percentage drops to 5.8 percent for loans that have been in repayment more than 48 months. Approximately 74 percent of our Managed Private Education Loans in forbearance have been in repayment less than 24 months. These borrowers are essentially extending their grace period as they transition to the workforce. Forbearance policies were tightened in late 2006 and again in late 2007. The increase in use of forbearance is attributed to both a weakening of the U.S. economy, as previously discussed, as well as improved borrower contact procedures. In the majority of situations forbearance continues to be a positive collection tool for Private Education Loans as we believe it can provide the borrower with sufficient time to obtain employment and income to support his or her obligation. Our experience has consistently shown that two years after being granted a first forbearance, close to 75 percent of the loans are current, paid in full, or receiving an in school grace or deferment, and only five percent have charged off. However, as discussed earlier, we believe that forbearance will be less effective for non traditional loans during a weakened U.S. economy. Loans in forbearance are reserved commensurate with the default expectation of this specific loan status. 72 The tables below show the composition and status of the Private Education Loan portfolio by number of months aged from the first date of repayment: Months Since Entering Repayment After 1 to 24 25 to 48 More than Dec. 31, months months 48 months 2007(1) Total December 31, 2007 Loans in school/grace/deferment $ $ $ $ 13,114 $ 13,114 Loans in forbearance 1,770 461 160 2,391 Loans in repayment current 7,885 3,348 2,406 13,639 Loans in repayment delinquent 31 60 days 277 145 86 508 Loans in repayment delinquent 61 90 days 144 78 38 260 Loans in repayment delinquent greater than 90 days 221 160 78 459 Total $ 10,297 $ 4,192 $ 2,768 $ 13,114 $ 30,371 Unamortized discount (823 ) Allowance for loan losses (1,220 ) Total Managed Private Education Loans, net $ 28,328 Loans in forbearance as a percentage of loans in repayment and forbearance 17.2 % 11.0 % 5.8 % % 13.9 % (1) Includes all loans in school/grace/deferment.

The 2007 FFELP provision included $30 million and $44 million for on balance sheet and Managed student loans, respectively, related to the repeal of the Exceptional Performer program (and the resulting increase in our Risk Sharing percentage) due to the passage of the CCRAA which was effective October 1, 2007. These amounts are additional, non recurring provision expenses required to cumulatively increase the allowance for loan losses for the increase in the Companys Risk Sharing percentage related to the Companys loans as of September 30, 2007. The 2007 FFELP provision also included $19 million and $27 million for on balance sheet student loans and Managed student loans, respectively, related to the increase in our default expectations due to an increase in recent delinquencies and charge offs. The remaining increase over 2006 primarily relates to an increased rate of provisioning for our Risk Sharing exposure in the post CCRAA environment, coupled with the growth of the portfolio. The increase in provisions related to mortgage and consumer loans primarily relates to a weakening U.S. economy and the deterioration of certain real estate markets related to our mortgage portfolio. As of December 31, 2007, our mortgage portfolio totaled $289 million. Total Loan Net Charge offs The following tables summarize the net charge offs for all loan types on balance sheet and on a Managed Basis for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

See Managed Basis Private Education Loan Loss Allowance Discussion for a discussion of net charge offs related to our Private Education Loans. Student Loan Premiums as a Percentage of Principal The following table presents student loan premiums paid as a percentage of the principal balance of student loans acquired for the respective periods. Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Volume Rate Volume Rate Volume Rate Student loan premiums paid: Sallie Mae brands $ 15,737 1.45 % $ 12,271 .94 % $ 8,430 .38 % Lender partners 9,728 2.92 11,738 1.97 12,463 1.77 Total Preferred Channel 25,465 2.01 24,009 1.44 20,893 1.21 Other purchases(1) 8,473 4.16 6,228 4.39 2,479 3.68 Subtotal base purchases 33,938 2.54 30,237 2.05 23,372 1.47 Consolidation originations 2,441 2.72 4,188 2.54 4,672 2.32 Total $ 36,379 2.56 % $ 34,425 2.11 % $ 28,044 1.61 % (1) Primarily includes spot purchases (including Wholesale Consolidation Loans), other commitment clients, and subsidiary acquisitions. The increase in premiums paid as a percentage of principal balance for Sallie Mae brands is primarily due to the increase in loans where we pay the origination fee and or federal default fee on behalf of borrowers, a practice we call zero fee lending. Premiums paid on lender partners were similarly impacted by zero fee lending. The borrower origination fee will be gradually phased out by the Reconciliation Legislation from 2007 to 2010. The other purchases category includes the acquisition of Wholesale Consolidation Loans which totaled $7.0 billion at an average premium percentage of 4.5 percent for the year ended December 31, 2007. Wholesale Consolidation Loans are discussed in more detail at Student Loan Spread Wholesale Consolidation Loans. Included in Consolidation originations is the .5 percent FFELP Consolidation Loan origination fee paid on the total balance of new FFELP Consolidation Loans made prior to October 1, 2007 (and 1.0 percent for FFELP Consolidation Loans made after October 1, 2007), including internally consolidated loans from our existing portfolio. The consolidation originations premium paid percentage is calculated on only consolidation volume that is incremental to our portfolio. This percentage is largely driven by the mix of internal consolidations. 79 Student Loan Acquisitions The following tables summarize the components of our student loan acquisition activity for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

This activity results in impairments of our Retained Interests in securitizations, but this is offset by an increase in on balance sheet interest earning assets, for which we do not record an offsetting gain. The following table includes on balance sheet asset information for our Lending business segment.

Preferred Channel Originations In 2007, we originated $25.5 billion in student loan volume through our Preferred Channel, a 9 percent increase over the $23.4 billion originated in 2006. In 2007, we grew the internal lending brand Preferred Channel Originations by 27 percent and our own brands now constitute 65 percent of our Preferred Channel Originations, up from 56 percent in 2006. At the same time, the JPMorgan Chase volume decreased by 41 percent and was 8 percent of our Preferred Channel Originations, down from 16 percent in 2005. The pipeline of loans that we currently service and are committed to purchase was $5.4 billion and $5.4 billion at 81 December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

(2) Represents FFELP/Stafford loans that we either own on balance sheet or in our off balance sheet securitization trusts that we consolidate. (3) The Total Managed Acquisitions line includes incremental consolidations from third parties and acquisitions. The increase in consolidations to third parties in 2006 reflects FFELP lenders reconsolidating FFELP Consolidation Loans using the Direct Loan program as a pass through entity, a practice which was severely restricted by The Higher Education Reconciliation Act of 2005 as of July 1, 2006. Additionally, the increases in 2006 and 2007 also reflect the effect of the repeal of the single holder rule, which was effective for 85 applications received on or after June 15, 2006. The single holder rule had previously required that when a lender held all of the FFELP Stafford loans of a particular borrower whose loans were held by a single lender, in most cases that borrower could only obtain a FFELP Consolidation Loan from that lender. During 2006, Private Education Loan consolidations were introduced as a separate product line. We expect this product line to grow in the future and will aggressively protect our portfolio against third party consolidation of Private Education Loans. Other Income Lending Business Segment The following table summarizes the components of other income, net, for our Lending business segment for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Late fees $ 134 $ 119 $ 96 Gains on sales of mortgages and other loan fees 11 15 18 Gains on sales of student loans 24 2 4 Leveraged lease impairment (39 ) Private Education Loan warehousing fees 2 16 12 Other 23 25 20 Total other income, net $ 194 $ 177 $ 111 The Company periodically sells student loans. The timing and amount of loan sales impacts the amount of recognized gains on sales of student loans. The decrease in Private Education Loan warehousing fees for the year ended December 31, 2007 versus the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, is primarily due to the shift of origination volume to Sallie Mae Bank. Prior to this shift, we earned servicing fees for originated Private Education Loans on behalf of third party lenders prior to our acquisition of those loans. The decline in this revenue stream is offset by capturing the net interest income earned by acquiring these loans earlier. The $39 million leveraged lease impairment in 2005 is for an aircraft leased to Northwest Airlines. At December 31, 2007, we had investments in leveraged and direct financing leases, net of impairments, totaling $100 million that are the general obligations of American Airlines and Federal Express Corporation. Based on an analysis of the potential losses on certain leveraged leases plus the increase in current tax obligations related to the forgiveness of debt obligations and or the taxable gain on the sale of the aircraft, our remaining after tax accounting exposure from our investment in leveraged leases was $63 million at December 31, 2007, of which $46 million relates to American Airlines. Operating Expenses Lending Business Segment The following table summarizes the components of operating expenses for our Lending business segment for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Sales and originations $ 351 $ 327 $ 285 Servicing 227 201 193 Corporate overhead 131 117 69 Total operating expenses $ 709 $ 645 $ 547 Operating expenses for our Lending business segment include costs incurred to service our Managed student loan portfolio and acquire student loans, as well as other general and administrative expenses. For the 86 years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, operating expenses for the Lending business segment also included $31 million and $34 million, respectively, of stock option compensation expense. 2007 versus 2006 Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007, increased by 10 percent to $709 million versus $645 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase is primarily due to increased consolidation and higher education sales and marketing expenses, Private Education Loan collection costs, and severance related expenses. 2006 versus 2005 Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006, increased by 18 percent to $645 million versus $547 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase is primarily due to sales and marketing expenses related to our direct to consumer initiatives and to higher sales expenses for higher education loan products. The increase was also due to an increase in origination and servicing costs, consistent with the increase in origination volume and the number of borrowers. In 2006, corporate overhead includes $34 million of stock option compensation expense, due to the implementation of SFAS No. 123(R). 87 ASSET PERFORMANCE GROUP (APG) BUSINESS SEGMENT In our APG business segment, we provide a wide range of accounts receivable and collections services including student loan default aversion services, defaulted student loan portfolio management services, contingency collections services for student loans and other asset classes, and accounts receivable management and collection for purchased portfolios of receivables that are delinquent or have been charged off by their original creditors as well as sub performing and non performing mortgage loans. In the purchased receivables business, we focus on a variety of consumer debt types with emphasis on charged off credit card receivables and distressed mortgage receivables. We purchase these portfolios at a discount to their face value, and then use both our internal collection operations coupled with third party collection agencies to maximize the recovery on these receivables. The private sector collections industry is highly fragmented with few large public companies and a large number of small scale privately held companies. The collections industry is highly competitive with credit card collections being the most competitive in both contingency collections and purchased paper activities. We are responding to these competitive challenges through enhanced servicing efficiencies and by continuing to build on customer relationships through value added services and financings. The following table includes the Core Earnings results of operations for our APG business segment. Condensed Statements of Income % Increase Years Ended (Decrease) December 31, 2007 vs. 2006 vs. 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 Contingency fee revenue 288 341 313 (16 )% 9 % Other fee income 48 56 47 (14 ) 19 Collections revenue 269 239 167 13 43 Total income 605 636 527 (5 ) 21 Operating expenses 390 358 288 9 24 Net interest expense 27 23 19 17 21 Income before income taxes and minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries 188 255 220 (26 ) 16 Income taxes 70 94 81 (26 ) 15 Income before minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries 118 161 139 (27 ) 16 Minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries 2 4 4 (50 ) Core Earnings net income $ 116 $ 157 $ 135 (26 )% 16 % Revenues from United Student Aid Funds, Inc. (USA Funds) represented 28 percent, 32 percent and 34 percent, respectively, of total APG revenue in 2007, 2006 and 2005. The percentage of revenue generated from services provided to USA Funds decreased due to the full year impact of recent acquisitions and the continued diversification into new asset classes in the purchased paper business. Contingency Fee Revenue The $53 million decrease in contingency fee revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 over 2006 was primarily due to a 2006 legislative change that reduced fees paid for collections via loan consolidation and direct collections. In addition, the 2006 legislation changed the policy governing rehabilitated loans by reducing the number of consecutive payments to qualify for a loan rehabilitation from twelve months to nine months. This accelerated process added approximately $36 million of incremental revenue in 2006. To a lesser extent, 2007 was negatively impacted by lower performance in default prevention. 88 The $28 million increase in contingency fee revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 over 2005 can be primarily attributed to a change in the federal regulations governing the rehabilitation loan policy along with the growth in guaranty agency collections. Under this change, the number of payments to qualify for a rehabilitated loan was reduced to nine months from twelve months, so all loans with nine to eleven consecutive payments at the time of change immediately qualified as a rehabilitated loan. Contingency Inventory The following table presents the outstanding inventory of receivables serviced through our APG business. These assets are not on our balance sheet. Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Contingency: Student loans $ 8,195 $ 6,971 $ 7,205 Other 1,509 1,667 2,178 Total $ 9,704 $ 8,638 $ 9,383 Purchased Paper The consistent increase in collections revenue for the years ended December 31, 2005 to 2007 was primarily due to the growth in purchased paper asset balances, resulting in an increase in yield income. Declines in real estate values and the weakening U.S. economy as well as lengthening the assumed lifetime collection period have resulted in write downs related to the mortgage purchased paper portfolio. Specifically, the mortgage purchased paper portfolio had impairments of $25 million and $8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. General economic uncertainty has also resulted in lengthening the assumed lifetime collection period related to our non mortgage, purchased paper portfolio. Our purchased paper collection business is comprised of the purchase of delinquent and charged off consumer receivables, primarily credit cards and the purchase of distressed mortgage receivables. Since these businesses operate in different segments of the marketplace with the primary distinguishing factor being the existence of collateral for the mortgage receivable, we have broken out their results separately in the presentations below. Purchased Paper Non Mortgage Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Face value of purchases for the period $ 6,111 $ 3,438 $ 2,826 Purchase price for the period 556 278 198 % of face value purchased 9.1 % 8.1 % 7.0 % Gross cash collections (GCC) $ 463 $ 348 $ 250 Collections revenue 217 199 157 Collections revenue as a % of GCC 47 % 56 % 63 % Carrying value of purchases $ 587 $ 274 $ 158 The amount of face value of purchases in any quarter is a function of a combination of factors including the amount of receivables available for purchase in the marketplace, average age of each portfolio, the asset class of the receivables, and competition in the marketplace. As a result, the percentage of face value purchased will vary from quarter to quarter. The decrease in collections revenue as a percentage of GCC versus the prior year can primarily be attributed to the increase in new portfolio purchases in the second half of 2007. Typically, revenue recognition based on a portfolios effective interest rate is a lower percentage of cash collections in the early stages of servicing a portfolio. 89 Purchased Paper Mortgage/Properties Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Face value of purchases for the period $ 1,307 $ 556 $ 165 Collections revenue, net of impairments 52 40 10 Collateral value of purchases 1,171 607 195 Purchase price for the period 855 462 141 Purchase price as a % of collateral value 73 % 76 % 72 % Carrying value of purchases $ 1,162 $ 518 $ 298 Carrying value of purchases as a % of collateral value 77 % 75 % 66 % The purchase price for sub performing and non performing mortgage loans is generally determined as a percentage of the underlying collateral, but we also consider a number of factors in pricing mortgage loan portfolios to attain a targeted yield. Therefore, the purchase price as a percentage of collateral value can fluctuate depending on the mix of sub performing versus non performing mortgages in the portfolio, the projected timeline to resolution of loans in the portfolio and the level of private mortgage insurance associated with particular assets. The increase in the Carrying value of purchases as a percentage of collateral value in the table above is reflective of the impact on the loan portion of year over year declines in real estate values in specific markets as well as a shift in the portfolio to a higher percentage of Real Estate Owned (REO) assets versus loans, due to current economic conditions. In relation to collateral value, REO assets are generally carried at a higher basis compared to loans, since a loan is adjusted, generally upward, to a collateral based fair value when it becomes REO. On August 31, 2005, we acquired 100 percent of GRP/AG Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively, GRP), a debt management company that acquires and manages portfolios of sub performing and non performing mortgage loans, substantially all of which are secured by one to four family residential real estate. GRP was purchased in August 2005, so the results for that year ended reflect only four months of activity. Operating Expenses APG Business Segment Operating expenses for the APG business segment for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 totaled: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Total operating expenses $ 390 $ 358 $ 288 Operating expenses increased by $32 million, or 9 percent, to $390 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase is primarily due to increased expenses for outsourced collections and overall growth in the purchased paper business. For the year ended December 31, 2007, operating expenses for this segment included $11 million of stock option compensation. The increase in 2006 operating expenses versus the prior year was primarily due to the increase in accounts serviced and to higher expenses for outsourced collections and recovery costs. Also, 2006 includes a full year of GRP expenses and $12 million of stock option compensation expense, due to the implementation of SFAS No. 123(R). At December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the APG business segment had total assets of $2.6 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. 90 CORPORATE AND OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENT Our Corporate and Other reportable segment reflects the aggregate activity of our smaller operating units including our Guarantor Servicing and Loan Servicing operating units,Upromise (acquired in August 2006), other products and services, as well as corporate expenses that do not pertain directly to our operating segments. In our Guarantor Servicing operating unit, we provide a full complement of administrative services to FFELP guarantors including guarantee issuance, processing, account maintenance, and guarantee fulfillment. In our Loan Servicing operating unit, we originate and service student loans on behalf of lenders who are unrelated to SLM Corporation. In our Upromise operating unit, we provide 529 college savings plan administration services and operate an affinity marketing program. Condensed Statements of Income Years Ended December 31, % Increase (Decrease) 2007 2006 2005 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 Net interest income (loss) after provisions for losses $ (1 ) $ (5 ) $ (1 ) 80 % 400 % Guarantor servicing fees 156 132 115 18 15 Loan servicing fees 23 29 44 (21 ) (34 ) Upromise 124 43 188 100 Other 71 83 81 (14 ) 2 Total other income 374 287 240 30 20 Operating expenses 341 250 235 36 6 Income before income taxes 32 32 4 700 Income tax expense 12 12 1 1,100 Core Earnings net income $ 20 $ 20 $ 3 % 567 % USA Funds, the nations largest guarantee agency, accounted for 86 percent, 83 percent, and 82 percent, respectively, of guarantor servicing fees and 16 percent, 25 percent, and 27 percent, respectively, of revenues associated with other products and services for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. 2007 versus 2006 The increase in guarantor servicing fees versus the year ago period was primarily due to the recognition of $15 million of previously deferred guarantee account maintenance fee revenue related to a negotiated settlement with USA Funds in the second quarter of 2006. The negotiated settlement with USA Funds would have resulted in the Company having to return the $15 million to USA Funds, if certain events occurred prior to December 31, 2007. These events did not occur prior to December 31, 2007, as stipulated in the negotiated settlement. As a result, all such contingencies were removed, resulting in the recognition of this deferred revenue in 2007. This amount is non recurring in nature. The increase in fees from Upromise for the year ended December 31, 2007 versus the year ago period was primarily due to the acquisition of Upromise in August 2006. 2006 versus 2005 The increase in guarantor servicing fees in 2006 versus 2005 is primarily due to a negotiated settlement with USA Funds such that USA Funds was able to pay account maintenance fees that were previously held up by the cap on payments from ED to guarantors in 2005. This cap was removed by legislation reauthorizing the student loan programs of the Higher Education Act on October 1, 2006. 91 Operating Expenses Corporate and Other Business Segment The following table summarizes the components of operating expenses for our Corporate and Other business segment. Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Operating expenses $ 109 $ 148 $ 149 Upromise 94 33 General and administrative expenses 138 69 86 Total $ 341 $ 250 $ 235 Operating expenses include direct costs incurred to perform guarantor servicing on behalf of guarantor agencies and to service loans for unrelated third parties, as well as information technology expenses related to these functions. General and administrative expenses include unallocated corporate overhead expenses for centralized headquarters functions such as executive management, accounting and finance, human resources and marketing. 2007 versus 2006 Operating expenses decreased $39 million in 2007 due primarily to the sale of the Noel Levitz subsidiary in the second half of 2007. General and administrative expenses increased $69 million in 2007 compared to the year ago period, primarily due to Merger related expenses of $56 million. In 2007, operating expenses in the Corporate and Other business segment include $15 million of stock option compensation expense, and a full year of expenses of Upromise, acquired in August 2006. 2006 versus 2005 In 2006, operating expenses in the Corporate and Other business segment include $17 million of stock option compensation expense, due to the implementation of SFAS No. 123(R) and the expenses of Upromise, acquired in August 2006. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is due to a $14 million net settlement in the College Loan Corporation (CLC) lawsuit and to lower corporate information technology expenses. At December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Corporate and Other business segment had total assets of $780 million, $999 million and $719 million, respectively. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Except in the case of acquisitions, which are discussed separately, our APG and Corporate and Other business segments are not capital intensive businesses and as such a minimal amount of debt and equity capital is allocated to these segments. Therefore, the following LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES discussion is concentrated on our Lending business segment. Prior to the announcement of the Merger, the Company funded its loan originations primarily with a combination of term asset backed securitizations and unsecured debt. Upon the announcement of the Merger on April 17, 2007, credit spreads on our unsecured debt widened considerably, significantly increasing our cost of accessing the unsecured debt markets. As a result, in the near term, we expect to fund our operations primarily through the issuance of student loan asset backed securities and secured student loan financing facilities, as further described below. We historically have been a regular issuer of term asset backed securities in the domestic and international capital markets. We securitized $25.4 billion in student loans in nine transactions in the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $32.1 billion in thirteen transactions in the year ago period. Secured borrowings, including securitizations, asset backed commercial paper (ABCP) borrowings and indentured trusts, comprised 75 percent of our Managed debt outstanding at December 31, 2007, versus 69 percent at December 31, 2006. 92 More recently, adverse conditions in the securitization markets increased the cost of borrowing in the market for student loan asset backed securities (ABS). In the third quarter of 2007, we completed one $2.5 billion securitization transaction, compared to four securitization transactions totaling $13.0 billion in the first quarter of 2007, the last full quarter before we entered into the Merger Agreement. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we completed three securitization transactions totaling $4.9 billion. Although we expect ABS financing to remain our primary source of funding, we expect our transaction volumes to be more limited and pricing less favorable than in the past, with significantly reduced opportunities to issue subordinated tranches of ABS. The Company has not recently and does not intend to rely on the auction rate securities market as a source of funding. At December 31, 2007, we had $3.3 billion of taxable and $1.7 billion of tax exempt auction rate securities outstanding on a Managed Basis. In February 2008, an imbalance of supply and demand in the auction rate securities market as a whole led to failures of the auctions pursuant to which certain of our auction rate securities interest rates are set. As a result, certain of our auction rate securities bear interest at the maximum rate allowable under their terms. The maximum allowable interest rate on our $3.3 billion of taxable auction rate securities is generally LIBOR plus 1.50 percent. The maximum allowable interest rate on many of our $1.7 billion of tax exempt auction rate securities was recently amended to LIBOR plus 2.00 percent through May 31, 2008. After May 31, 2008, the maximum allowable rate on these securities will revert to a formula driven rate, which, if in effect as of February 28, 2008, would have produced various maximum rates ranging from up to 5.26 percent. The Company is currently exploring various options to refinance its auction rate securities, if necessary. In the past, we employed reset rate note structures in conjunction with the issuance of certain tranches of our term asset backed securities. Reset rate notes are subject to periodic remarketing, at which time the interest rates on the reset rate notes are reset. In the event a reset rate note cannot be remarketed on its remarketing date, the interest rate generally steps up to and remains LIBOR plus 0.75 percent, until such time as the bonds are successfully remarketed. The Company also has the option to repurchase the reset rate note upon a failed remarketing and hold it as an investment until such time it can be remarketed. The Companys repurchase of a reset rate note requires additional funding, the availability and pricing of which may be less favorable to the Company than it was at the time the reset rate note was originally issued. As of December 31, 2007, on a Managed Basis, the Company had $2.6 billion, $2.1 billion and $2.5 billion of reset rate notes due to be remarketed in 2008, 2009 and 2010, and an additional $8.5 billion to be remarketed thereafter. In order to meet our financing needs, we are exploring other sources of funding, including unsecured debt, a financing source we have not used to fund our core businesses since the announcement of the Merger. We expect the terms and conditions of new unsecured debt issues, including pricing and covenant requirements, will be less favorable to us than our recent ABS financings and unsecured debt we incurred in the past. Our ability to access the unsecured debt market on attractive terms, or at all, will depend on our credit rating and prevailing market conditions. On April 30, 2007, in connection with the Merger Agreement, we entered into an aggregate interim $30.0 billion asset backed commercial paper conduit facilities (collectively, the Interim ABCP Facility) with Bank of America, N.A., and JPMorgan Chase, N.A., which provided us with significant additional liquidity. The Merger agreement contemplated a significant amount of whole loan sales as a main source of repayment for this Interim ABCP Facility. The Company has engaged J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc. (JPMorgan) and Banc of America Securities, LLC (BAS) as Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners along with Barclays Capital, The Royal Bank of Scotland, plc and Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. as Co Lead Arrangers and Credit Suisse, New York Branch, as Arranger to underwrite and arrange up to $28.0 billion of secured FFELP loan facilities and a $7.0 billion secured private credit student loans facility (together, the Facilities). On January 28, 2008, we announced that we had received commitments for $31.3 billion of 364 day financing from a consortium of banks led by Bank of America, N.A., JPMorgan Chase, N.A., Barclays Capital, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, and The Royal Bank of Scotland, and from UBS. Funding under the commitments is subject to various conditions. As of February 28, 2008, we anticipate closing on $23.4 billion of FFELP student loan ABCP conduit facilities 93 and $5.9 billion of Private Education Loan ABCP conduit facilities on February 29, 2008, or as soon as practical thereafter. Also on that date, we anticipate closing on an additional $2.0 billion secured FFELP loan facility. In addition, we anticipate closing on an additional $2.5 billion of student loan ABCP conduit facilities by mid March 2008. The new $33.8 billion of financing facilities we expect to close on, which may ultimately be increased to up to $35 billion in aggregate, will replace our $30 billion Interim ABCP Facility and $6 billion ABCP facility. The initial term of each of the new facilities will be 364 days. These new facilities will provide funding for certain of our FFELP loans and Private Education Loans until such time as these loans are refinanced in the term ABS markets. As part of this new financing arrangement, the lawsuit filed by the Company related to the Merger, as well as all counterclaims, was dismissed and the Merger Agreement was terminated on January 25, 2008. On February 14, 2008, we reached agreement with Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase to extend the date upon which outstanding advances under the $30.0 billion Interim ABCP Facility step up to a penalty rate. Under our agreement with Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, the step up date was extended from February 15, 2008 to a date that is the later to occur of (i) March 1, 2008 or (ii) if the Companys new ABCP facilities, also being arranged by Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, is closed prior to March 1, 2008, the date that is the earlier of (x) 15 Business Days after the date the initial advance is made under those new facilities and (y) 15 Business Days prior to April 24, 2008. In the event amounts outstanding under the Interim ABCP Facility are not repaid by the Company in full, the Interim ABCP Facility will terminate on April 24, 2008. During 2007, we also funded our liquidity needs through our existing $6.0 billion ABCP facility, our cash and investment portfolio and by selectively selling FFELP student loans in the secondary market. In addition, to supplement our funding sources, we maintain $6.5 billion in unsecured revolving credit facilities. We have not in the past relied upon, and do not expect to rely on, our unsecured revolving credit facilities as a primary source of liquidity. Although we have never borrowed under these facilities, they are available to be drawn upon for general corporate purposes. Our ability to access our unsecured revolving credit facilities will depend upon our ability to meet financial covenants set forth in the credit agreements, including a covenant to maintain consolidated tangible net worth of at least $1.38 billion, compliance with which will be affected by a variety of factors, including mark to market accounting adjustments applied principally to our derivatives and our residual interests in off balance sheet securitized loans. If we fail to comply with the consolidated tangible net worth covenant (or any other covenants) in our revolving credit facilities at that date or in the future, the banks party to the facilities (which include Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, as lenders and agents under the facilities) may elect to terminate their commitments, and if they did elect to terminate the facilities, our available liquidity could be materially impaired. Our tangible net worth for covenant purposes at December 31, 2007 was $3.5 billion. Beginning on November 29, 2007, the Company amended or closed out certain equity forward contracts. On December 19, 2007, the Company entered into a series of transactions with its equity forward counterparties and Citibank, N.A. (Citibank) to assign all of its remaining equity forward contracts, covering 44,039,890 shares, to Citibank. In connection with the assignment of the equity forward contracts, the Company and Citibank amended the terms of the equity forward contract to eliminate all stock price triggers (which had previously allowed the counterparty to terminate the contracts prior to their scheduled maturity date) and termination events based on the Companys credit ratings. The strike price of the equity forward contract on December 19, 2007, was $45.25 with a maturity date of February 22, 2008. The new Citibank equity forward contract was 100 percent collateralized with cash. On December 31, 2007, we closed public offerings of our common stock and 7.25 percent mandatory convertible preferred stock, Series C, resulting in total net proceeds of approximately $2.9 billion. We sold 101,781,170 shares of our common stock at a price of $19.65 per share and 1,000,000 shares of our 7.25 percent mandatory convertible preferred stock, Series C. Each share of mandatory convertible preferred stock, Series C, has a $1,000 liquidation preference and is subject to mandatory conversion on December 15, 2010, into between 41.7188 and 50.8906 shares of the companys common stock, unless previously converted 94 at the option of the holder. On January 9, 2008, we closed a second public offering of our 7.25 percent mandatory convertible preferred stock, Series C, as a result of the underwriters exercising their overallotment option. We sold 150,000 shares of the preferred stock related to this overallotment and the closing resulted in net proceeds of $145.5 million. We used approximately $2.0 billion of the net proceeds of the December 31, 2007 closings to settle our outstanding equity forward contract with Citibank and repurchase the 44,039,890 shares of common stock deliverable to us under the contract. On December 31, 2007, the Company and Citibank agreed to physically settle the contract and the Company paid Citibank approximately $1.1 billion, the difference between the contract purchase price and the previous market closing price on the 44 million shares. Consequently, the common shares outstanding and shareholders equity on the Companys year end balance sheet reflect the shares issued in the public offerings and the physical settlement of the equity forward contract. As of December 31, 2007, the 44 million shares under this equity forward contract are reflected in treasury stock. The Company paid Citibank the remaining balance of approximately $0.9 billion due under the contract on January 9, 2008. The Company now has no outstanding equity forward positions. The remaining proceeds from the public offerings were used for general corporate purposes. The following table details our primary sources of liquidity and the available capacity at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006. December 31, 2007 December 31, 2006 Available Capacity Available Capacity Sources of primary liquidity: Unrestricted cash and liquid investments: Cash and cash equivalents $ 7,582 $ 2,621 U.S. Treasury backed securities 643 1,098 Commercial paper and asset backed commercial paper 1,349 943 Certificates of deposit 600 Other 83 58 Total unrestricted cash and liquid investments(1) 10,257 4,720 Unused commercial paper and bank lines of credit 6,500 6,500 ABCP borrowing capacity 5,933 1,047 Interim ABCP Facility borrowing capacity 4,040 Total sources of primary liquidity 26,730 12,267 Sources of stand by liquidity: Unencumbered FFELP loans 18,731 28,070 Total sources of primary and stand by liquidity $ 45,461 $ 40,337 (1) Excludes $196 million and $365 million of investments pledged as collateral related to certain derivative positions and $93 million and $99 million of other non liquid investments classified at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively, as cash and investments on our balance sheet in accordance with GAAP. We believe our unencumbered FFELP loan portfolio provides a viable source of potential or stand by liquidity because of the well developed market for securitizations and whole loan sales of government guaranteed student loans. In addition to the assets listed in the table above, we hold on balance sheet a number of other unencumbered assets, consisting primarily of Private Education Loans, Retained Interests and other assets. At December 31, 2007, we had a total of $51.7 billion of unencumbered assets, including goodwill and acquired intangibles. In addition to liquidity, a major objective when financing our business is to minimize interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate and reset characteristics of our Managed assets and liabilities, generally on a pooled basis, to the extent practicable. In this process we use derivative financial instruments extensively to reduce our interest rate and foreign currency exposure. This interest rate risk management helps us to stabilize our student loan spread in various and changing interest rate environments. (See also RISKS Interest Rate Risk Management below.) 95 Managed Borrowings The following tables present the ending and average balances and average interest rates of our Managed borrowings for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. The average interest rates include derivatives that are economically hedging the underlying debt but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133.

In addition to the term issuances reflected in the table above, in the past we also used our commercial paper program for short term liquidity purposes. The average balance of commercial paper outstanding and the maximum daily amount outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $82 million and $2.2 billion, respectively. There was no commercial paper outstanding during 2007. Securitization Activities Securitization Program Our FFELP Stafford, Private Education Loan and FFELP Consolidation Loan securitizations are structured such that they are legal sales of assets using a two step transaction with a special purpose entity that legally isolates the transferred assets from the Company and its creditors, even in the event of bankruptcy. The holders of the beneficial interests issued by the special purpose entity are not constrained from pledging or exchanging their interests. In all of our securitizations, we retain the right to receive cash flows from the student loans and reserve accounts in excess of the amounts needed to pay servicing costs, derivative costs (if any), administration and other fees, and the principal and interest on the bonds backed by the student loans. The investors of the securitization trusts have no recourse to the Companys other assets should there be a failure of the securities backed by student loans to pay when due. Some of our securitizations meet the requirements for sale treatment under GAAP, according to the criteria of SFAS No. 140. In these transactions we use a two step sale to a qualifying special purpose entity (QSPE), such that we do not maintain effective control over the transferred assets. Accordingly, these transactions are accounted for off balance sheet. We recognize a gain on sales related to securitizations that qualify as off balance sheet transactions. The gain is calculated as the difference between the allocated cost basis of the assets sold and the relative fair value of the assets received. The carrying value of the student loan portfolio being securitized includes the applicable accrued interest, unamortized student loan premiums or discounts, loan loss reserves and Repayment Borrower Benefits reserves. The fair value of the Residual Interest is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology using assumptions discussed in more detail below. The ongoing earnings from our off balance sheet securitizations are recognized in servicing and securitization revenue. 97 The following table summarizes our securitization activity for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Those securitizations listed as sales are off balance sheet transactions and those listed as financings remain on balance sheet. Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Loan Loan Loan No. of Amount Pre Tax Gain No. of Amount Pre Tax Gain No. of Amount Pre Tax Gain Transactions Securitized Gain % Transactions Securitized Gain % Transactions Securitized Gain % (Dollars in millions) Securitizations sales: FFELP Stafford/PLUS loans $ $ % 2 $ 5,004 $ 17 .3 % 3 $ 6,533 $ 68 1.1 % FFELP Consolidation Loans 4 9,503 55 .6 2 4,011 31 .8 Private Education Loans 1 2,001 367 18.4 3 5,088 830 16.3 2 3,005 453 15.1 Total securitizations sales 1 2,001 $ 367 18.4 % 9 19,595 $ 902 4.6 % 7 13,549 $ 552 4.1 % Securitizations financings: FFELP Stafford/PLUS loans(1) 3 8,955 FFELP Consolidation Loans(1) 5 14,476 4 12,506 5 12,503 Total securitizations financings 8 23,431 4 12,506 5 12,503 Total securitizations 9 $ 25,432 13 $ 32,101 12 $ 26,052 (1) In certain securitizations there are terms within the deal structure that result in such securitizations not qualifying for sale treatment and accordingly, they are accounted for on balance sheet as variable interest entities (VIEs). Terms that prevent sale treatment include: (1) allowing the Company to hold certain rights that can affect the remarketing of certain bonds, (2) allowing the trust to enter into interest rate cap agreements after initial settlement of the securitization, which do not relate to the reissuance of third party beneficial interests or (3) allowing the Company to hold an unconditional call option related to a certain percentage of the securitized assets. The increase in the Private Education Loans gain as a percentage of loans securitized from 16.3 percent for the year ended December 31, 2006 to 18.4 percent for the year ended December 31, 2007 is primarily due to a higher spread earned on the assets securitized. The decrease in the FFELP Stafford/PLUS loans gain as a percentage of loans securitized from 1.1 percent for the year ended December 31, 2005 to .3 percent for the year ended December 31, 2006 is primarily due to: 1) an increase in the CPR assumption to account for continued high levels of FFELP Consolidation Loan activity; 2) an increase in the discount rate to reflect higher long term interest rates; 3) the re introduction of Risk Sharing with the Reconciliation Legislation during 2005 reauthorizing the student loan programs of the Higher Education Act; and 4) an increase in the amount of student loan premiums included in the carrying value of the loans sold. The higher premiums also affected FFELP Consolidation Loan securitizations and were primarily due to the securitization of loans previously acquired through business combinations. These loans carried higher premiums based on the allocation of the purchase price through purchase accounting. Higher premiums were also due to loans acquired through zero fee lending and the school as lender channels. 98 Residual Interest in Securitized Receivables The following tables summarize the fair value of our Residual Interests and the assumptions used to value such Residual Interests, along with the underlying off balance sheet student loans that relate to those securitizations in securitization transactions that were treated as sales as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. As of December 31, 2007 FFELP Consolidation Private Stafford and Loan Education (Dollars in millions) PLUS Trusts(1) Loan Trusts(5) Total Fair value of Residual Interests(2) $ 390 $ 730 $ 1,924 $ 3,044 Underlying securitized loan balance(3) 9,338 15,968 14,199 39,505 Weighted average life 2.7 yrs. 7.4 yrs. 7.0 yrs Prepayment speed (annual rate)(4) Interim status 0 % N/A 0 % Repayment status 0 37 % 3 8 % 1 30 % Life of loan repayment status 21 % 6 % 9 % Expected credit losses (% of student loan principal) .11 % .21 % 5.28 % Residual cash flows discount rate 12.0 % 9.8 % 12.9 % As of December 31, 2006 FFELP Consolidation Private Stafford and Loan Education (Dollars in millions) PLUS Trusts(1) Loan Trusts Total Fair value of Residual Interests(2) $ 701 $ 676 $ 1,965 $ 3,342 Underlying securitized loan balance(3) 14,794 17,817 13,222 45,833 Weighted average life 2.9 yrs. 7.3 yrs. 7.2 yrs Prepayment speed (annual rate)(4) Interim status 0 % n/a 0 % Repayment status 0 43 % 3 9 % 4 7 % Life of loan repayment status 24 % 6 % 6 % Expected credit losses (% of student loan principal) .06 % .07 % 4.36 % Residual cash flows discount rate 12.6 % 10.5 % 12.6 % (1) Includes $283 million and $151 million related to the fair value of the Embedded Floor Income as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Changes in the fair value of the Embedded Floor Income are primarily due to changes in the interest rates and the paydown of the underlying loans. (2) At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had unrealized gains (pre tax) in accumulated other comprehensive income of $301 million and $389 million, respectively, that related to the Residual Interests. (3) In addition to student loans in off balance sheet trusts, the Company had $65.5 billion and $48.6 billion of securitized student loans outstanding (face amount) as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, in on balance sheet FFELP loan securitization trusts. (4) Effective December 31, 2006, we implemented CPR curves for Residual Interest valuations that are based on the number of months since entering repayment that better reflect the CPR as the loan seasons. Under this methodology, a different CPR is applied to each year of a loans seasoning. Previously, we applied a CPR that was based on a static life of loan assumption, irrespective of seasoning, or, in the case of FFELP Stafford and PLUS loans, we used a vector approach in applying the CPR. The change in CPR methodology resulted in an immaterial change in the fair value of the Residual Interest. The CPR assumption used for all periods includes the impact of projected defaults. (5) The Company adopted SFAS No. 155, effective January 1, 2007. As a result, the Company elected to carry the Residual Interest on the Private Education Loan securitization which settled in the first quarter of 2007 at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in earnings. The fair value of this Residual Interest at December 31, 2007 was $363 million inclusive of a net $25 million fair value loss adjustment recorded since settlement. 99 Off Balance Sheet Net Assets The following table summarizes our off balance sheet net assets at December 31, 2007 and 2006 on a basis equivalent to our GAAP on balance sheet trusts, which presents the assets and liabilities in the off balance sheet trusts as if they were being accounted for on balance sheet rather than off balance sheet. This presentation, therefore, includes a theoretical calculation of the premiums on student loans, the allowance for loan losses, and the discounts and deferred financing costs on the debt. This presentation is not, nor is it intended to be, a liquidation basis of accounting. (See also LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENT Summary of our Managed Student Loan Portfolio Ending Balances (net of allowance for loan losses) and LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Managed Borrowings Ending Balances, earlier in this section.)

Interest income recognized on the Residual Interest is based on our anticipated yield determined by estimating future cash flows each quarter. 100 The following table summarizes the components of servicing and securitization revenue for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Servicing revenue $ 285 $ 336 $ 323 Securitization revenue, before Net Embedded Floor Income, impairment and unrealized fair value adjustment 419 368 270 Servicing and securitization revenue, before Net Embedded Floor Income, impairment and unrealized fair value adjustment 704 704 593 Embedded Floor Income 20 14 81 Less: Floor Income previously recognized in gain calculation (9 ) (8 ) (57 ) Net Embedded Floor Income 11 6 24 Servicing and securitization revenue, before impairment and unrealized fair value adjustment 715 710 617 Unrealized fair value adjustment(1) (24 ) Retained Interest impairment (254 ) (157 ) (260 ) Total servicing and securitization revenue $ 437 $ 553 $ 357 Average off balance sheet student loans $ 42,411 $ 46,336 $ 41,220 Average balance of Retained Interest $ 3,385 $ 3,101 $ 2,476 Servicing and securitization revenue as a percentage of the average balance of off balance sheet student loans (annualized) 1.03 % 1.19 % .87 % (1) The Company adopted SFAS No. 155 on January 1, 2007. SFAS No. 155 requires the Company to identify and bifurcate embedded derivatives from the Residual Interest. However, SFAS No. 155 does allow the Company to elect to carry the entire Residual Interest at fair value through earnings rather than bifurcate such embedded derivatives. For the off balance sheet securitizations that settled in the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company elected to carry the entire Residual Interest recorded at fair value through earnings. As a result of this election, all changes in the fair value of the Residual Interests for that securitization are recorded through earnings. Management anticipates electing to carry future Residual Interests at fair value through earnings. For securitizations settling prior to January 1, 2007, changes in the fair value of Residual Interest were recorded in other comprehensive income, unless impaired, for the years presented. Effective with the Companys adoption of SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115, the Company has elected the fair value option on all of its Residual Interests and will record future change in fair value through income beginning on January 1, 2008. Servicing and securitization revenue is primarily driven by the average balance of off balance sheet student loans, the amount of and the difference in the timing of Embedded Floor Income recognition on off balance sheet student loans, Retained Interest impairments, and the fair value adjustment related to those Residual Interests where the Company has elected to carry such Residual Interests at fair value through earnings under SFAS No. 155 as discussed in the above table. The increase in securitization revenue, before Net Embedded Floor Income, impairment and unrealized fair value adjustment, from 2005 to 2007, is primarily due to the continued increase in the amount of Private Education Loan Residual Interests as a percentage of the total Residual Interests. Private Education Loan Residual Interests generate a higher yield than FFELP loan Residual Interests. The Company recorded impairments to the Retained Interests of $254 million, $157 million and $260 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005. The impairment charges were the result of FFELP loans prepaying faster than projected through loan consolidations ($110 million, $104 million and $256 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively), impairment to the Floor Income component of the Companys Retained Interest due to increases in interest rates during the period ($24 million, $53 million and $4 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively), and increases in prepayments, defaults, and the discount rate related to Private Education Loans ($120 million for the year ended December 31, 2007). 101 The Company assessed the appropriateness of the current risk premium, which is added to the risk free rate, for the purpose of arriving at a discount rate in light of the current economic and credit uncertainty that exists in the market as of December 31, 2007. This discount rate is applied to the projected cash flows to arrive at a fair value representative of the current economic conditions. The Company increased the risk premium by 100 basis points (to LIBOR plus 850 basis points) to better take into account the current level of cash flow uncertainty and lack of liquidity that exists with the Private Education Residual Interests. During 2007, the Company increased its loan loss allowance related to the non traditional or higher risk loans within our Private Education Loan portfolio that the Company does not generally securitize. As a result, the Company does not expect the default rates used for the Residual Interest valuations to correspond with the expected default rates contemplated by the provision expense related to the non traditional Private Education Loans recorded in 2007. CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS The following table provides a summary of our obligations associated with long term notes and equity forward contracts at December 31, 2007. For further discussion of these obligations, see Note 8, Long Term Borrowings, Note 10, Derivative Financial Instruments, and Note 12, Stockholders Equity, to the consolidated financial statements. 1 Year 2 to 3 4 to 5 Over or Less Years Years 5 Years Total Long term notes(1)(2) $ 6,841 $ 27,090 $ 20,461 $ 53,000 $ 107,392 Equity forward contract(3) 865 865 Total contractual cash obligations $ 7,706 $ 27,090 $ 20,461 $ 53,000 $ 108,257 (1) Only includes principal obligations and specifically excludes SFAS No. 133 derivative market value adjustments of $3.7 billion for long term notes. (2) Includes Financial Interpretation (FIN) No. 46 long term beneficial interests of $68.1 billion of notes issued by consolidated variable interest entities in conjunction with our on balance sheet securitization transactions and included in long term notes in the consolidated balance sheet. Timing of obligations is estimated based on the Companys current projection of prepayment speeds of the securitized assets. (3) Includes remaining balance of equity forward contract paid to Citibank on January 9, 2008. The Company has no outstanding equity forward positions outstanding after the contract settlement on January 9, 2008. See Note 12, Stockholders Equity, to the consolidated financial statements. OFF BALANCE SHEET LENDING ARRANGEMENTS The following table summarizes the contractual amounts related to off balance sheet lending related financial instruments at December 31, 2007. 1 Year 2 to 3 4 to 5 Over or Less Years Years 5 Years Total Lines of credit $ 486 $ 1,350 $ 200 $ $ 2,036 We have issued lending related financial instruments including lines of credit to meet the financing needs of our customers. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk should the counterparty draw down the commitment and the counterparty subsequently fails to perform according to the terms of our contract. The remaining total contractual amount available to be borrowed under these commitments is $2.0 billion. We do not believe that these instruments are representative of our actual future credit exposure or funding requirements. To the extent that the lines of credit are drawn upon, the balance outstanding is collateralized by student loans. At December 31, 2007, draws on lines of credit were approximately $379 million, and are reflected in other loans in the consolidated balance sheet. For additional information, see Note 17, Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees, to the consolidated financial statements. The Company maintains forward contracts to purchase loans from our lending partners at contractual prices. These contracts typically have a maximum amount we are committed to buy, but lack a fixed or determinable amount as it ultimately is based on the lending partners origination activity. FFELP forward purchase contracts typically contain language relieving us of most of our responsibilities under the contract 102 due to, among other things, changes in student loan legislation. These commitments are not accounted for as derivatives under SFAS No. 133 as they do not meet the definition of a derivative due to the lack of a fixed and determinable purchase amount. As a result of the legislative changes effective October 1, 2007, we are currently reviewing our forward purchase contracts. At December 31, 2007, there were $5.4 billion originated loans (FFELP and Private Education Loans) in the pipeline that the Company is committed to purchase. RISKS Overview Managing risks is an essential part of successfully operating a financial services company. Our most prominent risk exposures are operational, market and interest rate, political and regulatory, liquidity, credit, and Consolidation Loan refinancing risk. We discuss these and other risks in the Risk Factors section (Item 1A) of this document. The discussion that follows enhances that disclosure by discussing the risk management strategies that we employ to mitigate these risks. Operational Risk Operational risk can result from regulatory compliance errors, servicing errors (see further discussion below), technology failures, breaches of the internal control system, and the risk of fraud or unauthorized transactions by employees or persons outside the Company. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards and contractual commitments, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. In addition, as described in BUSINESS Current Business Strategy, as a result of the CCRAA as well as the challenges we are facing in the capital markets, we aim to reduce our operating expenses by up to 20 percent as compared to 2007 operating expenses by year end 2009, before adjusting for growth and other investments. To date we have reduced our work force by approximately three percent. The federal guarantee on our student loans is conditioned on compliance with origination and servicing standards set by ED and guarantor agencies. A mitigating factor is our ability to cure servicing deficiencies and historically our losses have been small. Should we experience a high rate of servicing deficiencies, the cost of remedial servicing or the eventual losses on the student loans that are not cured could be material. Our servicing and operating processes are highly dependent on our information system infrastructure, and we face the risk of business disruption should there be extended failures of our information systems, any number of which could have a material impact on our business. To mitigate these risks we have a number of back up and recovery plans in the event of systems failures, which are regularly tested and monitored. We manage operational risk through our risk management and internal control processes, which involve each business line including independent cost centers, such as servicing, as well as executive management. The business lines have direct and primary responsibility and accountability for identifying, controlling, and monitoring operational risk, and each business line manager maintains a system of controls with the objective of providing proper transaction authorization and execution, proper system operations, safeguarding of assets from misuse or theft, and ensuring the reliability of financial and other data. We have centralized certain staff functions such as accounting, human resources and legal to further strengthen our operational controls. While we believe that we have designed effective methods to minimize operational risks, our operations remain vulnerable to natural disasters, human error, technology and communication system breakdowns and fraud. Market and Interest Rate Risk Market and interest rate risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices, interest rates, and or foreign currency exchange rates of our financial instruments. Our primary market risk is from changes in interest rates and interest spreads. We have an active interest rate risk management program that is designed to reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates and maintain consistent earning spreads in all interest rate environments. We use derivative instruments extensively to hedge our interest rate exposure, but there still is a risk that we are not hedging all potential interest rate exposures or that the hedges do not perform as designed. We measure interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for interest earning assets, interest bearing liabilities and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk. Many assumptions are utilized by management to calculate the 103 impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income, the more significant of which are related to student loan volumes and pricing, the timing of cash flows from our student loan portfolio, particularly the impact of Floor Income and the rate of student loan consolidations, basis risk, credit spreads and the maturity of our debt and derivatives. (See also Interest Rate Risk Management.) As discussed in more detail under BUSINESS SEGMENTS Limitations of Core Earnings, even though we believe our derivatives are economic hedges, some of them do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133. Therefore, changes in interest rates can cause volatility in those earnings for the market value of our derivatives. Under SFAS No. 133, these changes in derivative market values are recorded through earnings with no consideration for the corresponding change in the fair value of the hedged item. Changes in interest rates can also have a material effect on the amount of Floor Income earned in our student loan portfolio and the valuation of our Retained Interest asset. Our earnings can also be materially affected by changes in our estimate of the rate at which loans may prepay in our portfolios as measured by the CPR. The value of the Retained Interests on FFELP Stafford securitizations is particularly affected by the level of Consolidation Loan activity. We face a number of other challenges and risks that can materially affect our future results such as changes in: applicable laws and regulations, which may change the volume, average term, effective yields and refinancing options of student loans under the FFELP or provide advantages to competing FFELP and non FFELP loan providers; demand and competition for education financing; financing preferences of students and their families; borrower default rates on Private Education Loans; continued access to the capital markets for funding at favorable spreads particularly for our non federally insured Private Education Loan portfolio; and our operating execution and efficiencies, including errors, omissions, and effectiveness of internal control. Our foreign currency exchange rate exposure is primarily the result of foreign denominated liabilities issued by the Company. Cross currency interest rate swaps are used to lock in the exchange rate for the term of the liability. In addition, the Company has foreign exchange rate exposure as a result of international operations; however, the exposure is minimal at this time. Political/Regulatory Risk Because we operate in a federally sponsored loan program, we are subject to political and regulatory risk. The Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) which authorizes the FFELP, is subject to comprehensive reauthorization every five years and to frequent statutory and regulatory changes. Past changes included reduced loan yields paid to lenders in 1993 and 1998, increased fees paid by lenders in 1993, decreased level of the government guaranty in 1993 and reduced fees to guarantors and collectors, among others. The Secretary of Education oversees and implements the HEA and periodically issues regulations and interpretations that may impact our business. The HEA expired in 2003 and has since been extended by a series of temporary measures. Most recently, the Third Higher Education Extension Act of 2007 extended the HEA programs through March 31, 2008. The student loan programs under the HEA were reauthorized by the Higher Education Reconciliation Act (HERA), which was enacted February 8, 2006. In addition, the president signed into law the College Cost Reduction and Access Act (CCRAA) on September 27, 2007, and the Department of Education amended the FFELP regulations on November 1, 2007. The statutory and regulatory changes included in the above could have a material impact on the Company. See RECENT DEVELOPMENTS for additional discussion. Liquidity Risk (See LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES) Credit Risk We bear the full risk of borrower and closed school losses experienced in our Private Education Loan portfolio. These loans are underwritten and priced according to risk, generally determined by a commercially 104 available consumer credit scoring system, FICO. Because our borrowers often have limited repayment history on other loan products and the addition of our loans increases the debt burden of our borrowers, the origination of our loans generally results in an initial decrease in borrowers FICO scores. After this initial decrease, borrowers FICO scores will generally improve over time as the financial positions of our borrowers become more established and their repayment history on all loans becomes more seasoned. Additionally, for borrowers who do not meet our lending requirements or who desire more favorable terms, we generally require credit worthy cosigners. Our higher education Private Education Loans to students attending Title IV schools are not dischargeable in bankruptcy, except in certain limited circumstances. We have defined underwriting and collection policies, and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all Private Education Loans. Potential credit losses are considered in our risk based pricing model. The performance of the Private Education Loan portfolio may be affected by the economy, and a prolonged economic downturn may have an adverse effect on its credit performance. Management believes that it has provided sufficient allowances to cover the incurred losses estimated to be inherent in both the federally guaranteed and Private Education Loan portfolio. In addition, losses may be incurred for student borrowers who have not completed their education as a result of a drop out or a school closing, and who may have deferred repayment on all or on part of their loans. We have provided for these potential losses in our allowance for loan losses. There is, however, no guarantee that such allowances are sufficient enough to account for actual losses. (See LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENT Private Education Loans Activity in the Allowance for Private Education Loan Losses.) In limited instances in our Private Education Loan portfolio, we have third party guarantors or have entered into arrangements with schools whereby they bear a portion of the student loan default exposure. In these instances, we are exposed to credit risk related to these third parties. We perform financial performance reviews of these third parties upon entering agreements and monitor their financial performance on an ongoing basis. FFELP loans are guaranteed by state agencies or non profit companies called guarantors, with ED providing reinsurance to the guarantor. This guarantee generally covers 98 and 97 percent of the student loans principal and accrued interest for loans disbursed before and after July 1, 2006, respectively. As a result, we have credit exposure on FFELP loans for the remaining non guaranteed portion which is referred to as the Risk Sharing component. The performance of the FFELP loan portfolio may be affected by the economy, and a prolonged economic downturn may have an adverse effect on its payment performance. Management believes that it has provided sufficient allowances to cover the incurred losses estimated to be inherent in the FFELP loan portfolio. There is, however, no guarantee that such allowances are sufficient enough to account for actual losses. (See LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENT FFELP Loans.) We have credit risk exposure to the various counterparties with whom we have entered into derivative contracts. We review the credit standing of these companies. Our credit policies place limits on the amount of exposure we may take with any one party and in most cases, require collateral to secure the position. The credit risk associated with derivatives is measured based on the replacement cost should the counterparties with contracts in a gain position to the Company fail to perform under the terms of the contract. Credit risk in our investment portfolio is minimized by only investing in paper with highly rated issuers. Additionally, limits per issuer are determined by our internal credit and investment guidelines to limit our exposure to any one issuer. We also have credit risk with one commercial airline and Federal Express Corporation related to our portfolio of leveraged leases. Consolidation Loan Refinancing Risk The process of consolidating FFELP Stafford loans into FFELP Consolidation loans can have detrimental effects. Student loans in our portfolio can be consolidated away from us by other lenders at par. Additionally, FFELP Consolidation Loans have lower net yields than the FFELP Stafford loans they replace, which is somewhat offset by the longer average lives of FFELP Consolidation Loans. When FFELP Stafford loans in our securitization trusts consolidate, they are a prepayment for the trust. In periods of high consolidation activity, the prepayments can be greater than we have anticipated which can result in an impairment of our on balance sheet Retained Interest in those trusts due to its shorter life. See 105 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Effects of Consolidation Activity on Estimates. Also, we must maintain sufficient, short term liquidity to enable us to cost effectively refinance previously securitized FFELP loans as they are consolidated back on to our balance sheet. Interest Rate Risk Management Asset and Liability Funding Gap The tables below present our assets and liabilities (funding) arranged by underlying indices as of December 31, 2007. In the following GAAP presentation, the funding gap only includes derivatives that qualify as effective SFAS No. 133 hedges (those derivatives which are reflected in net interest margin, as opposed to those reflected in the gains/(losses) on derivatives and hedging activities, net line in the consolidated statement of income). The difference between the asset and the funding is the funding gap for the specified index. This represents our exposure to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk, which is the risk that the different indices may reset at different frequencies or may not move in the same direction or at the same magnitude. Management analyzes interest rate risk on a Managed basis, which consists of both on balance sheet and off balance sheet assets and liabilities and includes all derivatives that are economically hedging our debt whether they qualify as effective hedges under SFAS No. 133 or not. Accordingly, we are also presenting the asset and liability funding gap on a Managed basis in the table that follows the GAAP presentation. GAAP Basis Frequency of Index Variable Funding (Dollars in billions) Resets Assets Funding(1) Gap 3 month Commercial paper daily $ 98.6 $ $ 98.6 3 month Treasury bill weekly 7.8 .2 7.6 Prime annual .6 .6 Prime quarterly 1.5 1.5 Prime monthly 13.6 13.6 PLUS Index annual 1.6 1.6 3 month LIBOR daily 3 month LIBOR quarterly 1.0 104.0 (103.0 ) 1 month LIBOR(2) monthly .1 14.3 (14.2 ) CMT/CPI index monthly/quarterly 3.8 (3.8 ) Non Discrete reset(3) monthly 2.8 (2.8 ) Non Discrete reset(4) daily/weekly 14.0 16.5 (2.5 ) Fixed Rate(5) 16.8 14.0 2.8 Total $ 155.6 $ 155.6 $ (1) Funding includes all derivatives that qualify as hedges under SFAS No. 133. (2) Funding includes a portion of Interim ABCP Facility. (3) Funding includes auction rate securities. (4) Assets include restricted and non restricted cash equivalents and other overnight type instruments. Funding includes a portion of Interim ABCP Facility. (5) Assets include receivables and other assets (including Retained Interests, goodwill and acquired intangibles). Funding includes other liabilities and stockholders equity (excluding Series B Preferred Stock). The Funding Gaps in the above table are primarily interest rate mismatches in short term indices between our assets and liabilities. We address this issue typically through the use of basis swaps that typically convert quarterly 3 month LIBOR to other indices that are more correlated to our asset indices. These basis swaps do not qualify as effective hedges under SFAS No. 133 and as a result the effect on the funding index is not included in our interest margin and is therefore excluded from the GAAP presentation. 106 Managed Basis Frequency of Index Variable Funding (Dollars in billions) Resets Assets Funding(1) Gap 3 month Commercial paper daily $ 120.2 $ 12.1 $ 108.1 3 month Treasury bill weekly 11.2 9.6 1.6 Prime annual 1.0 .3 .7 Prime quarterly 7.0 6.0 1.0 Prime monthly 21.2 16.3 4.9 PLUS Index annual 2.6 2.6 3 month LIBOR(2) daily 104.4 (104.4 ) 3 month LIBOR quarterly .9 2.3 (1.4 ) 1 month LIBOR(3) monthly .1 9.6 (9.5 ) Non Discrete reset(4) monthly 2.5 (2.5 ) Non Discrete reset(5) daily/weekly 16.8 16.0 .8 Fixed Rate(6) 11.9 11.2 .7 Total $ 192.9 $ 192.9 $ (1) Funding includes all derivatives that management considers economic hedges of interest rate risk and reflects how we internally manage our interest rate exposure. (2) Funding includes $2.5 billion of auction rate securities. (3) Funding includes a portion of Interim ABCP Facility. (4) Funding includes auction rate securities. (5) Assets include restricted and non restricted cash equivalents and other overnight type instruments. Funding includes a portion of Interim ABCP Facility. (6) Assets include receivables and other assets (including Retained Interests, goodwill and acquired intangibles). Funding includes other liabilities and stockholders equity (excluding Series B Preferred Stock). To the extent possible, we generally fund our assets with debt (in combination with derivatives) that has the same underlying index (index type and index reset frequency). When it is more economical, we also fund our assets with debt that has a different index and or reset frequency than the asset, but only in instances where we believe there is a high degree of correlation between the interest rate movement of the two indices. For example, we use daily reset 3 month LIBOR to fund a large portion of our daily reset 3 month commercial paper indexed assets. In addition, we use quarterly reset 3 month LIBOR to fund a portion of our quarterly reset Prime rate indexed Private Education Loans. We also use our monthly Non Discrete reset and 1 month LIBOR funding (asset backed commercial paper program and auction rate securities) to fund various asset types. In using different index types and different index reset frequencies to fund our assets, we are exposed to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk, which is the risk that the different indices that may reset at different frequencies will not move in the same direction or at the same magnitude. While we believe that this risk is low as all of these indices are short term with rate movements that are highly correlated over a long period of time, market disruptions can lead to a temporary divergence between indices as was experienced in the second half of 2007 with the commercial paper and LIBOR indices. We use interest rate swaps and other derivatives to achieve our risk management objectives. When compared with the GAAP presentation, the Managed basis presentation includes all of our off balance sheet assets and funding, and also includes basis swaps that primarily convert quarterly 3 month LIBOR to other indices that are more correlated to our asset indices. 107 Weighted Average Life The following table reflects the weighted average life for our Managed earning assets and liabilities at December 31, 2007. On Balance Off Balance (Averages in Years) Sheet Sheet Managed Earning assets Student loans 9.0 6.0 8.9 Other loans 5.0 5.0 Cash and investments .2 .1 .2 Total earning assets 8.0 5.6 8.0 Borrowings Short term borrowings .2 .2 Long term borrowings 6.6 6.0 6.4 Total borrowings 5.0 6.0 5.2 Long term debt issuances likely to be called by us or putable by the investor have been categorized according to their call or put dates rather than their maturity dates. COMMON STOCK The following table summarizes the Companys common share repurchase, issuance and equity forward activity for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Years Ended December 31, (Shares in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Common shares repurchased: Open market 1.8 2.2 Equity forward contracts 4.2 5.4 17.3 Equity forward contracts agreed to be settled(1) 44.0 Benefit plans(2) 3.3 1.6 1.5 Total shares repurchased 53.3 9.2 18.8 Average purchase price per share(3) $ 44.59 $ 52.41 $ 49.94 Common shares issued 109.2 6.7 8.3 Equity forward contracts: Outstanding at beginning of period 48.2 42.7 42.8 New contracts 10.9 17.2 Settlements (4.2 ) (5.4 ) (17.3 ) Agreed to be settled(1) (44.0 ) Outstanding at end of period 48.2 42.7 Authority remaining at end of period to repurchase or enter into equity forwards 38.8 15.7 18.7 (1) On December 31, 2007, the Company and Citibank agreed to physically settle the contract as detailed below. Consequently, the common shares outstanding and shareholders equity on the Companys year end balance sheet reflect the physical settlement of the equity forward contract. As of December 31, 2007, the 44 million shares under this equity forward contract are reflected in treasury stock. (2) Shares withheld from stock option exercises and vesting of performance stock for employees tax withholding obligations and shares tendered by employees to satisfy option exercise costs. (3) For equity forward contracts, the average purchase price per share for 2005 is calculated based on the average strike price of all equity forward contracts including those whose strike prices were amended and were net settled in cashless transactions. There were no such cashless transactions in 2006 or 2007. 108 Beginning on November 29, 2007, the Company amended or closed out certain equity forward contracts. On December 19, 2007, the Company entered into a series of transactions with its equity forward counterparties and Citibank to assign all of its remaining equity forward contracts, covering 44,039,890 shares, to Citibank. In connection with the assignment of the equity forward contracts, the Company and Citibank amended the terms of the equity forward contract to eliminate all stock price triggers (which had previously allowed the counterparty to terminate the contracts prior to their scheduled maturity date) and termination events based on the Companys credit ratings. The strike price of the equity forward contract on December 19, 2007, was $45.25 with a maturity date of February 22, 2008. The new Citibank equity forward contract was 100 percent collateralized with cash. On December 31, 2007, the Company and Citibank agreed to physically settle the contract and the Company paid Citibank approximately $1.1 billion, the difference between the contract purchase price and the previous market closing price on the 44,039,890 shares. Consequently, the common shares outstanding and shareholders equity on the Companys year end balance sheet reflect the shares issued in the public offerings and the physical settlement of the equity forward contract. As of December 31, 2007, the 44 million shares under this equity forward contract are reflected in treasury stock. The Company paid Citibank the remaining balance of approximately $0.9 billion due under the contract on January 9, 2008. The Company now has no outstanding equity forward positions. On December 31, 2007, the Company issued 101,781,170 shares of its common stock at a price of $19.65 per share. Net proceeds from the sale, after deducting underwriting fees and other fees and expenses of the offering, were approximately $1.9 billion. The Company used approximately $2.0 billion of the net proceeds from the sale of Series C Preferred Stock and the sale of its common stock to settle its outstanding equity forward contract (see Note 12, Stockholders Equity, for further discussion). The remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. The Company issued 9,781,170 shares of the 102 million share offering from its treasury stock. These shares were removed from treasury stock at an average cost of $43.13, resulting in a $422 million decrease to the balance of treasury stock with an offsetting $235 million decrease to retained earnings. The closing price of the Companys common stock on December 31, 2007 was $20.14. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Higher Education Reauthorization On October 30, 2007, the House and Senate passed S. 2258, The Third Higher Education Extension Act of 2007, which extends the authorization of the Higher Education Act through March 31, 2008. The reauthorization of the Higher Education Act remains one of the outstanding issues for this Congress. On July 24, 2007, the Senate passed the full HEA reauthorization bill, S. 1642. The Senate bill includes some provisions that would affect the student loan programs. The Senate bill includes provisions that would regulate gifts, travel, entertainment, and services provided to institutions of higher education by guarantors and lenders. It includes new disclosure requirements on lenders and would prohibit schools from designating preferred lender lists. The Senate bill would allow schools to keep standard lists of lenders but would require the schools to include any lender on the list that requested inclusion. The bill would also eliminate school as lender, effective June 30, 2011. On February 7, 2008, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 4137, the College Opportunity and Affordability Act of 2007, its version of the Higher Education Act Reauthorization. The legislation includes the previously passed Student Loan Sunshine Act (H.R. 890). In addition, the House legislation includes provisions similar to Senate Banking Committee legislation, Private Student Loan Transparency, which provides for certain disclosures and prohibits certain activities in connection with Private Education Loans. Once House action is completed, it is expected that the House and Senate will resolve the differences between the two bills in conference committee and complete action on reauthorization prior to the expiration of the latest temporary extension. 109 Student Loan Sunshine Act On May 9, 2007, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 890, a bipartisan version of the Student Loan Sunshine Act. The bill would establish greater disclosure requirements on schools and lenders for both FFELP loans and Private Education Loans. The legislation would require higher education institutions to establish codes of conduct that would include prohibition on many areas that have been cited as creating conflicts of interest. Areas specified by the legislation include gifts, consulting or other fees paid by lenders to financial aid officers and other school officials, fees or other material benefits, including profit or revenue sharing to institutions or their staff, staffing assistance, opportunity loans, and advisory councils. The legislation would require that schools include at least three unaffiliated lenders on any Preferred Lender List and disclose the rationale for recommending such lenders. Private Student Loan Transparency and Improvement Act of 2007 On August 1, 2007, the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs approved the Private Student Loan Transparency and Improvement Act of 2007, legislation initially introduced by Senator Christopher Dodd (D CT) on June 8, 2007. The bill provides for certain disclosures and prohibits certain activities in connection with private education loans. The bills disclosure requirements would: Require all private education loan applications and solicitations to include a disclosure that includes the range of interest rates and fees available, in addition to other information regarding the terms and conditions of the loan; Require lenders to provide a clear and concise disclosure of the rate, terms and conditions of a private education loan that has been approved for a student borrower and provide borrowers with a cooling off period after the borrower receives the required disclosure documents within which to accept the terms of the loan and consummate the transaction; Provide for a right to cancel a private education loan without penalty within three business days of consummation; Require that private education lenders provide additional disclosures at the time of loan and its consummation; and Apply Truth in Lending Act (TILA) provisions to all private student loans. The bill would also prohibit: Private education lenders from offering or providing any gift to a covered educational institution or its employees and bar such institutions and their officers and employees from receiving such gift in exchange for any advantage or consideration provided to the lender related to its private education loan activities; Private education lenders from engaging in revenue sharing with a covered educational institution; Private education lenders from co branding their private education loans in any way that implies that the covered educational institution endorses the private education loans offered by the lender; Private education loan lenders from imposing a fee or penalty for early repayment or prepayment of any private education loans; and Financial aid office employees at covered educational institutions who serve on a private education lender advisory board from receiving anything of value from the private education lender other than the reimbursement of reasonable expenses incurred in connection with their service on the advisory board. 110 Other Legislative Developments On October 10, 2007, The House of Representatives passed H.R. 3056, the Tax Collection Responsibility Act of 2007. If enacted, this legislation would repeal the authority of the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) to contract with private collection agencies for certain federal tax collections. The Companys subsidiary, Pioneer Credit Recovery, is one of two agencies participating in the IRS pilot, testing the use of private collectors in improving federal tax collections. The Senate is not expected to act on corresponding repeal legislation this year. On December 17 18, 2007, the House and Senate passed an FY 2008 omnibus spending bill that did not eliminate or reduce funding for private debt collection, effectively keeping the program alive. Fee income generated from federal tax collections activity is currently de minimis to our APG business segment results of operations. Merger Related Developments On April 16, 2007, the Company announced that a buyer group (Buyer Group) led by J.C. Flowers Co. (J.C. Flowers), Bank of America, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase, N.A. signed a definitive agreement (Merger Agreement) to acquire the Company (the Merger) for approximately $25.3 billion or $60.00 per share of common stock. On January 25, 2008, the Company, Mustang Holding Company Inc. (Mustang Holding), Mustang Merger Sub, Inc. (Mustang Sub), J.C. Flowers, Bank of America, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. entered into a Settlement, Termination and Release Agreement (the Agreement). Under the Agreement, the lawsuit filed by the Company on October 8, 2007, related to the Merger, as well as all counterclaims, was dismissed and the Merger Agreement dated April 15, 2007, among the Company, Mustang Holding and Mustang Sub was terminated on January 25, 2008. Ratings Our management team intends to focus on maintaining, and ultimately improving, our credit ratings. Our credit ratings may affect, among other things, our cost of funding, especially in the unsecured debt markets, and, to a lesser extent, the volume and price of securitization transactions we can execute. Also, as discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors, a decrease in our credit ratings may affect the ability of counterparties to terminate our swap contracts. We cannot provide any assurance that our recent offerings of common stock and Series C preferred stock, or any other amount of equity capital will be sufficient to maintain our ratings at any particular level. We may issue additional equity in the form of common stock as we deem necessary to maintain, and ultimately improve, our credit ratings. Dividends We have not paid dividends on our common stock since the execution of the Merger Agreement with the Buyer Group in April 2007. While the restriction on the payment of dividends under the Merger Agreement has been terminated, we expect to continue not paying dividends in the near term in order to focus on balance sheet improvement and expect to re examine our dividend policy in the second half of 2008. Management Changes and Sales of Securities On December 12, 2007, the Company announced that Kevin F. Moehn, executive vice president, sales and originations, and June M. McCormack, executive vice president, servicing, technology and sales marketing, would be leaving the Company. On December 14, 2007, we announced that our Board of Directors added the Chief Executive Officer title and responsibilities to our Executive Chairman Albert L. Lord. C.E. Andrews, our previous CEO, assumed the role of President. On the same date, we announced we had opened our trading window for directors and executive officers for the first time since we commenced discussions with the Buyer Group in March 2007. Mr. Lord sold approximately 1.3 million shares of our common stock, or approximately 97 percent of the common stock that he owned before the sale, on the open market on December 14, 2007. Also on December 14, 2007, Mr. Charles 111 Daley, a director, sold approximately 80,023 shares of our common stock or approximately 68 percent of the common stock that he owned before the sale. Messrs. Lord and Daley have advised us that these actions were required under their respective borrowing arrangements. On December 19, 2007, the Corporation and Mr. Moehn agreed on the terms and conditions of a separation agreement. The material terms of the separation agreement are detailed in the Companys Form 8 K filed with the SEC on December 26, 2007. On December 22, 2007, the Company and Ms. McCormack agreed on the terms and conditions of a separation agreement. The material terms of the separation agreement are detailed in the Companys Form 8 K filed with the SEC on December 28, 2007. On January 7, 2008, the Board of Directors of the Company appointed Anthony P. Terracciano as Chairman of the Board. Mr. Terracciano was also appointed Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Board. Albert L. Lord was appointed Vice Chairman of the Board and its Executive Committee and continues to serve as Chief Executive Officer. In addition, the Board announced the appointment of John (Jack) F. Remondi as Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, effective January 8, 2008. On January 17, 2008, the SEC requested that the Company provide information and documents regarding disclosures and actions taken by the Company in December 2007 before and after stock sales of SLM Corporation common stock by Company directors and executives. We are cooperating with the SEC in order to provide the requested information and documents. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, Significant Accounting Policies Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements. 112 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis The effect of short term movements in interest rates on our results of operations and financial position has been limited through our interest rate risk management. The following tables summarize the effect on earnings for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 and the effect on fair values at December 31, 2007 and 2006, based upon a sensitivity analysis performed by management assuming a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of 100 basis points and 300 basis points while funding spreads remain constant. Additionally, as it relates to the effect on earnings, a sensitivity analysis was performed assuming the LIBOR index increased 25 basis points while other indices remained constant. Both of these analyses do not consider any potential impairment to our Residual Interests that may result from a higher discount rate that would be used to compute the present value of the cash flows if long term interest rates increased. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, Student Loan Securitization, which details the potential decrease to fair value that could occur.

However, as discussed under LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENT Summary of our Managed Student Loan Portfolio Floor Income, we can have a fixed versus floating mismatch in funding if the student loan earns at the fixed borrower rate and the funding remains floating. In addition, we can have a mismatch in the index of floating rate debt versus floating rate assets. During the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, certain FFELP student loans were earning Floor Income and we locked in a portion of that Floor Income through the use of futures and Floor Income Contracts. The result of these hedging transactions was to convert a portion of the fixed rate nature of student loans to variable rate, and to fix the relative spread between the student loan asset rate and the variable rate liability. In the above table, under the scenario where interest rates increase 100 and 300 basis points, the change in pre tax net income before the unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities is primarily due to the impact of (i) our off balance sheet hedged FFELP Consolidation Loan securitizations and the related 114 Embedded Floor Income recognized as part of the gain on sale, which results in a decrease in payments on the written Floor contracts that more than offset impairment losses on the Embedded Floor Income in the Residual Interest; (ii) our unhedged on balance sheet loans not currently having significant Floor Income due to a higher interest rate environment, which results in these loans being more variable rate; (iii) a portion of our fixed rate assets being funded with variable debt and (iv) a portion of our variable assets being funded with fixed debt. Items (i) and (iv) will generally cause income to increase when interest rates increase from a low interest rate environment, whereas, items (ii) and (iii) will generally offset this increase. In the 100 and 300 basis point scenario for the year ended December 31, 2007, items (i) and (iv) had a greater impact than item (ii) resulting in a net gain. Items (ii) and (iii) had a bigger impact in both scenarios than item (i) for the year ended December 31, 2006 due to the higher interest rate environment that existed. Under the scenario in the tables above, where the LIBOR index increases 25 basis points while other indices remain constant, the main driver of the decrease in pre tax income before unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities is the result of LIBOR based debt funding commercial paper indexed assets. See RISKS Interest Rate Risk Management Asset and Liability Funding Gap for a further discussion. In addition to interest rate risk addressed in the preceding tables, the Company is also exposed to risks related to foreign currency exchange rates. Foreign currency exchange risk is primarily the result of foreign denominated debt issued by the Company. As it relates to the Companys corporate unsecured and securitization debt programs used to fund the Companys business, the Companys policy is to use cross currency interest rate swaps to swap all foreign denominated debt payments (fixed and floating) to U.S. dollar LIBOR using a fixed exchange rate. In the tables above, there would be an immaterial impact on earnings if exchange rates were to decrease or increase, due to the terms of the hedging instrument and hedged items matching. The balance sheet interest bearing liabilities would be affected by a change in exchange rates, however, the change would be materially offset by the cross currency interest rate swaps in other assets or other liabilities. In addition, the Company has foreign exchange risk as a result of international operations, however, the exposure is minimal at this time.
