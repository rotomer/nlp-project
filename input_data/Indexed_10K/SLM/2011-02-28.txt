Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and in Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies. If we make incorrect assumptions or estimates, we may under or overstate reported financial results, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Political and Reputational. The scope and profitability of our lending businesses remain subject to risks arising from legislative and administrative actions. Through the HCERA, the U.S. Congress mandated that all future federally guaranteed student loans be made through the DSLP, eliminating the FFELP. Further legislative action by Congress could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For instance, the Presidents Fiscal 2012 Budget includes a provision that would, for a limited period of time, incent borrowers that have loans with the FFELP and DSLP to move their FFELP Loans to ED. While such consolidations have been permitted for some time, incentives such as these, if such a proposal were to be approved, could incrementally increase the rate at which borrowers might otherwise have moved certain FFELP Loans to ED and our future estimated cash flows and profitability from our FFELP Loan portfolios could be detrimentally affected. Likewise, additional restrictions or requirements imposed on private student lending could increase our costs, affect our ability to recover loans and materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in laws and regulations that affect the financial services industries generally have the potential to negatively impact our business and results of operations. As a non bank financial institution we are often subject to laws and regulations related to the broader financial services industry. For instance, the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 has the potential to significantly increase our costs of doing business or affect our relative competitiveness within our industry. For a more detailed description of the implications of this act, see below at Item 1A 13 Risk Factors Regulatory and Compliance. In 2010, we were anticipating the introduction of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) tax, which had the potential to significantly reduce our net income. The Presidents Fiscal 2012 Budget resubmits such a tax for Congress consideration. The passage of sweeping changes to the legal and regulatory environments in which we operate, including increases in taxation or fees charged on our business, have the potential to materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to continue to grow our businesses related to contracting with state and federal governments is partly reliant on our ability to remain compliant with the laws and regulations applicable to those contracts. We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations related to our government contracting businesses, including our contracts with ED. In addition, these government contracts are subject to termination rights, audits and investigations. If we were found in noncompliance with the contract provisions or applicable laws or regulations, or the government exercised its termination or other rights for that or other reasons, our reputation could be negatively affected, and our ability to compete for new contracts could be diminished. If this were to occur, the future prospects, revenues and results of operations of this portion of our business could be negatively affected. Competition. We operate in a competitive environment, and our product offerings are primarily concentrated in loan and savings products for higher education. We compete in the private credit lending business with banks and other consumer lending institutions, many with strong consumer brand name recognition. We compete based on our products, origination capability and customer service. To the extent our competitors compete aggressively or more effectively, we could lose market share to them or subject our existing loans to refinancing risk. In addition, there is a risk that any new education or loan products that we introduce will not be accepted in the marketplace. Our product offerings may not prove to be profitable and may fail to offset the loss of business in the education credit market. We are a leading provider of saving and paying for college products and programs. This concentration gives us a competitive advantage in the marketplace. This concentration also creates risks in our business, particularly in light of our concentration as a private credit lender and servicer for the FFELP and DSLP. If population demographics result in a decrease in college age individuals, if demand for higher education decreases, if the cost of attendance of higher education decreases, if public resistance to higher education costs increases, or if the demand for higher education loans decreases, our private credit lending business could be negatively affected. In addition, the federal government, through the DSLP, poses significant competition to our private credit loan products. If loan limits under the DSLP increase, as they did in late 2007 and 2008, DSLP loans could be more widely available to students and parents and DSLP loan limits could increase, resulting in a decrease in the size of the private credit education loan market and lessened demand for our private credit education loan products. Credit and Counterparty. Unexpected and sharp changes in the overall economic environment may negatively impact the performance of our loan and credit portfolios. Unexpected changes in the overall economic environment may result in the credit performance of our loan portfolio being materially different from what we expect. Our earnings are critically dependent on the evolving creditworthiness of our student loan customers. We maintain a reserve for credit losses based on expected future charge offs which considers many factors, including levels of past due loans and forbearances and expected economic conditions. However, managements determination of the appropriate reserve level may under or over estimate future losses. If the credit quality of our customer base materially decreases, if a market risk changes significantly, or if our reserves for credit losses are not adequate, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer. 14 In addition to the credit risk associated with our education loan customers, we are also subject to the creditworthiness of other third parties, including counterparties to our derivative transactions. For example, we have exposure to the financial condition of various lending, investment and derivative counterparties. If any of our counterparties is unable to perform its obligations, we could, depending on the type of counterparty arrangement, experience a loss of liquidity or an economic loss. In addition, we might not be able to cost effectively replace the derivative position depending on the type of derivative and the current economic environment, and thus be exposed to a greater level of interest rate and or foreign currency exchange rate risk which could lead to additional losses. Our counterparty exposure is more fully discussed in Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Counterparty Exposure. If our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer. Regulatory and Compliance. Our businesses are regulated by various state and federal laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in significant costs, sanctions, litigation or the loss of federal guarantees on affected FFELP Loans. Our businesses are subject to numerous state and federal laws and regulations and our failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in significant costs, including litigation costs, and or business sanctions. In addition, changes to such laws and regulations could adversely impact our business and results of operations if we are not able to adequately mitigate the impact of such changes. Our private credit lending and debt collection businesses are subject to regulation and oversight by various state and federal agencies, particularly in the area of consumer protection. Some state attorneys general have been active in this area of consumer protection regulation. We are subject, and may be subject in the future, to inquiries and audits from state and federal regulators as well as frequent litigation from private plaintiffs. The Bank is subject to state and FDIC regulation, oversight and regular examination. The FDIC and state regulators have the authority to impose fines, penalties or other limitations on the Banks operations should they conclude that its operations are not compliant with applicable laws and regulations. At the time of this filing, the Bank was the subject of a cease and desist order for weaknesses in its compliance function. While the issues addressed in the order have largely been remediated, the order has not yet been lifted. Our failure to comply with various laws and regulations or with the terms of the cease and desist order or to have issues raised during an examination could result in litigation expenses, fines, business sanctions, and limitations on our ability to fund our Private Education Loans, which are currently funded by deposits raised by the Bank, or restrictions on the operations of the Bank. The imposition of fines, penalties or other limitations on the Banks business could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Loans serviced under the FFELP are subject to the HEA and related regulations. Our servicing operations are designed and monitored to comply with the HEA, related regulations and program guidance; however ED could determine that we are not in compliance for a variety of reasons, including that we misinterpreted ED guidance or incorrectly applied the HEA and its related regulations or policies. Failure to comply could result in fines, the loss of the federal guarantees on affected FFELP Loans, expenses required to cure servicing deficiencies, suspension or termination of our right to participate as a servicer, negative publicity and potential legal claims. A summary of the FFELP, which indicates its complexity and frequent changes, may be found in Appendix A Federal Family Education Loan Program. The imposition of significant fines, the loss of federal guarantees on a material number of FFELP Loans, the incurrence of additional expenses and or the loss of our ability to participate as a FFELP servicer could individually or in the aggregate have a material, negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd Frank Act or the Act), legislation to reform and strengthen supervision of the 15 U.S. financial services industry. The Dodd Frank Act represents a comprehensive change to banking laws, imposing significant new regulation on almost every aspect of the U.S. financial services industry. The Dodd Frank Act will result in significant new regulation in key areas of our business and the markets in which we operate. Pursuant to the Act, we and many of our subsidiaries, including the Bank, will be subject to regulations promulgated by a new consumer protection bureau housed within the Federal Reserve System, known as the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (the Bureau). The Bureau will have substantial power to define the rights of consumers and responsibilities of lending institutions, including our Private Education lending and retail banking businesses. The Bureau will not examine the Bank, and the Banks primary regulator will remain the FDIC and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions. The U.S. Treasury Department has designated July 21, 2011 as the date upon which the Bureau will begin to exercise its authority. In addition, the act mandates the U.S. Secretary of Education to examine the private education loan market in the U.S. and provide a report to Congress by July 20, 2012. The Dodd Frank Act also provides that the newly established Financial Services Oversight Council (the FSOC) may designate that certain nonbank financial companies must be supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve Board) and be subject to enhanced prudential supervision and regulatory standards to be developed by the Federal Reserve Board. The FSOC may designate a nonbank financial company as systemically important if they find that material financial distress at the company or its nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or mix of activities could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States. Such enhanced standards will include, among other things, risk based capital and liquidity requirements, special regulatory and insolvency regimes, production of a resolution plan to cover potential insolvencies and may include such additional requirements on matters such as credit exposure concentrations. Most of the component parts of the Dodd Frank Act will be subject to intensive rulemaking and public comment over the coming months and we cannot predict the ultimate effect the Act or required examinations of the private education loan market could have on our operations or those of our subsidiaries, such as the Bank, at this time. It is likely, however, that operational expenses will increase if new or additional compliance requirements are imposed on our operations and our competitiveness could be significantly affected if we are subjected to supervision and regulatory standards not otherwise applicable to our competitors.

We are relocating our headquarters to Newark, Delaware from Reston, Virginia by March 31, 2011. 17 Item 3. Legal Proceedings Investor Litigation On January 31, 2008, a putative class action lawsuit was filed against us and certain officers in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. This case and other actions arising out of the same circumstances and alleged acts have been consolidated and are now identified as In Re SLM Corporation Securities Litigation. The case purports to be brought on behalf of those who acquired our common stock between January 18, 2007 and January 23, 2008 (the Securities Class Period). The complaint alleges that the Company and certain officers violated federal securities laws by issuing a series of materially false and misleading statements and that the statements had the effect of artificially inflating the market price for our securities. The complaint alleges that Defendants caused our results for year end 2006 and for the first quarter of 2007 to be materially misstated because we failed to adequately provide for loan losses, which overstated our net income, and that we failed to adequately disclose allegedly known trends and uncertainties with respect to our non traditional loan portfolio. On September 24, 2010, the court denied our motion to dismiss Mr. Albert Lord and the Company, but dismissed Mr. C.E. Andrews as a defendant in the action. The matter is now in the discovery phase. Lead Plaintiff seeks unspecified compensatory damages, attorneys fees, costs, and equitable and injunctive relief. A similar case is pending against the Company, certain officers, retirement plan fiduciaries, and the Board of Directors, In Re SLM Corporation ERISA Litigation, formerly in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and now before the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The case was originally filed on May 8, 2008 and the purported class consists of participants in or beneficiaries of the Sallie Mae 401(K) Retirement Savings Plan and Sallie Mae 401(k) Savings Plan (401K Plans) between January 18, 2007 and the present whose accounts included investments in our common stock (401K Class Period). The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties and prohibited transactions in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act arising out of alleged false and misleading public statements regarding our business made during the 401K Class Period and investments in our common stock by participants in the 401K Plans. On September 24, 2010, this case was dismissed; however, the Plaintiffs appealed. The appeal is pending. The Plaintiffs/Appellants seek unspecified damages, attorneys fees, costs, and equitable and injunctive relief. Lending and Collection Litigation and Investigations On July 15, 2009, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia unsealed the qui tam False Claims Act complaint of relator Sheldon Batiste, a former employee of SLM Financial Corporation (U.S. ex rel. Batiste v. SLM Corporation, et al.). The First Amended Complaint alleges that we violated the False Claims Act by our systemic failure to service loans and abide by forbearance regulations and our receipt of U.S. subsidies to which it was not entitled through the federally guaranteed student loan program, FFELP. No amount in controversy is specified, but the relator seeks treble actual damages, as well as civil monetary penalties on each of its claims. The U.S. Department of Justice declined intervention. Defendants filed their Motion to Dismiss on September 21, 2009. On September 24, 2010, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted our Motion to Dismiss in its entirety. On October 25, 2010, Plaintiff/Relator filed a Notice of Appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The appeal is pending. On February 2, 2010, a putative class action suit was filed by a borrower in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington (Mark A. Arthur et al. v. SLM Corporation). The suit complains that we allegedly contacted tens of thousands of consumers on their cellular telephones via autodialer without their prior express consent in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, 47 U.S.C. 227 et seq. (TCPA). Each violation under the TCPA provides for $500 in statutory damages ($1,500 if a willful violation is shown). Plaintiffs seek statutory damages, damages for willful violations, attorneys fees, costs, and injunctive relief. On April 5, 2010, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint changing the defendant from SLM Corporation to Sallie Mae, Inc. The parties in this matter have reached a tentative settlement which is subject to court approval and other conditions. On September 14, 2010, the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington agreed to Plaintiffs Motion for Preliminary Approval of Settlement Agreement. We have vigorously denied all claims asserted against us, but agreed to the settlement to avoid the burden and expense of 18 continued litigation. If the settlement receives final approval from the Court, settlement awards will be made to eligible class members on a claims made basis from a settlement fund of $19.5 million, and class members may opt out of certain calls to their cellular telephones. On January 21, 2011, and February 7, 2011, the Company filed submissions with the Court to advise that approximately 1.76 million individuals had been omitted from the original notice list for a total of approximately 6.6 million class members. In response, Class Counsel asked the Company to contribute additional unspecified amounts to the settlement fund. On February 10, 2011, the Court granted a Consented Motion to Stay Implementation of Settlement and Certain Deadlines. The Court ordered Class Counsel to file a status report on March 18, 2011. On February 10, 2011, Judith Harper filed a Motion to Intervene as Party Plaintiff, which the Court terminated on February 11, 2011 based upon the Courts February 10, 2011 Stay. On February 9, 2011, Ms. Harper filed a similar Class Action Complaint regarding the TCPA against Arrow Financial Services, LLC, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (the Harper case). On February 22, 2011, Arrow Financial Services, LLC filed a Motion to Stay Proceedings in the Harper case. That Motion is pending. On December 17, 2007, plaintiffs filed a complaint against us in Rodriguez v. SLM Corporation et al., in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut alleging that we engaged in underwriting practices which, among other things, resulted in certain applicants for student loans being directed into substandard and expensive loans on the basis of race. The complaint does not identify the relief plaintiffs seek. The court denied our Motion for Summary Judgment without prejudice on June 24, 2009. The Court granted Defendants partial Motion to Dismiss the Truth in Lending Act counts on November 10, 2009. The matter is now in the discovery phase. EDs Office of the Inspector General (OIG) commenced an audit regarding Special Allowance Payments on September 10, 2007. On August 3, 2009, we received the final audit report of the OIG related to our billing practices for Special Allowance Payments. Among other things, the OIG recommended that ED instruct us to return approximately $22 million in alleged special allowance overpayments. We continue to believe that our practices were consistent with longstanding ED guidance and all applicable rules and regulations and intend to continue disputing these findings. We provided our response to the Secretary on October 2, 2009 and we provided additional information to ED in 2010. The Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates also are subject to various claims, lawsuits and other actions that arise in the normal course of business. Most of these matters are claims by borrowers disputing the manner in which their loans have been processed or the accuracy of our reports to credit bureaus. In addition, our collections subsidiaries are routinely named in individual plaintiff or class action lawsuits in which the plaintiffs allege that those subsidiaries have violated a federal or state law in the process of collecting their accounts. We believe that these claims, lawsuits and other actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Finally, from time to time, the Company receives information and document requests from state attorneys general and Congressional committees concerning certain business practices. Our practice has been and continues to be to cooperate with the state attorneys general and Congressional committees and to be responsive to any such requests. Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders We did not submit any matters to a vote of security holders during the three months ended December 31, 2010. 19 PART II. Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Our common stock is listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol SLM. The number of holders of record of our common stock as of January 31, 2011 was 494. Because many shares of our common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of shareholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of beneficial owners represented by these record holders. The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices for our common stock for each full quarterly period within the two most recent fiscal years.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities The following table summarizes our common share repurchases during 2010. The only repurchases conducted by us during the period were in connection with the exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations and shares tendered by employees to satisfy option exercise costs (which combined totaled approximately 1.1 million shares for 2010) and not in connection with any authorized buyback program.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. This discussion and analysis also contains forward looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in Forward Looking and Cautionary Statements and Item 1A Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Through this discussion and analysis, we intend to provide the reader with some narrative context for how our management views our consolidated financial statements, additional context within which to assess our operating results, and information on the quality and variability of our earnings, liquidity and cash flows. Overview We provide Private Education Loans that help students and their families bridge the gap between family resources, federal loans, grants, student aid, scholarships, and the cost of a college education. We also provide savings products to help save for a college education. In addition we provide servicing and collection services on federal loans. We also offer servicing, collection and transaction support directly to colleges and universities in addition to the saving for college industry. Finally, we are the largest private owner of FFELP Loans. Effective July 1, 2010, HCERA legislation eliminated the authority to originate new loans under FFELP. Consequently, we no longer originate FFELP Loans. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2010 we changed the way we regularly monitor and assess our ongoing operations and results by realigning our business segments into four reportable segments: (1) FFELP Loans, (2) Consumer Lending, (3) Business Services and (4) Other. Management now views our business as consisting of three primary segments comprised of one runoff business (FFELP Loans) and two continuing growth businesses (Consumer Lending and Business Services). FFELP Loans Segment Our FFELP Loans segment consists of our $148.6 billion FFELP Loan portfolio and underlying debt and capital funding these loans. This includes the acquisition of loans from the Student Loan Corporation on December 31, 2010 (see Segment Earnings Summary Core Earnings Basis FFELP Loans Segment of this Item 7 for further discussion). Because we no longer originate FFELP Loans the portfolio is in runoff and is expected to amortize over approximately the next 25 years with a weighted average remaining life of 7.7 years. We actively seek to acquire FFELP Loan portfolios to leverage our servicing scale and expertise to generate incremental earnings and cash flow to create additional shareholder value. Of our total FFELP Loan portfolio, 77 percent was funded to term through securitization trusts, 16 percent was funded through the ED Conduit Program which terminates on January 19, 2014, 5 percent was funded in our multi year ABCP facility and FHLB DM facility, and the remainder was funded with unsecured debt. It is expected to generate a stable net interest margin and significant amounts of cash as the portfolio amortizes. Consumer Lending Segment In our Consumer Lending segment we originate, acquire, finance and service Private Education Loans. As of December 31, 2010 we had $35.7 billion of Private Education Loans outstanding. In 2010 we originated $2.3 billion of Private Education Loans, down from $3.2 billion in the prior year. We provide Private Education Loans to students and their families to help them pay for a college education. We provide loans through the financial aid office, direct to consumer and through referral and partner lenders. We also provide savings products, primarily in the form of retail deposits, to help customers save for a college education (we refer to this as our Direct Banking business line). Business Services Segment In our Business Services segment we provide loan servicing to our FFELP Loans segment, ED and other third parties. We provide default aversion work and contingency collections on behalf of Guarantors, colleges and ED. We also perform Campus Payment Solutions, account asset servicing and transaction processing activities. Other Our Other segment primarily consists of the financial results related to the repurchase of debt, the corporate liquidity portfolio and all overhead. We also include results from smaller wind down and discontinued operations within this segment. 23 The following table shows how we realigned our old reportable segments existing prior to the fourth quarter of 2010 into our new business lines as part of the change in business segments discussed above. Business Lines/Activities New Business Segment Prior Business Segment FFELP Loan business FFELP Loans Lending Private Education Loan business Consumer Lending Lending Direct Banking Consumer Lending Lending Intercompany servicing of FFELP Loans Business Services Lending FFELP Loan default aversion services Business Services APG FFELP defaulted loan portfolio management services Business Services APG FFELP Guarantor servicing Business Services Other Contingency collections Business Services APG Third party loan servicing Business Services Other ED loan servicing Business Services Other Upromise Business Services Other Campus Payment Solutions Business Services Other Purchased Paper Non Mortgage Other APG Purchased Paper Mortgage/Properties Other APG Mortgage and other loans Other Lending Debt repurchase gains Other Lending Corporate liquidity portfolio Other Lending Overhead expenses Other Lending, APG and Other Key Financial Measures Our operating results are primarily driven by net interest income from our student loan portfolios, provision for loan losses, financing costs, costs necessary to generate new assets, the revenues and expenses generated by our service businesses and gains and losses on loan sales, debt repurchases and derivatives. We manage and assess the performance of each business segment separately as each is focused on different customer bases and derive their revenue from different activities and services. A brief summary of our key financial measures are listed below. Net Interest Income The most significant portion of our earnings are generated by the spread earned between the interest revenue we receive on assets in our student loan portfolios and the interest cost of funding these loans. We report these earnings as net interest income. Net interest income in our FFELP Loans and Consumer Lending segments are driven by significantly different factors. FFELP Loans Segment Net interest income will be the primary source of cash flow generated by this segment as the portfolio runs off and we will no longer generate revenues from new originations. We may continue to acquire existing portfolios of FFELP Loans from third parties. We would expect any acquisitions to be accretive. The FFELP Loans segments net interest margin was 93 basis points in 2010 compared with 67 basis points in 2009. The major sources of variability in net interest margin are expected to be the CP/LIBOR spread and Floor Income. We refer to the spread between the Federal Reserves 3 month financial commercial paper index (CP) and 3 month LIBOR as the CP/LIBOR spread. Interest earned on our FFELP Loan assets are indexed primarily to CP and interest paid on their related funding liabilities are primarily indexed to 3 month LIBOR. Movements in the CP and 3 month LIBOR rates expand or contract the CP/LIBOR spread and our net interest income decreases or increases as a result. During the capital markets turmoil of recent years, the CP/LIBOR spread has suffered dramatic fluctuations that have negatively affected net interest income significantly. For 2010, the average CP/LIBOR spread returned to historical levels. Pursuant to the terms of the FFELP, certain FFELP Loans, in certain situations, continue to earn interest at the stated fixed rate of interest even if underlying debt costs decrease. We refer to this additional spread 24 income as Floor Income. This Floor Income can be volatile as rates on underlying debt move up and down. We will generally hedge this risk by selling Floor Income Contracts which lock in the value of the Floor Income over the term of the contract. Additional cash flow should be generated within this segment as many of our secured financing vehicles are over collateralized, creating the potential for additional cash flow to be distributed to us over time as the loans amortize. Consumer Lending Segment We expect to grow our Private Education Loan portfolio primarily through our school and direct to consumer channels. Net interest income in this segment is determined by the Private Education Loan asset yields, which are determined by interest rates established by us based upon the credit of the borrower and any co borrower, the level of price competition in the Private Education Loan market and our cost of funds. Our cost of funds can be influenced by a number of factors including the quality of the loans in our portfolio, our corporate credit rating, general economic conditions, investor demand for ABS and corporate unsecured debt and competition in the deposit market. Loans are priced to anticipate our cost of funds and expected charge off rate over the life of the loans. Our Private Education Loans earn variable rate interest and are funded primarily with variable rate liabilities. The Consumer Lending segments net interest margin was 3.85 percent in 2010 and 2009. Provision For Loan Losses Management estimates and maintains an allowance for loan losses equal to charge offs expected over the next two years. The provision is an income statement item that reduces segment revenues. Generally the allowance rises when charge offs are expected to increase and falls when charge offs are expected to decline. Our loss exposure and resulting provision for losses is smaller for FFELP Loans than for Private Education Loans because we bear a maximum of 3 percent loss exposure on FFELP Loans. Our provision for losses in our FFELP Loans segment was $98 million in 2010 compared with $119 million in 2009. Our loss exposure and resulting provision in our Consumer Lending segment is much greater than our FFELP Loans segment. Losses in our Consumer Lending segment are primarily driven by risk characteristics such as loan program type, school type, loan status (in school, grace, forbearance, repayment and delinquency), seasoning (number of months in active repayment for which a scheduled payment was due), underwriting criteria (e.g., credit scores), existence or absence of a cosigner and the current economic environment. Our provision for loan losses in our Consumer Lending segment was $1.298 billion in 2010 compared with $1.399 billion in 2009. Charge Offs and Delinquencies When we conclude a loan is uncollectable (from the borrower or Guarantor), the unrecoverable portion of the loan is charged against the allowance for loan losses in the relevant lending segment. Information regarding charge offs provides relevant information over time with respect to the actual performance of our loan portfolios as compared against the provisions for loan losses on those portfolios. The Consumer Lending segments charge off rate was 5 percent of loans in 2010 compared with 6 percent in 2009. Delinquencies are a very important indicator of the potential future credit performance. Management focuses on the overall level of delinquencies as well as the progression of loans from early to late stage delinquency. Core Earnings basis Private Education Loan delinquencies as a percentage of Private Education Loans in repayment decreased from 12.1 percent at December 31, 2009 to 10.6 percent at December 31, 2010. Servicing and Contingency Revenues We earn servicing revenues from servicing student loans, Campus Payment Solutions, and from account asset servicing related to 529 college savings plans. We earn contingency revenue related to default aversion and contingency collections work we do primarily on federal loans. The fees we recognize are primarily driven by our success in collecting or rehabilitating defaulted loans, the number of transactions processed and the underlying volume of loans we are servicing on behalf of others. 25 Other Income/(Loss) In managing our loan portfolios and funding sources we periodically engage in sales of loans and the repurchase of our outstanding debt. In each case, depending on market conditions, we may incur gains or losses from these transactions that affect our results from operations. We also recognize gains and losses in accordance with GAAP on our derivative and hedging activities from the changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and ineffectiveness on derivatives that do qualify for hedge accounting. Operating Expenses The operating expenses reported for our Consumer Lending and Business Services segments are those that are directly attributable to the generation of revenues by those segments. The operating expenses for the FFELP Loans segment primarily represent an intercompany servicing charge from the Business Services segment and do not reflect our actual underlying costs incurred to service the loans. We have included corporate overhead expenses and certain information technology costs (together referred to as Overhead) in our Other segment rather than allocate those expenses by segment. These overhead expenses include costs related to executive management, the board of directors, accounting, finance, legal, human resources, stock option expense and certain information technology costs related to infrastructure and operations. Core Earnings Management uses Core Earnings as the primary financial performance measure to evaluate performance and to allocate resources. Core Earnings is the basis in which we prepare our segment disclosures as required by GAAP under ASC 280 Segment Reporting (see Note 19 Segment Reporting). For a full explanation of the contents and limitations of Core Earnings see Core Earnings Definition and Limitations of this Item 7. 2010 Summary We overcame considerable challenges and achieved significant accomplishments in 2010. We continue to operate in an extremely challenging macroeconomic environment marked by high unemployment and periods of extreme illiquidity in the capital markets. Effective July 1, 2010, HCERA eliminated FFELP Loan originations, a major source of our net income. As a result, we will no longer have revenue related to FFELP Loan originations and will have declining net income related to our portfolio of FFELP Loans and related FFELP Loan servicing and collections activities. HCERA does not alter or affect the terms and conditions of our existing FFELP Loans. Net interest income we earn on our FFELP Loan portfolio will decline over time as the portfolio amortizes. We will no longer earn any origination fees for originating FFELP Loans (which was $34 million in 2010) and the Guarantor maintenance fees (which was $56 million in 2010) will decline as the portfolio pays down. In addition, we earned $245 million in FFELP contingency revenue in 2010, which we expect to remain relatively stable through 2012 and then steadily decline as the portfolio of defaulted FFELP Loans we manage is resolved and amortizes. In response to these legislative and economic challenges we explored splitting the Company into two publicly traded companies, representing our runoff and growth businesses. We also explored selling our residual interests in our securitized FFELP Loans to effectively remove the securitized loans from our balance sheet. After evaluating both strategies we determined that neither strategy currently provides better economic returns to investors than our current operating structure. On December 31, 2010, we closed on our agreement to purchase the $26.1 billion of securitized federal loans and related assets from the Student Loan Corporation. This transaction will be accretive to 2011 earnings and beyond. We continue to seek to acquire FFELP Loan portfolios. Despite the economic environment, we saw significant improvements in the quality of our lending business segments. 26 At the end of the year, our FFELP Loan portfolio was 93 percent funded to term with long term liabilities including the ED sponsored Straight A conduit. We also completed $2 billion of FFELP Loan asset backed securitization transactions in 2010. The net interest margin in our FFELP Loans segment improved to 93 basis points in 2010 from 67 basis points in 2009 as the CP/LIBOR spread returned to historical levels. In addition, we sold $20.4 billion of loans to ED in 2010 resulting in gains of $321 million. In our Private Education Loan portfolio, delinquencies greater than 90 days trended lower throughout the year to 5.3 percent of loans in repayment at year end compared to 6.4 percent of loans in repayment at the end of the first quarter of the year. The quarterly provision for loan losses ended the year at $294 million, down from the second quarter 2010 peak of $349 million. Private Education Loan originations improved over the course of 2010 as well. After falling more than 40 percent in each of the first two quarters of the year compared with the year ago quarters they fell just 6 percent in the third quarter and increased 8 percent in the fourth quarter. We completed $4.1 billion of Private Education Loan asset backed securitization transactions in 2010. The Consumer Lending segment returned to profitability in 2010 after posting a loss in the prior year. In our Business Services segment, we saw increased revenue in our third party servicing, contingency collections and account asset servicing lines of business. We decided to discontinue our Purchased Paper collection business at the end of 2010. In response to the elimination of FFELP, in 2010 we expanded an ongoing operating expense reduction initiative, including closing our Florida and Texas servicing centers and relocating our headquarters to Newark, Delaware by March 31, 2011. Core Earnings improved significantly to $1 billion from $807 million in the prior year. This was due to a number of factors including lower provision for loan losses, and a higher net interest margin. In 2010 we issued $1.5 billion of 10 year unsecured debt and repurchased $4.9 billion of unsecured debt. Combined with our asset backed securitization transactions, these actions significantly improved the overall maturity profile of our outstanding debt. 2011 Outlook We do not expect the economic environment to improve significantly in 2011. A high unemployment rate is expected to result in a challenging environment for financial services companies such as ours. We expect our Core Earnings business results to improve principally due to the significant improvement in the quality of our Private Education Loan portfolio. Increases in the cost of attaining a higher education and enrollments should drive increased volume in our consumer lending, servicing and collection businesses. Core Earnings are expected to be lower in 2011 than in 2010; however, this is principally due to a sharp decline in gains on debt repurchases and the absence of revenue generated from the sale of FFELP Loans to ED. In 2008 we significantly tightened our underwriting criteria and exited certain lending segments. In addition, each successive repayment cohort, i.e., a group of loans that enter their initial repayment status in the same calendar year upon exiting their grace period following graduation/separation from school, has been of higher quality. In 2009 we began to offer Smart Option Student Loans, which require students to make interest payments while they are in school, a departure from past practices where all required payments were deferred until the student graduated. In 2010, we began offering the Fixed Pay repayment option, which requires a payment during school that is less than a full interest payment. The loans that entered repayment in the fourth quarter of 2010 will influence delinquency trends in the first half of 2011 and charge offs in the second half. This cohort of loans is significantly smaller and of higher quality than previous repay cohorts, it has a higher average credit score and is comprised of significantly smaller amounts of higher risk non traditional and non cosigned loans on a percentage basis and in total volume. On January 11, 2011 we issued $2 billion, five year 6.25 percent fixed rate unsecured notes. The rate on the notes was swapped from a fixed rate to a floating rate equal to an all in cost of one month LIBOR plus 4.46 percent. Investor demand was the highest ever for a Sallie Mae issue, which we believe reflects investors views that our financial condition has strengthened. In 2011, we expect to access the unsecured debt market 27 and the term asset backed securities market to re finance both FFELP and Private Education Loans. We believe that conditions in these markets have improved as compared to last year and are conducive to funding at more favorable spreads and advance rates. Retail Bank deposits are also expected to continue to be a source of funding at favorable rates. We currently expect our net interest margins in the coming year to be stable in both our FFELP Loans and Consumer Lending segments. 2011 Management Objectives In 2011 we have set out five major goals to create shareholder value. They are: (1) Reduce our operating expenses; (2) Maximize cash flows from FFELP Loans; (3) Prudently grow Consumer Lending segment assets and revenue; (4) Increase Business Services segment revenue; and (5) Reinstate dividends and or share repurchases. Here is how we plan to achieve these objectives. Reduce Operating Expenses The elimination of FFELP by HCERA greatly reduced the scope of our historical revenue generating capabilities. In 2010 we originated $14 billion of loans, 84 percent of them FFELP Loans; in 2011 we expect to originate $2.5 billion of new loans, all of them Private Education Loans. Our FFELP related revenues will decline over the coming years. As a result, we must effectively match our cost structure to our ongoing business. Operating expenses will be reduced company wide. We have set a goal of getting to an annualized operating expense quarterly run rate of $250 million by the fourth quarter of 2011. Maximize Cash Flows from FFELP Loans We have a $148.6 billion portfolio of FFELP Loans that is expected to generate significant amounts of cash flow and earnings in the coming years. We plan to reduce related costs, minimize income volatility and opportunistically purchase other FFELP Loan portfolios like we did with SLC. Grow Consumer Lending Segment Assets and Revenue Successfully growing Private Education Loan lending is the key component of our long term plan to grow shareholder value. We must originate increasing numbers of high quality Private Education Loans, increase net interest margins and further reduce charge offs and provision for loan losses. To manage our borrowing costs, we must achieve more attractive term asset backed securities market access and prices in the coming year. Increase Business Services Segment Revenue Our Business Services segment is comprised of several businesses with customers related to FFELP that will experience revenue declines and several businesses with customers that provide growth opportunities. Our growth businesses are ED servicing, ED collections, other school based asset type servicing and collections, Campus Payment Solutions, transaction processing and 529 college savings plan account asset servicing. We currently have a 22 percent market share of the ED Servicing Contract. This volume will grow organically as more loans are originated under DL. Our goal is to further expand our market share and broaden the services we provide to ED and other third party servicing clients. The ED collection contract will also grow organically as more loans are originated under DL. We also seek to increase our market share through improved performance. Campus Payment Solutions is a business line that we expect to grow by expanding our product offerings and leveraging our deep relationships with colleges and universities. Assets under management in 529 college savings plans total $34.5 billion and have been growing at a rate of 21 percent over the last three years. Our goal is to service additional 529 plans. Reinstate Dividends and or Share Repurchases We suspended our dividend and share repurchase programs in April 2007 and have not since reinstated these programs. We now believe that our cash flow and capital positions have strengthened sufficiently that by 28 the second half of 2011, we will be able to recommend to our board of directors that we either reinstate a dividend, begin to repurchase shares or do a combination of both. Results of Operations We present the results of operations first on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP. As discussed earlier, we have four business segments, FFELP Loans, Consumer Lending, Business Services and Other segments. Since these segments operate in distinct business environments, the discussion following the Consolidated Earnings Summary is presented on a segment basis and is shown on a Core Earnings basis. See Item 1 Business Business Segments for further discussion on the components of each segment. 29 GAAP Statements of Income Increase (Decrease) Years Ended December 31, 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 $ % $ % Interest income FFELP Loans $ 3,345 $ 3,094 $ 5,173 $ 251 8 % $ (2,079 ) (40 )% Private Education Loans 2,353 1,582 1,738 771 49 (156 ) (9 ) Other loans 30 56 83 (26 ) (46 ) (27 ) (33 ) Cash and investments 26 26 276 (250 ) (91 ) Total interest income 5,754 4,758 7,270 996 21 (2,512 ) (35 ) Total interest expense 2,275 3,035 5,905 (760 ) (25 ) (2,870 ) (49 ) Net interest income 3,479 1,723 1,365 1,756 102 358 26 Less: provisions for loan losses 1,419 1,119 720 300 27 399 55 Net interest income after provisions for loan losses 2,060 604 645 1,456 241 (41 ) (6 ) Other income (loss): Securitization servicing and Residual Interest revenue 295 262 (295 ) (100 ) 33 13 Gains (losses) on sales of loans and securities, net 325 284 (186 ) 41 14 470 253 Losses on derivative and hedging activities, net (361 ) (604 ) (445 ) 243 (40 ) (159 ) 36 Servicing revenue 405 440 408 (35 ) (8 ) 32 8 Contingency revenue 330 294 330 36 12 (36 ) (11 ) Gains on debt repurchases 317 536 64 (219 ) (41 ) 472 738 Other income 6 88 39 (82 ) (93 ) 49 126 Total other income 1,022 1,333 472 (311 ) (23 ) 861 182 Expenses: Operating expenses 1,208 1,043 1,029 165 16 14 1 Goodwill and acquired intangible assets impairment and amortization expense 699 76 50 623 820 26 52 Restructuring expenses 85 10 72 75 750 (62 ) (86 ) Total expenses 1,992 1,129 1,151 863 76 (22 ) (2 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations, before income tax expense (benefit) 1,090 808 (34 ) 282 35 842 2,476 Income tax expense (benefit) 493 264 (36 ) 229 87 300 833 Net income from continuing operations 597 544 2 53 10 542 27,100 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (67 ) (220 ) (215 ) 153 (70 ) (5 ) 2 Net income (loss) 530 324 (213 ) 206 64 537 252 Preferred stock dividends 72 146 111 (74 ) (51 ) 35 32 Net income (loss) attributable to common stock $ 458 $ 178 $ (324 ) $ 280 157 % $ 502 155 % Basic earnings (loss) per common share: Continuing operations $ 1.08 $ .85 $ (.23 ) $ .23 27 % $ 1.08 470 % Discontinued operations $ (.14 ) $ (.47 ) $ (.46 ) $ .33 (70 )% $ (.01 ) 2 % Total $ .94 $ .38 $ (.69 ) $ .56 147 % $ 1.07 155 % Diluted earnings (loss) per common share: Continuing operations $ 1.08 $ .85 $ (.23 ) $ .23 27 % $ 1.08 470 % Discontinued operations $ (.14 ) $ (.47 ) $ (.46 ) $ .33 (70 )% $ (.01 ) 2 % Total $ .94 $ .38 $ (.69 ) $ .56 147 % $ 1.07 155 % Dividends per common share $ $ $ $ % $ % 30 Consolidated Earnings Summary GAAP basis Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2009 For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, net income was $530 million, or $.94 diluted earnings per common share, and $324 million, or $.38 diluted earnings per common share, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, net income from continuing operations was $597 million, or $1.08 diluted earnings per common share, and $544 million, or $.85 diluted earnings per common share, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, net loss from discontinued operations was $67 million, or $.14 diluted loss per common share, and $220 million, or $.47 diluted loss per common share from discontinued operations per common share, respectively. Income from Continuing Operations before Income Tax Expense Income from continuing operations before income tax expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2010, by $282 million as compared with the prior year primarily due to a $1.5 billion increase in net interest income after provisions for loan losses and a $243 million decrease in net losses on derivative and hedging activities. These improvements were partially offset by a $660 million goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge, a $165 million increase in operating expenses, a $219 million decrease in gains on debt repurchases and a decrease in securitization servicing and Residual Interest revenue of $295 million. The primary contributors to each of the identified drivers of changes in income from continuing operations before income tax expense for the year over year period are as follows: Net interest income after provisions for loan losses increased by $1.5 billion in the year ended December 31, 2010 from the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in net interest income and provisions for loan losses was partially due to the adoption as of January 1, 2010 of the new consolidation accounting guidance which resulted in the consolidation of $35.0 billion of assets and $34.4 billion of liabilities in certain securitizations trusts. (See Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies for a further discussion of the effect of adopting the new consolidation accounting guidance). The consolidation of these securitization trusts as of January 1, 2010 resulted in $998 million of additional net interest income and $355 million of additional provisions for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2010. Excluding the effect of the trusts being consolidated as of January 1, 2010, net interest income increased $758 million from the year ended 2009 and provisions for loan losses decreased $55 million from the year ended 2009. The increase in net interest income, excluding the effect of the new consolidation accounting guidance, was primarily the result of an increase in the FFELP Loans net interest margin primarily due to an improvement in our funding costs, a 24 basis point tightening of the CP/LIBOR spread and the effect of not receiving hedge accounting treatment for derivatives used to economically hedge risk affecting net interest income. The decrease in the provisions for loan losses relates to the Private Education Loan loss provision, which decreased as a result of the improving performance of the portfolio. Securitization servicing and Residual Interest revenue was no longer recorded in fiscal year 2010 due to the adoption of the new consolidation accounting guidance; however, we recognized $295 million in the prior year. Gains on sales of loans and securities increased $41 million from the prior year primarily related to the gains on sales of additional FFELP Loans to ED as part of EDs Loan Purchase Commitment Program (the Purchase Program). These gains will not occur in the future as the Purchase Program ended in 2010. Losses on derivatives and hedging activities, net, declined by $243 million in 2010 compared with 2009. The primary factor affecting the change in losses in 2010 was interest rates. Valuations of derivative instruments vary based upon many factors including changes in interest rates, credit risk, foreign currency fluctuations and other market factors. As a result, we expect gains and (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities, net, to vary significantly in future periods. 31 Servicing revenue decreased by $35 million primarily due to HCERA becoming effective as of July 1, 2010, thereby eliminating our ability to earn additional guarantor issuance fees on new FFELP Loans, as well as to a decline in outstanding FFELP Loans for which we were earning additional fees. Contingency revenue increased $36 million primarily from increased collections on defaulted FFELP Loans. Gains on debt repurchases decreased $219 million year over year while the principal amount of debt repurchased increased to $4.9 billion, as compared with the $3.4 billion repurchased in fiscal year 2009. We expect to continue to repurchase debt in the future and the amount of gains in the future will be dependent on market conditions and available liquidity. Other income declined by $82 million primarily due to a $71 million decrease in foreign currency translation gains. The foreign currency translation gains relate to a portion of our foreign currency denominated debt that does not receive hedge accounting treatment. These gains were partially offset by the losses on derivative and hedging activities, net line item on the income statement related to the derivatives used to economically hedge these debt instruments. Operating expenses, excluding restructuring related asset impairments of $19 million in 2010, increased $146 million year over year primarily due to an increase in legal contingency expense, costs related to the ED Servicing Contract, higher collection and servicing costs from a higher number of loans in repayment and in delinquent status, and higher marketing and technology enhancement costs related to Private Education Loans. Goodwill and intangible asset impairment and amortization increased $623 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to the $660 million of impairment recognized as a result of the passage of HCERA and its negative effects on the anticipated cash flows for certain of our reporting units and the reduced market values of these units. The amortization of acquired intangibles for continuing operations and for discontinued operations each remained relatively unchanged for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. For additional discussion regarding the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets see Note 6 Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets. Restructuring expenses increased $69 million in the year ended December 31, 2010, which is a result of a $75 million increase in restructuring expenses in continuing operations partially offset by a $6 million decrease in restructuring expenses attributable to discontinued operations. The following details our ongoing restructuring efforts: On March 30, 2010, President Obama signed into law H.R. 4872, HCERA, which included the SAFRA Act. Effective July 1, 2010, this legislation eliminated FFELP and requires all new federal loans to be made through the DSLP. Restructuring our operations in response to this change in law requires a significant reduction of operating costs from the elimination of positions and facilities associated with the origination of FFELP Loans. Expenses associated with continuing operations under this restructuring plan were $83 million in fiscal year 2010. We are currently finalizing this restructuring plan and expect to incur an estimated $11 million of additional restructuring costs in 2011. The majority of these expenses are severance costs related to the partially completed and planned elimination of approximately 2,500 positions, approximately 30 percent of our workforce that existed as of the first quarter 2010. In response to the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 (CCRAA) and challenges in the capital markets, we also initiated a restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of 2007. Under this ongoing plan, restructuring expenses associated with continuing operations of $2 million and $10 million were recognized in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The majority of these restructuring expenses were also severance costs related to the elimination of approximately 3,000 positions, or approximately 25 percent of our workforce that existed as of the fourth quarter 2007. 32 Income tax expense from continuing operations increased $229 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared with the prior year. The effective tax rates for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were 45 percent and 33 percent, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily driven by the impact of non deductible goodwill impairments recorded in 2010 and state tax rate changes recorded in both periods. Net Loss from Discontinued Operations. Net loss from discontinued operations in the year ended December 31, 2010 was $67 million compared with a net loss from discontinued operations of $220 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we sold our Purchased Paper Mortgage/Properties business for $280 million which resulted in an after tax loss of $95 million. As a result of this sale, the results of operations of this business were presented in discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2009. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we began actively marketing our Purchased Paper Non Mortgage business for sale and have concluded it is probable this business will be sold within one year at which time we would exit the business. As a result, the results of operations of this business were also required to be presented in discontinued operations beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010. In connection with this presentation, we are required to carry this business at the lower of fair value or historical cost basis. As a result, we recorded an after tax loss of $52 million from discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2010, primarily due to adjusting the value of this business to its estimated fair value. Our Purchased Paper businesses are presented in discontinued operations for the current and prior periods. The additional losses for both years that are more than the losses discussed above relate to ongoing impairment recorded as a result of the weakened economys effect on our ability to collect the receivables. Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2008 For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, net income was $324 million, or $.38 diluted earnings per common share, and a net loss of $213 million, or $.69 diluted loss per common share, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, net income from continuing operations was $544 million, or $.85 diluted earnings per common share, and $2 million, or $.23 diluted loss per common share, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, net loss from discontinued operations was $220 million, or $.47 diluted loss per common share, and $215 million, or $.46 diluted loss from discontinued operations per common share, respectively. Income from Continuing Operations before Income Tax Expense. Income from continuing operations before income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased $842 million from the prior year. The $842 million increase was primarily due to an increase in gains on debt repurchases of $472 million and an increase in gains on sales of loans and securities of $470 million offset by an increase of $159 million in net losses on derivative and hedging activities. The primary contributors to each of the identified drivers of changes in income from continuing operations before income tax expense for the year over year period are as follows: Net interest income after provisions for loan losses decreased by $41 million in the year ended December 31, 2009 from the prior year. This decrease was due to a $399 million increase in provisions for loan losses partially offset by a $358 million increase in net interest income. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to an increase in the FFELP Loans net interest margin primarily due to an increase in Gross Floor Income and the impact of derivative accounting and a $15 billion increase in the average balance of GAAP basis student loans. The increase in provisions for loan losses related primarily to increases in charge off expectations on Private Education Loans primarily as a result of the continued weakening of the U.S. economy. Securitization servicing and Residual Interest revenue increased by $33 million from the prior year primarily due to a $95 million decrease in the current year unrealized mark to market loss on our Residual Interests compared with the prior year, partially offset by a decrease in net Embedded Floor value. 33 Gains on sales of loans and securities increased $470 million from the prior year. The increase is primarily attributable to a $284 million gain on our sale of approximately $18.5 billion of FFELP Loans to ED as part of the ED Purchase Program and the $186 million loss incurred in fiscal year 2008. The 2008 loss resulted from our repurchase of delinquent Private Education Loans from our off balance sheet securitization trusts and the sale of approximately $1.0 billion FFELP Loans to the ED under ECASLA, which resulted in a $53 million loss. Losses on derivatives and hedging activities, net, increased by $159 million in 2009 compared with 2008. The primary factors affecting the change in losses in 2009 were interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Valuations of derivative instruments vary based upon many factors, including changes in interest rates, credit risk, foreign currency fluctuations and other market factors. As a result, we expect gains and (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities, net, to vary significantly in future periods. Servicing Revenue increased $32 million when compared with the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the initiation of Direct Lending servicing in 2009. Contingency revenue decreased $36 million when compared with the prior year primarily as a result of less Guarantor collections revenue from rehabilitating delinquent FFELP Loans. Gains on debt repurchases increased $472 million when compared with the prior year. We repurchased $3.4 billion of our unsecured corporate debt as compared with $1.9 billion in the prior year. Other income increased by $49 million primarily due to a $54 million increase in foreign currency translation gains. These gains were partially offset by the losses on derivative and hedging activities, net line item on the income statement related to the derivatives used to economically hedge these debt instruments. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, operating expenses, excluding restructuring related asset impairments of $0 and $6 million, respectively, were $1,043 million compared with $1,023 million, respectively. The $20 million increase from the prior year relates to increased marketing expense related to our direct to consumer marketing activities, increased technology costs as well as increased collections costs. Goodwill and intangible asset impairment for continuing operations increased by $35 million in 2009 and the goodwill and intangible asset impairment for discontinued operations decreased by like amount as compared with the prior year. For additional discussion regarding the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets see Note 6 Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets. The amortization of acquired intangibles for continuing operations totaled $38 million and $48 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and the amortization of acquired intangibles for discontinued operations totaled $1 million and $6 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Restructuring expenses of $22 million and $84 million were recognized in the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, of which $10 million and $72 million were in continuing operations and $12 million and $12 million were in discontinued operations, respectively. Income tax expense from continuing operations was $264 million in 2009 compared with an income tax benefit of $36 million in 2008, resulting in effective tax rates of 33 percent and 106 percent, respectively. The movement in the effective tax rate in 2009 compared with the prior year was primarily driven by the reduction of tax and interest on U.S. federal and state uncertain tax positions in both periods, as well as the permanent tax impact of deducting Proposed Merger related transaction costs in 2008. Also contributing to the higher effective tax rate in 2008 was the effect of significantly higher reported pre tax income in 2009 and the resulting changes in the proportion of income subject to federal and state taxes. For additional information, see Note 18 Income Taxes. 34 Net Loss from Discontinued Operations. Net loss from discontinued operations in the year ended December 31, 2009 increased $5 million from the prior year. Our Purchased Paper businesses are presented in discontinued operations for the current and prior years. Preferred Stock Dividend Expense During 2009, we converted $339 million of our Series C Preferred Stock to common stock. As part of this conversion, we delivered to the holders of the preferred stock: (1) approximately 17 million shares (the number of common shares they would most likely receive if the preferred stock they held mandatorily converted to common shares in the fourth quarter of 2010) plus (2) a discounted amount of the preferred stock dividends the holders of the preferred stock would have received if they held the preferred stock through the mandatory conversion date. The accounting treatment for this conversion resulted in additional expense recorded as a part of preferred stock dividends for the period of approximately $53 million. Core Earnings Definition and Limitations We prepare financial statements in accordance with GAAP. However, we also evaluate our business segments on a basis that differs from GAAP. We refer to this different basis of presentation as Core Earnings. We provide this Core Earnings basis of presentation on a consolidated basis for each business segment because this is what we internally review when making management decisions regarding our performance and how we allocate resources. We also refer to this information in our presentations with credit rating agencies, lenders and investors. Because our Core Earnings basis of presentation corresponds to our segment financial presentations, we are required by GAAP to provide Core Earnings disclosure in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for our business segments. For additional information, see Note 19 Segment Reporting. Core Earnings are not a substitute for reported results under GAAP. We use Core Earnings to manage each business segment because Core Earnings reflect adjustments to GAAP financial results for three items, discussed below, that create significant volatility mostly due to timing factors generally beyond the control of management. Accordingly, we believe that Core Earnings provide management with a useful basis from which to better evaluate results from ongoing operations against the business plan or against results from prior periods. Consequently, we disclose this information as we believe it provides investors with additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely assessed by management. The three items adjusted for in our Core Earnings presentations are (1) the off balance sheet treatment of certain securitization transactions, (2) our use of derivatives instruments to hedge our economic risks that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment or do qualify for hedge accounting treatment but result in ineffectiveness and (3) the accounting for goodwill and acquired intangible assets. While GAAP provides a uniform, comprehensive basis of accounting, for the reasons described above, our Core Earnings basis of presentation does not. Core Earnings are subject to certain general and specific limitations that investors should carefully consider. For example, there is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance for management reporting. Our Core Earnings are not defined terms within GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Accordingly, our Core Earnings presentation does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Investors, therefore, may not be able to compare our performance with that of other financial services companies based upon Core Earnings. Core Earnings results are only meant to supplement GAAP results by providing additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely used by management, our board of directors, rating agencies, lenders and investors to assess performance. Specific adjustments that management makes to GAAP results to derive our Core Earnings basis of presentation are described in detail in the section entitled Core Earnings Definition and Limitations Differences between Core Earnings and GAAP of this Item 7. 35 The following tables show Core Earnings for each business segment and our business as a whole along with the adjustments made to the income/expense items to reconcile the amounts to our reported GAAP results as required by GAAP and reported in Note 19 Segment Reporting.

Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Core Earnings $ 1,028 $ 807 $ 583 Core Earnings adjustments: Net impact of derivative accounting 83 (502 ) (751 ) Net impact of goodwill and acquired intangibles (699 ) (76 ) (73 ) Net impact of securitization accounting (201 ) (442 ) Total Core Earnings adjustments before income tax effect (616 ) (779 ) (1,266 ) Net income tax effect 118 296 470 Total Core Earnings adjustments (498 ) (483 ) (796 ) GAAP net income (loss) $ 530 $ 324 $ (213 ) 1) Derivative Accounting: Core Earnings exclude periodic unrealized gains and losses that are caused primarily by the mark to market valuations on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under GAAP. To a lesser extent, these periodic unrealized gains and losses are also a result of ineffectiveness recognized related to effective hedges. These unrealized gains and losses occur in our FFELP Loans, Consumer Lending and Other business segments. Under GAAP, for derivatives we generally use that are held to maturity, the cumulative net unrealized gain or loss at the time of maturity will equal $0 except for Floor Income Contracts where the cumulative unrealized gain will equal the amount for which we sold the contract. In our Core Earnings presentation, we recognize the economic effect of these hedges, which generally results in any cash paid or received being recognized ratably as an expense or revenue over the hedged items life. The accounting for derivatives requires that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments be recognized currently in earnings, with no fair value adjustment of the hedged item, unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. We believe that our derivatives are effective economic hedges, and as such, are a critical element of our interest rate and foreign currency risk management strategy. However, some of our derivatives, primarily Floor Income Contracts and certain basis swaps, do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and the stand alone derivative must be marked to market in the income statement with no consideration for the corresponding change in fair value of the hedged item. These gains and losses recorded in Gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net are primarily caused by interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate volatility and changing credit spreads during the period as well as the volume and term of derivatives not receiving hedge accounting treatment. Our Floor Income Contracts are written options that must meet more stringent requirements than other hedging relationships to achieve hedge effectiveness. Specifically, our Floor Income Contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment because the pay down of principal of the student loans underlying the Floor Income embedded in those student loans does not exactly match the change in the notional amount of our written Floor Income Contracts. Under derivatives accounting treatment, the upfront payment is deemed a liability and changes in fair value are recorded through income throughout the life of the contract. The change in the value of Floor Income Contracts is primarily caused by changing interest rates that cause the amount of Floor Income earned on the underlying student loans and paid to the counterparties to vary. This is economically offset by the change in value of the student loan portfolio earning Floor Income but that offsetting change in value is not recognized. We believe the Floor Income Contracts are economic hedges because they effectively fix the amount of Floor Income earned over the contract period, thus eliminating the timing and uncertainty that changes in interest rates can have on Floor Income for that period. Therefore, for purposes of Core Earnings, we have removed the unrealized gains and losses related to these contracts and added back the amortization of the net premiums received on the Floor Income Contracts. The amortization of the net premiums received on the Floor Income Contracts for Core Earnings is reflected in student loan interest income. Under GAAP accounting, the premium received on the Floor Income Contracts is recorded as revenue in the gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities, net line item by the end of the contracts life. Basis swaps are used to convert floating rate debt from one floating interest rate index to another to better match the interest rate characteristics of the assets financed by that debt. We primarily use basis swaps to 39 hedge our student loan assets that are primarily indexed to a commercial paper, Prime or Treasury bill index. In addition, we use basis swaps to convert debt indexed to the Consumer Price Index to three month LIBOR debt. The accounting for derivatives requires that when using basis swaps, the change in the cash flows of the hedge effectively offset both the change in the cash flows of the asset and the change in the cash flows of the liability. Our basis swaps hedge variable interest rate risk; however, they generally do not meet this effectiveness test because the index of the swap does not exactly match the index of the hedged assets as required for hedge accounting treatment. Additionally, some of our FFELP Loans can earn at either a variable or a fixed interest rate depending on market interest rates and therefore swaps written on the FFELP Loans do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting treatment. As a result, under GAAP, these swaps are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected currently in the income statement. The table below quantifies the adjustments for derivative accounting on our net income for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 when compared with the accounting principles employed in all years prior to the adoption of ASC 815 related to accounting for derivative financial instruments. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Core Earnings derivative adjustments: Gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net, included in other income(1) $ (361 ) $ (604 ) $ (445 ) Less: Realized (gains) losses on derivative and hedging activities, net(1) 815 322 (107 ) Unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net 454 (282 ) (552 ) Amortization of net premiums on Floor Income Contracts in net interest income (317 ) (197 ) (191 ) Other pre change in derivatives accounting adjustments (54 ) (23 ) (8 ) Total net impact derivative accounting(2) $ 83 $ (502 ) $ (751 ) (1) See Reclassification of Realized Gains (Losses) on Derivative and Hedging Activities below for a detailed breakdown of the components of realized losses on derivative and hedging activities. (2) Negative amounts are subtracted from Core Earnings to arrive at GAAP net income and positive amounts are added to Core Earnings to arrive at GAAP net income. Reclassification of Realized Gains (Losses) on Derivative and Hedging Activities The accounting for derivative instruments requires net settlement income/expense on derivatives and realized gains/losses related to derivative dispositions (collectively referred to as realized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities) that do not qualify as hedges to be recorded in a separate income statement line item below net interest income. Under our Core Earnings presentation, these gains and (losses) are reclassified to the income statement line item of the economically hedged item. For our Core Earnings net interest margin, this would primarily include: (a) reclassifying the net settlement amounts related to our Floor Income Contracts to student loan interest income and (b) reclassifying the net settlement amounts related to certain of our basis swaps to debt interest expense. The table below summarizes the realized losses on derivative and hedging activities and the associated reclassification on a Core Earnings basis for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Reclassification of realized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities: Net settlement expense on Floor Income Contracts reclassified to net interest income $ (888 ) $ (717 ) $ (488 ) Net settlement income (expense) on interest rate swaps reclassified to net interest income 69 412 563 Foreign exchange derivatives gains/(losses) reclassified to other income (15 ) 11 Net realized gains (losses) on terminated derivative contracts reclassified to other income 4 (2 ) 21 Total reclassifications of realized (gains)losses on derivative and hedging activities (815 ) (322 ) 107 Add: Unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net(1) 454 (282 ) (552 ) Gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net $ (361 ) $ (604 ) $ (445 ) 40 (1) Unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net comprises the following unrealized mark to market gains (losses): Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Floor Income Contracts $ 156 $ 483 $ (529 ) Basis swaps 341 (413 ) (239 ) Foreign currency hedges (83 ) (255 ) 328 Other 40 (97 ) (112 ) Total unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net $ 454 $ (282 ) $ (552 ) 2) Goodwill and Acquired Intangibles: Our Core Earnings exclude goodwill and intangible impairment and the amortization of acquired intangibles.

As a result, going forward, there will no longer be differences between our GAAP and Core Earnings presentation for securitization accounting. (See Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies for further detail). Prior to the adoption of the new consolidation accounting guidance on January 1, 2010, certain securitization transactions in our FFELP Loans and Consumer Lending business segments were accounted for as sales of assets. Under Core Earnings for the FFELP Loans and Consumer Lending business segments, we presented all securitization transactions as long term non recourse financings. The upfront gains on sale from securitization transactions, as well as ongoing securitization servicing and Residual Interest revenue (loss) presented in accordance with GAAP, were excluded from Core Earnings and were replaced by interest income, provisions for loan losses, and interest expense as earned or incurred on the securitization loans. This additional net interest margin included for Core Earnings contains any related fees or costs such as Consolidation Loan Rebate Fees, premium and discount amortization as well as any Repayment Borrower Benefit yield adjustments. We also excluded transactions with our off balance sheet trusts from Core Earnings as they were considered intercompany transactions on a Core Earnings basis. While we believe that our Core Earnings presentation presents the economic substance of results from our loan portfolios, when compared to GAAP results, it understates earnings volatility from securitization gains, securitization servicing income and Residual Interest income. 41 The following table summarizes Core Earnings securitization adjustments for the FFELP Loans and Consumer Lending business segments for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Core Earnings securitization adjustments: Net interest income on securitized loans, before provisions for loan losses and before intercompany transactions $ (942 ) $ (872 ) Provisions for loan losses 445 309 Net interest income on securitized loans, after provisions for loan losses, before intercompany transactions (497 ) (563 ) Intercompany transactions with off balance sheet trusts 1 (141 ) Net interest income on securitized loans, after provisions for loan losses (496 ) (704 ) Securitization servicing and Residual Interest revenue 295 262 Total Core Earnings securitization adjustments(1) $ (201 ) $ (442 ) (1) Negative amounts are subtracted from Core Earnings to arrive at GAAP net income and positive amounts are added to Core Earnings to arrive at GAAP net income. Intercompany transactions with off balance sheet trusts in the above table relate primarily to losses that result from the repurchase of delinquent loans from our off balance sheet securitization trusts. When Private Education Loans in our securitization trusts settling before September 30, 2005 became 180 days delinquent, we previously exercised our contingent call option to repurchase these loans at par value out of the trust and recorded a loss for the difference in the par value paid and the fair market value of the loan at the time of purchase. We do not hold the contingent call option for any trusts settled after September 30, 2005. In October 2008, we decided to no longer exercise our contingent call option. Business Segments As a result of the change in segment reporting that occurred in the fourth quarter 2010, past periods have been recast for comparison purposes. In connection with changing the reportable segments the following lists other significant changes we made related to the new segment presentation: The operating expenses reported for each segment are directly attributable to the generation of revenues by that segment. We have included corporate overhead and certain information technology costs (together referred to as Overhead) in our Other segment rather than allocate those expenses by segment. The creation of the FFELP Loans and Business Services segments has resulted in our accounting for the significant servicing revenue we earn on FFELP Loans we own in the Business Services segment. This bifurcates the FFELP interest income between the FFELP Loans and Business Services segment, with an intercompany servicing fee charge from the Business Services segment. The intercompany amounts are the contractual rates for encumbered loans within a financing facility or a similar market rate if the loan is not in a financing facility and accordingly exceed our costs. In our GAAP basis financial presentation we allocated existing goodwill to the new reporting units within the reportable segments based upon relative fair value. During the fourth quarter 2010, we also evaluated our goodwill for impairment using both the old reporting and new reporting unit framework and there was no impairment under either analysis. Similar to prior periods, capital is assigned to each segment based on internally determined risk adjusted weightings for the assets in each segment. These weightings have been updated and differ depending on the relative risk of each asset type and represent managements view of the level of capital needed to support different assets. Unsecured debt is allocated based on the remaining funding needed for each segment after direct funding and the capital allocation has been considered. 42 As part of the change in the reportable segments in the fourth quarter of 2010, we also changed our calculation of Core Earnings. When our FFELP Loan portfolio was growing, management and our investors valued it based on recurring income streams. Given the uncertain and volatile nature of unhedged Floor Income, little future value was attributed to it by the financial markets; therefore, we excluded unhedged Floor Income from Core Earnings. Now that our FFELP Loan portfolio is amortizing down, management and investors are focused on the total amount of cash the FFELP Loan portfolio generates, including unhedged Floor Income. As a result, we now include unhedged Floor Income in Core Earnings and have recast past Core Earnings financial results to reflect this change. The effect of including unhedged Floor Income, net of tax, on Core Earnings was an increase of $21 million, $210 million and $57 million for the years ending December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

This was primarily the result of a significant reduction in the cost of our ABCP Facility, a 24 basis point improvement in the CP/LIBOR Spread and a significantly higher margin on the loans within the EDs Loan Participation Purchase Program (the Participation Program) facility compared to the prior year. As of December 31, 2010, our FFELP Loan portfolio totaled approximately $149 billion, comprised of $56 billion of FFELP Stafford and $93 billion of FFELP Consolidation Loans. The weighted average life of these portfolios is 4.9 years and 9.4 years, respectively, assuming a CPR of 6 percent and 3 percent, respectively. On December 31, 2010, we closed on our agreement to purchase an interest in $26.1 billion of securitized federal student loans and related assets from the Student Loan Corporation (SLC), a subsidiary of Citibank, N.A. The purchase price was approximately $1.1 billion. The assets purchased include the residual interest in 13 of SLCs 14 FFELP loan securitizations and its interest in SLC Funding Note Issuer related to the U.S. Department of Educations Straight A Funding asset backed commercial paper conduit. We will also service these assets and administer the securitization trusts. However, SLC will subservice these trusts on our behalf in 2011 until we transition these functions to our own servicing platform during the latter part of 2011. Because we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of these trusts we have consolidated these trusts onto our balance sheet. In addition, we contracted the right to service approximately $0.8 billion of additional FFELP securitized assets from SLC. (We did not consolidate this underlying trust because we are not the primary beneficiary of this trust.) The purchase was funded by a 5 year term loan provided by Citibank in an amount equal to the purchase price. See Note 3 Student Loans and Note 7 Borrowings for additional details regarding assets and terms of funding. 44 Floor Income Core Earnings Basis The following table analyzes the ability of the FFELP Loans in our Core Earnings portfolio to earn Floor Income after December 31, 2010 and 2009, based on interest rates as of those dates.

The following table presents a projection of the average Core Earnings basis balance of FFELP Consolidation Loans for which Fixed Rate Floor Income has been economically hedged through Floor Income Contracts for the period January 1, 2011 to March 31, 2014. The hedges related to these loans do not qualify as effective hedges. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in billions) 2011 2012 2013 2014 Average balance of FFELP Consolidation Loans whose Floor Income is economically hedged $ 28.8 $ 20.6 $ 5.6 $ .2 FFELP Provisions for Loan Losses and Loan Charge Offs The following tables summarize the total FFELP provisions for loan losses and FFELP Loan charge offs on both a GAAP basis and a Core Earnings basis for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 FFELP provisions for loan losses: Total GAAP basis $ 98 $ 106 $ 106 Total Core Earnings basis 98 119 127 FFELP loan charge offs: Total GAAP basis $ 87 $ 79 $ 58 Total Core Earnings basis 87 94 79 45 Servicing Revenue and Other Income FFELP Loans Segment The following table summarizes the components of Core Earnings other income for our FFELP Loans segment for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Servicing revenue $ 68 $ 75 $ 77 Gains (losses) on sales of loans and securities, net 325 284 (51 ) Other (5 ) 8 9 Total other income, net $ 388 $ 367 $ 35 Servicing revenue for our FFELP Loans segment primarily consists of borrower late fees. The gains on sales of loans and securities in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, related primarily to the sale of $20.4 billion and $18.5 billion loans, respectively, of FFELP Loans to ED as part of the ED Purchase Program. The loss in 2008 primarily relates to the sale of approximately $1.0 billion of FFELP Loans to the ED under ECASLA, which resulted in a $53 million loss. Operating Expenses FFELP Loans Segment Operating expenses for our FFELP Loans segment primarily include the contractual rates we are paid to service loans in term asset backed securitization trusts or a similar rate if a loan is not in a term financing facility, the fees we pay for third party loan servicing and costs incurred to acquire loans. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, operating expenses for our FFELP Loans segment totaled $736 million, $754 million and $745 million, respectively. The intercompany revenue charged from the Business Services segment and included in those amounts was $648 million, $659 million and $632 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. These amounts exceed the actual cost of servicing the loans. 2010 versus 2009 Operating expenses decreased $18 million from the prior year, primarily due to the effect of our cost cutting initiative in connection with the passage of HCERA. This was partially offset by a one time fee paid to acquire the SLC portfolio, an increase in legal contingency expenses and costs related to closing and selling two loan originations centers in 2010. Operating expenses, excluding restructuring related asset impairments, were 51 basis points and 50 basis points of average Core Earnings basis FFELP Loans in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 2009 versus 2008 Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009, increased $9 million from the prior year primarily due to an increase in our servicing expense as a result of an $8 billion increase in the average balance of our FFELP Loan portfolio. 46 Consumer Lending Segment The following table includes Core Earnings results for our Consumer Lending segment. Years Ended December 31, % Increase (Decrease) (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Core Earnings interest income: Private Education Loans $ 2,353 $ 2,254 $ 2,752 4 % (18 )% Cash and investments 14 13 79 8 (84 ) Total Core Earnings interest income 2,367 2,267 2,831 4 (20 ) Total Core Earnings interest expense 758 721 1,280 5 (44 ) Net Core Earnings interest income 1,609 1,546 1,551 4 Less: provisions for loan losses 1,298 1,399 874 (7 ) 60 Net Core Earnings interest income after provisions for loan losses 311 147 677 112 (78 ) Servicing revenue 72 70 65 3 8 Other income 1 (100 ) Direct operating expenses: Sales and origination 125 81 67 54 21 Servicing 60 47 36 28 31 Collections 94 90 67 4 34 Information technology 68 52 23 31 126 Other 3 (5 ) 8 160 (163 ) Total direct operating expenses 350 265 201 32 32 Restructuring expenses 12 2 25 500 (92 ) Total expenses 362 267 226 36 18 Income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit) 21 (50 ) 517 142 (110 ) Income tax expense (benefit) 8 (18 ) 186 144 (110 ) Core Earnings (loss) $ 13 $ (32 ) $ 331 (141 )% (110 )% 47 Consumer Lending Core Earnings Net Interest Margin The following table shows the Consumer Lending Core Earnings net interest margin along with a reconciliation to the GAAP basis Consumer Lending net interest margin before provisions for loan losses.

The decrease in the net interest margin from 2008 to 2009 was primarily a result of a higher costs of funds due to the extreme turmoil in the capital markets. Private Education Loans Provisions for Loan Losses and Loan Charge Offs The following tables summarize the total Private Education Loans provisions for loan losses and charge offs on both a GAAP basis and a Core Earnings basis for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Private Education Loans provision for loan losses: Total GAAP basis $ 1,298 $ 967 $ 586 Total Core Earnings basis 1,298 1,399 874 Private Education Loans charge offs: Total GAAP basis $ 1,291 $ 876 $ 320 Total Core Earnings basis 1,291 1,299 473 The 2010 Core Earnings basis provision expense and charge offs are down from 2009 as the portfolios credit performance continued to improve since the weakening in the U.S. economy that began in 2008. The Private Education Loan portfolio experienced a significant increase in delinquencies through the first quarter of 2009 (delinquencies as a percentage of loans in repayment were 13.4 percent at March 31, 2009); however, delinquencies as a percentage of loans in repayment have now declined to 10.6 percent at December 31, 2010. Core Earnings basis Private Education Loan delinquencies as a percentage of loans in repayment decreased from 12.1 percent to 10.6 percent from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010. Core Earnings Private Education Loans in forbearance as a percentage of loans in repayment and forbearance decreased from 5.5 percent at December 31, 2009 to 4.6 percent at December 31, 2010. The Core Earnings basis Private 48 Education Loan allowance coverage of annual charge offs ratio was 1.6 at December 31, 2010 compared with 1.5 at December 31, 2009. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of ending Private Education Loans in repayment decreased from 8.1 percent at December 31, 2009 to 7.3 percent at December 31, 2010. We analyzed changes in the key ratios disclosed in the tables above when determining the appropriate Private Education Loan allowance for loan losses. Servicing Revenue and Other Income Consumer Lending Segment Servicing revenue for our Consumer Lending segment primarily includes late fees and forbearance fees. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, servicing revenue for our Consumer Lending segment totaled $72 million, $70 million and $65 million, respectively. Operating Expenses Consumer Lending Segment Operating expenses for our Consumer Lending segment include costs incurred to originate Private Education Loans and to service and collect on our Core Earnings basis Private Education Loan portfolio. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, operating expenses for our Consumer Lending segment totaled $350 million, $265 million and $201 million, respectively. 2010 versus 2009 Operating expenses increased $85 million from 2009, primarily as the result of a non recurring $11 million benefit in 2009 related to reversing a contingency reserve, an increase in collection and servicing costs from a higher number of loans in repayment and delinquency status and higher marketing and technology enhancement costs related to Private Education Loans in 2010. Operating expenses, excluding restructuring related asset impairments, were 96 basis points and 74 basis points, respectively, of average Core Earnings basis Private Education Loans in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. 2009 versus 2008 Operating expenses increased $64 million from 2008, primarily as a result of an increase in collection and servicing costs from a higher number of loans in repayment and delinquency status and higher marketing and technology enhancement costs related to Private Education Loans in 2009. Operating expenses, excluding restructuring related asset impairments, were 74 basis points and 61 basis points, respectively, of average Core Earnings basis Private Education Loans in the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. 49 Business Services Segment The following tables include Core Earnings results for our Business Services segment.

The average balance of this portfolio was $127 billion, $135 billion and $125 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease from 2009 to 2010 is primarily the result of the amortization of the underlying portfolio as well as the $20.4 billion of FFELP Loans sold to ED in October 2010. We are servicing approximately 3.3 million accounts under the ED Servicing Contract as of December 31, 2010. The increase in third party loan servicing revenue in 2010 is the result of the increase in the loans we are servicing under the ED Servicing Contract. Loan servicing fees in 2010 and 2009 included $44 million and $9 million, respectively, of servicing revenue related to the loans we are servicing under the ED Servicing Contract. Account asset servicing revenue represents fees earned on program management, transfer and servicing agent services and administration services for our various 529 college savings plans. Campus Payment Solutions revenue is earned from our Campus Payment Solutions business whose services include comprehensive financing and transaction processing solutions that we provide to college financial aid offices and students to streamline the financial aid process. 50 The decrease in Guarantor servicing revenue compared with the year ago period was primarily due to HCERA being effective as of July 1, 2010, our no longer earning Guarantor issuance fees and the lower balance of outstanding FFELP Loans on which we earn other fees. In 2010, contingency revenue increased $36 million from 2009 due to an increase in collections on defaulted FFELP Loans. Contingency revenue decreased in 2009 from 2008 as the result of significantly less Guarantor collections revenue associated with rehabilitating delinquent FFELP Loans. Loans are considered rehabilitated after a certain number of on time payments have been collected. We earn a rehabilitation fee only when the Guarantor sells the rehabilitated loan. The disruption in the credit markets limited the sale of rehabilitated loans. The following table presents the outstanding inventory of contingent collections receivables that our Business Services segment will collect on behalf of others. As of December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Contingency: Student loans $ 10,362 $ 8,762 $ 9,852 Other 1,730 1,262 1,726 Total $ 12,092 $ 10,024 $ 11,578 Transaction fees are earned in conjunction with our rewards program from participating companies based on member purchase activity, either online or in stores, depending on the contractual arrangement with the participating company. Typically, a percentage of the purchase price of the consumer members eligible purchases with participating companies is set aside in an account maintained by us on behalf of our members. Revenues related to services performed on FFELP Loans accounted for 78 percent, 79 percent and 79 percent, respectively, of total segment revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Operating Expenses Business Services Segment For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, operating expenses for the Business Services segment totaled $500 million, $440 million and $462 million, respectively. 2010 versus 2009 Operating expenses increased $60 million from 2009 to 2010 primarily due to higher technology and other expenses related to preparation for higher volumes for the ED Servicing Contract as well as an increase in legal contingency expenses. 2009 versus 2008 Operating expenses decreased $22 million in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to our cost reduction initiatives. Other Segment The Other segment primarily consists of the financial results related to the repurchase of debt, the corporate liquidity portfolio and all overhead. We also include results from smaller wind down and discontinued operations within this segment. These are the Purchased Paper businesses and mortgage and other loan businesses. The Other segment includes our remaining businesses that do not pertain directly to the primary segments identified above. Overhead expenses include costs related to executive management, the board of directors, accounting, finance, legal, human resources, stock option expense and certain information technology costs related to infrastructure and operations. 51 The following table includes Core Earnings results for our Other segment.

The businesses are presented in discontinued operations for the current and prior periods. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we sold our Purchased Paper Mortgage/Properties business for $280 million, which resulted in an after tax loss of $95 million. In the fourth quarter of 2010 we began actively marketing our Purchased Paper Non Mortgage business for sale. We have concluded it is probable this business will be sold within one year and, as a result, the results of operations of this business were presented in discontinued operations beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010. In connection with this classification, we are required to carry this business at the lower of fair value or historical cost basis. This resulted in us recording an after tax loss of $52 million from discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2010, primarily due to adjusting the value of this business to its estimated fair value. The following table summarizes the carrying value of the Purchased Paper Non Mortgage portfolio: December 31, December 31, December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Carrying value of purchased paper $ 95 $ 285 $ 544 52 Gains on Debt Repurchases We began repurchasing our outstanding debt in the second quarter of 2008. We repurchased $4.9 billion, $3.4 billion and $1.9 billion face amount of our senior unsecured notes for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Since the second quarter of 2008, we repurchased $10.2 billion face amount of our senior unsecured notes in the aggregate, with maturity dates ranging from 2008 to 2016. Mortgage and Other Loans Also included in this segment are our mortgage and other loan portfolios, which totaled $271 million at December 31, 2010. We are no longer originating mortgage and other loans. Overhead Corporate overhead is comprised of costs related to executive management, the board of directors, accounting, finance, legal, human resources and stock option expense. Information technology costs are related to infrastructure and operations. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, operating expenses for the Other segment totaled $270 million, $243 million and $253 million, respectively. 2010 versus 2009 Operating expenses increased $27 million from 2009 to 2010. This increase in corporate overhead was primarily attributable to increased technology costs associated with disaster recovery modernization, enterprise architecture and information security upgrades. 53 Financial Condition This section provides additional information regarding the changes related to our loan portfolio assets and related liabilities as well as credit performance indicators related to our loan portfolio. Many of these disclosures will show both GAAP basis as well as Core Earnings basis disclosures. Because certain trusts were not consolidated prior to the adoption of the new consolidation accounting guidance on January 1, 2010, these trusts were treated as off balance sheet for GAAP purposes but we considered them on balance sheet for Core Earnings purposes. Subsequent to the adoption of the new consolidation accounting guidance on January 1, 2010, this difference no longer exists because all of our trusts are treated as on balance sheet for GAAP purposes. Below and elsewhere in the document, Core Earnings basis disclosures include all historically (pre January 1, 2010) off balance sheet trusts as though they were on balance sheet. We believe that providing Core Earnings basis disclosures is meaningful because when we evaluate the performance and risk characteristics of the Company we have always considered the effect of any off balance sheet trusts as though they were on balance sheet. Average Balance Sheets GAAP The following table reflects the rates earned on interest earning assets and paid on interest bearing liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

We believe this decline was a result of a variety of factors, including an overall increase in the use of federal financial aid and consumer deleveraging. 61 The following table summarizes our Private Education Loan originations. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Total Private Education Loan Originations $ 2,307 $ 3,176 $ 6,336 FFELP Loan Portfolio Performance FFELP Delinquencies and Forbearance The tables below present our FFELP Loan delinquency trends as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Delinquencies have the potential to adversely impact earnings as they are an indication of the borrowers potential to possibly default and as a result require a higher loan loss reserve than loans in current status. Delinquent loans also require increased servicing and collection efforts, resulting in higher operating costs.

Use of Forbearance as a Private Education Loan Collection Tool Forbearance involves granting the borrower a temporary cessation of payments (or temporary acceptance of smaller than scheduled payments) for a specified period of time. Using forbearance extends the original term of the loan. Forbearance does not grant any reduction in the total repayment obligation (principal or interest). While in forbearance status, interest continues to accrue and is capitalized to principal when the loan re enters repayment status. Our forbearance policies include limits on the number of forbearance months granted consecutively and the total number of forbearance months granted over the life of the loan. In some instances, we require good faith payments before granting forbearance. Exceptions to forbearance policies are permitted when such exceptions are judged to increase the likelihood of collection of the loan. Forbearance as a collection tool is used most effectively when applied based on a borrowers unique situation, including historical information and judgments. We leverage updated borrower information and other decision support tools to best determine who will be granted forbearance based on our expectations as to a borrowers ability and willingness to repay their obligation. This strategy is aimed at mitigating the overall risk of the portfolio as well as encouraging cash resolution of delinquent loans. Forbearance may be granted to borrowers who are exiting their grace period to provide additional time to obtain employment and income to support their obligations, or to current borrowers who are faced with a hardship and request forbearance time to provide temporary payment relief. In these circumstances, a borrowers loan is placed into a forbearance status in limited monthly increments and is reflected in the forbearance status at month end during this time. At the end of their granted forbearance period, the borrower 70 will enter repayment status as current and is expected to begin making their scheduled monthly payments on a go forward basis. Forbearance may also be granted to borrowers who are delinquent in their payments. In these circumstances, the forbearance cures the delinquency and the borrower is returned to a current repayment status. In more limited instances, delinquent borrowers will also be granted additional forbearance time. As we have obtained further experience about the effectiveness of forbearance, we have reduced the amount of time a loan will spend in forbearance, thereby increasing our ongoing contact with the borrower to encourage consistent repayment behavior once the loan is returned to a current repayment status. As a result, the balance of loans in a forbearance status as of month end has decreased since 2008. In addition, the monthly average number of loans granted forbearance as a percentage of loans in repayment and forbearance declined to 5.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with the year ago quarter of 5.6 percent. As of December 31, 2010, 2.4 percent of loans in current status were delinquent as of the end of the prior month, but were granted a forbearance that made them current as of December 31, 2010 (borrowers made payments on approximately 20 percent of these loans prior to being granted forbearance). The table below reflects the historical effectiveness of using forbearance. Our experience has shown that three years after being granted forbearance for the first time, 68 percent of the loans are current, paid in full, or receiving an in school grace or deferment, and 17 percent have defaulted. The default experience associated with loans which utilize forbearance is considered in our allowance for loan losses. Tracking by First Time in Forbearance Compared to All Loans Entering Repayment Status distribution Status distribution 36 months after Status distribution 36 months after being granted 36 months after entering repayment for forbearance entering repayment loans never entering for the first time (all loans) forbearance In school/grace/deferment 9.2 % 8.5 % 4.1 % Current 50.2 57.4 64.1 Delinquent 31 60 days 3.1 2.0 0.4 Delinquent 61 90 days 1.9 1.1 0.2 Delinquent greater than 90 days 4.8 2.7 0.3 Forbearance 4.7 3.5 Defaulted 17.4 9.1 4.8 Paid 8.7 15.7 26.1 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 71 The tables below show the composition and status of the Core Earnings basis Private Education Loan portfolio aged by number of months in active repayment status (months for which a scheduled monthly payment was due). As indicated in the tables, the percentage of loans in forbearance status decreases the longer the loans have been in active repayment status. At December 31, 2010, loans in forbearance status as a percentage of loans in repayment and forbearance were 6.2 percent for loans that have been in active repayment status for less than 25 months.

If actual periodic recoveries are less than expected, the difference is charged off and immediately included in provision expense. 73 The following tables summarize the activity in the receivable for partially charged off loans for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Private Education Loan Repayment Options Certain loan programs allow borrowers to select from a variety of repayment options depending on their loan type and their enrollment/loan status, which include the ability to extend their repayment term or change their monthly payment. The chart below provides the optional repayment offerings in addition to the standard level principal and interest payments as of December 31, 2010. Loan Program Signature and Career (Dollars in millions) Other Smart Option Training Total $ in Repayment $23,179 $2,532 $2,141 $ 27,852 $ in Total 32,779 2,536 2,217 37,532 Payment method by enrollment status: In school/Grace Deferred(1) Interest only or fixed $25/month Interest only or fixed $25/month Repayment Level principal and interest or graduated Level principal and interest Level principal and interest (1) Deferred includes loans for which no payments are required and interest charges are capitalized into the loan balance. The graduated repayment program that is part of Signature and Other Loans includes an interest only payment option. This program is available to borrowers in repayment, after their grace period, who would like a temporary lower payment from the required principal and interest payment amount. Borrowers participating in this program pay monthly interest with no amortization of their principal balance for up to 48 payments after entering repayment (dependent on the loan product type). The maturity date of the loan is not extended when a borrower participates in this program. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, borrowers in repayment owing approximately $7.5 billion (27 percent of loans in repayment) and $7.0 billion (29 percent of loans in repayment), respectively, were enrolled in the interest only program. 74 Liquidity and Capital Resources Funding and Liquidity Risk Management The following Liquidity and Capital Resources discussion concentrates on our FFELP Loans and Consumer Lending segments. Our Business Services and Other segments need little capital. We define liquidity risk as the potential inability to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations, on or off balance sheet, as they come due, as well as the potential inability to originate Private Education Loans. Our primary liquidity objective is to ensure our ongoing ability to meet our funding needs for our businesses throughout market cycles, including during periods of financial stress. Our two primary liquidity needs are funding the originations of Private Education Loans and retiring unsecured debt when it matures. To achieve that objective we analyze and monitor our liquidity needs, maintain excess liquidity and access diverse funding sources including the issuance of unsecured debt, the issuance of secured debt primarily through asset backed securitizations and or financing facilities and through deposits at Sallie Mae Bank (the Bank), our Utah industrial bank subsidiary. We define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high quality liquid unencumbered securities, that we can use to meet our funding requirements as those obligations arise. Our primary liquidity risk relates to our ability to fund new originations and raise replacement funding at a reasonable cost as our unsecured debt matures. In addition, we must continue to obtain funding at reasonable rates to meet our other business obligations and to continue to grow our business. Key risks associated with our liquidity relates to our ability to access the capital markets and access them at reasonable rates. This ability may be affected by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions, including over the counter derivatives. Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions subject to ongoing review by the ratings agencies and may change from time to time based on our financial performance, industry dynamics and other factors. Other factors that influence our credit ratings include the ratings agencies assessment of the general operating environment, our relative positions in the markets in which we compete, reputation, liquidity position, the level and volatility of earnings, corporate governance and risk management policies, capital position and capital management practices. A negative change in our credit rating could have a negative effect on our liquidity because it would raise the cost and availability of funding and potentially require additional cash collateral or restrict cash currently held as collateral on existing borrowings or derivative collateral arrangements. It is our objective to improve our credit ratings so that we can continue to access the capital markets even in difficult economic and market conditions. We expect to fund our ongoing liquidity needs, including the origination of new Private Education Loans and the repayment of $4.4 billion of senior unsecured notes to mature in the next twelve months, primarily through our current cash and investment position and very predictable operating cash flows provided by earnings and repayment of principal on unencumbered student loan assets, distributions from our securitization trusts (including servicing fees which are priority payments within the trusts), as well as drawdowns under the 2010 ABCP Facility, the issuance of term ABS, the collection of additional term bank deposits and the issuance of unsecured debt. We primarily fund our student loan originations at the Bank. Currently, new Private Education Loan originations are initially funded through deposits. We plan to subsequently securitize these loans to term on a programmatic basis. We currently have $2 billion of cash at the Bank available to fund future originations. We no longer originate FFELP Loans and therefore no longer have liquidity requirements for new FFELP Loan originations. In 2009, we began using the ED Conduit Program (see ED Funding Programs of this Item 7 for a discussion of this program) to fund older FFELP Stafford and PLUS Loans. In addition, in 2008 we began funding new FFELP Stafford and PLUS Loan originations for AY 2008 2009 pursuant to EDs Loan Purchase Commitment Program (the Purchase Program) and Loan Participation Purchase Program (the Participation Program).We discuss these liquidity sources below. 75 We continued to use EDs Purchase and Participation Programs to fund FFELP Stafford and PLUS Loans disbursed through September 30, 2010 (see Item 1 Business Recent Legislation for a further discussion regarding the end of new FFELP Loan originations as of July 1, 2010). Primary Sources of Liquidity and Available Capacity The following table details our main sources of primary liquidity and the available capacity at December 31, 2010 and 2009. December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 (Dollars in millions) Available Capacity Available Capacity Sources of primary liquidity for general corporate purposes: Unrestricted cash and liquid investments: Cash and cash equivalents $ 4,342 $ 6,070 Commercial paper and asset backed commercial paper 1,150 Other 85 131 Total unrestricted cash and liquid investments(1)(2)(3) 4,427 7,351 Unused commercial paper and bank lines of credit(4) 3,485 Available borrowings to the extent collateral exists: FFELP ABCP facilities(5) 3,937 1,703 FHLB DM facility(5) 8,664 Total sources of primary liquidity for general corporate purposes(6) $ 17,028 $ 12,539 (1) At December 31, 2010 and 2009, excludes $0 and $25 million, respectively, of investments pledged as collateral related to certain derivative positions and $872 million and $708 million, respectively, of other non liquid investments, classified as investments on our balance sheet in accordance with GAAP. (2) At December 31, 2010 and 2009, includes $684 million and $821 million, respectively, of cash collateral pledged by derivative counterparties and held in our unrestricted cash. (3) At December 31, 2010 and 2009, includes $2.0 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, of cash and liquid investments at the Bank. This cash will be used primarily to originate or acquire student loans. (4) On November 24, 2010, our remaining bank line of credit was retired. (5) Borrowing capacity is subject to availability of collateral. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had $1.5 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, of outstanding unencumbered FFELP Loans, net, available for use in either the FFELP ABCP facilities or FHLB DM facility. (6) General corporate purposes primarily include originating Private Education Loans and repaying unsecured debt as it matures. In addition to the assets listed in the table above, we hold a number of other unencumbered assets, consisting primarily of Private Education Loans and other assets. At December 31, 2010, we had a total of $22.3 billion of unencumbered assets, excluding goodwill and acquired intangibles. Total student loans, net, comprised $12.6 billion of this unencumbered asset total, of which $11.1 billion are Private Education Loans, net, and $1.5 billion are FFELP Loans, net. 76 The following table reconciles encumbered and unencumbered assets and their net impact on total tangible equity. December 31, December 31, (Dollars in billions) 2010 2009 Net assets of consolidated variable interest entities $ 13.1 $ 12.7 Tangible unencumbered assets(2) 22.3 30.1 Unsecured debt (26.9 ) (35.1 ) Mark to market on unsecured hedged debt(1) (1.4 ) (1.9 ) Other liabilities, net (2.6 ) (1.7 ) Total tangible equity $ 4.5 $ 4.1 (1) At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, there were $1.4 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, of net gains on derivatives hedging this debt in unencumbered assets, which partially offset these losses. (2) Excludes goodwill and acquired intangible assets. ED Funding Programs Pursuant to ECASLA, in 2009, ED published summary terms under which it will purchase eligible FFELP Stafford and PLUS Loans from a conduit vehicle established to provide funding for eligible student lenders (the ED Conduit Program). Loans eligible for the ED Conduit Program must be first disbursed on or after October 1, 2003, but not later than July 1, 2009, and fully disbursed before September 30, 2009, and meet certain other requirements, including those relating to borrower benefits. The ED Conduit Program was launched in May 2009 and accepted eligible loans through July 1, 2010. The ED Conduit Program expires on January 19, 2014. Funding for the ED Conduit Program is provided by the capital markets at a cost based on market rates, with advance rates of 97 percent of the student loan face amount. If the conduit does not have sufficient funds to make the required payments on the notes issued by the conduit, then the notes will be repaid with funds from the Federal Financing Bank (FFB). The FFB will hold the notes for a short period of time and, if at the end of that time, the notes still cannot be paid off, the underlying FFELP Loans that serve as collateral to the ED Conduit will be sold to ED through a put agreement at a price of 97 percent of the face amount of the loans. As of December 31, 2010, approximately $24.2 billion face amount of our Stafford and PLUS Loans were funded through the ED Conduit Program. Our intent is to term securitize the loans that are in this facility before the facility expires on January 19, 2014. We are exposed to the risk associated with this program ending in 2014. The amount of loans exposed to this refinance risk will decline over time as the loans pay down. If we are not able to successfully refinance the loans before the facility expires, we will sell them to ED at a price of 97 percent of face value. In 2008, ED implemented the Participation Program pursuant to ECASLA. In October 2010, we sold $20.4 billion of loans to ED and paid off $20.3 billion of advances outstanding under the Participation Program. This program is no longer in effect and is not available as a funding source. Sallie Mae Bank In 2008, the Bank began expanding its deposit base to fund new Private Education Loan originations. The Bank raises deposits through intermediaries in the retail brokered Certificate of Deposit (CD) market and through direct retail deposit channels. As of December 31, 2010, total bank deposits were $5.9 billion, of which $4.5 billion were brokered deposits and $1.4 billion were retail and other deposits. Cash and liquid investments totaled $2.0 billion. In addition to its deposit base, the Bank has borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) through a collateralized lending facility. Borrowing capacity is limited by the availability of acceptable collateral. As of December 31, 2010, borrowing capacity was approximately $650 million and there were no outstanding borrowings. 77 ABS Transactions In early 2009, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York initiated a program, The Term Asset Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF), to facilitate renewed issuance of eligible consumer and small business ABS with a term of up to five years. For student loan collateral, TALF expired on March 31, 2010. During the program, we completed five transactions totaling $7.5 billion which were TALF eligible. Under this program we have $5.3 billion of ABS outstanding where we have the option to call the bonds at a discount between 2011 and 2014. In 2010, we completed three Private Education Loan ABS transactions totaling $4.1 billion. In 2010, we completed two FFELP long term ABS transactions totaling $2.0 billion. Although we have demonstrated our continued access to the ABS market and we expect ABS financing to remain a primary source of funding over the long term, we also expect our transaction volumes to be more limited and pricing less favorable than prior to the credit market dislocation that began in the summer of 2007, with significantly reduced opportunities to place subordinated tranches of ABS with investors. Asset Backed Financing (ABCP) Facilities In early 2008, we entered into two new asset backed financing facilities (the 2008 Asset Backed Financing Facilities) to fund FFELP Loans. In 2009, the FFELP facilities were subsequently amended and reduced and in early 2010 we terminated these facilities and entered into new multi year ABCP facilities (the 2010 Facility) which will continue to provide funding for our federally guaranteed student loans. The 2010 Facility provides for maximum funding of $10 billion for the first year, $5 billion for the second year and $2 billion for the third year. The underlying cost of borrowing under the 2010 Facility for the first year is expected to be commercial paper issuance cost plus 0.50 percent, excluding up front commitment and unused fees. Borrowings under the 2010 Facility are non recourse and the maximum amount we may borrow under the 2010 Facility is limited based on certain factors, including market conditions and the fair value of student loans in the facility. The 2010 Facility is subject to termination under certain circumstances. The principal financial covenants in this facility require us to maintain consolidated tangible net worth of at least $1.38 billion at all times. Consolidated tangible net worth as calculated for purposes of this covenant was $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2010. The covenants also require us to meet either a minimum interest coverage ratio or a minimum net adjusted revenue test based on the four preceding quarters adjusted Core Earnings financial performance. We were compliant with both of the minimum interest coverage ratio and the minimum net adjusted revenue tests as of the quarter ended December 31, 2010. Increases in the borrowing rate of up to LIBOR plus 4.50 percent could occur if certain asset coverage ratio thresholds are not met. Failure to pay off the 2010 Facility on the maturity date or to reduce amounts outstanding below the annual maximum step downs will result in a 90 day extension of the 2010 Facility with the interest rate increasing from LIBOR plus 2.00 percent to LIBOR plus 3.00 percent over that period. If, at the end of the 90 day extension, these required paydown amounts have not been made, the collateral can be foreclosed. As of December 31, 2010, there was approximately $5.9 billion outstanding in this facility. The book basis of the assets securing this facility at December 31, 2010 was $6.4 billion. On January 14, 2011, we amended the 2010 Asset Backed Financing Facility, which will continue to provide funding for our federally guaranteed student loans, expanding the size and extending the maturity. The facility amount is now $7.5 billion, reflecting an increase of $2.5 billion over the previously scheduled facility reduction. The facility size will decrease by $2.5 billion annually with a scheduled maturity date of January 10, 2014. Federal Home Loan Bank in Des Moines (FHLB DM) In early 2010, HICA Education Loan Corporation (HICA), a subsidiary of the Company, entered into a lending agreement with the FHLB DM. Under the agreement, the FHLB DM will provide advances backed by Federal Housing Finance Agency approved collateral which includes federally guaranteed student loans (but does not include Private Education Loans). The amount, price and tenor of future advances will vary and be subject to the agreements borrowing conditions as then in effect determined at the time of each borrowing. The maximum amount that can be borrowed, as of December 31, 2010, subject to available collateral, is approximately $9.6 billion. As of December 31, 2010, borrowing under the facility totaled $900 million and was secured by $1.2 billion of 78 FFELP Loans. We have provided a guarantee to the FHLB DM for the performance and payment of HICAs obligations. Senior Unsecured Debt We issue unsecured debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve cost efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile. While the cost and availability of unsecured funding may be negatively affected by general market conditions or by matters specific to the financial services industry or Sallie Mae, we seek to mitigate refinancing risk by actively managing the amount of our borrowings that we anticipate will mature within any month, quarter or year. Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions (other than a change in control would allow $4 billion of these obligations as of December 31, 2010, to be put at 101 percent) that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity, or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price. We issue unsecured debt when the pricing for the term of the debt is favorable relative to our other funding options and our overall liquidity position. In 2010 we issued $1.5 billion of unsecured debt maturing in 2020 and an all in cost of LIBOR plus 4.65 percent. On January 11, 2011, we announced and priced a $2 billion five year 6.25 percent fixed rate unsecured bond. The bond was issued to yield 6.50 percent before underwriting fees. The rate on the bond was swapped from a fixed rate to a floating rate equal to an all in cost of one month LIBOR plus 4.46 percent. The proceeds of this bond will be used for general corporate purposes. We also repurchase our outstanding unsecured debt in both open market repurchases and public tender offers. Repurchasing debt helps us better manage our short term and long term funding needs. In 2010 we repurchased $4.9 billion face amount of our senior unsecured notes in the aggregate, with maturity dates ranging from 2010 to 2014, which resulted in a total gain of $317 million. Counterparty Exposure Counterparty exposure related to financial instruments arises from the risk that a lending, investment or derivative counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations to us. Risks associated with our lending portfolio are discussed in Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition FFELP Loan Portfolio Performance and Consumer Lending Portfolio Performance. Our investment portfolio is composed of very short term securities issued by highly rated issuers limiting our counterparty exposure. Additionally, our investing activity is governed by Board approved limits on the amount that is allowed to be invested with any one issuer based on the credit rating of the issuer, further minimizing our counterparty exposure. Counterparty credit risk is considered when valuing investments and considering impairment. Related to derivative transactions, protection against counterparty risk is generally provided by International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) Credit Support Annexes (CSAs). CSAs require a counterparty to post collateral if a potential default would expose the other party to a loss. All derivative contracts entered into by SLM Corporation and the Bank are covered under such agreements and require collateral to be exchanged based on the net fair value of derivatives with each counterparty. Our securitization trusts require collateral in all cases if the counterpartys credit rating is withdrawn or downgraded below a certain level. Additionally, securitizations involving foreign currency notes issued after November 2005 also require the counterparty to post collateral to the trust based on the fair value of the derivative, regardless of credit rating. The trusts are not required to post collateral to the counterparties. In all cases, our exposure is limited to the value of the derivative contracts in a gain position net of any collateral we are holding. We consider counterparties credit risk when determining the fair value of derivative positions on our exposure net of collateral. 79 We have liquidity exposure related to collateral movements between us and our derivative counterparties. Movements in the value of the derivatives, which are primarily affected by changes in interest rate and foreign exchange rates, may require us to return cash collateral held or may require us to access primary liquidity to post collateral to counterparties. If our credit ratings are downgraded from current levels, we may be required to segregate unrestricted cash collateral into restricted accounts. The table below highlights exposure related to our derivative counterparties at December 31, 2010.

Timing of obligations is estimated based on our current projection of prepayment speeds of the securitized assets. (2) The aggregate principal amount of debt that matures in each period is $16.3 billion, $32.4 billion, $24.6 billion and $88.7 billion, respectively. Specifically excludes derivative market value adjustments of $2.6 billion for long term notes. Interest obligations on notes are predominantly variable in nature, resetting quarterly based on 3 month LIBOR. Unrecognized tax benefits were $39 million and $101 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. For additional information, see Note 18 Income Taxes. 81 Off Balance Sheet Lending Arrangements We have issued lending related financial instruments, including lines of credit, to meet the financing needs of our institutional customers. In connection with these agreements, we also enter into a participation agreement with the institution to participate in the loans as they are originated. In the event that a line of credit is drawn upon, the loan is collateralized by underlying student loans and is usually participated on the same day. The contractual amount of these financial instruments, $50 million at December 31, 2010, represents the maximum possible credit risk should the counterparty draw down the commitment, we do not participate in the loan, and the counterparty subsequently fails to perform according to the terms of our contract. The remaining total contractual amount available to be borrowed under these commitments is $50 million. All commitments mature in 2011. We do not believe that these instruments are representative of our actual future credit exposure; to the extent that the lines of credit are drawn upon, the balance outstanding is collateralized by student loans. At December 31, 2010, there were no outstanding draws on lines of credit. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations addresses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP). Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates its estimates, particularly those that include the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and are often about matters that are inherently uncertain. The most significant judgments, estimates and assumptions relate to the following critical accounting policies that are discussed in more detail below. Allowance for Loan Losses When calculating the allowance for loan loss for Private Education Loans we estimate the amount of our customers who will default over the next two years and how much we will recover over time related to the defaulted amount. Our historical experience indicates that, on average, the time between the date that a borrower experiences a default causing event (e.g., the loss trigger event) and the date that we charge off the unrecoverable portion of that loan is two years. In estimating the amount of defaults we expect to have over the next two years we divide the portfolio into categories of similar risk characteristics based on loan program type, school type, loan status (in school, grace, forbearance, repayment and delinquency), seasoning (number of months in active repayment for which a scheduled payment was due), underwriting criteria (credit scores), and existence or absence of a cosigner. The primary characteristics we use are school type, credit scores, cosigner status, loan status and seasoning. We start with historical experience of customer default behavior. We make judgments about which historical period to start with and then make further judgments about whether that historical experience is representative of future expectations and whether additional adjustment may be needed to those historical default rates. We also take into account the current and future economic environment when calculating the allowance for loan loss. We analyze key economic statistics and the effect they will have on future defaults. Key economic statistics analyzed as part of the allowance for loan loss are unemployment rates (total and specific to college graduates) and other asset type delinquency rates (credit cards, mortgages). Significantly more judgment has been required over the last three years, compared with years prior, in light of the U.S. economy and its effect on our customers ability to pay their obligations. In addition to making judgments about the amount of defaults that will occur over the next two years we also make judgments about how much we will subsequently recover from a defaulted customer and when that recovery will occur. Similar to estimating defaults, we begin with historical recovery performance when projecting future recoveries and use judgment in determining whether historical performance is representative of what we expect to recover in the future. 82 FFELP Loans are guaranteed as to their principal and accrued interest in the event of default subject to a Risk Sharing level based on the date of loan disbursement. For loans disbursed after October 1, 1993, and before July 1, 2006, we receive 98 percent reimbursement on all qualifying default claims. For loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2006, we receive 97 percent reimbursement. For loans disbursed prior to October 1, 1993, we receive 100 percent reimbursement. Similar to the allowance for Private Education Loan losses, the allowance for FFELP Loan losses uses historical experience of borrower default behavior and a two year loss confirmation period to estimate the credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio at the reporting date. We apply the default rate projections, net of applicable Risk Sharing, to each category for the current period to perform our quantitative calculation. Once the quantitative calculation is performed, we review the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and determine if qualitative adjustments need to be considered. Premium and Discount Amortization The most judgmental estimate for premium and discount amortization on student loans is the Constant Prepayment Rate (CPR), which measures the rate at which loans in the portfolio pay down principal compared to their stated terms. Loan consolidation, default, term extension and other prepayment factors affecting our CPR estimates are affected by changes in our business strategy, changes in our competitors business strategies, FFELP legislative changes, interest rates and changes to the current economic and credit environment. When we determine the CPR we begin with historical prepayment rates due to consolidation activity, defaults, payoffs and term extensions from the utilization of forbearance. We make judgments about which historical period to start with and then make further judgments about whether that historical experience is representative of future expectations and whether additional adjustment may be needed to those historical prepayment rates. In the past the consolidation of FFELP Loans and Private Education Loans significantly affected our CPRs and updating those assumptions often resulted in material adjustments to our amortization expense. As a result of the CCRAA and the current U.S. economic and credit environment, we, as well as many other industry competitors, have suspended our FFELP Loans consolidation program and Private Education Loans consolidation program. We do not expect to consolidate FFELP Loans in the future and do not currently expect others to actively consolidate our FFELP Loans. As a result, we expect CPRs related to our FFELP Loans to remain relatively stable over time. We expect that in the future both we and our competitors will begin to consolidate Private Education Loans. This is built into the CPR assumption we use for Private Education Loans. However, it is difficult to accurately project the timing and level at which this consolidation activity will begin and our assumption may need to be updated by a material amount in the future based on changes in the economy and marketplace. The level of defaults is a significant component of our FFELP Loan and Private Education Loan CPR. This component of the FFELP Loan and Private Education Loan CPR is estimated in the same manner as discussed in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Allowance for Loan Loss of this Item 7 the only difference is for premium and discount amortization purposes the estimate of defaults is a life of loan estimate whereas for allowance for loan loss it is a two year estimate. Fair Value Measurement The most significant assumptions used in fair value measurements, including those related to credit and liquidity risk, are as follows: 1. Investments Our investments primarily consist of overnight/weekly maturity instruments with high credit quality counterparties. However, we consider credit and liquidity risk involving specific instruments in determining their fair value and, when appropriate, have adjusted the fair value of these instruments for the effect of credit and liquidity risk. These assumptions have further been validated by the successful maturity of these investments in the period immediately following the end of the reporting period. 2. Derivatives When determining the fair value of derivatives, we take into account counterparty credit risk for positions where we are exposed to the counterparty on a net basis by assessing exposure net of collateral held. The net exposure for each counterparty is adjusted based on market 83 information available for that specific counterparty, including spreads from credit default swaps. Additionally, when the counterparty has exposure to us related to our derivatives, we fully collateralize the exposure, minimizing the adjustment necessary to the derivative valuations for our own credit risk. Trusts that contain derivatives are not required to post collateral to counterparties as the credit quality and securitized nature of the trusts minimizes any adjustments for the counterpartys exposure to the trusts. Adjustments related to credit risk reduced the overall value of our derivatives by $72 million as of December 31, 2010. We also take into account changes in liquidity when determining the fair value of derivative positions. We adjusted the fair value of certain less liquid positions downward by approximately $129 million to take into account a significant reduction in liquidity as of December 31, 2010, related primarily to basis swaps indexed to interest rate indices with inactive markets. A major indicator of market inactivity is the widening of the bid/ask spread in these markets. In general, the widening of counterparty credit spreads and reduced liquidity for derivative instruments as indicated by wider bid/ask spreads will reduce the fair value of derivatives. In addition, certain cross currency interest rate swaps hedging foreign currency denominated reset rate and amortizing notes in our on balance sheet trusts contain extension features that coincide with the remarketing dates of the notes. The valuation of the extension feature requires significant judgment based on internally developed inputs. 3. Student Loans Our FFELP Loans and Private Education Loans are accounted for at cost or at the lower of cost or fair value if the loan is held for sale. The fair values of our student loans are disclosed in Note 15 Fair Value Measurements. For both FFELP Loans and Private Education Loans accounted for at cost, fair value is determined by modeling loan level cash flows using stated terms of the assets and internally developed assumptions to determine aggregate portfolio yield, net present value and average life. The significant assumptions used to project cash flows are prepayment speeds, default rates, cost of funds, and required return on equity. In addition, the Floor Income component of our FFELP Loan portfolio is valued through discounted cash flow and option models using both observable market inputs and internally developed inputs. Significant inputs into the models are not generally market observable. They are either derived internally through a combination of historical experience and managements qualitative expectation of future performance (in the case of prepayment speeds, default rates, and capital assumptions) or are obtained through external broker quotes (as in the case of cost of funds). When possible, market transactions are used to validate the model. In most cases, these are either infrequent or not observable. For FFELP Loans classified as held for sale and accounted for at the lower of cost or market, the fair value is based on the committed sales price of the various loan purchase programs established by ED. For further information regarding the effect of our use of fair values on our results of operations, see Note 15 Fair Value Measurements. Transfers of Financial Assets and the Variable Interest Entity (VIE) Consolidation Model Changes in Accounting Principles effective January 1, 2010 The new consolidation accounting adopted on January 1, 2010 significantly changed the consolidation model for Variable Interest Entities (VIEs). This new rule, among other things, (1) eliminated the exemption for QSPEs, (2) provided a new approach for determining who should consolidate a VIE that is more focused on control rather than economic interest, (3) changed when it is necessary to reassess who should consolidate a VIE and (4) required additional disclosure. Under these new rules, if we have a variable interest in a VIE and we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE then we will consolidate the VIE. We are the considered the primary beneficiary if we have both: (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. There is considerable judgment that has to be used as it relates to determining who is the primary beneficiary of the VIEs with which we are associated. There are no bright line tests. Rather, the assessment of who has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most 84 significantly affects the VIEs economic performance and who has the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE is very qualitative and judgmental in nature. However, based on our current relationship with our securitization trusts and other financing vehicles which are considered VIEs, we believe the assessment is more straightforward. As it relates to our securitized assets, we are the servicer of those securitized assets (which means we have the power to direct the activities of the trust) and we own the Residual Interest (which means we have the loss and gain obligation that could potentially be significant to the VIE) of the securitization trusts. As a result we are the primary beneficiary of our securitization trusts and other financing vehicles. See Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies for further details regarding the adoption of these new rules on January 1, 2010. Derivative Accounting The most significant judgments related to derivative accounting are: (1) concluding the derivative is an effective hedge and qualifies for hedge accounting and (2) determining the fair value of certain derivatives and hedged items. To qualify for hedge accounting a derivative must be concluded to be a highly effective hedge upon designation and on an ongoing basis. There are no bright line tests on what is considered a highly effective hedge. We use a historical regression analysis to prove ongoing and prospective hedge effectiveness. See previous discussion under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Fair Value Measurement of this Item 7 for significant judgments related to the valuation of derivatives. Although some of our valuations are more judgmental than others, we compare the fair values of our derivatives that we calculate to those provided by our counterparties on a monthly basis. We view this as a critical control which helps validate these judgments. Any significant differences with our counterparties are identified and resolved appropriately. Goodwill and Intangible Assets In determining annually (or more frequently if required) whether goodwill is impaired, we determine whether an event has occurred that would indicate to us that there is the potential for the fair value of the business unit to fall below the book basis of the equity of that business unit. If we determine that this event has occurred, we perform an analysis to determine the fair value of the business unit. There are significant judgments involved in determining the fair value of a business unit, including assumptions regarding estimates of future cash flows from existing and new business activities, customer relationships, the value of existing customer contracts, the value of other tangible and intangible assets, as well as assumptions regarding what we believe a third party willing to pay for all of the assets and liabilities of the business unit. This calculation requires us to estimate the appropriate discount and growth rates to apply to those projected cash flows and the appropriate control premium to apply to arrive at the final fair value. The business units for which we must estimate the fair value are not publically traded and often there is not comparable market data available for that individual business to aid in its valuation. We use a third party appraisal firm to provide an opinion on the fair values we conclude upon. Risk Management Processes Our Approach The monitoring, assessment and oversight of risk are shared responsibilities throughout the Company. Each business division is primarily responsible and accountable for managing risks specific to its area. Our executive management team and centralized support functions, including compliance, credit risk, human resources, legal, information technology, finance and accounting, are responsible for providing our business divisions with the training, systems and specialized expertise necessary to properly perform their risk management duties. Executive management, individually and through participation in various committees, are ultimately responsible for the management of risk across our businesses. Our Risk Assessment Department regularly monitors and reports to the Audit Committee of our Board of Director on the effectiveness of various aspects of our risk management activities. Our Code of Business Conduct and the on going training our employees receive in many compliance areas provide a framework for our employees to conduct themselves with the highest integrity. We instill a risk conscious culture through communications, training, policies and procedures. We have strengthened the 85 linkage between the management performance process and individual compensation to encourage employees to work toward corporate wide compliance goals. Our Risk Assessment Department monitors our various risk management and compliance efforts, identifies areas that require increased focus and resources, and reports significant control issues to executive management and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. At least annually, the Risk Assessment Department performs a risk assessment to identify our top risks, to develop the internal audit plan. Risks are rated on significance and likelihood of occurrence and communicated to our management team members who allocate appropriate attention and resources. Results of the assessment, including survey results, identified risks and recommendations, are reported to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors and its various committees oversee our overall strategic direction and provide direction to management as to its tolerance levels of various significant risks. Through its committees, our Board of Directors regularly reviews our risk management practices. Our Significant Risks Significant risks may be grouped into the following categories: (1) funding and liquidity; (2) operations; (3) political/reputation; (4) competition; (5) credit; and (6) regulatory and compliance. More specific descriptions of the particular risks of each type we currently face are discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors. Funding and Liquidity Risk Management Funding and liquidity risk is the potential inability to fund liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, fund asset growth and business operations, and meet contractual obligations at reasonable market rates. Our primary liquidity objective is to ensure our ongoing ability to meet our funding needs for our businesses throughout market cycles, including during periods of financial stress. Our two primary liquidity needs are originating Private Education Loans and retiring secured and unsecured debt when it matures. We define excess liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high quality liquid unencumbered securities, that we can use to meet our funding requirements as those obligations arise. Our primary liquidity risk relates to our ability to raise replacement funding and raise that funding at a reasonable cost as our secured and unsecured debt matures. In addition, we must continue to obtain funding at reasonable rates to meet our other business obligations and to continue to grow our business. Key risks associated with our liquidity relates to our ability to access the capital markets and access them at reasonable rates. This ability is directly affected by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions, including over the counter derivatives. A negative change in our credit rating would have a negative effect on our liquidity because it would raise the cost, diminish the availability of funding and potentially require additional cash collateral or restrict cash currently held as collateral on existing borrowings or derivative collateral arrangements. Our funding and liquidity risk management activities are centralized within our Corporate Finance Department, which is responsible for planning and executing our funding activities and strategies. We analyze and monitor our liquidity risk, maintain excess liquidity and access diverse funding. Funding and liquidity risk are overseen and recommendations approved via one or more management committees that manage market, interest rate and balance sheet risk. The Finance Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for approving our Asset and Liability Management Policy. The Finance Committee of the Board, and in some cases the full Board, monitor our liquidity on an ongoing basis. Our liquidity risk management activities are centralized within the Corporate Finance Department, which is responsible for planning and executing our funding activities and strategies. Operations Risk Management Operations risk arises from problems with service or product delivery or from nonconformance with internal policies and procedures. The Company is exposed to transaction risk when products, services or 86 delivery channels do not fit with our operational capacity, customer demands or strategic objectives. Operations risk can increase with the implementation of new information technology to support a new, expanded or modified product or service. Failed or flawed technology, either from error, inadequate capacity or fraud, may result in the inability to deliver products or services. Operations risk is managed by our managers with assistance and training provided by our centralized support functions. Additionally, the operations risks associated with new products and services, the security and confidentiality of information, the effectiveness of our technology infrastructure, the emergency loss of technology and other infrastructure resources, the monitoring of internal controls and compliance with internal control standards, and the monitoring and dissemination of changes in regulations affecting the business are each the subject of executive management review through committees established for these particular purposes. The Finance and Operations Committee of our Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for significant operational risks and receives periodic reports from executive management regarding the effectiveness of our risk management efforts in this area. Political and Reputation Risk Management Political and reputation risk is the risk that changes in laws and regulations or actions negatively impacting our reputation could affect the profitability and sustainability of our business. Management proactively assesses and manages political and reputation risk. Our government relations team of employees manages our review and response to all formal inquiries from members of Congress, state legislators, and their staff, including providing targeted messaging that reinforces our public policy goals. We review and consider political and reputational risks on an integrated basis in connection with the risk management oversight activities conducted in the various aspects of our business on matters as diverse as the launch of new products and services, our credit underwriting activities and how we fund our operations. Significant political and reputation risks are reported to and monitored by the Finance and Operations Committee of our Board of Directors. Competition Risk Management Competition risk is the risk of losing market share or the lack of market acceptance of our products due to our competitors competing more effectively. Management closely monitors competitors and conditions. We follow changes in product pricing and features and track marketing activity across a variety of distribution channels. In addition, we measure category participants brand recognition among key consumer groups. We continuously evaluate the size of the market and analyze market developments and trends that may impact future demand for student loans. Significant market competition risks are reported to and monitored by the Finance and Operations Committee of our Board of Directors. Credit and Counterparty Risk Management Credit and counterparty risk is the risk of loss stemming from one partys failure to repay a loan or otherwise meet a contractual obligation. We have credit or counterparty risk exposure with borrowers and co borrowers with whom we have made Private Education Loans, the various counterparties with whom we have entered into derivative contracts, the various issuers with whom we make investments, and with several higher education institutions related to academic facilities loans secured by real estate. The credit risk related to Private Education Loans are managed within a credit risk infrastructure which includes (i) a well defined underwriting and collection policy framework; (ii) an ongoing monitoring and review process of portfolio segments and trends; (iii) assignment and management of credit authorities and responsibilities; and (iv) establishment of an allowance for loan losses that covers estimated losses based upon 87 portfolio and economic analysis. This infrastructure is overseen by our Chief Credit Officer and the executive management committee that he chairs. Credit and counterparty risk related to derivative contracts is managed by reviewing counterparties for credit strength on an ongoing basis and via our credit policies, which place limits on the amount of exposure we may take with any one counterparty and, in most cases, require collateral to secure the position. The credit and counterparty risk associated with derivatives is measured based on the replacement cost should the counterparties with contracts in a gain position to the Company fail to perform under the terms of the contract. The credit and counterparty risk in our investment portfolio is minimized by only investing in paper with highly rated issuers and setting limits on our exposure per issuer. Credit and counterparty risk related to derivative contracts and our investment portfolio are approved and managed by our Credit Risk Management group overseen by our Chief Credit Officer. Significant credit and counterparty risks related to derivative contracts or our investment portfolio are reported to the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. Additionally, our Chief Credit Officer reports, on a regular basis, to the Board and the Audit Committee of the Board regarding the asset quality of our Private Education Loans. Regulatory and Compliance Risk Management Regulatory and compliance risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from violations of laws, rules, or regulations. The Company is exposed to regulatory and compliance risk when key areas such as our private education lending, collections or government loan servicing businesses are not properly monitored for compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and when an oversight program does not include appropriate audit and control features. We also face regulatory and compliance risk when new, expanded or modified products or services are not properly monitored for compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Primary ownership and responsibility for regulatory and compliance risk is placed with the business areas to manage their specific regulatory and compliance risks. Our Compliance Department supports these activities through providing extensive training and monitoring of our Code of Business Conduct, maintaining consumer lending regulatory and information security policies and procedures, and working in close coordination with our other centralized support functions such as our Legal department. Compliance risks associated with new products and services, SEC disclosure obligations, security and confidentiality of information and effectiveness of our technology infrastructure, internal controls and compliance with internal control standards, dissemination of changes in regulations affecting the business, and enforcement of credit lending policies and practices are each the subject of specific review by existing management committees. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has oversight with respect to establishing standards with respect to our monitoring and control of regulatory and compliance risks and the qualification of employees overseeing these risk management functions. The Audit Committee receives periodic reports from executive management team members responsible for the regulatory and compliance risk management functions. 88 Common Stock The following table summarizes our common share repurchases and issuances for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Years Ended December 31, (Shares in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Common shares repurchased: Open market Benefit plans(1) 1.1 .3 1.0 Total shares repurchased 1.1 .3 1.0 Average purchase price per share $ 13.44 $ 20.29 $ 24.51 Common shares issued 1.8 17.8 1.9 Authority remaining at end of period for repurchases 38.8 38.8 38.8 (1) Shares withheld from stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock for employees tax withholding obligations and shares tendered by employees to satisfy option exercise costs. During 2009, we converted $339 million of our Series C Preferred Stock to common stock. As part of this conversion, we delivered to the holders of the preferred stock: (1) approximately 17 million shares (the number of common shares they would most likely receive if the preferred stock they held mandatorily converted to common shares in the fourth quarter of 2010) plus (2) a discounted amount of the preferred stock dividends the holders of the preferred stock would have received if they held the preferred stock through the mandatory conversion date. The accounting treatment for this conversion resulted in additional dividends recorded as part of preferred stock dividends for the year of approximately $53 million. On December 15, 2010, the mandatory conversion date, the remaining 810,370 shares of our Series C Preferred Stock were converted into 41 million shares of common stock. The closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2010 was $12.59 89 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis Our interest rate risk management seeks to limit the impact of short term movements in interest rates on our results of operations and financial position. The following tables summarize the effect on earnings for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the effect on fair values at December 31, 2010 and 2009, based upon a sensitivity analysis performed by management assuming a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of 100 basis points and 300 basis points while funding spreads remain constant. Additionally, as it relates to the effect on earnings, a sensitivity analysis was performed assuming the funding index increases 25 basis points while holding the asset index constant, if the funding index is different than the asset index. Both of these analyses do not consider any potential mark to market losses that may occur related to our Residual Interests (prior to the adoption of topic updates on ASC 810 on January 1, 2010) that may result from asset and funding basis divergence or a higher discount rate that would be used to compute the present value of the cash flows if long term interest rates increased.

However, as discussed in Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Segment Earnings Summary Core Earnings Basis FFELP Loans Segment Floor Income Core Earnings Basis, we can have a fixed versus floating mismatch in funding if the student loan earns at the fixed borrower rate and the funding remains floating. In addition, we can have a mismatch in the index (including the frequency of reset) of floating rate debt versus floating rate assets. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, certain FFELP Loans were earning Floor Income and we locked in a portion of that Floor Income through the use of Floor Income Contracts. The result of these hedging transactions was to convert a portion of the fixed rate nature of student loans to variable rate, and to fix the relative spread between the student loan asset rate and the variable rate liability. 91 In the preceding tables, under the scenario where interest rates increase 100 and 300 basis points, the change in pre tax net income before the unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities is primarily due to the impact of (i) our unhedged on balance sheet loans being in a fixed rate mode due to the Embedded Floor Income, while being funded with variable debt in low interest rate environments; and (ii) a portion of our variable assets being funded with fixed debt. Item (i) will generally cause income to decrease when interest rates increase from a low interest rate environment, whereas item (ii) will generally offset this decrease. In the 100 and 300 basis point scenarios for the year ended December 31, 2010, the increase in income resulted from item (ii) having a greater impact than item (i). In the prior year period, item (i) resulted in a decrease to income in the 100 and 300 basis point scenarios. Under the scenario in the tables above labeled Asset and Funding Index Mismatches, the main driver of the decrease in pre tax income before unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities is the result of LIBOR based debt funding commercial paper indexed assets. See Asset and Liability Funding Gap of this Item 7A for a further discussion. Increasing the spread between indices will also impact the unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities as it relates to basis swaps. Basis swaps used to convert LIBOR based debt to indices that we believe are economic hedges of the indices of the assets being funded resulted in an unrealized losses of $(204) million and $(102) million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Offsetting this unrealized loss are basis swaps that economically hedge our Private Education Loan securitization trusts. Unrealized gains for these basis swaps totaled $176 million and $208 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The change from a net gain in the prior year period to a net loss in the current year period was the impact of basis swap hedges in securitization trusts that were previously off balance sheet prior to new consolidation accounting adopted on January 1, 2010 (see Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Transfers of Financial Assets and the VIE Consolidation Model for further discussion). In addition to interest rate risk addressed in the preceding tables, we are also exposed to risks related to foreign currency exchange rates. Foreign currency exchange risk is primarily the result of foreign currency denominated debt issued by us. As it relates to our corporate unsecured and securitization debt programs used to fund our business, our policy is to use cross currency interest rate swaps to swap all foreign currency denominated debt payments (fixed and floating) to U.S. dollar LIBOR using a fixed exchange rate. In the tables above, there would be an immaterial impact on earnings if exchange rates were to decrease or increase, due to the terms of the hedging instrument and hedged items matching. The balance sheet interest bearing liabilities would be affected by a change in exchange rates; however, the change would be materially offset by the cross currency interest rate swaps in other assets or other liabilities. In the current economic environment, volatility in the spread between spot and forward foreign exchange rates has resulted in material mark to market impacts to current period earnings which have not been factored into the above analysis. The earnings impact is noncash, and at maturity of the instruments the cumulative mark to market impact will be zero. 92 Asset and Liability Funding Gap The tables below present our assets and liabilities (funding) arranged by underlying indices as of December 31, 2010. In the following GAAP presentation, the funding gap only includes derivatives that qualify as effective hedges (those derivatives which are reflected in net interest margin, as opposed to those reflected in the gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities, net line on the consolidated statements of income). The difference between the asset and the funding is the funding gap for the specified index. This represents our exposure to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk, which is the risk that the different indices may reset at different frequencies or may not move in the same direction or at the same magnitude. Management analyzes interest rate risk and in doing so includes all derivatives that are economically hedging our debt whether they qualify as effective hedges or not (Core Earnings basis). Accordingly, we are also presenting the asset and liability funding gap on a Core Earnings basis in the table that follows the GAAP presentation. GAAP Basis Frequency of Index Variable Funding (Dollars in billions) Resets Assets Funding(1) Gap 3 month Commercial paper daily $ 139.2 $ .1 $ 139.1 3 month Treasury bill weekly 8.2 8.2 Prime annual .8 .8 Prime quarterly 5.4 5.4 Prime monthly 23.1 23.1 Prime daily 3.0 (3.0 ) PLUS Index annual .5 .5 3 month LIBOR daily 3 month LIBOR quarterly 132.1 (132.1 ) 1 month LIBOR monthly 7.3 15.3 (8.0 ) CMT/CPI Index monthly/quarterly 2.0 (2.0 ) Non Discrete reset(2) monthly 34.6 (34.6 ) Non Discrete reset(3) daily/weekly 11.5 2.3 9.2 Fixed Rate(4) 9.3 15.9 (6.6 ) Total $ 205.3 $ 205.3 $ (1) Funding includes all derivatives that qualify as hedges. (2) Funding consists of auction rate securities, the ABCP Facilities and the ED Conduit Program facility. (3) Assets include restricted and unrestricted cash equivalents and other overnight type instruments. Funding includes retail and other deposits and cash collateral held related to derivatives exposures that are recorded as a short term debt obligation. (4) Assets include receivables and other assets (including goodwill and acquired intangibles). Funding includes other liabilities and stockholders equity (excluding series B Preferred Stock). 93 The Funding Gaps in the above table are primarily interest rate mismatches in short term indices between our assets and liabilities. We address this issue typically through the use of basis swaps that typically convert quarterly reset three month LIBOR to other indices that are more correlated to our asset indices. These basis swaps do not qualify as effective hedges and as a result the effect on the funding index is not included in our interest margin and is therefore excluded from the GAAP presentation. Core Earnings Basis Index Frequency of Funding (Dollars in billions) Variable Resets Assets Funding(1) Gap 3 month Commercial paper daily $ 139.2 $ .1 $ 139.1 3 month Treasury bill weekly 8.2 2.0 6.2 Prime annual .8 .8 Prime quarterly 5.4 1.5 3.9 Prime monthly 23.1 8.6 14.5 Prime daily 3.0 (3.0 ) PLUS Index annual .5 .5 3 month LIBOR daily 55.5 (55.5 ) 3 month LIBOR quarterly 54.6 (54.6 ) 1 month LIBOR monthly 7.3 20.1 (12.8 ) 1 month LIBOR daily 9.0 (9.0 ) Non Discrete reset(2) monthly 34.6 (34.6 ) Non Discrete reset(3) daily/weekly 11.5 2.3 9.2 Fixed Rate(4) 6.6 11.3 (4.7 ) Total $ 202.6 $ 202.6 $ (1) Funding includes all derivatives that management considers economic hedges of interest rate risk and reflects how we internally manage our interest rate exposure. (2) Funding consists of auction rate securities, the ABCP Facilities and the ED Conduit Program facility. (3) Assets include restricted and unrestricted cash equivalents and other overnight type instruments. Funding includes retail and other deposits and cash collateral held related to derivatives exposures that are recorded as a short term debt obligation. (4) Assets include receivables and other assets (including goodwill and acquired intangibles). Funding includes other liabilities and stockholders equity (excluding series B Preferred Stock). We use interest rate swaps and other derivatives to achieve our risk management objectives. To the extent possible, we fund our assets with debt (in combination with derivatives) that has the same underlying index (index type and index reset frequency). When it is more economical, we also fund our assets with debt that has a different index and or reset frequency than the asset, but only in instances where we believe there is a high degree of correlation between the interest rate movement of the two indices. For example, we use daily reset three month LIBOR to fund a large portion of our daily reset three month commercial paper indexed assets. In addition, we use quarterly reset three month LIBOR to fund a portion of our quarterly reset Prime rate indexed Private Education Loans. We also use our monthly Non Discrete reset and 1 month LIBOR funding to fund various asset types. In using different index types and different index reset frequencies to fund our assets, we are exposed to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk, which is the risk that the different indices that may reset at different frequencies will not move in the same direction or at the same magnitude. While we believe that this risk is low, as all of these indices are short term with rate movements that are highly correlated over a long period of time, market disruptions can lead to a temporary divergence between indices as was experienced beginning in the second half of 2007 through the second quarter of 2009 with the commercial paper and LIBOR indices. As of December 31, 2010, we have approximately $92.6 billion of FFELP Loans indexed to three month commercial paper (3M CP) that are funded with debt indexed to 3M LIBOR. 94 Weighted Average Life The following table reflects the weighted average life for our earning assets and liabilities at December 31, 2010.

Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Counterparty Exposure. If our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer. Regulatory and Compliance. Our businesses are regulated by various state and federal laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in significant costs, sanctions, litigation or the loss of federal guarantees on affected FFELP Loans. Our businesses are subject to numerous state and federal laws and regulations and our failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in significant costs, including litigation costs, and or business sanctions. In addition, changes to such laws and regulations could adversely impact our business and results of operations if we are not able to adequately mitigate the impact of such changes. Our private credit lending and debt collection businesses are subject to regulation and oversight by various state and federal agencies, particularly in the area of consumer protection. Some state attorneys general have been active in this area of consumer protection regulation. We are subject, and may be subject in the future, to inquiries and audits from state and federal regulators as well as frequent litigation from private plaintiffs. The Bank is subject to state and FDIC regulation, oversight and regular examination. The FDIC and state regulators have the authority to impose fines, penalties or other limitations on the Banks operations should they conclude that its operations are not compliant with applicable laws and regulations. At the time of this filing, the Bank was the subject of a cease and desist order for weaknesses in its compliance function. While the issues addressed in the order have largely been remediated, the order has not yet been lifted. Our failure to comply with various laws and regulations or with the terms of the cease and desist order or to have issues raised during an examination could result in litigation expenses, fines, business sanctions, and limitations on our ability to fund our Private Education Loans, which are currently funded by deposits raised by the Bank, or restrictions on the operations of the Bank. The imposition of fines, penalties or other limitations on the Banks business could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Loans serviced under the FFELP are subject to the HEA and related regulations. Our servicing operations are designed and monitored to comply with the HEA, related regulations and program guidance; however ED could determine that we are not in compliance for a variety of reasons, including that we misinterpreted ED guidance or incorrectly applied the HEA and its related regulations or policies. Failure to comply could result in fines, the loss of the federal guarantees on affected FFELP Loans, expenses required to cure servicing deficiencies, suspension or termination of our right to participate as a servicer, negative publicity and potential legal claims. A summary of the FFELP, which indicates its complexity and frequent changes, may be found in Appendix A Federal Family Education Loan Program. The imposition of significant fines, the loss of federal guarantees on a material number of FFELP Loans, the incurrence of additional expenses and or the loss of our ability to participate as a FFELP servicer could individually or in the aggregate have a material, negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd Frank Act or the Act), legislation to reform and strengthen supervision of the 15 U.S. financial services industry. The Dodd Frank Act represents a comprehensive change to banking laws, imposing significant new regulation on almost every aspect of the U.S. financial services industry. The Dodd Frank Act will result in significant new regulation in key areas of our business and the markets in which we operate. Pursuant to the Act, we and many of our subsidiaries, including the Bank, will be subject to regulations promulgated by a new consumer protection bureau housed within the Federal Reserve System, known as the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (the Bureau). The Bureau will have substantial power to define the rights of consumers and responsibilities of lending institutions, including our Private Education lending and retail banking businesses. The Bureau will not examine the Bank, and the Banks primary regulator will remain the FDIC and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions. The U.S. Treasury Department has designated July 21, 2011 as the date upon which the Bureau will begin to exercise its authority. In addition, the act mandates the U.S. Secretary of Education to examine the private education loan market in the U.S. and provide a report to Congress by July 20, 2012. The Dodd Frank Act also provides that the newly established Financial Services Oversight Council (the FSOC) may designate that certain nonbank financial companies must be supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve Board) and be subject to enhanced prudential supervision and regulatory standards to be developed by the Federal Reserve Board. The FSOC may designate a nonbank financial company as systemically important if they find that material financial distress at the company or its nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or mix of activities could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States. Such enhanced standards will include, among other things, risk based capital and liquidity requirements, special regulatory and insolvency regimes, production of a resolution plan to cover potential insolvencies and may include such additional requirements on matters such as credit exposure concentrations. Most of the component parts of the Dodd Frank Act will be subject to intensive rulemaking and public comment over the coming months and we cannot predict the ultimate effect the Act or required examinations of the private education loan market could have on our operations or those of our subsidiaries, such as the Bank, at this time. It is likely, however, that operational expenses will increase if new or additional compliance requirements are imposed on our operations and our competitiveness could be significantly affected if we are subjected to supervision and regulatory standards not otherwise applicable to our competitors.

We believe that our headquarters, loan servicing centers, data center, back up facility and data management and collections centers are generally adequate to meet our long term student loan and business goals. Our headquarters are currently in leased space at 12061 Bluemont Way, Reston, Virginia, 20190. We are relocating our headquarters to Newark, Delaware from Reston, Virginia by March 31, 2011. 17 Item 3. Legal Proceedings Investor Litigation On January 31, 2008, a putative class action lawsuit was filed against us and certain officers in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. This case and other actions arising out of the same circumstances and alleged acts have been consolidated and are now identified as In Re SLM Corporation Securities Litigation. The case purports to be brought on behalf of those who acquired our common stock between January 18, 2007 and January 23, 2008 (the Securities Class Period). The complaint alleges that the Company and certain officers violated federal securities laws by issuing a series of materially false and misleading statements and that the statements had the effect of artificially inflating the market price for our securities. The complaint alleges that Defendants caused our results for year end 2006 and for the first quarter of 2007 to be materially misstated because we failed to adequately provide for loan losses, which overstated our net income, and that we failed to adequately disclose allegedly known trends and uncertainties with respect to our non traditional loan portfolio. On September 24, 2010, the court denied our motion to dismiss Mr. Albert Lord and the Company, but dismissed Mr. C.E. Andrews as a defendant in the action. The matter is now in the discovery phase. Lead Plaintiff seeks unspecified compensatory damages, attorneys fees, costs, and equitable and injunctive relief. A similar case is pending against the Company, certain officers, retirement plan fiduciaries, and the Board of Directors, In Re SLM Corporation ERISA Litigation, formerly in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and now before the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The case was originally filed on May 8, 2008 and the purported class consists of participants in or beneficiaries of the Sallie Mae 401(K) Retirement Savings Plan and Sallie Mae 401(k) Savings Plan (401K Plans) between January 18, 2007 and the present whose accounts included investments in our common stock (401K Class Period). The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties and prohibited transactions in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act arising out of alleged false and misleading public statements regarding our business made during the 401K Class Period and investments in our common stock by participants in the 401K Plans. On September 24, 2010, this case was dismissed; however, the Plaintiffs appealed. The appeal is pending. The Plaintiffs/Appellants seek unspecified damages, attorneys fees, costs, and equitable and injunctive relief. Lending and Collection Litigation and Investigations On July 15, 2009, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia unsealed the qui tam False Claims Act complaint of relator Sheldon Batiste, a former employee of SLM Financial Corporation (U.S. ex rel. Batiste v. SLM Corporation, et al.). The First Amended Complaint alleges that we violated the False Claims Act by our systemic failure to service loans and abide by forbearance regulations and our receipt of U.S. subsidies to which it was not entitled through the federally guaranteed student loan program, FFELP. No amount in controversy is specified, but the relator seeks treble actual damages, as well as civil monetary penalties on each of its claims. The U.S. Department of Justice declined intervention. Defendants filed their Motion to Dismiss on September 21, 2009. On September 24, 2010, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted our Motion to Dismiss in its entirety. On October 25, 2010, Plaintiff/Relator filed a Notice of Appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The appeal is pending. On February 2, 2010, a putative class action suit was filed by a borrower in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington (Mark A. Arthur et al. v. SLM Corporation). The suit complains that we allegedly contacted tens of thousands of consumers on their cellular telephones via autodialer without their prior express consent in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, 47 U.S.C. 227 et seq. (TCPA). Each violation under the TCPA provides for $500 in statutory damages ($1,500 if a willful violation is shown). Plaintiffs seek statutory damages, damages for willful violations, attorneys fees, costs, and injunctive relief. On April 5, 2010, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint changing the defendant from SLM Corporation to Sallie Mae, Inc. The parties in this matter have reached a tentative settlement which is subject to court approval and other conditions. On September 14, 2010, the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington agreed to Plaintiffs Motion for Preliminary Approval of Settlement Agreement. We have vigorously denied all claims asserted against us, but agreed to the settlement to avoid the burden and expense of 18 continued litigation. If the settlement receives final approval from the Court, settlement awards will be made to eligible class members on a claims made basis from a settlement fund of $19.5 million, and class members may opt out of certain calls to their cellular telephones. On January 21, 2011, and February 7, 2011, the Company filed submissions with the Court to advise that approximately 1.76 million individuals had been omitted from the original notice list for a total of approximately 6.6 million class members. In response, Class Counsel asked the Company to contribute additional unspecified amounts to the settlement fund. On February 10, 2011, the Court granted a Consented Motion to Stay Implementation of Settlement and Certain Deadlines. The Court ordered Class Counsel to file a status report on March 18, 2011. On February 10, 2011, Judith Harper filed a Motion to Intervene as Party Plaintiff, which the Court terminated on February 11, 2011 based upon the Courts February 10, 2011 Stay. On February 9, 2011, Ms. Harper filed a similar Class Action Complaint regarding the TCPA against Arrow Financial Services, LLC, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (the Harper case). On February 22, 2011, Arrow Financial Services, LLC filed a Motion to Stay Proceedings in the Harper case. That Motion is pending. On December 17, 2007, plaintiffs filed a complaint against us in Rodriguez v. SLM Corporation et al., in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut alleging that we engaged in underwriting practices which, among other things, resulted in certain applicants for student loans being directed into substandard and expensive loans on the basis of race. The complaint does not identify the relief plaintiffs seek. The court denied our Motion for Summary Judgment without prejudice on June 24, 2009. The Court granted Defendants partial Motion to Dismiss the Truth in Lending Act counts on November 10, 2009. The matter is now in the discovery phase. EDs Office of the Inspector General (OIG) commenced an audit regarding Special Allowance Payments on September 10, 2007. On August 3, 2009, we received the final audit report of the OIG related to our billing practices for Special Allowance Payments. Among other things, the OIG recommended that ED instruct us to return approximately $22 million in alleged special allowance overpayments. We continue to believe that our practices were consistent with longstanding ED guidance and all applicable rules and regulations and intend to continue disputing these findings. We provided our response to the Secretary on October 2, 2009 and we provided additional information to ED in 2010. The Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates also are subject to various claims, lawsuits and other actions that arise in the normal course of business. Most of these matters are claims by borrowers disputing the manner in which their loans have been processed or the accuracy of our reports to credit bureaus. In addition, our collections subsidiaries are routinely named in individual plaintiff or class action lawsuits in which the plaintiffs allege that those subsidiaries have violated a federal or state law in the process of collecting their accounts. We believe that these claims, lawsuits and other actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Finally, from time to time, the Company receives information and document requests from state attorneys general and Congressional committees concerning certain business practices. Our practice has been and continues to be to cooperate with the state attorneys general and Congressional committees and to be responsive to any such requests. Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders We did not submit any matters to a vote of security holders during the three months ended December 31, 2010. 19 PART II. Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Our common stock is listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol SLM. The number of holders of record of our common stock as of January 31, 2011 was 494. Because many shares of our common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of shareholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of beneficial owners represented by these record holders. The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices for our common stock for each full quarterly period within the two most recent fiscal years. Common Stock Prices 1st Quarter 2nd Quarter 3rd Quarter 4th Quarter 2010 High $ 13.32 $ 13.96 $ 12.40 $ 13.14 Low 10.01 9.85 10.05 10.92 2009 High $ 12.43 $ 10.47 $ 10.39 $ 12.11 Low 3.11 4.02 8.12 8.01 There were no dividends paid in 2008, 2009 or 2010. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities The following table summarizes our common share repurchases during 2010. The only repurchases conducted by us during the period were in connection with the exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations and shares tendered by employees to satisfy option exercise costs (which combined totaled approximately 1.1 million shares for 2010) and not in connection with any authorized buyback program.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. This discussion and analysis also contains forward looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in Forward Looking and Cautionary Statements and Item 1A Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Through this discussion and analysis, we intend to provide the reader with some narrative context for how our management views our consolidated financial statements, additional context within which to assess our operating results, and information on the quality and variability of our earnings, liquidity and cash flows. Overview We provide Private Education Loans that help students and their families bridge the gap between family resources, federal loans, grants, student aid, scholarships, and the cost of a college education. We also provide savings products to help save for a college education. In addition we provide servicing and collection services on federal loans. We also offer servicing, collection and transaction support directly to colleges and universities in addition to the saving for college industry. Finally, we are the largest private owner of FFELP Loans. Effective July 1, 2010, HCERA legislation eliminated the authority to originate new loans under FFELP. Consequently, we no longer originate FFELP Loans. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2010 we changed the way we regularly monitor and assess our ongoing operations and results by realigning our business segments into four reportable segments: (1) FFELP Loans, (2) Consumer Lending, (3) Business Services and (4) Other. Management now views our business as consisting of three primary segments comprised of one runoff business (FFELP Loans) and two continuing growth businesses (Consumer Lending and Business Services). FFELP Loans Segment Our FFELP Loans segment consists of our $148.6 billion FFELP Loan portfolio and underlying debt and capital funding these loans. This includes the acquisition of loans from the Student Loan Corporation on December 31, 2010 (see Segment Earnings Summary Core Earnings Basis FFELP Loans Segment of this Item 7 for further discussion). Because we no longer originate FFELP Loans the portfolio is in runoff and is expected to amortize over approximately the next 25 years with a weighted average remaining life of 7.7 years. We actively seek to acquire FFELP Loan portfolios to leverage our servicing scale and expertise to generate incremental earnings and cash flow to create additional shareholder value. Of our total FFELP Loan portfolio, 77 percent was funded to term through securitization trusts, 16 percent was funded through the ED Conduit Program which terminates on January 19, 2014, 5 percent was funded in our multi year ABCP facility and FHLB DM facility, and the remainder was funded with unsecured debt. It is expected to generate a stable net interest margin and significant amounts of cash as the portfolio amortizes. Consumer Lending Segment In our Consumer Lending segment we originate, acquire, finance and service Private Education Loans. As of December 31, 2010 we had $35.7 billion of Private Education Loans outstanding. In 2010 we originated $2.3 billion of Private Education Loans, down from $3.2 billion in the prior year. We provide Private Education Loans to students and their families to help them pay for a college education. We provide loans through the financial aid office, direct to consumer and through referral and partner lenders. We also provide savings products, primarily in the form of retail deposits, to help customers save for a college education (we refer to this as our Direct Banking business line). Business Services Segment In our Business Services segment we provide loan servicing to our FFELP Loans segment, ED and other third parties. We provide default aversion work and contingency collections on behalf of Guarantors, colleges and ED. We also perform Campus Payment Solutions, account asset servicing and transaction processing activities. Other Our Other segment primarily consists of the financial results related to the repurchase of debt, the corporate liquidity portfolio and all overhead. We also include results from smaller wind down and discontinued operations within this segment. 23 The following table shows how we realigned our old reportable segments existing prior to the fourth quarter of 2010 into our new business lines as part of the change in business segments discussed above. Business Lines/Activities New Business Segment Prior Business Segment FFELP Loan business FFELP Loans Lending Private Education Loan business Consumer Lending Lending Direct Banking Consumer Lending Lending Intercompany servicing of FFELP Loans Business Services Lending FFELP Loan default aversion services Business Services APG FFELP defaulted loan portfolio management services Business Services APG FFELP Guarantor servicing Business Services Other Contingency collections Business Services APG Third party loan servicing Business Services Other ED loan servicing Business Services Other Upromise Business Services Other Campus Payment Solutions Business Services Other Purchased Paper Non Mortgage Other APG Purchased Paper Mortgage/Properties Other APG Mortgage and other loans Other Lending Debt repurchase gains Other Lending Corporate liquidity portfolio Other Lending Overhead expenses Other Lending, APG and Other Key Financial Measures Our operating results are primarily driven by net interest income from our student loan portfolios, provision for loan losses, financing costs, costs necessary to generate new assets, the revenues and expenses generated by our service businesses and gains and losses on loan sales, debt repurchases and derivatives. We manage and assess the performance of each business segment separately as each is focused on different customer bases and derive their revenue from different activities and services. A brief summary of our key financial measures are listed below. Net Interest Income The most significant portion of our earnings are generated by the spread earned between the interest revenue we receive on assets in our student loan portfolios and the interest cost of funding these loans. We report these earnings as net interest income. Net interest income in our FFELP Loans and Consumer Lending segments are driven by significantly different factors. FFELP Loans Segment Net interest income will be the primary source of cash flow generated by this segment as the portfolio runs off and we will no longer generate revenues from new originations. We may continue to acquire existing portfolios of FFELP Loans from third parties. We would expect any acquisitions to be accretive. The FFELP Loans segments net interest margin was 93 basis points in 2010 compared with 67 basis points in 2009. The major sources of variability in net interest margin are expected to be the CP/LIBOR spread and Floor Income. We refer to the spread between the Federal Reserves 3 month financial commercial paper index (CP) and 3 month LIBOR as the CP/LIBOR spread. Interest earned on our FFELP Loan assets are indexed primarily to CP and interest paid on their related funding liabilities are primarily indexed to 3 month LIBOR. Movements in the CP and 3 month LIBOR rates expand or contract the CP/LIBOR spread and our net interest income decreases or increases as a result. During the capital markets turmoil of recent years, the CP/LIBOR spread has suffered dramatic fluctuations that have negatively affected net interest income significantly. For 2010, the average CP/LIBOR spread returned to historical levels. Pursuant to the terms of the FFELP, certain FFELP Loans, in certain situations, continue to earn interest at the stated fixed rate of interest even if underlying debt costs decrease. We refer to this additional spread 24 income as Floor Income. This Floor Income can be volatile as rates on underlying debt move up and down. We will generally hedge this risk by selling Floor Income Contracts which lock in the value of the Floor Income over the term of the contract. Additional cash flow should be generated within this segment as many of our secured financing vehicles are over collateralized, creating the potential for additional cash flow to be distributed to us over time as the loans amortize. Consumer Lending Segment We expect to grow our Private Education Loan portfolio primarily through our school and direct to consumer channels. Net interest income in this segment is determined by the Private Education Loan asset yields, which are determined by interest rates established by us based upon the credit of the borrower and any co borrower, the level of price competition in the Private Education Loan market and our cost of funds. Our cost of funds can be influenced by a number of factors including the quality of the loans in our portfolio, our corporate credit rating, general economic conditions, investor demand for ABS and corporate unsecured debt and competition in the deposit market. Loans are priced to anticipate our cost of funds and expected charge off rate over the life of the loans. Our Private Education Loans earn variable rate interest and are funded primarily with variable rate liabilities. The Consumer Lending segments net interest margin was 3.85 percent in 2010 and 2009. Provision For Loan Losses Management estimates and maintains an allowance for loan losses equal to charge offs expected over the next two years. The provision is an income statement item that reduces segment revenues. Generally the allowance rises when charge offs are expected to increase and falls when charge offs are expected to decline. Our loss exposure and resulting provision for losses is smaller for FFELP Loans than for Private Education Loans because we bear a maximum of 3 percent loss exposure on FFELP Loans. Our provision for losses in our FFELP Loans segment was $98 million in 2010 compared with $119 million in 2009. Our loss exposure and resulting provision in our Consumer Lending segment is much greater than our FFELP Loans segment. Losses in our Consumer Lending segment are primarily driven by risk characteristics such as loan program type, school type, loan status (in school, grace, forbearance, repayment and delinquency), seasoning (number of months in active repayment for which a scheduled payment was due), underwriting criteria (e.g., credit scores), existence or absence of a cosigner and the current economic environment. Our provision for loan losses in our Consumer Lending segment was $1.298 billion in 2010 compared with $1.399 billion in 2009. Charge Offs and Delinquencies When we conclude a loan is uncollectable (from the borrower or Guarantor), the unrecoverable portion of the loan is charged against the allowance for loan losses in the relevant lending segment. Information regarding charge offs provides relevant information over time with respect to the actual performance of our loan portfolios as compared against the provisions for loan losses on those portfolios. The Consumer Lending segments charge off rate was 5 percent of loans in 2010 compared with 6 percent in 2009. Delinquencies are a very important indicator of the potential future credit performance. Management focuses on the overall level of delinquencies as well as the progression of loans from early to late stage delinquency. Core Earnings basis Private Education Loan delinquencies as a percentage of Private Education Loans in repayment decreased from 12.1 percent at December 31, 2009 to 10.6 percent at December 31, 2010. Servicing and Contingency Revenues We earn servicing revenues from servicing student loans, Campus Payment Solutions, and from account asset servicing related to 529 college savings plans. We earn contingency revenue related to default aversion and contingency collections work we do primarily on federal loans. The fees we recognize are primarily driven by our success in collecting or rehabilitating defaulted loans, the number of transactions processed and the underlying volume of loans we are servicing on behalf of others. 25 Other Income/(Loss) In managing our loan portfolios and funding sources we periodically engage in sales of loans and the repurchase of our outstanding debt. In each case, depending on market conditions, we may incur gains or losses from these transactions that affect our results from operations. We also recognize gains and losses in accordance with GAAP on our derivative and hedging activities from the changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and ineffectiveness on derivatives that do qualify for hedge accounting. Operating Expenses The operating expenses reported for our Consumer Lending and Business Services segments are those that are directly attributable to the generation of revenues by those segments. The operating expenses for the FFELP Loans segment primarily represent an intercompany servicing charge from the Business Services segment and do not reflect our actual underlying costs incurred to service the loans. We have included corporate overhead expenses and certain information technology costs (together referred to as Overhead) in our Other segment rather than allocate those expenses by segment. These overhead expenses include costs related to executive management, the board of directors, accounting, finance, legal, human resources, stock option expense and certain information technology costs related to infrastructure and operations. Core Earnings Management uses Core Earnings as the primary financial performance measure to evaluate performance and to allocate resources. Core Earnings is the basis in which we prepare our segment disclosures as required by GAAP under ASC 280 Segment Reporting (see Note 19 Segment Reporting). For a full explanation of the contents and limitations of Core Earnings see Core Earnings Definition and Limitations of this Item 7. 2010 Summary We overcame considerable challenges and achieved significant accomplishments in 2010. We continue to operate in an extremely challenging macroeconomic environment marked by high unemployment and periods of extreme illiquidity in the capital markets. Effective July 1, 2010, HCERA eliminated FFELP Loan originations, a major source of our net income. As a result, we will no longer have revenue related to FFELP Loan originations and will have declining net income related to our portfolio of FFELP Loans and related FFELP Loan servicing and collections activities. HCERA does not alter or affect the terms and conditions of our existing FFELP Loans. Net interest income we earn on our FFELP Loan portfolio will decline over time as the portfolio amortizes. We will no longer earn any origination fees for originating FFELP Loans (which was $34 million in 2010) and the Guarantor maintenance fees (which was $56 million in 2010) will decline as the portfolio pays down. In addition, we earned $245 million in FFELP contingency revenue in 2010, which we expect to remain relatively stable through 2012 and then steadily decline as the portfolio of defaulted FFELP Loans we manage is resolved and amortizes. In response to these legislative and economic challenges we explored splitting the Company into two publicly traded companies, representing our runoff and growth businesses. We also explored selling our residual interests in our securitized FFELP Loans to effectively remove the securitized loans from our balance sheet. After evaluating both strategies we determined that neither strategy currently provides better economic returns to investors than our current operating structure. On December 31, 2010, we closed on our agreement to purchase the $26.1 billion of securitized federal loans and related assets from the Student Loan Corporation. This transaction will be accretive to 2011 earnings and beyond. We continue to seek to acquire FFELP Loan portfolios. Despite the economic environment, we saw significant improvements in the quality of our lending business segments. 26 At the end of the year, our FFELP Loan portfolio was 93 percent funded to term with long term liabilities including the ED sponsored Straight A conduit. We also completed $2 billion of FFELP Loan asset backed securitization transactions in 2010. The net interest margin in our FFELP Loans segment improved to 93 basis points in 2010 from 67 basis points in 2009 as the CP/LIBOR spread returned to historical levels. In addition, we sold $20.4 billion of loans to ED in 2010 resulting in gains of $321 million. In our Private Education Loan portfolio, delinquencies greater than 90 days trended lower throughout the year to 5.3 percent of loans in repayment at year end compared to 6.4 percent of loans in repayment at the end of the first quarter of the year. The quarterly provision for loan losses ended the year at $294 million, down from the second quarter 2010 peak of $349 million. Private Education Loan originations improved over the course of 2010 as well. After falling more than 40 percent in each of the first two quarters of the year compared with the year ago quarters they fell just 6 percent in the third quarter and increased 8 percent in the fourth quarter. We completed $4.1 billion of Private Education Loan asset backed securitization transactions in 2010. The Consumer Lending segment returned to profitability in 2010 after posting a loss in the prior year. In our Business Services segment, we saw increased revenue in our third party servicing, contingency collections and account asset servicing lines of business. We decided to discontinue our Purchased Paper collection business at the end of 2010. In response to the elimination of FFELP, in 2010 we expanded an ongoing operating expense reduction initiative, including closing our Florida and Texas servicing centers and relocating our headquarters to Newark, Delaware by March 31, 2011. Core Earnings improved significantly to $1 billion from $807 million in the prior year. This was due to a number of factors including lower provision for loan losses, and a higher net interest margin. In 2010 we issued $1.5 billion of 10 year unsecured debt and repurchased $4.9 billion of unsecured debt. Combined with our asset backed securitization transactions, these actions significantly improved the overall maturity profile of our outstanding debt. 2011 Outlook We do not expect the economic environment to improve significantly in 2011. A high unemployment rate is expected to result in a challenging environment for financial services companies such as ours. We expect our Core Earnings business results to improve principally due to the significant improvement in the quality of our Private Education Loan portfolio. Increases in the cost of attaining a higher education and enrollments should drive increased volume in our consumer lending, servicing and collection businesses. Core Earnings are expected to be lower in 2011 than in 2010; however, this is principally due to a sharp decline in gains on debt repurchases and the absence of revenue generated from the sale of FFELP Loans to ED. In 2008 we significantly tightened our underwriting criteria and exited certain lending segments. In addition, each successive repayment cohort, i.e., a group of loans that enter their initial repayment status in the same calendar year upon exiting their grace period following graduation/separation from school, has been of higher quality. In 2009 we began to offer Smart Option Student Loans, which require students to make interest payments while they are in school, a departure from past practices where all required payments were deferred until the student graduated. In 2010, we began offering the Fixed Pay repayment option, which requires a payment during school that is less than a full interest payment. The loans that entered repayment in the fourth quarter of 2010 will influence delinquency trends in the first half of 2011 and charge offs in the second half. This cohort of loans is significantly smaller and of higher quality than previous repay cohorts, it has a higher average credit score and is comprised of significantly smaller amounts of higher risk non traditional and non cosigned loans on a percentage basis and in total volume. On January 11, 2011 we issued $2 billion, five year 6.25 percent fixed rate unsecured notes. The rate on the notes was swapped from a fixed rate to a floating rate equal to an all in cost of one month LIBOR plus 4.46 percent. Investor demand was the highest ever for a Sallie Mae issue, which we believe reflects investors views that our financial condition has strengthened. In 2011, we expect to access the unsecured debt market 27 and the term asset backed securities market to re finance both FFELP and Private Education Loans. We believe that conditions in these markets have improved as compared to last year and are conducive to funding at more favorable spreads and advance rates. Retail Bank deposits are also expected to continue to be a source of funding at favorable rates. We currently expect our net interest margins in the coming year to be stable in both our FFELP Loans and Consumer Lending segments. 2011 Management Objectives In 2011 we have set out five major goals to create shareholder value. They are: (1) Reduce our operating expenses; (2) Maximize cash flows from FFELP Loans; (3) Prudently grow Consumer Lending segment assets and revenue; (4) Increase Business Services segment revenue; and (5) Reinstate dividends and or share repurchases. Here is how we plan to achieve these objectives. Reduce Operating Expenses The elimination of FFELP by HCERA greatly reduced the scope of our historical revenue generating capabilities. In 2010 we originated $14 billion of loans, 84 percent of them FFELP Loans; in 2011 we expect to originate $2.5 billion of new loans, all of them Private Education Loans. Our FFELP related revenues will decline over the coming years. As a result, we must effectively match our cost structure to our ongoing business. Operating expenses will be reduced company wide. We have set a goal of getting to an annualized operating expense quarterly run rate of $250 million by the fourth quarter of 2011. Maximize Cash Flows from FFELP Loans We have a $148.6 billion portfolio of FFELP Loans that is expected to generate significant amounts of cash flow and earnings in the coming years. We plan to reduce related costs, minimize income volatility and opportunistically purchase other FFELP Loan portfolios like we did with SLC. Grow Consumer Lending Segment Assets and Revenue Successfully growing Private Education Loan lending is the key component of our long term plan to grow shareholder value. We must originate increasing numbers of high quality Private Education Loans, increase net interest margins and further reduce charge offs and provision for loan losses. To manage our borrowing costs, we must achieve more attractive term asset backed securities market access and prices in the coming year. Increase Business Services Segment Revenue Our Business Services segment is comprised of several businesses with customers related to FFELP that will experience revenue declines and several businesses with customers that provide growth opportunities. Our growth businesses are ED servicing, ED collections, other school based asset type servicing and collections, Campus Payment Solutions, transaction processing and 529 college savings plan account asset servicing. We currently have a 22 percent market share of the ED Servicing Contract. This volume will grow organically as more loans are originated under DL. Our goal is to further expand our market share and broaden the services we provide to ED and other third party servicing clients. The ED collection contract will also grow organically as more loans are originated under DL. We also seek to increase our market share through improved performance. Campus Payment Solutions is a business line that we expect to grow by expanding our product offerings and leveraging our deep relationships with colleges and universities. Assets under management in 529 college savings plans total $34.5 billion and have been growing at a rate of 21 percent over the last three years. Our goal is to service additional 529 plans. Reinstate Dividends and or Share Repurchases We suspended our dividend and share repurchase programs in April 2007 and have not since reinstated these programs. We now believe that our cash flow and capital positions have strengthened sufficiently that by 28 the second half of 2011, we will be able to recommend to our board of directors that we either reinstate a dividend, begin to repurchase shares or do a combination of both. Results of Operations We present the results of operations first on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP. As discussed earlier, we have four business segments, FFELP Loans, Consumer Lending, Business Services and Other segments. Since these segments operate in distinct business environments, the discussion following the Consolidated Earnings Summary is presented on a segment basis and is shown on a Core Earnings basis. See Item 1 Business Business Segments for further discussion on the components of each segment. 29 GAAP Statements of Income Increase (Decrease) Years Ended December 31, 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 $ % $ % Interest income FFELP Loans $ 3,345 $ 3,094 $ 5,173 $ 251 8 % $ (2,079 ) (40 )% Private Education Loans 2,353 1,582 1,738 771 49 (156 ) (9 ) Other loans 30 56 83 (26 ) (46 ) (27 ) (33 ) Cash and investments 26 26 276 (250 ) (91 ) Total interest income 5,754 4,758 7,270 996 21 (2,512 ) (35 ) Total interest expense 2,275 3,035 5,905 (760 ) (25 ) (2,870 ) (49 ) Net interest income 3,479 1,723 1,365 1,756 102 358 26 Less: provisions for loan losses 1,419 1,119 720 300 27 399 55 Net interest income after provisions for loan losses 2,060 604 645 1,456 241 (41 ) (6 ) Other income (loss): Securitization servicing and Residual Interest revenue 295 262 (295 ) (100 ) 33 13 Gains (losses) on sales of loans and securities, net 325 284 (186 ) 41 14 470 253 Losses on derivative and hedging activities, net (361 ) (604 ) (445 ) 243 (40 ) (159 ) 36 Servicing revenue 405 440 408 (35 ) (8 ) 32 8 Contingency revenue 330 294 330 36 12 (36 ) (11 ) Gains on debt repurchases 317 536 64 (219 ) (41 ) 472 738 Other income 6 88 39 (82 ) (93 ) 49 126 Total other income 1,022 1,333 472 (311 ) (23 ) 861 182 Expenses: Operating expenses 1,208 1,043 1,029 165 16 14 1 Goodwill and acquired intangible assets impairment and amortization expense 699 76 50 623 820 26 52 Restructuring expenses 85 10 72 75 750 (62 ) (86 ) Total expenses 1,992 1,129 1,151 863 76 (22 ) (2 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations, before income tax expense (benefit) 1,090 808 (34 ) 282 35 842 2,476 Income tax expense (benefit) 493 264 (36 ) 229 87 300 833 Net income from continuing operations 597 544 2 53 10 542 27,100 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (67 ) (220 ) (215 ) 153 (70 ) (5 ) 2 Net income (loss) 530 324 (213 ) 206 64 537 252 Preferred stock dividends 72 146 111 (74 ) (51 ) 35 32 Net income (loss) attributable to common stock $ 458 $ 178 $ (324 ) $ 280 157 % $ 502 155 % Basic earnings (loss) per common share: Continuing operations $ 1.08 $ .85 $ (.23 ) $ .23 27 % $ 1.08 470 % Discontinued operations $ (.14 ) $ (.47 ) $ (.46 ) $ .33 (70 )% $ (.01 ) 2 % Total $ .94 $ .38 $ (.69 ) $ .56 147 % $ 1.07 155 % Diluted earnings (loss) per common share: Continuing operations $ 1.08 $ .85 $ (.23 ) $ .23 27 % $ 1.08 470 % Discontinued operations $ (.14 ) $ (.47 ) $ (.46 ) $ .33 (70 )% $ (.01 ) 2 % Total $ .94 $ .38 $ (.69 ) $ .56 147 % $ 1.07 155 % Dividends per common share $ $ $ $ % $ % 30 Consolidated Earnings Summary GAAP basis Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2009 For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, net income was $530 million, or $.94 diluted earnings per common share, and $324 million, or $.38 diluted earnings per common share, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, net income from continuing operations was $597 million, or $1.08 diluted earnings per common share, and $544 million, or $.85 diluted earnings per common share, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, net loss from discontinued operations was $67 million, or $.14 diluted loss per common share, and $220 million, or $.47 diluted loss per common share from discontinued operations per common share, respectively. Income from Continuing Operations before Income Tax Expense Income from continuing operations before income tax expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2010, by $282 million as compared with the prior year primarily due to a $1.5 billion increase in net interest income after provisions for loan losses and a $243 million decrease in net losses on derivative and hedging activities. These improvements were partially offset by a $660 million goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge, a $165 million increase in operating expenses, a $219 million decrease in gains on debt repurchases and a decrease in securitization servicing and Residual Interest revenue of $295 million. The primary contributors to each of the identified drivers of changes in income from continuing operations before income tax expense for the year over year period are as follows: Net interest income after provisions for loan losses increased by $1.5 billion in the year ended December 31, 2010 from the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in net interest income and provisions for loan losses was partially due to the adoption as of January 1, 2010 of the new consolidation accounting guidance which resulted in the consolidation of $35.0 billion of assets and $34.4 billion of liabilities in certain securitizations trusts. (See Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies for a further discussion of the effect of adopting the new consolidation accounting guidance). The consolidation of these securitization trusts as of January 1, 2010 resulted in $998 million of additional net interest income and $355 million of additional provisions for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2010. Excluding the effect of the trusts being consolidated as of January 1, 2010, net interest income increased $758 million from the year ended 2009 and provisions for loan losses decreased $55 million from the year ended 2009. The increase in net interest income, excluding the effect of the new consolidation accounting guidance, was primarily the result of an increase in the FFELP Loans net interest margin primarily due to an improvement in our funding costs, a 24 basis point tightening of the CP/LIBOR spread and the effect of not receiving hedge accounting treatment for derivatives used to economically hedge risk affecting net interest income. The decrease in the provisions for loan losses relates to the Private Education Loan loss provision, which decreased as a result of the improving performance of the portfolio. Securitization servicing and Residual Interest revenue was no longer recorded in fiscal year 2010 due to the adoption of the new consolidation accounting guidance; however, we recognized $295 million in the prior year. Gains on sales of loans and securities increased $41 million from the prior year primarily related to the gains on sales of additional FFELP Loans to ED as part of EDs Loan Purchase Commitment Program (the Purchase Program). These gains will not occur in the future as the Purchase Program ended in 2010. Losses on derivatives and hedging activities, net, declined by $243 million in 2010 compared with 2009. The primary factor affecting the change in losses in 2010 was interest rates. Valuations of derivative instruments vary based upon many factors including changes in interest rates, credit risk, foreign currency fluctuations and other market factors. As a result, we expect gains and (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities, net, to vary significantly in future periods. 31 Servicing revenue decreased by $35 million primarily due to HCERA becoming effective as of July 1, 2010, thereby eliminating our ability to earn additional guarantor issuance fees on new FFELP Loans, as well as to a decline in outstanding FFELP Loans for which we were earning additional fees. Contingency revenue increased $36 million primarily from increased collections on defaulted FFELP Loans. Gains on debt repurchases decreased $219 million year over year while the principal amount of debt repurchased increased to $4.9 billion, as compared with the $3.4 billion repurchased in fiscal year 2009. We expect to continue to repurchase debt in the future and the amount of gains in the future will be dependent on market conditions and available liquidity. Other income declined by $82 million primarily due to a $71 million decrease in foreign currency translation gains. The foreign currency translation gains relate to a portion of our foreign currency denominated debt that does not receive hedge accounting treatment. These gains were partially offset by the losses on derivative and hedging activities, net line item on the income statement related to the derivatives used to economically hedge these debt instruments. Operating expenses, excluding restructuring related asset impairments of $19 million in 2010, increased $146 million year over year primarily due to an increase in legal contingency expense, costs related to the ED Servicing Contract, higher collection and servicing costs from a higher number of loans in repayment and in delinquent status, and higher marketing and technology enhancement costs related to Private Education Loans. Goodwill and intangible asset impairment and amortization increased $623 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to the $660 million of impairment recognized as a result of the passage of HCERA and its negative effects on the anticipated cash flows for certain of our reporting units and the reduced market values of these units. The amortization of acquired intangibles for continuing operations and for discontinued operations each remained relatively unchanged for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. For additional discussion regarding the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets see Note 6 Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets. Restructuring expenses increased $69 million in the year ended December 31, 2010, which is a result of a $75 million increase in restructuring expenses in continuing operations partially offset by a $6 million decrease in restructuring expenses attributable to discontinued operations. The following details our ongoing restructuring efforts: On March 30, 2010, President Obama signed into law H.R. 4872, HCERA, which included the SAFRA Act. Effective July 1, 2010, this legislation eliminated FFELP and requires all new federal loans to be made through the DSLP. Restructuring our operations in response to this change in law requires a significant reduction of operating costs from the elimination of positions and facilities associated with the origination of FFELP Loans. Expenses associated with continuing operations under this restructuring plan were $83 million in fiscal year 2010. We are currently finalizing this restructuring plan and expect to incur an estimated $11 million of additional restructuring costs in 2011. The majority of these expenses are severance costs related to the partially completed and planned elimination of approximately 2,500 positions, approximately 30 percent of our workforce that existed as of the first quarter 2010. In response to the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 (CCRAA) and challenges in the capital markets, we also initiated a restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of 2007. Under this ongoing plan, restructuring expenses associated with continuing operations of $2 million and $10 million were recognized in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The majority of these restructuring expenses were also severance costs related to the elimination of approximately 3,000 positions, or approximately 25 percent of our workforce that existed as of the fourth quarter 2007. 32 Income tax expense from continuing operations increased $229 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared with the prior year. The effective tax rates for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were 45 percent and 33 percent, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily driven by the impact of non deductible goodwill impairments recorded in 2010 and state tax rate changes recorded in both periods. Net Loss from Discontinued Operations. Net loss from discontinued operations in the year ended December 31, 2010 was $67 million compared with a net loss from discontinued operations of $220 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we sold our Purchased Paper Mortgage/Properties business for $280 million which resulted in an after tax loss of $95 million. As a result of this sale, the results of operations of this business were presented in discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2009. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we began actively marketing our Purchased Paper Non Mortgage business for sale and have concluded it is probable this business will be sold within one year at which time we would exit the business. As a result, the results of operations of this business were also required to be presented in discontinued operations beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010. In connection with this presentation, we are required to carry this business at the lower of fair value or historical cost basis. As a result, we recorded an after tax loss of $52 million from discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2010, primarily due to adjusting the value of this business to its estimated fair value. Our Purchased Paper businesses are presented in discontinued operations for the current and prior periods. The additional losses for both years that are more than the losses discussed above relate to ongoing impairment recorded as a result of the weakened economys effect on our ability to collect the receivables. Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2008 For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, net income was $324 million, or $.38 diluted earnings per common share, and a net loss of $213 million, or $.69 diluted loss per common share, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, net income from continuing operations was $544 million, or $.85 diluted earnings per common share, and $2 million, or $.23 diluted loss per common share, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, net loss from discontinued operations was $220 million, or $.47 diluted loss per common share, and $215 million, or $.46 diluted loss from discontinued operations per common share, respectively. Income from Continuing Operations before Income Tax Expense. Income from continuing operations before income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased $842 million from the prior year. The $842 million increase was primarily due to an increase in gains on debt repurchases of $472 million and an increase in gains on sales of loans and securities of $470 million offset by an increase of $159 million in net losses on derivative and hedging activities. The primary contributors to each of the identified drivers of changes in income from continuing operations before income tax expense for the year over year period are as follows: Net interest income after provisions for loan losses decreased by $41 million in the year ended December 31, 2009 from the prior year. This decrease was due to a $399 million increase in provisions for loan losses partially offset by a $358 million increase in net interest income. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to an increase in the FFELP Loans net interest margin primarily due to an increase in Gross Floor Income and the impact of derivative accounting and a $15 billion increase in the average balance of GAAP basis student loans. The increase in provisions for loan losses related primarily to increases in charge off expectations on Private Education Loans primarily as a result of the continued weakening of the U.S. economy. Securitization servicing and Residual Interest revenue increased by $33 million from the prior year primarily due to a $95 million decrease in the current year unrealized mark to market loss on our Residual Interests compared with the prior year, partially offset by a decrease in net Embedded Floor value. 33 Gains on sales of loans and securities increased $470 million from the prior year. The increase is primarily attributable to a $284 million gain on our sale of approximately $18.5 billion of FFELP Loans to ED as part of the ED Purchase Program and the $186 million loss incurred in fiscal year 2008. The 2008 loss resulted from our repurchase of delinquent Private Education Loans from our off balance sheet securitization trusts and the sale of approximately $1.0 billion FFELP Loans to the ED under ECASLA, which resulted in a $53 million loss. Losses on derivatives and hedging activities, net, increased by $159 million in 2009 compared with 2008. The primary factors affecting the change in losses in 2009 were interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Valuations of derivative instruments vary based upon many factors, including changes in interest rates, credit risk, foreign currency fluctuations and other market factors. As a result, we expect gains and (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities, net, to vary significantly in future periods. Servicing Revenue increased $32 million when compared with the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the initiation of Direct Lending servicing in 2009. Contingency revenue decreased $36 million when compared with the prior year primarily as a result of less Guarantor collections revenue from rehabilitating delinquent FFELP Loans. Gains on debt repurchases increased $472 million when compared with the prior year. We repurchased $3.4 billion of our unsecured corporate debt as compared with $1.9 billion in the prior year. Other income increased by $49 million primarily due to a $54 million increase in foreign currency translation gains. These gains were partially offset by the losses on derivative and hedging activities, net line item on the income statement related to the derivatives used to economically hedge these debt instruments. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, operating expenses, excluding restructuring related asset impairments of $0 and $6 million, respectively, were $1,043 million compared with $1,023 million, respectively. The $20 million increase from the prior year relates to increased marketing expense related to our direct to consumer marketing activities, increased technology costs as well as increased collections costs. Goodwill and intangible asset impairment for continuing operations increased by $35 million in 2009 and the goodwill and intangible asset impairment for discontinued operations decreased by like amount as compared with the prior year. For additional discussion regarding the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets see Note 6 Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets. The amortization of acquired intangibles for continuing operations totaled $38 million and $48 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and the amortization of acquired intangibles for discontinued operations totaled $1 million and $6 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Restructuring expenses of $22 million and $84 million were recognized in the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, of which $10 million and $72 million were in continuing operations and $12 million and $12 million were in discontinued operations, respectively. Income tax expense from continuing operations was $264 million in 2009 compared with an income tax benefit of $36 million in 2008, resulting in effective tax rates of 33 percent and 106 percent, respectively. The movement in the effective tax rate in 2009 compared with the prior year was primarily driven by the reduction of tax and interest on U.S. federal and state uncertain tax positions in both periods, as well as the permanent tax impact of deducting Proposed Merger related transaction costs in 2008. Also contributing to the higher effective tax rate in 2008 was the effect of significantly higher reported pre tax income in 2009 and the resulting changes in the proportion of income subject to federal and state taxes. For additional information, see Note 18 Income Taxes. 34 Net Loss from Discontinued Operations. Net loss from discontinued operations in the year ended December 31, 2009 increased $5 million from the prior year. Our Purchased Paper businesses are presented in discontinued operations for the current and prior years. Preferred Stock Dividend Expense During 2009, we converted $339 million of our Series C Preferred Stock to common stock. As part of this conversion, we delivered to the holders of the preferred stock: (1) approximately 17 million shares (the number of common shares they would most likely receive if the preferred stock they held mandatorily converted to common shares in the fourth quarter of 2010) plus (2) a discounted amount of the preferred stock dividends the holders of the preferred stock would have received if they held the preferred stock through the mandatory conversion date. The accounting treatment for this conversion resulted in additional expense recorded as a part of preferred stock dividends for the period of approximately $53 million. Core Earnings Definition and Limitations We prepare financial statements in accordance with GAAP. However, we also evaluate our business segments on a basis that differs from GAAP. We refer to this different basis of presentation as Core Earnings. We provide this Core Earnings basis of presentation on a consolidated basis for each business segment because this is what we internally review when making management decisions regarding our performance and how we allocate resources. We also refer to this information in our presentations with credit rating agencies, lenders and investors. Because our Core Earnings basis of presentation corresponds to our segment financial presentations, we are required by GAAP to provide Core Earnings disclosure in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for our business segments. For additional information, see Note 19 Segment Reporting. Core Earnings are not a substitute for reported results under GAAP. We use Core Earnings to manage each business segment because Core Earnings reflect adjustments to GAAP financial results for three items, discussed below, that create significant volatility mostly due to timing factors generally beyond the control of management. Accordingly, we believe that Core Earnings provide management with a useful basis from which to better evaluate results from ongoing operations against the business plan or against results from prior periods. Consequently, we disclose this information as we believe it provides investors with additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely assessed by management. The three items adjusted for in our Core Earnings presentations are (1) the off balance sheet treatment of certain securitization transactions, (2) our use of derivatives instruments to hedge our economic risks that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment or do qualify for hedge accounting treatment but result in ineffectiveness and (3) the accounting for goodwill and acquired intangible assets. While GAAP provides a uniform, comprehensive basis of accounting, for the reasons described above, our Core Earnings basis of presentation does not. Core Earnings are subject to certain general and specific limitations that investors should carefully consider. For example, there is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance for management reporting. Our Core Earnings are not defined terms within GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Accordingly, our Core Earnings presentation does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Investors, therefore, may not be able to compare our performance with that of other financial services companies based upon Core Earnings. Core Earnings results are only meant to supplement GAAP results by providing additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely used by management, our board of directors, rating agencies, lenders and investors to assess performance. Specific adjustments that management makes to GAAP results to derive our Core Earnings basis of presentation are described in detail in the section entitled Core Earnings Definition and Limitations Differences between Core Earnings and GAAP of this Item 7. 35 The following tables show Core Earnings for each business segment and our business as a whole along with the adjustments made to the income/expense items to reconcile the amounts to our reported GAAP results as required by GAAP and reported in Note 19 Segment Reporting.

Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Core Earnings $ 1,028 $ 807 $ 583 Core Earnings adjustments: Net impact of derivative accounting 83 (502 ) (751 ) Net impact of goodwill and acquired intangibles (699 ) (76 ) (73 ) Net impact of securitization accounting (201 ) (442 ) Total Core Earnings adjustments before income tax effect (616 ) (779 ) (1,266 ) Net income tax effect 118 296 470 Total Core Earnings adjustments (498 ) (483 ) (796 ) GAAP net income (loss) $ 530 $ 324 $ (213 ) 1) Derivative Accounting: Core Earnings exclude periodic unrealized gains and losses that are caused primarily by the mark to market valuations on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under GAAP. To a lesser extent, these periodic unrealized gains and losses are also a result of ineffectiveness recognized related to effective hedges. These unrealized gains and losses occur in our FFELP Loans, Consumer Lending and Other business segments. Under GAAP, for derivatives we generally use that are held to maturity, the cumulative net unrealized gain or loss at the time of maturity will equal $0 except for Floor Income Contracts where the cumulative unrealized gain will equal the amount for which we sold the contract. In our Core Earnings presentation, we recognize the economic effect of these hedges, which generally results in any cash paid or received being recognized ratably as an expense or revenue over the hedged items life. The accounting for derivatives requires that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments be recognized currently in earnings, with no fair value adjustment of the hedged item, unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. We believe that our derivatives are effective economic hedges, and as such, are a critical element of our interest rate and foreign currency risk management strategy. However, some of our derivatives, primarily Floor Income Contracts and certain basis swaps, do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and the stand alone derivative must be marked to market in the income statement with no consideration for the corresponding change in fair value of the hedged item. These gains and losses recorded in Gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net are primarily caused by interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate volatility and changing credit spreads during the period as well as the volume and term of derivatives not receiving hedge accounting treatment. Our Floor Income Contracts are written options that must meet more stringent requirements than other hedging relationships to achieve hedge effectiveness. Specifically, our Floor Income Contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment because the pay down of principal of the student loans underlying the Floor Income embedded in those student loans does not exactly match the change in the notional amount of our written Floor Income Contracts. Under derivatives accounting treatment, the upfront payment is deemed a liability and changes in fair value are recorded through income throughout the life of the contract. The change in the value of Floor Income Contracts is primarily caused by changing interest rates that cause the amount of Floor Income earned on the underlying student loans and paid to the counterparties to vary. This is economically offset by the change in value of the student loan portfolio earning Floor Income but that offsetting change in value is not recognized. We believe the Floor Income Contracts are economic hedges because they effectively fix the amount of Floor Income earned over the contract period, thus eliminating the timing and uncertainty that changes in interest rates can have on Floor Income for that period. Therefore, for purposes of Core Earnings, we have removed the unrealized gains and losses related to these contracts and added back the amortization of the net premiums received on the Floor Income Contracts. The amortization of the net premiums received on the Floor Income Contracts for Core Earnings is reflected in student loan interest income. Under GAAP accounting, the premium received on the Floor Income Contracts is recorded as revenue in the gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities, net line item by the end of the contracts life. Basis swaps are used to convert floating rate debt from one floating interest rate index to another to better match the interest rate characteristics of the assets financed by that debt. We primarily use basis swaps to 39 hedge our student loan assets that are primarily indexed to a commercial paper, Prime or Treasury bill index. In addition, we use basis swaps to convert debt indexed to the Consumer Price Index to three month LIBOR debt. The accounting for derivatives requires that when using basis swaps, the change in the cash flows of the hedge effectively offset both the change in the cash flows of the asset and the change in the cash flows of the liability. Our basis swaps hedge variable interest rate risk; however, they generally do not meet this effectiveness test because the index of the swap does not exactly match the index of the hedged assets as required for hedge accounting treatment. Additionally, some of our FFELP Loans can earn at either a variable or a fixed interest rate depending on market interest rates and therefore swaps written on the FFELP Loans do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting treatment. As a result, under GAAP, these swaps are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected currently in the income statement. The table below quantifies the adjustments for derivative accounting on our net income for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 when compared with the accounting principles employed in all years prior to the adoption of ASC 815 related to accounting for derivative financial instruments. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Core Earnings derivative adjustments: Gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net, included in other income(1) $ (361 ) $ (604 ) $ (445 ) Less: Realized (gains) losses on derivative and hedging activities, net(1) 815 322 (107 ) Unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net 454 (282 ) (552 ) Amortization of net premiums on Floor Income Contracts in net interest income (317 ) (197 ) (191 ) Other pre change in derivatives accounting adjustments (54 ) (23 ) (8 ) Total net impact derivative accounting(2) $ 83 $ (502 ) $ (751 ) (1) See Reclassification of Realized Gains (Losses) on Derivative and Hedging Activities below for a detailed breakdown of the components of realized losses on derivative and hedging activities. (2) Negative amounts are subtracted from Core Earnings to arrive at GAAP net income and positive amounts are added to Core Earnings to arrive at GAAP net income. Reclassification of Realized Gains (Losses) on Derivative and Hedging Activities The accounting for derivative instruments requires net settlement income/expense on derivatives and realized gains/losses related to derivative dispositions (collectively referred to as realized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities) that do not qualify as hedges to be recorded in a separate income statement line item below net interest income. Under our Core Earnings presentation, these gains and (losses) are reclassified to the income statement line item of the economically hedged item. For our Core Earnings net interest margin, this would primarily include: (a) reclassifying the net settlement amounts related to our Floor Income Contracts to student loan interest income and (b) reclassifying the net settlement amounts related to certain of our basis swaps to debt interest expense. The table below summarizes the realized losses on derivative and hedging activities and the associated reclassification on a Core Earnings basis for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Reclassification of realized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities: Net settlement expense on Floor Income Contracts reclassified to net interest income $ (888 ) $ (717 ) $ (488 ) Net settlement income (expense) on interest rate swaps reclassified to net interest income 69 412 563 Foreign exchange derivatives gains/(losses) reclassified to other income (15 ) 11 Net realized gains (losses) on terminated derivative contracts reclassified to other income 4 (2 ) 21 Total reclassifications of realized (gains)losses on derivative and hedging activities (815 ) (322 ) 107 Add: Unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net(1) 454 (282 ) (552 ) Gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net $ (361 ) $ (604 ) $ (445 ) 40 (1) Unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net comprises the following unrealized mark to market gains (losses): Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Floor Income Contracts $ 156 $ 483 $ (529 ) Basis swaps 341 (413 ) (239 ) Foreign currency hedges (83 ) (255 ) 328 Other 40 (97 ) (112 ) Total unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net $ 454 $ (282 ) $ (552 ) 2) Goodwill and Acquired Intangibles: Our Core Earnings exclude goodwill and intangible impairment and the amortization of acquired intangibles. The following table summarizes the goodwill and acquired intangible adjustments for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Core Earnings goodwill and acquired intangibles adjustments: Goodwill and intangible impairment of acquired intangibles from continuing operations $ (660 ) $ (36 ) $ (1 ) Goodwill and intangible impairment of acquired intangibles from discontinued operations, net of tax (1 ) (20 ) Amortization of acquired intangibles from continuing operations (39 ) (38 ) (48 ) Amortization of acquired intangibles from discontinued operations, net of tax (1 ) (4 ) Total Core Earnings goodwill and acquired intangibles adjustments(1) $ (699 ) $ (76 ) $ (73 ) (1) Negative amounts are subtracted from Core Earnings to arrive at GAAP net income and positive amounts are added to Core Earnings to arrive at GAAP net income. 3) Securitization Accounting: On January 1, 2010, we adopted the new consolidation accounting guidance which now consolidates our off balance sheet securitization trusts. As a result, going forward, there will no longer be differences between our GAAP and Core Earnings presentation for securitization accounting. (See Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies for further detail). Prior to the adoption of the new consolidation accounting guidance on January 1, 2010, certain securitization transactions in our FFELP Loans and Consumer Lending business segments were accounted for as sales of assets. Under Core Earnings for the FFELP Loans and Consumer Lending business segments, we presented all securitization transactions as long term non recourse financings. The upfront gains on sale from securitization transactions, as well as ongoing securitization servicing and Residual Interest revenue (loss) presented in accordance with GAAP, were excluded from Core Earnings and were replaced by interest income, provisions for loan losses, and interest expense as earned or incurred on the securitization loans. This additional net interest margin included for Core Earnings contains any related fees or costs such as Consolidation Loan Rebate Fees, premium and discount amortization as well as any Repayment Borrower Benefit yield adjustments. We also excluded transactions with our off balance sheet trusts from Core Earnings as they were considered intercompany transactions on a Core Earnings basis. While we believe that our Core Earnings presentation presents the economic substance of results from our loan portfolios, when compared to GAAP results, it understates earnings volatility from securitization gains, securitization servicing income and Residual Interest income. 41 The following table summarizes Core Earnings securitization adjustments for the FFELP Loans and Consumer Lending business segments for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Core Earnings securitization adjustments: Net interest income on securitized loans, before provisions for loan losses and before intercompany transactions $ (942 ) $ (872 ) Provisions for loan losses 445 309 Net interest income on securitized loans, after provisions for loan losses, before intercompany transactions (497 ) (563 ) Intercompany transactions with off balance sheet trusts 1 (141 ) Net interest income on securitized loans, after provisions for loan losses (496 ) (704 ) Securitization servicing and Residual Interest revenue 295 262 Total Core Earnings securitization adjustments(1) $ (201 ) $ (442 ) (1) Negative amounts are subtracted from Core Earnings to arrive at GAAP net income and positive amounts are added to Core Earnings to arrive at GAAP net income. Intercompany transactions with off balance sheet trusts in the above table relate primarily to losses that result from the repurchase of delinquent loans from our off balance sheet securitization trusts. When Private Education Loans in our securitization trusts settling before September 30, 2005 became 180 days delinquent, we previously exercised our contingent call option to repurchase these loans at par value out of the trust and recorded a loss for the difference in the par value paid and the fair market value of the loan at the time of purchase. We do not hold the contingent call option for any trusts settled after September 30, 2005. In October 2008, we decided to no longer exercise our contingent call option. Business Segments As a result of the change in segment reporting that occurred in the fourth quarter 2010, past periods have been recast for comparison purposes. In connection with changing the reportable segments the following lists other significant changes we made related to the new segment presentation: The operating expenses reported for each segment are directly attributable to the generation of revenues by that segment. We have included corporate overhead and certain information technology costs (together referred to as Overhead) in our Other segment rather than allocate those expenses by segment. The creation of the FFELP Loans and Business Services segments has resulted in our accounting for the significant servicing revenue we earn on FFELP Loans we own in the Business Services segment. This bifurcates the FFELP interest income between the FFELP Loans and Business Services segment, with an intercompany servicing fee charge from the Business Services segment. The intercompany amounts are the contractual rates for encumbered loans within a financing facility or a similar market rate if the loan is not in a financing facility and accordingly exceed our costs. In our GAAP basis financial presentation we allocated existing goodwill to the new reporting units within the reportable segments based upon relative fair value. During the fourth quarter 2010, we also evaluated our goodwill for impairment using both the old reporting and new reporting unit framework and there was no impairment under either analysis. Similar to prior periods, capital is assigned to each segment based on internally determined risk adjusted weightings for the assets in each segment. These weightings have been updated and differ depending on the relative risk of each asset type and represent managements view of the level of capital needed to support different assets. Unsecured debt is allocated based on the remaining funding needed for each segment after direct funding and the capital allocation has been considered. 42 As part of the change in the reportable segments in the fourth quarter of 2010, we also changed our calculation of Core Earnings. When our FFELP Loan portfolio was growing, management and our investors valued it based on recurring income streams. Given the uncertain and volatile nature of unhedged Floor Income, little future value was attributed to it by the financial markets; therefore, we excluded unhedged Floor Income from Core Earnings. Now that our FFELP Loan portfolio is amortizing down, management and investors are focused on the total amount of cash the FFELP Loan portfolio generates, including unhedged Floor Income. As a result, we now include unhedged Floor Income in Core Earnings and have recast past Core Earnings financial results to reflect this change. The effect of including unhedged Floor Income, net of tax, on Core Earnings was an increase of $21 million, $210 million and $57 million for the years ending December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Segment Earnings Summary Core Earnings Basis FFELP Loans Segment The following table includes Core Earnings results for our FFELP Loans segment. Years Ended December 31, % Increase (Decrease) (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Core Earnings interest income: FFELP Loans $ 2,766 $ 3,252 $ 6,052 (15 )% (46 )% Cash and investments 9 26 156 (65 ) (83 ) Total Core Earnings interest income 2,775 3,278 6,208 (15 ) (47 ) Total Core Earnings interest expense 1,407 2,238 5,294 (37 ) (58 ) Net Core Earnings interest income 1,368 1,040 914 32 14 Less: provisions for loan losses 98 119 127 (18 ) (6 ) Net Core Earnings interest income after provisions for loan losses 1,270 921 787 38 17 Servicing revenue 68 75 77 (9 ) (3 ) Other income (loss) 320 292 (42 ) 10 795 Total other income 388 367 35 6 949 Direct operating expenses: Sales and origination 23 56 57 (59 ) (2 ) Servicing 679 691 662 (2 ) 4 Information technology 3 7 23 (57 ) (70 ) Other 31 3 100 (100 ) Total direct operating expense 736 754 745 (2 ) 1 Restructuring expenses 54 8 42 575 (81 ) Total expenses 790 762 787 4 (3 ) Income from continuing operations, before income tax expense 868 526 35 65 1,403 Income tax expense 311 186 13 67 1,331 Core Earnings $ 557 $ 340 $ 22 64 % 1,445 % 43 FFELP Loans Core Earnings Net Interest Margin The following table shows the FFELP Loans Core Earnings net interest margin along with a reconciliation to the GAAP basis FFELP Loans net interest margin.

This was primarily the result of a significant reduction in the cost of our ABCP Facility, a 24 basis point improvement in the CP/LIBOR Spread and a significantly higher margin on the loans within the EDs Loan Participation Purchase Program (the Participation Program) facility compared to the prior year. As of December 31, 2010, our FFELP Loan portfolio totaled approximately $149 billion, comprised of $56 billion of FFELP Stafford and $93 billion of FFELP Consolidation Loans. The weighted average life of these portfolios is 4.9 years and 9.4 years, respectively, assuming a CPR of 6 percent and 3 percent, respectively. On December 31, 2010, we closed on our agreement to purchase an interest in $26.1 billion of securitized federal student loans and related assets from the Student Loan Corporation (SLC), a subsidiary of Citibank, N.A. The purchase price was approximately $1.1 billion. The assets purchased include the residual interest in 13 of SLCs 14 FFELP loan securitizations and its interest in SLC Funding Note Issuer related to the U.S. Department of Educations Straight A Funding asset backed commercial paper conduit. We will also service these assets and administer the securitization trusts. However, SLC will subservice these trusts on our behalf in 2011 until we transition these functions to our own servicing platform during the latter part of 2011. Because we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of these trusts we have consolidated these trusts onto our balance sheet. In addition, we contracted the right to service approximately $0.8 billion of additional FFELP securitized assets from SLC. (We did not consolidate this underlying trust because we are not the primary beneficiary of this trust.) The purchase was funded by a 5 year term loan provided by Citibank in an amount equal to the purchase price. See Note 3 Student Loans and Note 7 Borrowings for additional details regarding assets and terms of funding. 44 Floor Income Core Earnings Basis The following table analyzes the ability of the FFELP Loans in our Core Earnings portfolio to earn Floor Income after December 31, 2010 and 2009, based on interest rates as of those dates. December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 Fixed Variable Fixed Variable Borrower Borrower Borrower Borrower (Dollars in billions) Rate Rate Total Rate Rate Total Student loans eligible to earn Floor Income: GAAP basis student loans $ 123.6 $ 21.9 $ 145.5 $ 103.3 $ 14.9 $ 118.2 Off balance sheet student loans 14.3 5.4 19.7 Core Earnings basis student loans eligible to earn Floor Income 123.6 21.9 145.5 117.6 20.3 137.9 Less: post March 31, 2006 disbursed loans required to rebate Floor Income (65.2 ) (2.3 ) (67.5 ) (64.9 ) (1.2 ) (66.1 ) Less: economically hedged Floor Income Contracts (39.2 ) (39.2 ) (39.6 ) (39.6 ) Net Core Earnings basis student loans eligible to earn Floor Income $ 19.2 $ 19.6 $ 38.8 $ 13.1 $ 19.1 $ 32.2 Net Core Earnings basis student loans earning Floor Income as of December 31, $ 18.0 $ 1.2 $ 19.2 $ 13.1 $ 3.0 $ 16.1 We have sold Floor Income contracts to hedge the potential Floor Income from specifically identified pools of FFELP Consolidation Loans that are eligible to earn Floor Income. The following table presents a projection of the average Core Earnings basis balance of FFELP Consolidation Loans for which Fixed Rate Floor Income has been economically hedged through Floor Income Contracts for the period January 1, 2011 to March 31, 2014. The hedges related to these loans do not qualify as effective hedges. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in billions) 2011 2012 2013 2014 Average balance of FFELP Consolidation Loans whose Floor Income is economically hedged $ 28.8 $ 20.6 $ 5.6 $ .2 FFELP Provisions for Loan Losses and Loan Charge Offs The following tables summarize the total FFELP provisions for loan losses and FFELP Loan charge offs on both a GAAP basis and a Core Earnings basis for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 FFELP provisions for loan losses: Total GAAP basis $ 98 $ 106 $ 106 Total Core Earnings basis 98 119 127 FFELP loan charge offs: Total GAAP basis $ 87 $ 79 $ 58 Total Core Earnings basis 87 94 79 45 Servicing Revenue and Other Income FFELP Loans Segment The following table summarizes the components of Core Earnings other income for our FFELP Loans segment for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Servicing revenue $ 68 $ 75 $ 77 Gains (losses) on sales of loans and securities, net 325 284 (51 ) Other (5 ) 8 9 Total other income, net $ 388 $ 367 $ 35 Servicing revenue for our FFELP Loans segment primarily consists of borrower late fees. The gains on sales of loans and securities in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, related primarily to the sale of $20.4 billion and $18.5 billion loans, respectively, of FFELP Loans to ED as part of the ED Purchase Program. The loss in 2008 primarily relates to the sale of approximately $1.0 billion of FFELP Loans to the ED under ECASLA, which resulted in a $53 million loss. Operating Expenses FFELP Loans Segment Operating expenses for our FFELP Loans segment primarily include the contractual rates we are paid to service loans in term asset backed securitization trusts or a similar rate if a loan is not in a term financing facility, the fees we pay for third party loan servicing and costs incurred to acquire loans. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, operating expenses for our FFELP Loans segment totaled $736 million, $754 million and $745 million, respectively. The intercompany revenue charged from the Business Services segment and included in those amounts was $648 million, $659 million and $632 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. These amounts exceed the actual cost of servicing the loans. 2010 versus 2009 Operating expenses decreased $18 million from the prior year, primarily due to the effect of our cost cutting initiative in connection with the passage of HCERA. This was partially offset by a one time fee paid to acquire the SLC portfolio, an increase in legal contingency expenses and costs related to closing and selling two loan originations centers in 2010. Operating expenses, excluding restructuring related asset impairments, were 51 basis points and 50 basis points of average Core Earnings basis FFELP Loans in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 2009 versus 2008 Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009, increased $9 million from the prior year primarily due to an increase in our servicing expense as a result of an $8 billion increase in the average balance of our FFELP Loan portfolio. 46 Consumer Lending Segment The following table includes Core Earnings results for our Consumer Lending segment. Years Ended December 31, % Increase (Decrease) (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Core Earnings interest income: Private Education Loans $ 2,353 $ 2,254 $ 2,752 4 % (18 )% Cash and investments 14 13 79 8 (84 ) Total Core Earnings interest income 2,367 2,267 2,831 4 (20 ) Total Core Earnings interest expense 758 721 1,280 5 (44 ) Net Core Earnings interest income 1,609 1,546 1,551 4 Less: provisions for loan losses 1,298 1,399 874 (7 ) 60 Net Core Earnings interest income after provisions for loan losses 311 147 677 112 (78 ) Servicing revenue 72 70 65 3 8 Other income 1 (100 ) Direct operating expenses: Sales and origination 125 81 67 54 21 Servicing 60 47 36 28 31 Collections 94 90 67 4 34 Information technology 68 52 23 31 126 Other 3 (5 ) 8 160 (163 ) Total direct operating expenses 350 265 201 32 32 Restructuring expenses 12 2 25 500 (92 ) Total expenses 362 267 226 36 18 Income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit) 21 (50 ) 517 142 (110 ) Income tax expense (benefit) 8 (18 ) 186 144 (110 ) Core Earnings (loss) $ 13 $ (32 ) $ 331 (141 )% (110 )% 47 Consumer Lending Core Earnings Net Interest Margin The following table shows the Consumer Lending Core Earnings net interest margin along with a reconciliation to the GAAP basis Consumer Lending net interest margin before provisions for loan losses.

The decrease in the net interest margin from 2008 to 2009 was primarily a result of a higher costs of funds due to the extreme turmoil in the capital markets. Private Education Loans Provisions for Loan Losses and Loan Charge Offs The following tables summarize the total Private Education Loans provisions for loan losses and charge offs on both a GAAP basis and a Core Earnings basis for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Private Education Loans provision for loan losses: Total GAAP basis $ 1,298 $ 967 $ 586 Total Core Earnings basis 1,298 1,399 874 Private Education Loans charge offs: Total GAAP basis $ 1,291 $ 876 $ 320 Total Core Earnings basis 1,291 1,299 473 The 2010 Core Earnings basis provision expense and charge offs are down from 2009 as the portfolios credit performance continued to improve since the weakening in the U.S. economy that began in 2008. The Private Education Loan portfolio experienced a significant increase in delinquencies through the first quarter of 2009 (delinquencies as a percentage of loans in repayment were 13.4 percent at March 31, 2009); however, delinquencies as a percentage of loans in repayment have now declined to 10.6 percent at December 31, 2010. Core Earnings basis Private Education Loan delinquencies as a percentage of loans in repayment decreased from 12.1 percent to 10.6 percent from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010. Core Earnings Private Education Loans in forbearance as a percentage of loans in repayment and forbearance decreased from 5.5 percent at December 31, 2009 to 4.6 percent at December 31, 2010. The Core Earnings basis Private 48 Education Loan allowance coverage of annual charge offs ratio was 1.6 at December 31, 2010 compared with 1.5 at December 31, 2009. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of ending Private Education Loans in repayment decreased from 8.1 percent at December 31, 2009 to 7.3 percent at December 31, 2010. We analyzed changes in the key ratios disclosed in the tables above when determining the appropriate Private Education Loan allowance for loan losses. Servicing Revenue and Other Income Consumer Lending Segment Servicing revenue for our Consumer Lending segment primarily includes late fees and forbearance fees. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, servicing revenue for our Consumer Lending segment totaled $72 million, $70 million and $65 million, respectively. Operating Expenses Consumer Lending Segment Operating expenses for our Consumer Lending segment include costs incurred to originate Private Education Loans and to service and collect on our Core Earnings basis Private Education Loan portfolio. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, operating expenses for our Consumer Lending segment totaled $350 million, $265 million and $201 million, respectively. 2010 versus 2009 Operating expenses increased $85 million from 2009, primarily as the result of a non recurring $11 million benefit in 2009 related to reversing a contingency reserve, an increase in collection and servicing costs from a higher number of loans in repayment and delinquency status and higher marketing and technology enhancement costs related to Private Education Loans in 2010. Operating expenses, excluding restructuring related asset impairments, were 96 basis points and 74 basis points, respectively, of average Core Earnings basis Private Education Loans in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. 2009 versus 2008 Operating expenses increased $64 million from 2008, primarily as a result of an increase in collection and servicing costs from a higher number of loans in repayment and delinquency status and higher marketing and technology enhancement costs related to Private Education Loans in 2009. Operating expenses, excluding restructuring related asset impairments, were 74 basis points and 61 basis points, respectively, of average Core Earnings basis Private Education Loans in the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. 49 Business Services Segment The following tables include Core Earnings results for our Business Services segment.

The average balance of this portfolio was $127 billion, $135 billion and $125 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease from 2009 to 2010 is primarily the result of the amortization of the underlying portfolio as well as the $20.4 billion of FFELP Loans sold to ED in October 2010. We are servicing approximately 3.3 million accounts under the ED Servicing Contract as of December 31, 2010. The increase in third party loan servicing revenue in 2010 is the result of the increase in the loans we are servicing under the ED Servicing Contract. Loan servicing fees in 2010 and 2009 included $44 million and $9 million, respectively, of servicing revenue related to the loans we are servicing under the ED Servicing Contract. Account asset servicing revenue represents fees earned on program management, transfer and servicing agent services and administration services for our various 529 college savings plans. Campus Payment Solutions revenue is earned from our Campus Payment Solutions business whose services include comprehensive financing and transaction processing solutions that we provide to college financial aid offices and students to streamline the financial aid process. 50 The decrease in Guarantor servicing revenue compared with the year ago period was primarily due to HCERA being effective as of July 1, 2010, our no longer earning Guarantor issuance fees and the lower balance of outstanding FFELP Loans on which we earn other fees. In 2010, contingency revenue increased $36 million from 2009 due to an increase in collections on defaulted FFELP Loans. Contingency revenue decreased in 2009 from 2008 as the result of significantly less Guarantor collections revenue associated with rehabilitating delinquent FFELP Loans. Loans are considered rehabilitated after a certain number of on time payments have been collected. We earn a rehabilitation fee only when the Guarantor sells the rehabilitated loan. The disruption in the credit markets limited the sale of rehabilitated loans. The following table presents the outstanding inventory of contingent collections receivables that our Business Services segment will collect on behalf of others. As of December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Contingency: Student loans $ 10,362 $ 8,762 $ 9,852 Other 1,730 1,262 1,726 Total $ 12,092 $ 10,024 $ 11,578 Transaction fees are earned in conjunction with our rewards program from participating companies based on member purchase activity, either online or in stores, depending on the contractual arrangement with the participating company. Typically, a percentage of the purchase price of the consumer members eligible purchases with participating companies is set aside in an account maintained by us on behalf of our members. Revenues related to services performed on FFELP Loans accounted for 78 percent, 79 percent and 79 percent, respectively, of total segment revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Operating Expenses Business Services Segment For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, operating expenses for the Business Services segment totaled $500 million, $440 million and $462 million, respectively. 2010 versus 2009 Operating expenses increased $60 million from 2009 to 2010 primarily due to higher technology and other expenses related to preparation for higher volumes for the ED Servicing Contract as well as an increase in legal contingency expenses. 2009 versus 2008 Operating expenses decreased $22 million in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to our cost reduction initiatives. Other Segment The Other segment primarily consists of the financial results related to the repurchase of debt, the corporate liquidity portfolio and all overhead. We also include results from smaller wind down and discontinued operations within this segment. These are the Purchased Paper businesses and mortgage and other loan businesses. The Other segment includes our remaining businesses that do not pertain directly to the primary segments identified above. Overhead expenses include costs related to executive management, the board of directors, accounting, finance, legal, human resources, stock option expense and certain information technology costs related to infrastructure and operations. 51 The following table includes Core Earnings results for our Other segment. Years Ended December 31, % Increase (Decrease) (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Net interest loss after provision $ (35 ) $ (66 ) $ (11 ) (47 )% 500 % Gains on debt repurchases 317 536 64 (41 ) 738 Other 14 1 15 1,300 (93 ) Total income 331 537 79 (38 ) 580 Direct operating expenses: Servicing 9 6 17 50 (65 ) Other 3 100 Total direct operating expenses 12 6 17 100 (65 ) Overhead expenses: Corporate overhead 128 138 150 (7 ) (8 ) Unallocated information technology costs 130 99 86 31 15 Total overhead expenses 258 237 236 9 Total operating expenses 270 243 253 11 (4 ) Restructuring expenses 12 (2 ) (5 ) 700 60 Total expenses 282 241 248 17 (3 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations, before income tax expense (benefit) 14 230 (180 ) (94 ) 228 Income tax expense (benefit) 4 81 (65 ) (95 ) 225 Net income (loss) from continuing operations 10 149 (115 ) (93 ) 230 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (67 ) (220 ) (188 ) (70 ) 17 Core Earnings net loss $ (57 ) $ (71 ) $ (303 ) (20 )% (77 )% Purchased Paper Business In 2008, we concluded that our Purchased Paper businesses were no longer a strategic fit. The businesses are presented in discontinued operations for the current and prior periods. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we sold our Purchased Paper Mortgage/Properties business for $280 million, which resulted in an after tax loss of $95 million. In the fourth quarter of 2010 we began actively marketing our Purchased Paper Non Mortgage business for sale. We have concluded it is probable this business will be sold within one year and, as a result, the results of operations of this business were presented in discontinued operations beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010. In connection with this classification, we are required to carry this business at the lower of fair value or historical cost basis. This resulted in us recording an after tax loss of $52 million from discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2010, primarily due to adjusting the value of this business to its estimated fair value. The following table summarizes the carrying value of the Purchased Paper Non Mortgage portfolio: December 31, December 31, December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Carrying value of purchased paper $ 95 $ 285 $ 544 52 Gains on Debt Repurchases We began repurchasing our outstanding debt in the second quarter of 2008. We repurchased $4.9 billion, $3.4 billion and $1.9 billion face amount of our senior unsecured notes for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Since the second quarter of 2008, we repurchased $10.2 billion face amount of our senior unsecured notes in the aggregate, with maturity dates ranging from 2008 to 2016. Mortgage and Other Loans Also included in this segment are our mortgage and other loan portfolios, which totaled $271 million at December 31, 2010. We are no longer originating mortgage and other loans. Overhead Corporate overhead is comprised of costs related to executive management, the board of directors, accounting, finance, legal, human resources and stock option expense. Information technology costs are related to infrastructure and operations. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, operating expenses for the Other segment totaled $270 million, $243 million and $253 million, respectively. 2010 versus 2009 Operating expenses increased $27 million from 2009 to 2010. This increase in corporate overhead was primarily attributable to increased technology costs associated with disaster recovery modernization, enterprise architecture and information security upgrades. 53 Financial Condition This section provides additional information regarding the changes related to our loan portfolio assets and related liabilities as well as credit performance indicators related to our loan portfolio. Many of these disclosures will show both GAAP basis as well as Core Earnings basis disclosures. Because certain trusts were not consolidated prior to the adoption of the new consolidation accounting guidance on January 1, 2010, these trusts were treated as off balance sheet for GAAP purposes but we considered them on balance sheet for Core Earnings purposes. Subsequent to the adoption of the new consolidation accounting guidance on January 1, 2010, this difference no longer exists because all of our trusts are treated as on balance sheet for GAAP purposes. Below and elsewhere in the document, Core Earnings basis disclosures include all historically (pre January 1, 2010) off balance sheet trusts as though they were on balance sheet. We believe that providing Core Earnings basis disclosures is meaningful because when we evaluate the performance and risk characteristics of the Company we have always considered the effect of any off balance sheet trusts as though they were on balance sheet. Average Balance Sheets GAAP The following table reflects the rates earned on interest earning assets and paid on interest bearing liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Use of Forbearance as a Private Education Loan Collection Tool Forbearance involves granting the borrower a temporary cessation of payments (or temporary acceptance of smaller than scheduled payments) for a specified period of time. Using forbearance extends the original term of the loan. Forbearance does not grant any reduction in the total repayment obligation (principal or interest). While in forbearance status, interest continues to accrue and is capitalized to principal when the loan re enters repayment status. Our forbearance policies include limits on the number of forbearance months granted consecutively and the total number of forbearance months granted over the life of the loan. In some instances, we require good faith payments before granting forbearance. Exceptions to forbearance policies are permitted when such exceptions are judged to increase the likelihood of collection of the loan. Forbearance as a collection tool is used most effectively when applied based on a borrowers unique situation, including historical information and judgments. We leverage updated borrower information and other decision support tools to best determine who will be granted forbearance based on our expectations as to a borrowers ability and willingness to repay their obligation. This strategy is aimed at mitigating the overall risk of the portfolio as well as encouraging cash resolution of delinquent loans. Forbearance may be granted to borrowers who are exiting their grace period to provide additional time to obtain employment and income to support their obligations, or to current borrowers who are faced with a hardship and request forbearance time to provide temporary payment relief. In these circumstances, a borrowers loan is placed into a forbearance status in limited monthly increments and is reflected in the forbearance status at month end during this time. At the end of their granted forbearance period, the borrower 70 will enter repayment status as current and is expected to begin making their scheduled monthly payments on a go forward basis. Forbearance may also be granted to borrowers who are delinquent in their payments. In these circumstances, the forbearance cures the delinquency and the borrower is returned to a current repayment status. In more limited instances, delinquent borrowers will also be granted additional forbearance time. As we have obtained further experience about the effectiveness of forbearance, we have reduced the amount of time a loan will spend in forbearance, thereby increasing our ongoing contact with the borrower to encourage consistent repayment behavior once the loan is returned to a current repayment status. As a result, the balance of loans in a forbearance status as of month end has decreased since 2008. In addition, the monthly average number of loans granted forbearance as a percentage of loans in repayment and forbearance declined to 5.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with the year ago quarter of 5.6 percent. As of December 31, 2010, 2.4 percent of loans in current status were delinquent as of the end of the prior month, but were granted a forbearance that made them current as of December 31, 2010 (borrowers made payments on approximately 20 percent of these loans prior to being granted forbearance). The table below reflects the historical effectiveness of using forbearance. Our experience has shown that three years after being granted forbearance for the first time, 68 percent of the loans are current, paid in full, or receiving an in school grace or deferment, and 17 percent have defaulted. The default experience associated with loans which utilize forbearance is considered in our allowance for loan losses. Tracking by First Time in Forbearance Compared to All Loans Entering Repayment Status distribution Status distribution 36 months after Status distribution 36 months after being granted 36 months after entering repayment for forbearance entering repayment loans never entering for the first time (all loans) forbearance In school/grace/deferment 9.2 % 8.5 % 4.1 % Current 50.2 57.4 64.1 Delinquent 31 60 days 3.1 2.0 0.4 Delinquent 61 90 days 1.9 1.1 0.2 Delinquent greater than 90 days 4.8 2.7 0.3 Forbearance 4.7 3.5 Defaulted 17.4 9.1 4.8 Paid 8.7 15.7 26.1 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 71 The tables below show the composition and status of the Core Earnings basis Private Education Loan portfolio aged by number of months in active repayment status (months for which a scheduled monthly payment was due). As indicated in the tables, the percentage of loans in forbearance status decreases the longer the loans have been in active repayment status. At December 31, 2010, loans in forbearance status as a percentage of loans in repayment and forbearance were 6.2 percent for loans that have been in active repayment status for less than 25 months. The percentage drops to 1.9 percent for loans that have been in active repayment status for more than 48 months. Approximately 79 percent of our Core Earnings basis Private Education Loans in forbearance status has been in active repayment status less than 25 months.

Private Education Loan Repayment Options Certain loan programs allow borrowers to select from a variety of repayment options depending on their loan type and their enrollment/loan status, which include the ability to extend their repayment term or change their monthly payment. The chart below provides the optional repayment offerings in addition to the standard level principal and interest payments as of December 31, 2010.

The graduated repayment program that is part of Signature and Other Loans includes an interest only payment option. This program is available to borrowers in repayment, after their grace period, who would like a temporary lower payment from the required principal and interest payment amount. Borrowers participating in this program pay monthly interest with no amortization of their principal balance for up to 48 payments after entering repayment (dependent on the loan product type). The maturity date of the loan is not extended when a borrower participates in this program. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, borrowers in repayment owing approximately $7.5 billion (27 percent of loans in repayment) and $7.0 billion (29 percent of loans in repayment), respectively, were enrolled in the interest only program. 74 Liquidity and Capital Resources Funding and Liquidity Risk Management The following Liquidity and Capital Resources discussion concentrates on our FFELP Loans and Consumer Lending segments. Our Business Services and Other segments need little capital. We define liquidity risk as the potential inability to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations, on or off balance sheet, as they come due, as well as the potential inability to originate Private Education Loans. Our primary liquidity objective is to ensure our ongoing ability to meet our funding needs for our businesses throughout market cycles, including during periods of financial stress. Our two primary liquidity needs are funding the originations of Private Education Loans and retiring unsecured debt when it matures. To achieve that objective we analyze and monitor our liquidity needs, maintain excess liquidity and access diverse funding sources including the issuance of unsecured debt, the issuance of secured debt primarily through asset backed securitizations and or financing facilities and through deposits at Sallie Mae Bank (the Bank), our Utah industrial bank subsidiary. We define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high quality liquid unencumbered securities, that we can use to meet our funding requirements as those obligations arise. Our primary liquidity risk relates to our ability to fund new originations and raise replacement funding at a reasonable cost as our unsecured debt matures. In addition, we must continue to obtain funding at reasonable rates to meet our other business obligations and to continue to grow our business. Key risks associated with our liquidity relates to our ability to access the capital markets and access them at reasonable rates. This ability may be affected by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions, including over the counter derivatives. Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions subject to ongoing review by the ratings agencies and may change from time to time based on our financial performance, industry dynamics and other factors. Other factors that influence our credit ratings include the ratings agencies assessment of the general operating environment, our relative positions in the markets in which we compete, reputation, liquidity position, the level and volatility of earnings, corporate governance and risk management policies, capital position and capital management practices. A negative change in our credit rating could have a negative effect on our liquidity because it would raise the cost and availability of funding and potentially require additional cash collateral or restrict cash currently held as collateral on existing borrowings or derivative collateral arrangements. It is our objective to improve our credit ratings so that we can continue to access the capital markets even in difficult economic and market conditions. We expect to fund our ongoing liquidity needs, including the origination of new Private Education Loans and the repayment of $4.4 billion of senior unsecured notes to mature in the next twelve months, primarily through our current cash and investment position and very predictable operating cash flows provided by earnings and repayment of principal on unencumbered student loan assets, distributions from our securitization trusts (including servicing fees which are priority payments within the trusts), as well as drawdowns under the 2010 ABCP Facility, the issuance of term ABS, the collection of additional term bank deposits and the issuance of unsecured debt. We primarily fund our student loan originations at the Bank. Currently, new Private Education Loan originations are initially funded through deposits. We plan to subsequently securitize these loans to term on a programmatic basis. We currently have $2 billion of cash at the Bank available to fund future originations. We no longer originate FFELP Loans and therefore no longer have liquidity requirements for new FFELP Loan originations. In 2009, we began using the ED Conduit Program (see ED Funding Programs of this Item 7 for a discussion of this program) to fund older FFELP Stafford and PLUS Loans. In addition, in 2008 we began funding new FFELP Stafford and PLUS Loan originations for AY 2008 2009 pursuant to EDs Loan Purchase Commitment Program (the Purchase Program) and Loan Participation Purchase Program (the Participation Program).We discuss these liquidity sources below. 75 We continued to use EDs Purchase and Participation Programs to fund FFELP Stafford and PLUS Loans disbursed through September 30, 2010 (see Item 1 Business Recent Legislation for a further discussion regarding the end of new FFELP Loan originations as of July 1, 2010). Primary Sources of Liquidity and Available Capacity The following table details our main sources of primary liquidity and the available capacity at December 31, 2010 and 2009. December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 (Dollars in millions) Available Capacity Available Capacity Sources of primary liquidity for general corporate purposes: Unrestricted cash and liquid investments: Cash and cash equivalents $ 4,342 $ 6,070 Commercial paper and asset backed commercial paper 1,150 Other 85 131 Total unrestricted cash and liquid investments(1)(2)(3) 4,427 7,351 Unused commercial paper and bank lines of credit(4) 3,485 Available borrowings to the extent collateral exists: FFELP ABCP facilities(5) 3,937 1,703 FHLB DM facility(5) 8,664 Total sources of primary liquidity for general corporate purposes(6) $ 17,028 $ 12,539 (1) At December 31, 2010 and 2009, excludes $0 and $25 million, respectively, of investments pledged as collateral related to certain derivative positions and $872 million and $708 million, respectively, of other non liquid investments, classified as investments on our balance sheet in accordance with GAAP. (2) At December 31, 2010 and 2009, includes $684 million and $821 million, respectively, of cash collateral pledged by derivative counterparties and held in our unrestricted cash. (3) At December 31, 2010 and 2009, includes $2.0 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, of cash and liquid investments at the Bank. This cash will be used primarily to originate or acquire student loans. (4) On November 24, 2010, our remaining bank line of credit was retired. (5) Borrowing capacity is subject to availability of collateral. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had $1.5 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, of outstanding unencumbered FFELP Loans, net, available for use in either the FFELP ABCP facilities or FHLB DM facility. (6) General corporate purposes primarily include originating Private Education Loans and repaying unsecured debt as it matures. In addition to the assets listed in the table above, we hold a number of other unencumbered assets, consisting primarily of Private Education Loans and other assets. At December 31, 2010, we had a total of $22.3 billion of unencumbered assets, excluding goodwill and acquired intangibles. Total student loans, net, comprised $12.6 billion of this unencumbered asset total, of which $11.1 billion are Private Education Loans, net, and $1.5 billion are FFELP Loans, net. 76 The following table reconciles encumbered and unencumbered assets and their net impact on total tangible equity.

(2) Excludes goodwill and acquired intangible assets. ED Funding Programs Pursuant to ECASLA, in 2009, ED published summary terms under which it will purchase eligible FFELP Stafford and PLUS Loans from a conduit vehicle established to provide funding for eligible student lenders (the ED Conduit Program). Loans eligible for the ED Conduit Program must be first disbursed on or after October 1, 2003, but not later than July 1, 2009, and fully disbursed before September 30, 2009, and meet certain other requirements, including those relating to borrower benefits. The ED Conduit Program was launched in May 2009 and accepted eligible loans through July 1, 2010. The ED Conduit Program expires on January 19, 2014. Funding for the ED Conduit Program is provided by the capital markets at a cost based on market rates, with advance rates of 97 percent of the student loan face amount. If the conduit does not have sufficient funds to make the required payments on the notes issued by the conduit, then the notes will be repaid with funds from the Federal Financing Bank (FFB). The FFB will hold the notes for a short period of time and, if at the end of that time, the notes still cannot be paid off, the underlying FFELP Loans that serve as collateral to the ED Conduit will be sold to ED through a put agreement at a price of 97 percent of the face amount of the loans. As of December 31, 2010, approximately $24.2 billion face amount of our Stafford and PLUS Loans were funded through the ED Conduit Program. Our intent is to term securitize the loans that are in this facility before the facility expires on January 19, 2014. We are exposed to the risk associated with this program ending in 2014. The amount of loans exposed to this refinance risk will decline over time as the loans pay down. If we are not able to successfully refinance the loans before the facility expires, we will sell them to ED at a price of 97 percent of face value. In 2008, ED implemented the Participation Program pursuant to ECASLA. In October 2010, we sold $20.4 billion of loans to ED and paid off $20.3 billion of advances outstanding under the Participation Program. This program is no longer in effect and is not available as a funding source. Sallie Mae Bank In 2008, the Bank began expanding its deposit base to fund new Private Education Loan originations. The Bank raises deposits through intermediaries in the retail brokered Certificate of Deposit (CD) market and through direct retail deposit channels. As of December 31, 2010, total bank deposits were $5.9 billion, of which $4.5 billion were brokered deposits and $1.4 billion were retail and other deposits. Cash and liquid investments totaled $2.0 billion. In addition to its deposit base, the Bank has borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) through a collateralized lending facility. Borrowing capacity is limited by the availability of acceptable collateral. As of December 31, 2010, borrowing capacity was approximately $650 million and there were no outstanding borrowings. 77 ABS Transactions In early 2009, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York initiated a program, The Term Asset Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF), to facilitate renewed issuance of eligible consumer and small business ABS with a term of up to five years. For student loan collateral, TALF expired on March 31, 2010. During the program, we completed five transactions totaling $7.5 billion which were TALF eligible. Under this program we have $5.3 billion of ABS outstanding where we have the option to call the bonds at a discount between 2011 and 2014. In 2010, we completed three Private Education Loan ABS transactions totaling $4.1 billion. In 2010, we completed two FFELP long term ABS transactions totaling $2.0 billion. Although we have demonstrated our continued access to the ABS market and we expect ABS financing to remain a primary source of funding over the long term, we also expect our transaction volumes to be more limited and pricing less favorable than prior to the credit market dislocation that began in the summer of 2007, with significantly reduced opportunities to place subordinated tranches of ABS with investors. Asset Backed Financing (ABCP) Facilities In early 2008, we entered into two new asset backed financing facilities (the 2008 Asset Backed Financing Facilities) to fund FFELP Loans. In 2009, the FFELP facilities were subsequently amended and reduced and in early 2010 we terminated these facilities and entered into new multi year ABCP facilities (the 2010 Facility) which will continue to provide funding for our federally guaranteed student loans. The 2010 Facility provides for maximum funding of $10 billion for the first year, $5 billion for the second year and $2 billion for the third year. The underlying cost of borrowing under the 2010 Facility for the first year is expected to be commercial paper issuance cost plus 0.50 percent, excluding up front commitment and unused fees. Borrowings under the 2010 Facility are non recourse and the maximum amount we may borrow under the 2010 Facility is limited based on certain factors, including market conditions and the fair value of student loans in the facility. The 2010 Facility is subject to termination under certain circumstances. The principal financial covenants in this facility require us to maintain consolidated tangible net worth of at least $1.38 billion at all times. Consolidated tangible net worth as calculated for purposes of this covenant was $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2010. The covenants also require us to meet either a minimum interest coverage ratio or a minimum net adjusted revenue test based on the four preceding quarters adjusted Core Earnings financial performance. We were compliant with both of the minimum interest coverage ratio and the minimum net adjusted revenue tests as of the quarter ended December 31, 2010. Increases in the borrowing rate of up to LIBOR plus 4.50 percent could occur if certain asset coverage ratio thresholds are not met. Failure to pay off the 2010 Facility on the maturity date or to reduce amounts outstanding below the annual maximum step downs will result in a 90 day extension of the 2010 Facility with the interest rate increasing from LIBOR plus 2.00 percent to LIBOR plus 3.00 percent over that period. If, at the end of the 90 day extension, these required paydown amounts have not been made, the collateral can be foreclosed. As of December 31, 2010, there was approximately $5.9 billion outstanding in this facility. The book basis of the assets securing this facility at December 31, 2010 was $6.4 billion. On January 14, 2011, we amended the 2010 Asset Backed Financing Facility, which will continue to provide funding for our federally guaranteed student loans, expanding the size and extending the maturity. The facility amount is now $7.5 billion, reflecting an increase of $2.5 billion over the previously scheduled facility reduction. The facility size will decrease by $2.5 billion annually with a scheduled maturity date of January 10, 2014. Federal Home Loan Bank in Des Moines (FHLB DM) In early 2010, HICA Education Loan Corporation (HICA), a subsidiary of the Company, entered into a lending agreement with the FHLB DM. Under the agreement, the FHLB DM will provide advances backed by Federal Housing Finance Agency approved collateral which includes federally guaranteed student loans (but does not include Private Education Loans). The amount, price and tenor of future advances will vary and be subject to the agreements borrowing conditions as then in effect determined at the time of each borrowing. The maximum amount that can be borrowed, as of December 31, 2010, subject to available collateral, is approximately $9.6 billion. As of December 31, 2010, borrowing under the facility totaled $900 million and was secured by $1.2 billion of 78 FFELP Loans. We have provided a guarantee to the FHLB DM for the performance and payment of HICAs obligations. Senior Unsecured Debt We issue unsecured debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve cost efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile. While the cost and availability of unsecured funding may be negatively affected by general market conditions or by matters specific to the financial services industry or Sallie Mae, we seek to mitigate refinancing risk by actively managing the amount of our borrowings that we anticipate will mature within any month, quarter or year. Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions (other than a change in control would allow $4 billion of these obligations as of December 31, 2010, to be put at 101 percent) that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity, or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price. We issue unsecured debt when the pricing for the term of the debt is favorable relative to our other funding options and our overall liquidity position. In 2010 we issued $1.5 billion of unsecured debt maturing in 2020 and an all in cost of LIBOR plus 4.65 percent. On January 11, 2011, we announced and priced a $2 billion five year 6.25 percent fixed rate unsecured bond. The bond was issued to yield 6.50 percent before underwriting fees. The rate on the bond was swapped from a fixed rate to a floating rate equal to an all in cost of one month LIBOR plus 4.46 percent. The proceeds of this bond will be used for general corporate purposes. We also repurchase our outstanding unsecured debt in both open market repurchases and public tender offers. Repurchasing debt helps us better manage our short term and long term funding needs. In 2010 we repurchased $4.9 billion face amount of our senior unsecured notes in the aggregate, with maturity dates ranging from 2010 to 2014, which resulted in a total gain of $317 million. Counterparty Exposure Counterparty exposure related to financial instruments arises from the risk that a lending, investment or derivative counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations to us. Risks associated with our lending portfolio are discussed in Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition FFELP Loan Portfolio Performance and Consumer Lending Portfolio Performance. Our investment portfolio is composed of very short term securities issued by highly rated issuers limiting our counterparty exposure. Additionally, our investing activity is governed by Board approved limits on the amount that is allowed to be invested with any one issuer based on the credit rating of the issuer, further minimizing our counterparty exposure. Counterparty credit risk is considered when valuing investments and considering impairment. Related to derivative transactions, protection against counterparty risk is generally provided by International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) Credit Support Annexes (CSAs). CSAs require a counterparty to post collateral if a potential default would expose the other party to a loss. All derivative contracts entered into by SLM Corporation and the Bank are covered under such agreements and require collateral to be exchanged based on the net fair value of derivatives with each counterparty. Our securitization trusts require collateral in all cases if the counterpartys credit rating is withdrawn or downgraded below a certain level. Additionally, securitizations involving foreign currency notes issued after November 2005 also require the counterparty to post collateral to the trust based on the fair value of the derivative, regardless of credit rating. The trusts are not required to post collateral to the counterparties. In all cases, our exposure is limited to the value of the derivative contracts in a gain position net of any collateral we are holding. We consider counterparties credit risk when determining the fair value of derivative positions on our exposure net of collateral. 79 We have liquidity exposure related to collateral movements between us and our derivative counterparties. Movements in the value of the derivatives, which are primarily affected by changes in interest rate and foreign exchange rates, may require us to return cash collateral held or may require us to access primary liquidity to post collateral to counterparties. If our credit ratings are downgraded from current levels, we may be required to segregate unrestricted cash collateral into restricted accounts. The table below highlights exposure related to our derivative counterparties at December 31, 2010.

Timing of obligations is estimated based on our current projection of prepayment speeds of the securitized assets. (2) The aggregate principal amount of debt that matures in each period is $16.3 billion, $32.4 billion, $24.6 billion and $88.7 billion, respectively. Specifically excludes derivative market value adjustments of $2.6 billion for long term notes. Interest obligations on notes are predominantly variable in nature, resetting quarterly based on 3 month LIBOR. Unrecognized tax benefits were $39 million and $101 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. For additional information, see Note 18 Income Taxes. 81 Off Balance Sheet Lending Arrangements We have issued lending related financial instruments, including lines of credit, to meet the financing needs of our institutional customers. In connection with these agreements, we also enter into a participation agreement with the institution to participate in the loans as they are originated. In the event that a line of credit is drawn upon, the loan is collateralized by underlying student loans and is usually participated on the same day. The contractual amount of these financial instruments, $50 million at December 31, 2010, represents the maximum possible credit risk should the counterparty draw down the commitment, we do not participate in the loan, and the counterparty subsequently fails to perform according to the terms of our contract. The remaining total contractual amount available to be borrowed under these commitments is $50 million. All commitments mature in 2011. We do not believe that these instruments are representative of our actual future credit exposure; to the extent that the lines of credit are drawn upon, the balance outstanding is collateralized by student loans. At December 31, 2010, there were no outstanding draws on lines of credit. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations addresses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP). Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates its estimates, particularly those that include the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and are often about matters that are inherently uncertain. The most significant judgments, estimates and assumptions relate to the following critical accounting policies that are discussed in more detail below. Allowance for Loan Losses When calculating the allowance for loan loss for Private Education Loans we estimate the amount of our customers who will default over the next two years and how much we will recover over time related to the defaulted amount. Our historical experience indicates that, on average, the time between the date that a borrower experiences a default causing event (e.g., the loss trigger event) and the date that we charge off the unrecoverable portion of that loan is two years. In estimating the amount of defaults we expect to have over the next two years we divide the portfolio into categories of similar risk characteristics based on loan program type, school type, loan status (in school, grace, forbearance, repayment and delinquency), seasoning (number of months in active repayment for which a scheduled payment was due), underwriting criteria (credit scores), and existence or absence of a cosigner. The primary characteristics we use are school type, credit scores, cosigner status, loan status and seasoning. We start with historical experience of customer default behavior. We make judgments about which historical period to start with and then make further judgments about whether that historical experience is representative of future expectations and whether additional adjustment may be needed to those historical default rates. We also take into account the current and future economic environment when calculating the allowance for loan loss. We analyze key economic statistics and the effect they will have on future defaults. Key economic statistics analyzed as part of the allowance for loan loss are unemployment rates (total and specific to college graduates) and other asset type delinquency rates (credit cards, mortgages). Significantly more judgment has been required over the last three years, compared with years prior, in light of the U.S. economy and its effect on our customers ability to pay their obligations. In addition to making judgments about the amount of defaults that will occur over the next two years we also make judgments about how much we will subsequently recover from a defaulted customer and when that recovery will occur. Similar to estimating defaults, we begin with historical recovery performance when projecting future recoveries and use judgment in determining whether historical performance is representative of what we expect to recover in the future. 82 FFELP Loans are guaranteed as to their principal and accrued interest in the event of default subject to a Risk Sharing level based on the date of loan disbursement. For loans disbursed after October 1, 1993, and before July 1, 2006, we receive 98 percent reimbursement on all qualifying default claims. For loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2006, we receive 97 percent reimbursement. For loans disbursed prior to October 1, 1993, we receive 100 percent reimbursement. Similar to the allowance for Private Education Loan losses, the allowance for FFELP Loan losses uses historical experience of borrower default behavior and a two year loss confirmation period to estimate the credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio at the reporting date. We apply the default rate projections, net of applicable Risk Sharing, to each category for the current period to perform our quantitative calculation. Once the quantitative calculation is performed, we review the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and determine if qualitative adjustments need to be considered. Premium and Discount Amortization The most judgmental estimate for premium and discount amortization on student loans is the Constant Prepayment Rate (CPR), which measures the rate at which loans in the portfolio pay down principal compared to their stated terms. Loan consolidation, default, term extension and other prepayment factors affecting our CPR estimates are affected by changes in our business strategy, changes in our competitors business strategies, FFELP legislative changes, interest rates and changes to the current economic and credit environment. When we determine the CPR we begin with historical prepayment rates due to consolidation activity, defaults, payoffs and term extensions from the utilization of forbearance. We make judgments about which historical period to start with and then make further judgments about whether that historical experience is representative of future expectations and whether additional adjustment may be needed to those historical prepayment rates. In the past the consolidation of FFELP Loans and Private Education Loans significantly affected our CPRs and updating those assumptions often resulted in material adjustments to our amortization expense. As a result of the CCRAA and the current U.S. economic and credit environment, we, as well as many other industry competitors, have suspended our FFELP Loans consolidation program and Private Education Loans consolidation program. We do not expect to consolidate FFELP Loans in the future and do not currently expect others to actively consolidate our FFELP Loans. As a result, we expect CPRs related to our FFELP Loans to remain relatively stable over time. We expect that in the future both we and our competitors will begin to consolidate Private Education Loans. This is built into the CPR assumption we use for Private Education Loans. However, it is difficult to accurately project the timing and level at which this consolidation activity will begin and our assumption may need to be updated by a material amount in the future based on changes in the economy and marketplace. The level of defaults is a significant component of our FFELP Loan and Private Education Loan CPR. This component of the FFELP Loan and Private Education Loan CPR is estimated in the same manner as discussed in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Allowance for Loan Loss of this Item 7 the only difference is for premium and discount amortization purposes the estimate of defaults is a life of loan estimate whereas for allowance for loan loss it is a two year estimate. Fair Value Measurement The most significant assumptions used in fair value measurements, including those related to credit and liquidity risk, are as follows: 1. Investments Our investments primarily consist of overnight/weekly maturity instruments with high credit quality counterparties. However, we consider credit and liquidity risk involving specific instruments in determining their fair value and, when appropriate, have adjusted the fair value of these instruments for the effect of credit and liquidity risk. These assumptions have further been validated by the successful maturity of these investments in the period immediately following the end of the reporting period. 2. Derivatives When determining the fair value of derivatives, we take into account counterparty credit risk for positions where we are exposed to the counterparty on a net basis by assessing exposure net of collateral held. The net exposure for each counterparty is adjusted based on market 83 information available for that specific counterparty, including spreads from credit default swaps. Additionally, when the counterparty has exposure to us related to our derivatives, we fully collateralize the exposure, minimizing the adjustment necessary to the derivative valuations for our own credit risk. Trusts that contain derivatives are not required to post collateral to counterparties as the credit quality and securitized nature of the trusts minimizes any adjustments for the counterpartys exposure to the trusts. Adjustments related to credit risk reduced the overall value of our derivatives by $72 million as of December 31, 2010. We also take into account changes in liquidity when determining the fair value of derivative positions. We adjusted the fair value of certain less liquid positions downward by approximately $129 million to take into account a significant reduction in liquidity as of December 31, 2010, related primarily to basis swaps indexed to interest rate indices with inactive markets. A major indicator of market inactivity is the widening of the bid/ask spread in these markets. In general, the widening of counterparty credit spreads and reduced liquidity for derivative instruments as indicated by wider bid/ask spreads will reduce the fair value of derivatives. In addition, certain cross currency interest rate swaps hedging foreign currency denominated reset rate and amortizing notes in our on balance sheet trusts contain extension features that coincide with the remarketing dates of the notes. The valuation of the extension feature requires significant judgment based on internally developed inputs. 3. Student Loans Our FFELP Loans and Private Education Loans are accounted for at cost or at the lower of cost or fair value if the loan is held for sale. The fair values of our student loans are disclosed in Note 15 Fair Value Measurements. For both FFELP Loans and Private Education Loans accounted for at cost, fair value is determined by modeling loan level cash flows using stated terms of the assets and internally developed assumptions to determine aggregate portfolio yield, net present value and average life. The significant assumptions used to project cash flows are prepayment speeds, default rates, cost of funds, and required return on equity. In addition, the Floor Income component of our FFELP Loan portfolio is valued through discounted cash flow and option models using both observable market inputs and internally developed inputs. Significant inputs into the models are not generally market observable. They are either derived internally through a combination of historical experience and managements qualitative expectation of future performance (in the case of prepayment speeds, default rates, and capital assumptions) or are obtained through external broker quotes (as in the case of cost of funds). When possible, market transactions are used to validate the model. In most cases, these are either infrequent or not observable. For FFELP Loans classified as held for sale and accounted for at the lower of cost or market, the fair value is based on the committed sales price of the various loan purchase programs established by ED. For further information regarding the effect of our use of fair values on our results of operations, see Note 15 Fair Value Measurements. Transfers of Financial Assets and the Variable Interest Entity (VIE) Consolidation Model Changes in Accounting Principles effective January 1, 2010 The new consolidation accounting adopted on January 1, 2010 significantly changed the consolidation model for Variable Interest Entities (VIEs). This new rule, among other things, (1) eliminated the exemption for QSPEs, (2) provided a new approach for determining who should consolidate a VIE that is more focused on control rather than economic interest, (3) changed when it is necessary to reassess who should consolidate a VIE and (4) required additional disclosure. Under these new rules, if we have a variable interest in a VIE and we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE then we will consolidate the VIE. We are the considered the primary beneficiary if we have both: (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. There is considerable judgment that has to be used as it relates to determining who is the primary beneficiary of the VIEs with which we are associated. There are no bright line tests. Rather, the assessment of who has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most 84 significantly affects the VIEs economic performance and who has the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE is very qualitative and judgmental in nature. However, based on our current relationship with our securitization trusts and other financing vehicles which are considered VIEs, we believe the assessment is more straightforward. As it relates to our securitized assets, we are the servicer of those securitized assets (which means we have the power to direct the activities of the trust) and we own the Residual Interest (which means we have the loss and gain obligation that could potentially be significant to the VIE) of the securitization trusts. As a result we are the primary beneficiary of our securitization trusts and other financing vehicles. See Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies for further details regarding the adoption of these new rules on January 1, 2010. Derivative Accounting The most significant judgments related to derivative accounting are: (1) concluding the derivative is an effective hedge and qualifies for hedge accounting and (2) determining the fair value of certain derivatives and hedged items. To qualify for hedge accounting a derivative must be concluded to be a highly effective hedge upon designation and on an ongoing basis. There are no bright line tests on what is considered a highly effective hedge. We use a historical regression analysis to prove ongoing and prospective hedge effectiveness. See previous discussion under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Fair Value Measurement of this Item 7 for significant judgments related to the valuation of derivatives. Although some of our valuations are more judgmental than others, we compare the fair values of our derivatives that we calculate to those provided by our counterparties on a monthly basis. We view this as a critical control which helps validate these judgments. Any significant differences with our counterparties are identified and resolved appropriately. Goodwill and Intangible Assets In determining annually (or more frequently if required) whether goodwill is impaired, we determine whether an event has occurred that would indicate to us that there is the potential for the fair value of the business unit to fall below the book basis of the equity of that business unit. If we determine that this event has occurred, we perform an analysis to determine the fair value of the business unit. There are significant judgments involved in determining the fair value of a business unit, including assumptions regarding estimates of future cash flows from existing and new business activities, customer relationships, the value of existing customer contracts, the value of other tangible and intangible assets, as well as assumptions regarding what we believe a third party willing to pay for all of the assets and liabilities of the business unit. This calculation requires us to estimate the appropriate discount and growth rates to apply to those projected cash flows and the appropriate control premium to apply to arrive at the final fair value. The business units for which we must estimate the fair value are not publically traded and often there is not comparable market data available for that individual business to aid in its valuation. We use a third party appraisal firm to provide an opinion on the fair values we conclude upon. Risk Management Processes Our Approach The monitoring, assessment and oversight of risk are shared responsibilities throughout the Company. Each business division is primarily responsible and accountable for managing risks specific to its area. Our executive management team and centralized support functions, including compliance, credit risk, human resources, legal, information technology, finance and accounting, are responsible for providing our business divisions with the training, systems and specialized expertise necessary to properly perform their risk management duties. Executive management, individually and through participation in various committees, are ultimately responsible for the management of risk across our businesses. Our Risk Assessment Department regularly monitors and reports to the Audit Committee of our Board of Director on the effectiveness of various aspects of our risk management activities. Our Code of Business Conduct and the on going training our employees receive in many compliance areas provide a framework for our employees to conduct themselves with the highest integrity. We instill a risk conscious culture through communications, training, policies and procedures. We have strengthened the 85 linkage between the management performance process and individual compensation to encourage employees to work toward corporate wide compliance goals. Our Risk Assessment Department monitors our various risk management and compliance efforts, identifies areas that require increased focus and resources, and reports significant control issues to executive management and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. At least annually, the Risk Assessment Department performs a risk assessment to identify our top risks, to develop the internal audit plan. Risks are rated on significance and likelihood of occurrence and communicated to our management team members who allocate appropriate attention and resources. Results of the assessment, including survey results, identified risks and recommendations, are reported to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors and its various committees oversee our overall strategic direction and provide direction to management as to its tolerance levels of various significant risks. Through its committees, our Board of Directors regularly reviews our risk management practices. Our Significant Risks Significant risks may be grouped into the following categories: (1) funding and liquidity; (2) operations; (3) political/reputation; (4) competition; (5) credit; and (6) regulatory and compliance. More specific descriptions of the particular risks of each type we currently face are discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors. Funding and Liquidity Risk Management Funding and liquidity risk is the potential inability to fund liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, fund asset growth and business operations, and meet contractual obligations at reasonable market rates. Our primary liquidity objective is to ensure our ongoing ability to meet our funding needs for our businesses throughout market cycles, including during periods of financial stress. Our two primary liquidity needs are originating Private Education Loans and retiring secured and unsecured debt when it matures. We define excess liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high quality liquid unencumbered securities, that we can use to meet our funding requirements as those obligations arise. Our primary liquidity risk relates to our ability to raise replacement funding and raise that funding at a reasonable cost as our secured and unsecured debt matures. In addition, we must continue to obtain funding at reasonable rates to meet our other business obligations and to continue to grow our business. Key risks associated with our liquidity relates to our ability to access the capital markets and access them at reasonable rates. This ability is directly affected by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions, including over the counter derivatives. A negative change in our credit rating would have a negative effect on our liquidity because it would raise the cost, diminish the availability of funding and potentially require additional cash collateral or restrict cash currently held as collateral on existing borrowings or derivative collateral arrangements. Our funding and liquidity risk management activities are centralized within our Corporate Finance Department, which is responsible for planning and executing our funding activities and strategies. We analyze and monitor our liquidity risk, maintain excess liquidity and access diverse funding. Funding and liquidity risk are overseen and recommendations approved via one or more management committees that manage market, interest rate and balance sheet risk. The Finance Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for approving our Asset and Liability Management Policy. The Finance Committee of the Board, and in some cases the full Board, monitor our liquidity on an ongoing basis. Our liquidity risk management activities are centralized within the Corporate Finance Department, which is responsible for planning and executing our funding activities and strategies. Operations Risk Management Operations risk arises from problems with service or product delivery or from nonconformance with internal policies and procedures. The Company is exposed to transaction risk when products, services or 86 delivery channels do not fit with our operational capacity, customer demands or strategic objectives. Operations risk can increase with the implementation of new information technology to support a new, expanded or modified product or service. Failed or flawed technology, either from error, inadequate capacity or fraud, may result in the inability to deliver products or services. Operations risk is managed by our managers with assistance and training provided by our centralized support functions. Additionally, the operations risks associated with new products and services, the security and confidentiality of information, the effectiveness of our technology infrastructure, the emergency loss of technology and other infrastructure resources, the monitoring of internal controls and compliance with internal control standards, and the monitoring and dissemination of changes in regulations affecting the business are each the subject of executive management review through committees established for these particular purposes. The Finance and Operations Committee of our Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for significant operational risks and receives periodic reports from executive management regarding the effectiveness of our risk management efforts in this area. Political and Reputation Risk Management Political and reputation risk is the risk that changes in laws and regulations or actions negatively impacting our reputation could affect the profitability and sustainability of our business. Management proactively assesses and manages political and reputation risk. Our government relations team of employees manages our review and response to all formal inquiries from members of Congress, state legislators, and their staff, including providing targeted messaging that reinforces our public policy goals. We review and consider political and reputational risks on an integrated basis in connection with the risk management oversight activities conducted in the various aspects of our business on matters as diverse as the launch of new products and services, our credit underwriting activities and how we fund our operations. Significant political and reputation risks are reported to and monitored by the Finance and Operations Committee of our Board of Directors. Competition Risk Management Competition risk is the risk of losing market share or the lack of market acceptance of our products due to our competitors competing more effectively. Management closely monitors competitors and conditions. We follow changes in product pricing and features and track marketing activity across a variety of distribution channels. In addition, we measure category participants brand recognition among key consumer groups. We continuously evaluate the size of the market and analyze market developments and trends that may impact future demand for student loans. Significant market competition risks are reported to and monitored by the Finance and Operations Committee of our Board of Directors. Credit and Counterparty Risk Management Credit and counterparty risk is the risk of loss stemming from one partys failure to repay a loan or otherwise meet a contractual obligation. We have credit or counterparty risk exposure with borrowers and co borrowers with whom we have made Private Education Loans, the various counterparties with whom we have entered into derivative contracts, the various issuers with whom we make investments, and with several higher education institutions related to academic facilities loans secured by real estate. The credit risk related to Private Education Loans are managed within a credit risk infrastructure which includes (i) a well defined underwriting and collection policy framework; (ii) an ongoing monitoring and review process of portfolio segments and trends; (iii) assignment and management of credit authorities and responsibilities; and (iv) establishment of an allowance for loan losses that covers estimated losses based upon 87 portfolio and economic analysis. This infrastructure is overseen by our Chief Credit Officer and the executive management committee that he chairs. Credit and counterparty risk related to derivative contracts is managed by reviewing counterparties for credit strength on an ongoing basis and via our credit policies, which place limits on the amount of exposure we may take with any one counterparty and, in most cases, require collateral to secure the position. The credit and counterparty risk associated with derivatives is measured based on the replacement cost should the counterparties with contracts in a gain position to the Company fail to perform under the terms of the contract. The credit and counterparty risk in our investment portfolio is minimized by only investing in paper with highly rated issuers and setting limits on our exposure per issuer. Credit and counterparty risk related to derivative contracts and our investment portfolio are approved and managed by our Credit Risk Management group overseen by our Chief Credit Officer. Significant credit and counterparty risks related to derivative contracts or our investment portfolio are reported to the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. Additionally, our Chief Credit Officer reports, on a regular basis, to the Board and the Audit Committee of the Board regarding the asset quality of our Private Education Loans. Regulatory and Compliance Risk Management Regulatory and compliance risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from violations of laws, rules, or regulations. The Company is exposed to regulatory and compliance risk when key areas such as our private education lending, collections or government loan servicing businesses are not properly monitored for compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and when an oversight program does not include appropriate audit and control features. We also face regulatory and compliance risk when new, expanded or modified products or services are not properly monitored for compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Primary ownership and responsibility for regulatory and compliance risk is placed with the business areas to manage their specific regulatory and compliance risks. Our Compliance Department supports these activities through providing extensive training and monitoring of our Code of Business Conduct, maintaining consumer lending regulatory and information security policies and procedures, and working in close coordination with our other centralized support functions such as our Legal department. Compliance risks associated with new products and services, SEC disclosure obligations, security and confidentiality of information and effectiveness of our technology infrastructure, internal controls and compliance with internal control standards, dissemination of changes in regulations affecting the business, and enforcement of credit lending policies and practices are each the subject of specific review by existing management committees. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has oversight with respect to establishing standards with respect to our monitoring and control of regulatory and compliance risks and the qualification of employees overseeing these risk management functions. The Audit Committee receives periodic reports from executive management team members responsible for the regulatory and compliance risk management functions. 88 Common Stock The following table summarizes our common share repurchases and issuances for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Years Ended December 31, (Shares in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Common shares repurchased: Open market Benefit plans(1) 1.1 .3 1.0 Total shares repurchased 1.1 .3 1.0 Average purchase price per share $ 13.44 $ 20.29 $ 24.51 Common shares issued 1.8 17.8 1.9 Authority remaining at end of period for repurchases 38.8 38.8 38.8 (1) Shares withheld from stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock for employees tax withholding obligations and shares tendered by employees to satisfy option exercise costs. During 2009, we converted $339 million of our Series C Preferred Stock to common stock. As part of this conversion, we delivered to the holders of the preferred stock: (1) approximately 17 million shares (the number of common shares they would most likely receive if the preferred stock they held mandatorily converted to common shares in the fourth quarter of 2010) plus (2) a discounted amount of the preferred stock dividends the holders of the preferred stock would have received if they held the preferred stock through the mandatory conversion date. The accounting treatment for this conversion resulted in additional dividends recorded as part of preferred stock dividends for the year of approximately $53 million. On December 15, 2010, the mandatory conversion date, the remaining 810,370 shares of our Series C Preferred Stock were converted into 41 million shares of common stock. The closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2010 was $12.59 89 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis Our interest rate risk management seeks to limit the impact of short term movements in interest rates on our results of operations and financial position. The following tables summarize the effect on earnings for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the effect on fair values at December 31, 2010 and 2009, based upon a sensitivity analysis performed by management assuming a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of 100 basis points and 300 basis points while funding spreads remain constant. Additionally, as it relates to the effect on earnings, a sensitivity analysis was performed assuming the funding index increases 25 basis points while holding the asset index constant, if the funding index is different than the asset index. Both of these analyses do not consider any potential mark to market losses that may occur related to our Residual Interests (prior to the adoption of topic updates on ASC 810 on January 1, 2010) that may result from asset and funding basis divergence or a higher discount rate that would be used to compute the present value of the cash flows if long term interest rates increased.

However, as discussed in Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Segment Earnings Summary Core Earnings Basis FFELP Loans Segment Floor Income Core Earnings Basis, we can have a fixed versus floating mismatch in funding if the student loan earns at the fixed borrower rate and the funding remains floating. In addition, we can have a mismatch in the index (including the frequency of reset) of floating rate debt versus floating rate assets. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, certain FFELP Loans were earning Floor Income and we locked in a portion of that Floor Income through the use of Floor Income Contracts. The result of these hedging transactions was to convert a portion of the fixed rate nature of student loans to variable rate, and to fix the relative spread between the student loan asset rate and the variable rate liability. 91 In the preceding tables, under the scenario where interest rates increase 100 and 300 basis points, the change in pre tax net income before the unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities is primarily due to the impact of (i) our unhedged on balance sheet loans being in a fixed rate mode due to the Embedded Floor Income, while being funded with variable debt in low interest rate environments; and (ii) a portion of our variable assets being funded with fixed debt. Item (i) will generally cause income to decrease when interest rates increase from a low interest rate environment, whereas item (ii) will generally offset this decrease. In the 100 and 300 basis point scenarios for the year ended December 31, 2010, the increase in income resulted from item (ii) having a greater impact than item (i). In the prior year period, item (i) resulted in a decrease to income in the 100 and 300 basis point scenarios. Under the scenario in the tables above labeled Asset and Funding Index Mismatches, the main driver of the decrease in pre tax income before unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities is the result of LIBOR based debt funding commercial paper indexed assets. See Asset and Liability Funding Gap of this Item 7A for a further discussion. Increasing the spread between indices will also impact the unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities as it relates to basis swaps. Basis swaps used to convert LIBOR based debt to indices that we believe are economic hedges of the indices of the assets being funded resulted in an unrealized losses of $(204) million and $(102) million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Offsetting this unrealized loss are basis swaps that economically hedge our Private Education Loan securitization trusts. Unrealized gains for these basis swaps totaled $176 million and $208 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The change from a net gain in the prior year period to a net loss in the current year period was the impact of basis swap hedges in securitization trusts that were previously off balance sheet prior to new consolidation accounting adopted on January 1, 2010 (see Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Transfers of Financial Assets and the VIE Consolidation Model for further discussion). In addition to interest rate risk addressed in the preceding tables, we are also exposed to risks related to foreign currency exchange rates. Foreign currency exchange risk is primarily the result of foreign currency denominated debt issued by us. As it relates to our corporate unsecured and securitization debt programs used to fund our business, our policy is to use cross currency interest rate swaps to swap all foreign currency denominated debt payments (fixed and floating) to U.S. dollar LIBOR using a fixed exchange rate. In the tables above, there would be an immaterial impact on earnings if exchange rates were to decrease or increase, due to the terms of the hedging instrument and hedged items matching. The balance sheet interest bearing liabilities would be affected by a change in exchange rates; however, the change would be materially offset by the cross currency interest rate swaps in other assets or other liabilities. In the current economic environment, volatility in the spread between spot and forward foreign exchange rates has resulted in material mark to market impacts to current period earnings which have not been factored into the above analysis. The earnings impact is noncash, and at maturity of the instruments the cumulative mark to market impact will be zero. 92 Asset and Liability Funding Gap The tables below present our assets and liabilities (funding) arranged by underlying indices as of December 31, 2010. In the following GAAP presentation, the funding gap only includes derivatives that qualify as effective hedges (those derivatives which are reflected in net interest margin, as opposed to those reflected in the gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities, net line on the consolidated statements of income). The difference between the asset and the funding is the funding gap for the specified index. This represents our exposure to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk, which is the risk that the different indices may reset at different frequencies or may not move in the same direction or at the same magnitude. Management analyzes interest rate risk and in doing so includes all derivatives that are economically hedging our debt whether they qualify as effective hedges or not (Core Earnings basis). Accordingly, we are also presenting the asset and liability funding gap on a Core Earnings basis in the table that follows the GAAP presentation. GAAP Basis Frequency of Index Variable Funding (Dollars in billions) Resets Assets Funding(1) Gap 3 month Commercial paper daily $ 139.2 $ .1 $ 139.1 3 month Treasury bill weekly 8.2 8.2 Prime annual .8 .8 Prime quarterly 5.4 5.4 Prime monthly 23.1 23.1 Prime daily 3.0 (3.0 ) PLUS Index annual .5 .5 3 month LIBOR daily 3 month LIBOR quarterly 132.1 (132.1 ) 1 month LIBOR monthly 7.3 15.3 (8.0 ) CMT/CPI Index monthly/quarterly 2.0 (2.0 ) Non Discrete reset(2) monthly 34.6 (34.6 ) Non Discrete reset(3) daily/weekly 11.5 2.3 9.2 Fixed Rate(4) 9.3 15.9 (6.6 ) Total $ 205.3 $ 205.3 $ (1) Funding includes all derivatives that qualify as hedges. (2) Funding consists of auction rate securities, the ABCP Facilities and the ED Conduit Program facility. (3) Assets include restricted and unrestricted cash equivalents and other overnight type instruments. Funding includes retail and other deposits and cash collateral held related to derivatives exposures that are recorded as a short term debt obligation. (4) Assets include receivables and other assets (including goodwill and acquired intangibles). Funding includes other liabilities and stockholders equity (excluding series B Preferred Stock). 93 The Funding Gaps in the above table are primarily interest rate mismatches in short term indices between our assets and liabilities. We address this issue typically through the use of basis swaps that typically convert quarterly reset three month LIBOR to other indices that are more correlated to our asset indices. These basis swaps do not qualify as effective hedges and as a result the effect on the funding index is not included in our interest margin and is therefore excluded from the GAAP presentation. Core Earnings Basis Index Frequency of Funding (Dollars in billions) Variable Resets Assets Funding(1) Gap 3 month Commercial paper daily $ 139.2 $ .1 $ 139.1 3 month Treasury bill weekly 8.2 2.0 6.2 Prime annual .8 .8 Prime quarterly 5.4 1.5 3.9 Prime monthly 23.1 8.6 14.5 Prime daily 3.0 (3.0 ) PLUS Index annual .5 .5 3 month LIBOR daily 55.5 (55.5 ) 3 month LIBOR quarterly 54.6 (54.6 ) 1 month LIBOR monthly 7.3 20.1 (12.8 ) 1 month LIBOR daily 9.0 (9.0 ) Non Discrete reset(2) monthly 34.6 (34.6 ) Non Discrete reset(3) daily/weekly 11.5 2.3 9.2 Fixed Rate(4) 6.6 11.3 (4.7 ) Total $ 202.6 $ 202.6 $ (1) Funding includes all derivatives that management considers economic hedges of interest rate risk and reflects how we internally manage our interest rate exposure. (2) Funding consists of auction rate securities, the ABCP Facilities and the ED Conduit Program facility. (3) Assets include restricted and unrestricted cash equivalents and other overnight type instruments. Funding includes retail and other deposits and cash collateral held related to derivatives exposures that are recorded as a short term debt obligation. (4) Assets include receivables and other assets (including goodwill and acquired intangibles). Funding includes other liabilities and stockholders equity (excluding series B Preferred Stock). We use interest rate swaps and other derivatives to achieve our risk management objectives. To the extent possible, we fund our assets with debt (in combination with derivatives) that has the same underlying index (index type and index reset frequency). When it is more economical, we also fund our assets with debt that has a different index and or reset frequency than the asset, but only in instances where we believe there is a high degree of correlation between the interest rate movement of the two indices. For example, we use daily reset three month LIBOR to fund a large portion of our daily reset three month commercial paper indexed assets. In addition, we use quarterly reset three month LIBOR to fund a portion of our quarterly reset Prime rate indexed Private Education Loans. We also use our monthly Non Discrete reset and 1 month LIBOR funding to fund various asset types. In using different index types and different index reset frequencies to fund our assets, we are exposed to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk, which is the risk that the different indices that may reset at different frequencies will not move in the same direction or at the same magnitude. While we believe that this risk is low, as all of these indices are short term with rate movements that are highly correlated over a long period of time, market disruptions can lead to a temporary divergence between indices as was experienced beginning in the second half of 2007 through the second quarter of 2009 with the commercial paper and LIBOR indices. As of December 31, 2010, we have approximately $92.6 billion of FFELP Loans indexed to three month commercial paper (3M CP) that are funded with debt indexed to 3M LIBOR. 94 Weighted Average Life The following table reflects the weighted average life for our earning assets and liabilities at December 31, 2010.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. This discussion and analysis also contains forward looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in Forward Looking and Cautionary Statements and Item 1A Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Through this discussion and analysis, we intend to provide the reader with some narrative context for how our management views our consolidated financial statements, additional context within which to assess our operating results, and information on the quality and variability of our earnings, liquidity and cash flows. Overview We provide Private Education Loans that help students and their families bridge the gap between family resources, federal loans, grants, student aid, scholarships, and the cost of a college education. We also provide savings products to help save for a college education. In addition we provide servicing and collection services on federal loans. We also offer servicing, collection and transaction support directly to colleges and universities in addition to the saving for college industry. Finally, we are the largest private owner of FFELP Loans. Effective July 1, 2010, HCERA legislation eliminated the authority to originate new loans under FFELP. Consequently, we no longer originate FFELP Loans. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2010 we changed the way we regularly monitor and assess our ongoing operations and results by realigning our business segments into four reportable segments: (1) FFELP Loans, (2) Consumer Lending, (3) Business Services and (4) Other. Management now views our business as consisting of three primary segments comprised of one runoff business (FFELP Loans) and two continuing growth businesses (Consumer Lending and Business Services). FFELP Loans Segment Our FFELP Loans segment consists of our $148.6 billion FFELP Loan portfolio and underlying debt and capital funding these loans. This includes the acquisition of loans from the Student Loan Corporation on December 31, 2010 (see Segment Earnings Summary Core Earnings Basis FFELP Loans Segment of this Item 7 for further discussion). Because we no longer originate FFELP Loans the portfolio is in runoff and is expected to amortize over approximately the next 25 years with a weighted average remaining life of 7.7 years. We actively seek to acquire FFELP Loan portfolios to leverage our servicing scale and expertise to generate incremental earnings and cash flow to create additional shareholder value. Of our total FFELP Loan portfolio, 77 percent was funded to term through securitization trusts, 16 percent was funded through the ED Conduit Program which terminates on January 19, 2014, 5 percent was funded in our multi year ABCP facility and FHLB DM facility, and the remainder was funded with unsecured debt. It is expected to generate a stable net interest margin and significant amounts of cash as the portfolio amortizes. Consumer Lending Segment In our Consumer Lending segment we originate, acquire, finance and service Private Education Loans. As of December 31, 2010 we had $35.7 billion of Private Education Loans outstanding. In 2010 we originated $2.3 billion of Private Education Loans, down from $3.2 billion in the prior year. We provide Private Education Loans to students and their families to help them pay for a college education. We provide loans through the financial aid office, direct to consumer and through referral and partner lenders. We also provide savings products, primarily in the form of retail deposits, to help customers save for a college education (we refer to this as our Direct Banking business line). Business Services Segment In our Business Services segment we provide loan servicing to our FFELP Loans segment, ED and other third parties. We provide default aversion work and contingency collections on behalf of Guarantors, colleges and ED. We also perform Campus Payment Solutions, account asset servicing and transaction processing activities. Other Our Other segment primarily consists of the financial results related to the repurchase of debt, the corporate liquidity portfolio and all overhead. We also include results from smaller wind down and discontinued operations within this segment. 23 The following table shows how we realigned our old reportable segments existing prior to the fourth quarter of 2010 into our new business lines as part of the change in business segments discussed above. Business Lines/Activities New Business Segment Prior Business Segment FFELP Loan business FFELP Loans Lending Private Education Loan business Consumer Lending Lending Direct Banking Consumer Lending Lending Intercompany servicing of FFELP Loans Business Services Lending FFELP Loan default aversion services Business Services APG FFELP defaulted loan portfolio management services Business Services APG FFELP Guarantor servicing Business Services Other Contingency collections Business Services APG Third party loan servicing Business Services Other ED loan servicing Business Services Other Upromise Business Services Other Campus Payment Solutions Business Services Other Purchased Paper Non Mortgage Other APG Purchased Paper Mortgage/Properties Other APG Mortgage and other loans Other Lending Debt repurchase gains Other Lending Corporate liquidity portfolio Other Lending Overhead expenses Other Lending, APG and Other Key Financial Measures Our operating results are primarily driven by net interest income from our student loan portfolios, provision for loan losses, financing costs, costs necessary to generate new assets, the revenues and expenses generated by our service businesses and gains and losses on loan sales, debt repurchases and derivatives. We manage and assess the performance of each business segment separately as each is focused on different customer bases and derive their revenue from different activities and services. A brief summary of our key financial measures are listed below. Net Interest Income The most significant portion of our earnings are generated by the spread earned between the interest revenue we receive on assets in our student loan portfolios and the interest cost of funding these loans. We report these earnings as net interest income. Net interest income in our FFELP Loans and Consumer Lending segments are driven by significantly different factors. FFELP Loans Segment Net interest income will be the primary source of cash flow generated by this segment as the portfolio runs off and we will no longer generate revenues from new originations. We may continue to acquire existing portfolios of FFELP Loans from third parties. We would expect any acquisitions to be accretive. The FFELP Loans segments net interest margin was 93 basis points in 2010 compared with 67 basis points in 2009. The major sources of variability in net interest margin are expected to be the CP/LIBOR spread and Floor Income. We refer to the spread between the Federal Reserves 3 month financial commercial paper index (CP) and 3 month LIBOR as the CP/LIBOR spread. Interest earned on our FFELP Loan assets are indexed primarily to CP and interest paid on their related funding liabilities are primarily indexed to 3 month LIBOR. Movements in the CP and 3 month LIBOR rates expand or contract the CP/LIBOR spread and our net interest income decreases or increases as a result. During the capital markets turmoil of recent years, the CP/LIBOR spread has suffered dramatic fluctuations that have negatively affected net interest income significantly. For 2010, the average CP/LIBOR spread returned to historical levels. Pursuant to the terms of the FFELP, certain FFELP Loans, in certain situations, continue to earn interest at the stated fixed rate of interest even if underlying debt costs decrease. We refer to this additional spread 24 income as Floor Income. This Floor Income can be volatile as rates on underlying debt move up and down. We will generally hedge this risk by selling Floor Income Contracts which lock in the value of the Floor Income over the term of the contract. Additional cash flow should be generated within this segment as many of our secured financing vehicles are over collateralized, creating the potential for additional cash flow to be distributed to us over time as the loans amortize. Consumer Lending Segment We expect to grow our Private Education Loan portfolio primarily through our school and direct to consumer channels. Net interest income in this segment is determined by the Private Education Loan asset yields, which are determined by interest rates established by us based upon the credit of the borrower and any co borrower, the level of price competition in the Private Education Loan market and our cost of funds. Our cost of funds can be influenced by a number of factors including the quality of the loans in our portfolio, our corporate credit rating, general economic conditions, investor demand for ABS and corporate unsecured debt and competition in the deposit market. Loans are priced to anticipate our cost of funds and expected charge off rate over the life of the loans. Our Private Education Loans earn variable rate interest and are funded primarily with variable rate liabilities. The Consumer Lending segments net interest margin was 3.85 percent in 2010 and 2009. Provision For Loan Losses Management estimates and maintains an allowance for loan losses equal to charge offs expected over the next two years. The provision is an income statement item that reduces segment revenues. Generally the allowance rises when charge offs are expected to increase and falls when charge offs are expected to decline. Our loss exposure and resulting provision for losses is smaller for FFELP Loans than for Private Education Loans because we bear a maximum of 3 percent loss exposure on FFELP Loans. Our provision for losses in our FFELP Loans segment was $98 million in 2010 compared with $119 million in 2009. Our loss exposure and resulting provision in our Consumer Lending segment is much greater than our FFELP Loans segment. Losses in our Consumer Lending segment are primarily driven by risk characteristics such as loan program type, school type, loan status (in school, grace, forbearance, repayment and delinquency), seasoning (number of months in active repayment for which a scheduled payment was due), underwriting criteria (e.g., credit scores), existence or absence of a cosigner and the current economic environment. Our provision for loan losses in our Consumer Lending segment was $1.298 billion in 2010 compared with $1.399 billion in 2009. Charge Offs and Delinquencies When we conclude a loan is uncollectable (from the borrower or Guarantor), the unrecoverable portion of the loan is charged against the allowance for loan losses in the relevant lending segment. Information regarding charge offs provides relevant information over time with respect to the actual performance of our loan portfolios as compared against the provisions for loan losses on those portfolios. The Consumer Lending segments charge off rate was 5 percent of loans in 2010 compared with 6 percent in 2009. Delinquencies are a very important indicator of the potential future credit performance. Management focuses on the overall level of delinquencies as well as the progression of loans from early to late stage delinquency. Core Earnings basis Private Education Loan delinquencies as a percentage of Private Education Loans in repayment decreased from 12.1 percent at December 31, 2009 to 10.6 percent at December 31, 2010. Servicing and Contingency Revenues We earn servicing revenues from servicing student loans, Campus Payment Solutions, and from account asset servicing related to 529 college savings plans. We earn contingency revenue related to default aversion and contingency collections work we do primarily on federal loans. The fees we recognize are primarily driven by our success in collecting or rehabilitating defaulted loans, the number of transactions processed and the underlying volume of loans we are servicing on behalf of others. 25 Other Income/(Loss) In managing our loan portfolios and funding sources we periodically engage in sales of loans and the repurchase of our outstanding debt. In each case, depending on market conditions, we may incur gains or losses from these transactions that affect our results from operations. We also recognize gains and losses in accordance with GAAP on our derivative and hedging activities from the changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and ineffectiveness on derivatives that do qualify for hedge accounting. Operating Expenses The operating expenses reported for our Consumer Lending and Business Services segments are those that are directly attributable to the generation of revenues by those segments. The operating expenses for the FFELP Loans segment primarily represent an intercompany servicing charge from the Business Services segment and do not reflect our actual underlying costs incurred to service the loans. We have included corporate overhead expenses and certain information technology costs (together referred to as Overhead) in our Other segment rather than allocate those expenses by segment. These overhead expenses include costs related to executive management, the board of directors, accounting, finance, legal, human resources, stock option expense and certain information technology costs related to infrastructure and operations. Core Earnings Management uses Core Earnings as the primary financial performance measure to evaluate performance and to allocate resources. Core Earnings is the basis in which we prepare our segment disclosures as required by GAAP under ASC 280 Segment Reporting (see Note 19 Segment Reporting). For a full explanation of the contents and limitations of Core Earnings see Core Earnings Definition and Limitations of this Item 7. 2010 Summary We overcame considerable challenges and achieved significant accomplishments in 2010. We continue to operate in an extremely challenging macroeconomic environment marked by high unemployment and periods of extreme illiquidity in the capital markets. Effective July 1, 2010, HCERA eliminated FFELP Loan originations, a major source of our net income. As a result, we will no longer have revenue related to FFELP Loan originations and will have declining net income related to our portfolio of FFELP Loans and related FFELP Loan servicing and collections activities. HCERA does not alter or affect the terms and conditions of our existing FFELP Loans. Net interest income we earn on our FFELP Loan portfolio will decline over time as the portfolio amortizes. We will no longer earn any origination fees for originating FFELP Loans (which was $34 million in 2010) and the Guarantor maintenance fees (which was $56 million in 2010) will decline as the portfolio pays down. In addition, we earned $245 million in FFELP contingency revenue in 2010, which we expect to remain relatively stable through 2012 and then steadily decline as the portfolio of defaulted FFELP Loans we manage is resolved and amortizes. In response to these legislative and economic challenges we explored splitting the Company into two publicly traded companies, representing our runoff and growth businesses. We also explored selling our residual interests in our securitized FFELP Loans to effectively remove the securitized loans from our balance sheet. After evaluating both strategies we determined that neither strategy currently provides better economic returns to investors than our current operating structure. On December 31, 2010, we closed on our agreement to purchase the $26.1 billion of securitized federal loans and related assets from the Student Loan Corporation. This transaction will be accretive to 2011 earnings and beyond. We continue to seek to acquire FFELP Loan portfolios. Despite the economic environment, we saw significant improvements in the quality of our lending business segments. 26 At the end of the year, our FFELP Loan portfolio was 93 percent funded to term with long term liabilities including the ED sponsored Straight A conduit. We also completed $2 billion of FFELP Loan asset backed securitization transactions in 2010. The net interest margin in our FFELP Loans segment improved to 93 basis points in 2010 from 67 basis points in 2009 as the CP/LIBOR spread returned to historical levels. In addition, we sold $20.4 billion of loans to ED in 2010 resulting in gains of $321 million. In our Private Education Loan portfolio, delinquencies greater than 90 days trended lower throughout the year to 5.3 percent of loans in repayment at year end compared to 6.4 percent of loans in repayment at the end of the first quarter of the year. The quarterly provision for loan losses ended the year at $294 million, down from the second quarter 2010 peak of $349 million. Private Education Loan originations improved over the course of 2010 as well. After falling more than 40 percent in each of the first two quarters of the year compared with the year ago quarters they fell just 6 percent in the third quarter and increased 8 percent in the fourth quarter. We completed $4.1 billion of Private Education Loan asset backed securitization transactions in 2010. The Consumer Lending segment returned to profitability in 2010 after posting a loss in the prior year. In our Business Services segment, we saw increased revenue in our third party servicing, contingency collections and account asset servicing lines of business. We decided to discontinue our Purchased Paper collection business at the end of 2010. In response to the elimination of FFELP, in 2010 we expanded an ongoing operating expense reduction initiative, including closing our Florida and Texas servicing centers and relocating our headquarters to Newark, Delaware by March 31, 2011. Core Earnings improved significantly to $1 billion from $807 million in the prior year. This was due to a number of factors including lower provision for loan losses, and a higher net interest margin. In 2010 we issued $1.5 billion of 10 year unsecured debt and repurchased $4.9 billion of unsecured debt. Combined with our asset backed securitization transactions, these actions significantly improved the overall maturity profile of our outstanding debt. 2011 Outlook We do not expect the economic environment to improve significantly in 2011. A high unemployment rate is expected to result in a challenging environment for financial services companies such as ours. We expect our Core Earnings business results to improve principally due to the significant improvement in the quality of our Private Education Loan portfolio. Increases in the cost of attaining a higher education and enrollments should drive increased volume in our consumer lending, servicing and collection businesses. Core Earnings are expected to be lower in 2011 than in 2010; however, this is principally due to a sharp decline in gains on debt repurchases and the absence of revenue generated from the sale of FFELP Loans to ED. In 2008 we significantly tightened our underwriting criteria and exited certain lending segments. In addition, each successive repayment cohort, i.e., a group of loans that enter their initial repayment status in the same calendar year upon exiting their grace period following graduation/separation from school, has been of higher quality. In 2009 we began to offer Smart Option Student Loans, which require students to make interest payments while they are in school, a departure from past practices where all required payments were deferred until the student graduated. In 2010, we began offering the Fixed Pay repayment option, which requires a payment during school that is less than a full interest payment. The loans that entered repayment in the fourth quarter of 2010 will influence delinquency trends in the first half of 2011 and charge offs in the second half. This cohort of loans is significantly smaller and of higher quality than previous repay cohorts, it has a higher average credit score and is comprised of significantly smaller amounts of higher risk non traditional and non cosigned loans on a percentage basis and in total volume. On January 11, 2011 we issued $2 billion, five year 6.25 percent fixed rate unsecured notes. The rate on the notes was swapped from a fixed rate to a floating rate equal to an all in cost of one month LIBOR plus 4.46 percent. Investor demand was the highest ever for a Sallie Mae issue, which we believe reflects investors views that our financial condition has strengthened. In 2011, we expect to access the unsecured debt market 27 and the term asset backed securities market to re finance both FFELP and Private Education Loans. We believe that conditions in these markets have improved as compared to last year and are conducive to funding at more favorable spreads and advance rates. Retail Bank deposits are also expected to continue to be a source of funding at favorable rates. We currently expect our net interest margins in the coming year to be stable in both our FFELP Loans and Consumer Lending segments. 2011 Management Objectives In 2011 we have set out five major goals to create shareholder value. They are: (1) Reduce our operating expenses; (2) Maximize cash flows from FFELP Loans; (3) Prudently grow Consumer Lending segment assets and revenue; (4) Increase Business Services segment revenue; and (5) Reinstate dividends and or share repurchases. Here is how we plan to achieve these objectives. Reduce Operating Expenses The elimination of FFELP by HCERA greatly reduced the scope of our historical revenue generating capabilities. In 2010 we originated $14 billion of loans, 84 percent of them FFELP Loans; in 2011 we expect to originate $2.5 billion of new loans, all of them Private Education Loans. Our FFELP related revenues will decline over the coming years. As a result, we must effectively match our cost structure to our ongoing business. Operating expenses will be reduced company wide. We have set a goal of getting to an annualized operating expense quarterly run rate of $250 million by the fourth quarter of 2011. Maximize Cash Flows from FFELP Loans We have a $148.6 billion portfolio of FFELP Loans that is expected to generate significant amounts of cash flow and earnings in the coming years. We plan to reduce related costs, minimize income volatility and opportunistically purchase other FFELP Loan portfolios like we did with SLC. Grow Consumer Lending Segment Assets and Revenue Successfully growing Private Education Loan lending is the key component of our long term plan to grow shareholder value. We must originate increasing numbers of high quality Private Education Loans, increase net interest margins and further reduce charge offs and provision for loan losses. To manage our borrowing costs, we must achieve more attractive term asset backed securities market access and prices in the coming year. Increase Business Services Segment Revenue Our Business Services segment is comprised of several businesses with customers related to FFELP that will experience revenue declines and several businesses with customers that provide growth opportunities. Our growth businesses are ED servicing, ED collections, other school based asset type servicing and collections, Campus Payment Solutions, transaction processing and 529 college savings plan account asset servicing. We currently have a 22 percent market share of the ED Servicing Contract. This volume will grow organically as more loans are originated under DL. Our goal is to further expand our market share and broaden the services we provide to ED and other third party servicing clients. The ED collection contract will also grow organically as more loans are originated under DL. We also seek to increase our market share through improved performance. Campus Payment Solutions is a business line that we expect to grow by expanding our product offerings and leveraging our deep relationships with colleges and universities. Assets under management in 529 college savings plans total $34.5 billion and have been growing at a rate of 21 percent over the last three years. Our goal is to service additional 529 plans. Reinstate Dividends and or Share Repurchases We suspended our dividend and share repurchase programs in April 2007 and have not since reinstated these programs. We now believe that our cash flow and capital positions have strengthened sufficiently that by 28 the second half of 2011, we will be able to recommend to our board of directors that we either reinstate a dividend, begin to repurchase shares or do a combination of both. Results of Operations We present the results of operations first on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP. As discussed earlier, we have four business segments, FFELP Loans, Consumer Lending, Business Services and Other segments. Since these segments operate in distinct business environments, the discussion following the Consolidated Earnings Summary is presented on a segment basis and is shown on a Core Earnings basis. See Item 1 Business Business Segments for further discussion on the components of each segment. 29 GAAP Statements of Income Increase (Decrease) Years Ended December 31, 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 $ % $ % Interest income FFELP Loans $ 3,345 $ 3,094 $ 5,173 $ 251 8 % $ (2,079 ) (40 )% Private Education Loans 2,353 1,582 1,738 771 49 (156 ) (9 ) Other loans 30 56 83 (26 ) (46 ) (27 ) (33 ) Cash and investments 26 26 276 (250 ) (91 ) Total interest income 5,754 4,758 7,270 996 21 (2,512 ) (35 ) Total interest expense 2,275 3,035 5,905 (760 ) (25 ) (2,870 ) (49 ) Net interest income 3,479 1,723 1,365 1,756 102 358 26 Less: provisions for loan losses 1,419 1,119 720 300 27 399 55 Net interest income after provisions for loan losses 2,060 604 645 1,456 241 (41 ) (6 ) Other income (loss): Securitization servicing and Residual Interest revenue 295 262 (295 ) (100 ) 33 13 Gains (losses) on sales of loans and securities, net 325 284 (186 ) 41 14 470 253 Losses on derivative and hedging activities, net (361 ) (604 ) (445 ) 243 (40 ) (159 ) 36 Servicing revenue 405 440 408 (35 ) (8 ) 32 8 Contingency revenue 330 294 330 36 12 (36 ) (11 ) Gains on debt repurchases 317 536 64 (219 ) (41 ) 472 738 Other income 6 88 39 (82 ) (93 ) 49 126 Total other income 1,022 1,333 472 (311 ) (23 ) 861 182 Expenses: Operating expenses 1,208 1,043 1,029 165 16 14 1 Goodwill and acquired intangible assets impairment and amortization expense 699 76 50 623 820 26 52 Restructuring expenses 85 10 72 75 750 (62 ) (86 ) Total expenses 1,992 1,129 1,151 863 76 (22 ) (2 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations, before income tax expense (benefit) 1,090 808 (34 ) 282 35 842 2,476 Income tax expense (benefit) 493 264 (36 ) 229 87 300 833 Net income from continuing operations 597 544 2 53 10 542 27,100 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (67 ) (220 ) (215 ) 153 (70 ) (5 ) 2 Net income (loss) 530 324 (213 ) 206 64 537 252 Preferred stock dividends 72 146 111 (74 ) (51 ) 35 32 Net income (loss) attributable to common stock $ 458 $ 178 $ (324 ) $ 280 157 % $ 502 155 % Basic earnings (loss) per common share: Continuing operations $ 1.08 $ .85 $ (.23 ) $ .23 27 % $ 1.08 470 % Discontinued operations $ (.14 ) $ (.47 ) $ (.46 ) $ .33 (70 )% $ (.01 ) 2 % Total $ .94 $ .38 $ (.69 ) $ .56 147 % $ 1.07 155 % Diluted earnings (loss) per common share: Continuing operations $ 1.08 $ .85 $ (.23 ) $ .23 27 % $ 1.08 470 % Discontinued operations $ (.14 ) $ (.47 ) $ (.46 ) $ .33 (70 )% $ (.01 ) 2 % Total $ .94 $ .38 $ (.69 ) $ .56 147 % $ 1.07 155 % Dividends per common share $ $ $ $ % $ % 30 Consolidated Earnings Summary GAAP basis Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2009 For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, net income was $530 million, or $.94 diluted earnings per common share, and $324 million, or $.38 diluted earnings per common share, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, net income from continuing operations was $597 million, or $1.08 diluted earnings per common share, and $544 million, or $.85 diluted earnings per common share, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, net loss from discontinued operations was $67 million, or $.14 diluted loss per common share, and $220 million, or $.47 diluted loss per common share from discontinued operations per common share, respectively. Income from Continuing Operations before Income Tax Expense Income from continuing operations before income tax expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2010, by $282 million as compared with the prior year primarily due to a $1.5 billion increase in net interest income after provisions for loan losses and a $243 million decrease in net losses on derivative and hedging activities. These improvements were partially offset by a $660 million goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge, a $165 million increase in operating expenses, a $219 million decrease in gains on debt repurchases and a decrease in securitization servicing and Residual Interest revenue of $295 million. The primary contributors to each of the identified drivers of changes in income from continuing operations before income tax expense for the year over year period are as follows: Net interest income after provisions for loan losses increased by $1.5 billion in the year ended December 31, 2010 from the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in net interest income and provisions for loan losses was partially due to the adoption as of January 1, 2010 of the new consolidation accounting guidance which resulted in the consolidation of $35.0 billion of assets and $34.4 billion of liabilities in certain securitizations trusts. (See Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies for a further discussion of the effect of adopting the new consolidation accounting guidance). The consolidation of these securitization trusts as of January 1, 2010 resulted in $998 million of additional net interest income and $355 million of additional provisions for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2010. Excluding the effect of the trusts being consolidated as of January 1, 2010, net interest income increased $758 million from the year ended 2009 and provisions for loan losses decreased $55 million from the year ended 2009. The increase in net interest income, excluding the effect of the new consolidation accounting guidance, was primarily the result of an increase in the FFELP Loans net interest margin primarily due to an improvement in our funding costs, a 24 basis point tightening of the CP/LIBOR spread and the effect of not receiving hedge accounting treatment for derivatives used to economically hedge risk affecting net interest income. The decrease in the provisions for loan losses relates to the Private Education Loan loss provision, which decreased as a result of the improving performance of the portfolio. Securitization servicing and Residual Interest revenue was no longer recorded in fiscal year 2010 due to the adoption of the new consolidation accounting guidance; however, we recognized $295 million in the prior year. Gains on sales of loans and securities increased $41 million from the prior year primarily related to the gains on sales of additional FFELP Loans to ED as part of EDs Loan Purchase Commitment Program (the Purchase Program). These gains will not occur in the future as the Purchase Program ended in 2010. Losses on derivatives and hedging activities, net, declined by $243 million in 2010 compared with 2009. The primary factor affecting the change in losses in 2010 was interest rates. Valuations of derivative instruments vary based upon many factors including changes in interest rates, credit risk, foreign currency fluctuations and other market factors. As a result, we expect gains and (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities, net, to vary significantly in future periods. 31 Servicing revenue decreased by $35 million primarily due to HCERA becoming effective as of July 1, 2010, thereby eliminating our ability to earn additional guarantor issuance fees on new FFELP Loans, as well as to a decline in outstanding FFELP Loans for which we were earning additional fees. Contingency revenue increased $36 million primarily from increased collections on defaulted FFELP Loans. Gains on debt repurchases decreased $219 million year over year while the principal amount of debt repurchased increased to $4.9 billion, as compared with the $3.4 billion repurchased in fiscal year 2009. We expect to continue to repurchase debt in the future and the amount of gains in the future will be dependent on market conditions and available liquidity. Other income declined by $82 million primarily due to a $71 million decrease in foreign currency translation gains. The foreign currency translation gains relate to a portion of our foreign currency denominated debt that does not receive hedge accounting treatment. These gains were partially offset by the losses on derivative and hedging activities, net line item on the income statement related to the derivatives used to economically hedge these debt instruments. Operating expenses, excluding restructuring related asset impairments of $19 million in 2010, increased $146 million year over year primarily due to an increase in legal contingency expense, costs related to the ED Servicing Contract, higher collection and servicing costs from a higher number of loans in repayment and in delinquent status, and higher marketing and technology enhancement costs related to Private Education Loans. Goodwill and intangible asset impairment and amortization increased $623 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to the $660 million of impairment recognized as a result of the passage of HCERA and its negative effects on the anticipated cash flows for certain of our reporting units and the reduced market values of these units. The amortization of acquired intangibles for continuing operations and for discontinued operations each remained relatively unchanged for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. For additional discussion regarding the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets see Note 6 Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets. Restructuring expenses increased $69 million in the year ended December 31, 2010, which is a result of a $75 million increase in restructuring expenses in continuing operations partially offset by a $6 million decrease in restructuring expenses attributable to discontinued operations. The following details our ongoing restructuring efforts: On March 30, 2010, President Obama signed into law H.R. 4872, HCERA, which included the SAFRA Act. Effective July 1, 2010, this legislation eliminated FFELP and requires all new federal loans to be made through the DSLP. Restructuring our operations in response to this change in law requires a significant reduction of operating costs from the elimination of positions and facilities associated with the origination of FFELP Loans. Expenses associated with continuing operations under this restructuring plan were $83 million in fiscal year 2010. We are currently finalizing this restructuring plan and expect to incur an estimated $11 million of additional restructuring costs in 2011. The majority of these expenses are severance costs related to the partially completed and planned elimination of approximately 2,500 positions, approximately 30 percent of our workforce that existed as of the first quarter 2010. In response to the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 (CCRAA) and challenges in the capital markets, we also initiated a restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of 2007. Under this ongoing plan, restructuring expenses associated with continuing operations of $2 million and $10 million were recognized in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The majority of these restructuring expenses were also severance costs related to the elimination of approximately 3,000 positions, or approximately 25 percent of our workforce that existed as of the fourth quarter 2007. 32 Income tax expense from continuing operations increased $229 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared with the prior year. The effective tax rates for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were 45 percent and 33 percent, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily driven by the impact of non deductible goodwill impairments recorded in 2010 and state tax rate changes recorded in both periods. Net Loss from Discontinued Operations. Net loss from discontinued operations in the year ended December 31, 2010 was $67 million compared with a net loss from discontinued operations of $220 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we sold our Purchased Paper Mortgage/Properties business for $280 million which resulted in an after tax loss of $95 million. As a result of this sale, the results of operations of this business were presented in discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2009. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we began actively marketing our Purchased Paper Non Mortgage business for sale and have concluded it is probable this business will be sold within one year at which time we would exit the business. As a result, the results of operations of this business were also required to be presented in discontinued operations beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010. In connection with this presentation, we are required to carry this business at the lower of fair value or historical cost basis. As a result, we recorded an after tax loss of $52 million from discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2010, primarily due to adjusting the value of this business to its estimated fair value. Our Purchased Paper businesses are presented in discontinued operations for the current and prior periods. The additional losses for both years that are more than the losses discussed above relate to ongoing impairment recorded as a result of the weakened economys effect on our ability to collect the receivables. Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2008 For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, net income was $324 million, or $.38 diluted earnings per common share, and a net loss of $213 million, or $.69 diluted loss per common share, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, net income from continuing operations was $544 million, or $.85 diluted earnings per common share, and $2 million, or $.23 diluted loss per common share, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, net loss from discontinued operations was $220 million, or $.47 diluted loss per common share, and $215 million, or $.46 diluted loss from discontinued operations per common share, respectively. Income from Continuing Operations before Income Tax Expense. Income from continuing operations before income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased $842 million from the prior year. The $842 million increase was primarily due to an increase in gains on debt repurchases of $472 million and an increase in gains on sales of loans and securities of $470 million offset by an increase of $159 million in net losses on derivative and hedging activities. The primary contributors to each of the identified drivers of changes in income from continuing operations before income tax expense for the year over year period are as follows: Net interest income after provisions for loan losses decreased by $41 million in the year ended December 31, 2009 from the prior year. This decrease was due to a $399 million increase in provisions for loan losses partially offset by a $358 million increase in net interest income. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to an increase in the FFELP Loans net interest margin primarily due to an increase in Gross Floor Income and the impact of derivative accounting and a $15 billion increase in the average balance of GAAP basis student loans. The increase in provisions for loan losses related primarily to increases in charge off expectations on Private Education Loans primarily as a result of the continued weakening of the U.S. economy. Securitization servicing and Residual Interest revenue increased by $33 million from the prior year primarily due to a $95 million decrease in the current year unrealized mark to market loss on our Residual Interests compared with the prior year, partially offset by a decrease in net Embedded Floor value. 33 Gains on sales of loans and securities increased $470 million from the prior year. The increase is primarily attributable to a $284 million gain on our sale of approximately $18.5 billion of FFELP Loans to ED as part of the ED Purchase Program and the $186 million loss incurred in fiscal year 2008. The 2008 loss resulted from our repurchase of delinquent Private Education Loans from our off balance sheet securitization trusts and the sale of approximately $1.0 billion FFELP Loans to the ED under ECASLA, which resulted in a $53 million loss. Losses on derivatives and hedging activities, net, increased by $159 million in 2009 compared with 2008. The primary factors affecting the change in losses in 2009 were interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Valuations of derivative instruments vary based upon many factors, including changes in interest rates, credit risk, foreign currency fluctuations and other market factors. As a result, we expect gains and (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities, net, to vary significantly in future periods. Servicing Revenue increased $32 million when compared with the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the initiation of Direct Lending servicing in 2009. Contingency revenue decreased $36 million when compared with the prior year primarily as a result of less Guarantor collections revenue from rehabilitating delinquent FFELP Loans. Gains on debt repurchases increased $472 million when compared with the prior year. We repurchased $3.4 billion of our unsecured corporate debt as compared with $1.9 billion in the prior year. Other income increased by $49 million primarily due to a $54 million increase in foreign currency translation gains. These gains were partially offset by the losses on derivative and hedging activities, net line item on the income statement related to the derivatives used to economically hedge these debt instruments. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, operating expenses, excluding restructuring related asset impairments of $0 and $6 million, respectively, were $1,043 million compared with $1,023 million, respectively. The $20 million increase from the prior year relates to increased marketing expense related to our direct to consumer marketing activities, increased technology costs as well as increased collections costs. Goodwill and intangible asset impairment for continuing operations increased by $35 million in 2009 and the goodwill and intangible asset impairment for discontinued operations decreased by like amount as compared with the prior year. For additional discussion regarding the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets see Note 6 Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets. The amortization of acquired intangibles for continuing operations totaled $38 million and $48 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and the amortization of acquired intangibles for discontinued operations totaled $1 million and $6 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Restructuring expenses of $22 million and $84 million were recognized in the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, of which $10 million and $72 million were in continuing operations and $12 million and $12 million were in discontinued operations, respectively. Income tax expense from continuing operations was $264 million in 2009 compared with an income tax benefit of $36 million in 2008, resulting in effective tax rates of 33 percent and 106 percent, respectively. The movement in the effective tax rate in 2009 compared with the prior year was primarily driven by the reduction of tax and interest on U.S. federal and state uncertain tax positions in both periods, as well as the permanent tax impact of deducting Proposed Merger related transaction costs in 2008. Also contributing to the higher effective tax rate in 2008 was the effect of significantly higher reported pre tax income in 2009 and the resulting changes in the proportion of income subject to federal and state taxes. For additional information, see Note 18 Income Taxes. 34 Net Loss from Discontinued Operations. Net loss from discontinued operations in the year ended December 31, 2009 increased $5 million from the prior year. Our Purchased Paper businesses are presented in discontinued operations for the current and prior years. Preferred Stock Dividend Expense During 2009, we converted $339 million of our Series C Preferred Stock to common stock. As part of this conversion, we delivered to the holders of the preferred stock: (1) approximately 17 million shares (the number of common shares they would most likely receive if the preferred stock they held mandatorily converted to common shares in the fourth quarter of 2010) plus (2) a discounted amount of the preferred stock dividends the holders of the preferred stock would have received if they held the preferred stock through the mandatory conversion date. The accounting treatment for this conversion resulted in additional expense recorded as a part of preferred stock dividends for the period of approximately $53 million. Core Earnings Definition and Limitations We prepare financial statements in accordance with GAAP. However, we also evaluate our business segments on a basis that differs from GAAP. We refer to this different basis of presentation as Core Earnings. We provide this Core Earnings basis of presentation on a consolidated basis for each business segment because this is what we internally review when making management decisions regarding our performance and how we allocate resources. We also refer to this information in our presentations with credit rating agencies, lenders and investors. Because our Core Earnings basis of presentation corresponds to our segment financial presentations, we are required by GAAP to provide Core Earnings disclosure in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for our business segments. For additional information, see Note 19 Segment Reporting. Core Earnings are not a substitute for reported results under GAAP. We use Core Earnings to manage each business segment because Core Earnings reflect adjustments to GAAP financial results for three items, discussed below, that create significant volatility mostly due to timing factors generally beyond the control of management. Accordingly, we believe that Core Earnings provide management with a useful basis from which to better evaluate results from ongoing operations against the business plan or against results from prior periods. Consequently, we disclose this information as we believe it provides investors with additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely assessed by management. The three items adjusted for in our Core Earnings presentations are (1) the off balance sheet treatment of certain securitization transactions, (2) our use of derivatives instruments to hedge our economic risks that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment or do qualify for hedge accounting treatment but result in ineffectiveness and (3) the accounting for goodwill and acquired intangible assets. While GAAP provides a uniform, comprehensive basis of accounting, for the reasons described above, our Core Earnings basis of presentation does not. Core Earnings are subject to certain general and specific limitations that investors should carefully consider. For example, there is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance for management reporting. Our Core Earnings are not defined terms within GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Accordingly, our Core Earnings presentation does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Investors, therefore, may not be able to compare our performance with that of other financial services companies based upon Core Earnings. Core Earnings results are only meant to supplement GAAP results by providing additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely used by management, our board of directors, rating agencies, lenders and investors to assess performance. Specific adjustments that management makes to GAAP results to derive our Core Earnings basis of presentation are described in detail in the section entitled Core Earnings Definition and Limitations Differences between Core Earnings and GAAP of this Item 7. 35 The following tables show Core Earnings for each business segment and our business as a whole along with the adjustments made to the income/expense items to reconcile the amounts to our reported GAAP results as required by GAAP and reported in Note 19 Segment Reporting.

Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Core Earnings $ 1,028 $ 807 $ 583 Core Earnings adjustments: Net impact of derivative accounting 83 (502 ) (751 ) Net impact of goodwill and acquired intangibles (699 ) (76 ) (73 ) Net impact of securitization accounting (201 ) (442 ) Total Core Earnings adjustments before income tax effect (616 ) (779 ) (1,266 ) Net income tax effect 118 296 470 Total Core Earnings adjustments (498 ) (483 ) (796 ) GAAP net income (loss) $ 530 $ 324 $ (213 ) 1) Derivative Accounting: Core Earnings exclude periodic unrealized gains and losses that are caused primarily by the mark to market valuations on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under GAAP. To a lesser extent, these periodic unrealized gains and losses are also a result of ineffectiveness recognized related to effective hedges. These unrealized gains and losses occur in our FFELP Loans, Consumer Lending and Other business segments. Under GAAP, for derivatives we generally use that are held to maturity, the cumulative net unrealized gain or loss at the time of maturity will equal $0 except for Floor Income Contracts where the cumulative unrealized gain will equal the amount for which we sold the contract. In our Core Earnings presentation, we recognize the economic effect of these hedges, which generally results in any cash paid or received being recognized ratably as an expense or revenue over the hedged items life. The accounting for derivatives requires that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments be recognized currently in earnings, with no fair value adjustment of the hedged item, unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. We believe that our derivatives are effective economic hedges, and as such, are a critical element of our interest rate and foreign currency risk management strategy. However, some of our derivatives, primarily Floor Income Contracts and certain basis swaps, do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and the stand alone derivative must be marked to market in the income statement with no consideration for the corresponding change in fair value of the hedged item. These gains and losses recorded in Gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net are primarily caused by interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate volatility and changing credit spreads during the period as well as the volume and term of derivatives not receiving hedge accounting treatment. Our Floor Income Contracts are written options that must meet more stringent requirements than other hedging relationships to achieve hedge effectiveness. Specifically, our Floor Income Contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment because the pay down of principal of the student loans underlying the Floor Income embedded in those student loans does not exactly match the change in the notional amount of our written Floor Income Contracts. Under derivatives accounting treatment, the upfront payment is deemed a liability and changes in fair value are recorded through income throughout the life of the contract. The change in the value of Floor Income Contracts is primarily caused by changing interest rates that cause the amount of Floor Income earned on the underlying student loans and paid to the counterparties to vary. This is economically offset by the change in value of the student loan portfolio earning Floor Income but that offsetting change in value is not recognized. We believe the Floor Income Contracts are economic hedges because they effectively fix the amount of Floor Income earned over the contract period, thus eliminating the timing and uncertainty that changes in interest rates can have on Floor Income for that period. Therefore, for purposes of Core Earnings, we have removed the unrealized gains and losses related to these contracts and added back the amortization of the net premiums received on the Floor Income Contracts. The amortization of the net premiums received on the Floor Income Contracts for Core Earnings is reflected in student loan interest income. Under GAAP accounting, the premium received on the Floor Income Contracts is recorded as revenue in the gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities, net line item by the end of the contracts life. Basis swaps are used to convert floating rate debt from one floating interest rate index to another to better match the interest rate characteristics of the assets financed by that debt. We primarily use basis swaps to 39 hedge our student loan assets that are primarily indexed to a commercial paper, Prime or Treasury bill index. In addition, we use basis swaps to convert debt indexed to the Consumer Price Index to three month LIBOR debt. The accounting for derivatives requires that when using basis swaps, the change in the cash flows of the hedge effectively offset both the change in the cash flows of the asset and the change in the cash flows of the liability. Our basis swaps hedge variable interest rate risk; however, they generally do not meet this effectiveness test because the index of the swap does not exactly match the index of the hedged assets as required for hedge accounting treatment. Additionally, some of our FFELP Loans can earn at either a variable or a fixed interest rate depending on market interest rates and therefore swaps written on the FFELP Loans do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting treatment. As a result, under GAAP, these swaps are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected currently in the income statement. The table below quantifies the adjustments for derivative accounting on our net income for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 when compared with the accounting principles employed in all years prior to the adoption of ASC 815 related to accounting for derivative financial instruments. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Core Earnings derivative adjustments: Gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net, included in other income(1) $ (361 ) $ (604 ) $ (445 ) Less: Realized (gains) losses on derivative and hedging activities, net(1) 815 322 (107 ) Unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net 454 (282 ) (552 ) Amortization of net premiums on Floor Income Contracts in net interest income (317 ) (197 ) (191 ) Other pre change in derivatives accounting adjustments (54 ) (23 ) (8 ) Total net impact derivative accounting(2) $ 83 $ (502 ) $ (751 ) (1) See Reclassification of Realized Gains (Losses) on Derivative and Hedging Activities below for a detailed breakdown of the components of realized losses on derivative and hedging activities. (2) Negative amounts are subtracted from Core Earnings to arrive at GAAP net income and positive amounts are added to Core Earnings to arrive at GAAP net income. Reclassification of Realized Gains (Losses) on Derivative and Hedging Activities The accounting for derivative instruments requires net settlement income/expense on derivatives and realized gains/losses related to derivative dispositions (collectively referred to as realized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities) that do not qualify as hedges to be recorded in a separate income statement line item below net interest income. Under our Core Earnings presentation, these gains and (losses) are reclassified to the income statement line item of the economically hedged item. For our Core Earnings net interest margin, this would primarily include: (a) reclassifying the net settlement amounts related to our Floor Income Contracts to student loan interest income and (b) reclassifying the net settlement amounts related to certain of our basis swaps to debt interest expense. The table below summarizes the realized losses on derivative and hedging activities and the associated reclassification on a Core Earnings basis for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Reclassification of realized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities: Net settlement expense on Floor Income Contracts reclassified to net interest income $ (888 ) $ (717 ) $ (488 ) Net settlement income (expense) on interest rate swaps reclassified to net interest income 69 412 563 Foreign exchange derivatives gains/(losses) reclassified to other income (15 ) 11 Net realized gains (losses) on terminated derivative contracts reclassified to other income 4 (2 ) 21 Total reclassifications of realized (gains)losses on derivative and hedging activities (815 ) (322 ) 107 Add: Unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net(1) 454 (282 ) (552 ) Gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net $ (361 ) $ (604 ) $ (445 ) 40 (1) Unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net comprises the following unrealized mark to market gains (losses): Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Floor Income Contracts $ 156 $ 483 $ (529 ) Basis swaps 341 (413 ) (239 ) Foreign currency hedges (83 ) (255 ) 328 Other 40 (97 ) (112 ) Total unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net $ 454 $ (282 ) $ (552 ) 2) Goodwill and Acquired Intangibles: Our Core Earnings exclude goodwill and intangible impairment and the amortization of acquired intangibles.

As a result, going forward, there will no longer be differences between our GAAP and Core Earnings presentation for securitization accounting. (See Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies for further detail). Prior to the adoption of the new consolidation accounting guidance on January 1, 2010, certain securitization transactions in our FFELP Loans and Consumer Lending business segments were accounted for as sales of assets. Under Core Earnings for the FFELP Loans and Consumer Lending business segments, we presented all securitization transactions as long term non recourse financings. The upfront gains on sale from securitization transactions, as well as ongoing securitization servicing and Residual Interest revenue (loss) presented in accordance with GAAP, were excluded from Core Earnings and were replaced by interest income, provisions for loan losses, and interest expense as earned or incurred on the securitization loans. This additional net interest margin included for Core Earnings contains any related fees or costs such as Consolidation Loan Rebate Fees, premium and discount amortization as well as any Repayment Borrower Benefit yield adjustments. We also excluded transactions with our off balance sheet trusts from Core Earnings as they were considered intercompany transactions on a Core Earnings basis. While we believe that our Core Earnings presentation presents the economic substance of results from our loan portfolios, when compared to GAAP results, it understates earnings volatility from securitization gains, securitization servicing income and Residual Interest income. 41 The following table summarizes Core Earnings securitization adjustments for the FFELP Loans and Consumer Lending business segments for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Core Earnings securitization adjustments: Net interest income on securitized loans, before provisions for loan losses and before intercompany transactions $ (942 ) $ (872 ) Provisions for loan losses 445 309 Net interest income on securitized loans, after provisions for loan losses, before intercompany transactions (497 ) (563 ) Intercompany transactions with off balance sheet trusts 1 (141 ) Net interest income on securitized loans, after provisions for loan losses (496 ) (704 ) Securitization servicing and Residual Interest revenue 295 262 Total Core Earnings securitization adjustments(1) $ (201 ) $ (442 ) (1) Negative amounts are subtracted from Core Earnings to arrive at GAAP net income and positive amounts are added to Core Earnings to arrive at GAAP net income. Intercompany transactions with off balance sheet trusts in the above table relate primarily to losses that result from the repurchase of delinquent loans from our off balance sheet securitization trusts. When Private Education Loans in our securitization trusts settling before September 30, 2005 became 180 days delinquent, we previously exercised our contingent call option to repurchase these loans at par value out of the trust and recorded a loss for the difference in the par value paid and the fair market value of the loan at the time of purchase. We do not hold the contingent call option for any trusts settled after September 30, 2005. In October 2008, we decided to no longer exercise our contingent call option. Business Segments As a result of the change in segment reporting that occurred in the fourth quarter 2010, past periods have been recast for comparison purposes. In connection with changing the reportable segments the following lists other significant changes we made related to the new segment presentation: The operating expenses reported for each segment are directly attributable to the generation of revenues by that segment. We have included corporate overhead and certain information technology costs (together referred to as Overhead) in our Other segment rather than allocate those expenses by segment. The creation of the FFELP Loans and Business Services segments has resulted in our accounting for the significant servicing revenue we earn on FFELP Loans we own in the Business Services segment. This bifurcates the FFELP interest income between the FFELP Loans and Business Services segment, with an intercompany servicing fee charge from the Business Services segment. The intercompany amounts are the contractual rates for encumbered loans within a financing facility or a similar market rate if the loan is not in a financing facility and accordingly exceed our costs. In our GAAP basis financial presentation we allocated existing goodwill to the new reporting units within the reportable segments based upon relative fair value. During the fourth quarter 2010, we also evaluated our goodwill for impairment using both the old reporting and new reporting unit framework and there was no impairment under either analysis. Similar to prior periods, capital is assigned to each segment based on internally determined risk adjusted weightings for the assets in each segment. These weightings have been updated and differ depending on the relative risk of each asset type and represent managements view of the level of capital needed to support different assets. Unsecured debt is allocated based on the remaining funding needed for each segment after direct funding and the capital allocation has been considered. 42 As part of the change in the reportable segments in the fourth quarter of 2010, we also changed our calculation of Core Earnings. When our FFELP Loan portfolio was growing, management and our investors valued it based on recurring income streams. Given the uncertain and volatile nature of unhedged Floor Income, little future value was attributed to it by the financial markets; therefore, we excluded unhedged Floor Income from Core Earnings. Now that our FFELP Loan portfolio is amortizing down, management and investors are focused on the total amount of cash the FFELP Loan portfolio generates, including unhedged Floor Income. As a result, we now include unhedged Floor Income in Core Earnings and have recast past Core Earnings financial results to reflect this change. The effect of including unhedged Floor Income, net of tax, on Core Earnings was an increase of $21 million, $210 million and $57 million for the years ending December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

This was primarily the result of a significant reduction in the cost of our ABCP Facility, a 24 basis point improvement in the CP/LIBOR Spread and a significantly higher margin on the loans within the EDs Loan Participation Purchase Program (the Participation Program) facility compared to the prior year. As of December 31, 2010, our FFELP Loan portfolio totaled approximately $149 billion, comprised of $56 billion of FFELP Stafford and $93 billion of FFELP Consolidation Loans. The weighted average life of these portfolios is 4.9 years and 9.4 years, respectively, assuming a CPR of 6 percent and 3 percent, respectively. On December 31, 2010, we closed on our agreement to purchase an interest in $26.1 billion of securitized federal student loans and related assets from the Student Loan Corporation (SLC), a subsidiary of Citibank, N.A. The purchase price was approximately $1.1 billion. The assets purchased include the residual interest in 13 of SLCs 14 FFELP loan securitizations and its interest in SLC Funding Note Issuer related to the U.S. Department of Educations Straight A Funding asset backed commercial paper conduit. We will also service these assets and administer the securitization trusts. However, SLC will subservice these trusts on our behalf in 2011 until we transition these functions to our own servicing platform during the latter part of 2011. Because we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of these trusts we have consolidated these trusts onto our balance sheet. In addition, we contracted the right to service approximately $0.8 billion of additional FFELP securitized assets from SLC. (We did not consolidate this underlying trust because we are not the primary beneficiary of this trust.) The purchase was funded by a 5 year term loan provided by Citibank in an amount equal to the purchase price. See Note 3 Student Loans and Note 7 Borrowings for additional details regarding assets and terms of funding. 44 Floor Income Core Earnings Basis The following table analyzes the ability of the FFELP Loans in our Core Earnings portfolio to earn Floor Income after December 31, 2010 and 2009, based on interest rates as of those dates.

The following table presents a projection of the average Core Earnings basis balance of FFELP Consolidation Loans for which Fixed Rate Floor Income has been economically hedged through Floor Income Contracts for the period January 1, 2011 to March 31, 2014. The hedges related to these loans do not qualify as effective hedges. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in billions) 2011 2012 2013 2014 Average balance of FFELP Consolidation Loans whose Floor Income is economically hedged $ 28.8 $ 20.6 $ 5.6 $ .2 FFELP Provisions for Loan Losses and Loan Charge Offs The following tables summarize the total FFELP provisions for loan losses and FFELP Loan charge offs on both a GAAP basis and a Core Earnings basis for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 FFELP provisions for loan losses: Total GAAP basis $ 98 $ 106 $ 106 Total Core Earnings basis 98 119 127 FFELP loan charge offs: Total GAAP basis $ 87 $ 79 $ 58 Total Core Earnings basis 87 94 79 45 Servicing Revenue and Other Income FFELP Loans Segment The following table summarizes the components of Core Earnings other income for our FFELP Loans segment for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Servicing revenue $ 68 $ 75 $ 77 Gains (losses) on sales of loans and securities, net 325 284 (51 ) Other (5 ) 8 9 Total other income, net $ 388 $ 367 $ 35 Servicing revenue for our FFELP Loans segment primarily consists of borrower late fees. The gains on sales of loans and securities in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, related primarily to the sale of $20.4 billion and $18.5 billion loans, respectively, of FFELP Loans to ED as part of the ED Purchase Program. The loss in 2008 primarily relates to the sale of approximately $1.0 billion of FFELP Loans to the ED under ECASLA, which resulted in a $53 million loss. Operating Expenses FFELP Loans Segment Operating expenses for our FFELP Loans segment primarily include the contractual rates we are paid to service loans in term asset backed securitization trusts or a similar rate if a loan is not in a term financing facility, the fees we pay for third party loan servicing and costs incurred to acquire loans. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, operating expenses for our FFELP Loans segment totaled $736 million, $754 million and $745 million, respectively. The intercompany revenue charged from the Business Services segment and included in those amounts was $648 million, $659 million and $632 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. These amounts exceed the actual cost of servicing the loans. 2010 versus 2009 Operating expenses decreased $18 million from the prior year, primarily due to the effect of our cost cutting initiative in connection with the passage of HCERA. This was partially offset by a one time fee paid to acquire the SLC portfolio, an increase in legal contingency expenses and costs related to closing and selling two loan originations centers in 2010. Operating expenses, excluding restructuring related asset impairments, were 51 basis points and 50 basis points of average Core Earnings basis FFELP Loans in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 2009 versus 2008 Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009, increased $9 million from the prior year primarily due to an increase in our servicing expense as a result of an $8 billion increase in the average balance of our FFELP Loan portfolio. 46 Consumer Lending Segment The following table includes Core Earnings results for our Consumer Lending segment. Years Ended December 31, % Increase (Decrease) (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Core Earnings interest income: Private Education Loans $ 2,353 $ 2,254 $ 2,752 4 % (18 )% Cash and investments 14 13 79 8 (84 ) Total Core Earnings interest income 2,367 2,267 2,831 4 (20 ) Total Core Earnings interest expense 758 721 1,280 5 (44 ) Net Core Earnings interest income 1,609 1,546 1,551 4 Less: provisions for loan losses 1,298 1,399 874 (7 ) 60 Net Core Earnings interest income after provisions for loan losses 311 147 677 112 (78 ) Servicing revenue 72 70 65 3 8 Other income 1 (100 ) Direct operating expenses: Sales and origination 125 81 67 54 21 Servicing 60 47 36 28 31 Collections 94 90 67 4 34 Information technology 68 52 23 31 126 Other 3 (5 ) 8 160 (163 ) Total direct operating expenses 350 265 201 32 32 Restructuring expenses 12 2 25 500 (92 ) Total expenses 362 267 226 36 18 Income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit) 21 (50 ) 517 142 (110 ) Income tax expense (benefit) 8 (18 ) 186 144 (110 ) Core Earnings (loss) $ 13 $ (32 ) $ 331 (141 )% (110 )% 47 Consumer Lending Core Earnings Net Interest Margin The following table shows the Consumer Lending Core Earnings net interest margin along with a reconciliation to the GAAP basis Consumer Lending net interest margin before provisions for loan losses.

The decrease in the net interest margin from 2008 to 2009 was primarily a result of a higher costs of funds due to the extreme turmoil in the capital markets. Private Education Loans Provisions for Loan Losses and Loan Charge Offs The following tables summarize the total Private Education Loans provisions for loan losses and charge offs on both a GAAP basis and a Core Earnings basis for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Private Education Loans provision for loan losses: Total GAAP basis $ 1,298 $ 967 $ 586 Total Core Earnings basis 1,298 1,399 874 Private Education Loans charge offs: Total GAAP basis $ 1,291 $ 876 $ 320 Total Core Earnings basis 1,291 1,299 473 The 2010 Core Earnings basis provision expense and charge offs are down from 2009 as the portfolios credit performance continued to improve since the weakening in the U.S. economy that began in 2008. The Private Education Loan portfolio experienced a significant increase in delinquencies through the first quarter of 2009 (delinquencies as a percentage of loans in repayment were 13.4 percent at March 31, 2009); however, delinquencies as a percentage of loans in repayment have now declined to 10.6 percent at December 31, 2010. Core Earnings basis Private Education Loan delinquencies as a percentage of loans in repayment decreased from 12.1 percent to 10.6 percent from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010. Core Earnings Private Education Loans in forbearance as a percentage of loans in repayment and forbearance decreased from 5.5 percent at December 31, 2009 to 4.6 percent at December 31, 2010. The Core Earnings basis Private 48 Education Loan allowance coverage of annual charge offs ratio was 1.6 at December 31, 2010 compared with 1.5 at December 31, 2009. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of ending Private Education Loans in repayment decreased from 8.1 percent at December 31, 2009 to 7.3 percent at December 31, 2010. We analyzed changes in the key ratios disclosed in the tables above when determining the appropriate Private Education Loan allowance for loan losses. Servicing Revenue and Other Income Consumer Lending Segment Servicing revenue for our Consumer Lending segment primarily includes late fees and forbearance fees. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, servicing revenue for our Consumer Lending segment totaled $72 million, $70 million and $65 million, respectively. Operating Expenses Consumer Lending Segment Operating expenses for our Consumer Lending segment include costs incurred to originate Private Education Loans and to service and collect on our Core Earnings basis Private Education Loan portfolio. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, operating expenses for our Consumer Lending segment totaled $350 million, $265 million and $201 million, respectively. 2010 versus 2009 Operating expenses increased $85 million from 2009, primarily as the result of a non recurring $11 million benefit in 2009 related to reversing a contingency reserve, an increase in collection and servicing costs from a higher number of loans in repayment and delinquency status and higher marketing and technology enhancement costs related to Private Education Loans in 2010. Operating expenses, excluding restructuring related asset impairments, were 96 basis points and 74 basis points, respectively, of average Core Earnings basis Private Education Loans in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. 2009 versus 2008 Operating expenses increased $64 million from 2008, primarily as a result of an increase in collection and servicing costs from a higher number of loans in repayment and delinquency status and higher marketing and technology enhancement costs related to Private Education Loans in 2009. Operating expenses, excluding restructuring related asset impairments, were 74 basis points and 61 basis points, respectively, of average Core Earnings basis Private Education Loans in the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. 49 Business Services Segment The following tables include Core Earnings results for our Business Services segment.

The average balance of this portfolio was $127 billion, $135 billion and $125 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease from 2009 to 2010 is primarily the result of the amortization of the underlying portfolio as well as the $20.4 billion of FFELP Loans sold to ED in October 2010. We are servicing approximately 3.3 million accounts under the ED Servicing Contract as of December 31, 2010. The increase in third party loan servicing revenue in 2010 is the result of the increase in the loans we are servicing under the ED Servicing Contract. Loan servicing fees in 2010 and 2009 included $44 million and $9 million, respectively, of servicing revenue related to the loans we are servicing under the ED Servicing Contract. Account asset servicing revenue represents fees earned on program management, transfer and servicing agent services and administration services for our various 529 college savings plans. Campus Payment Solutions revenue is earned from our Campus Payment Solutions business whose services include comprehensive financing and transaction processing solutions that we provide to college financial aid offices and students to streamline the financial aid process. 50 The decrease in Guarantor servicing revenue compared with the year ago period was primarily due to HCERA being effective as of July 1, 2010, our no longer earning Guarantor issuance fees and the lower balance of outstanding FFELP Loans on which we earn other fees. In 2010, contingency revenue increased $36 million from 2009 due to an increase in collections on defaulted FFELP Loans. Contingency revenue decreased in 2009 from 2008 as the result of significantly less Guarantor collections revenue associated with rehabilitating delinquent FFELP Loans. Loans are considered rehabilitated after a certain number of on time payments have been collected. We earn a rehabilitation fee only when the Guarantor sells the rehabilitated loan. The disruption in the credit markets limited the sale of rehabilitated loans. The following table presents the outstanding inventory of contingent collections receivables that our Business Services segment will collect on behalf of others. As of December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Contingency: Student loans $ 10,362 $ 8,762 $ 9,852 Other 1,730 1,262 1,726 Total $ 12,092 $ 10,024 $ 11,578 Transaction fees are earned in conjunction with our rewards program from participating companies based on member purchase activity, either online or in stores, depending on the contractual arrangement with the participating company. Typically, a percentage of the purchase price of the consumer members eligible purchases with participating companies is set aside in an account maintained by us on behalf of our members. Revenues related to services performed on FFELP Loans accounted for 78 percent, 79 percent and 79 percent, respectively, of total segment revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Operating Expenses Business Services Segment For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, operating expenses for the Business Services segment totaled $500 million, $440 million and $462 million, respectively. 2010 versus 2009 Operating expenses increased $60 million from 2009 to 2010 primarily due to higher technology and other expenses related to preparation for higher volumes for the ED Servicing Contract as well as an increase in legal contingency expenses. 2009 versus 2008 Operating expenses decreased $22 million in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to our cost reduction initiatives. Other Segment The Other segment primarily consists of the financial results related to the repurchase of debt, the corporate liquidity portfolio and all overhead. We also include results from smaller wind down and discontinued operations within this segment. These are the Purchased Paper businesses and mortgage and other loan businesses. The Other segment includes our remaining businesses that do not pertain directly to the primary segments identified above. Overhead expenses include costs related to executive management, the board of directors, accounting, finance, legal, human resources, stock option expense and certain information technology costs related to infrastructure and operations. 51 The following table includes Core Earnings results for our Other segment.

The businesses are presented in discontinued operations for the current and prior periods. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we sold our Purchased Paper Mortgage/Properties business for $280 million, which resulted in an after tax loss of $95 million. In the fourth quarter of 2010 we began actively marketing our Purchased Paper Non Mortgage business for sale. We have concluded it is probable this business will be sold within one year and, as a result, the results of operations of this business were presented in discontinued operations beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010. In connection with this classification, we are required to carry this business at the lower of fair value or historical cost basis. This resulted in us recording an after tax loss of $52 million from discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2010, primarily due to adjusting the value of this business to its estimated fair value. The following table summarizes the carrying value of the Purchased Paper Non Mortgage portfolio: December 31, December 31, December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Carrying value of purchased paper $ 95 $ 285 $ 544 52 Gains on Debt Repurchases We began repurchasing our outstanding debt in the second quarter of 2008. We repurchased $4.9 billion, $3.4 billion and $1.9 billion face amount of our senior unsecured notes for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Since the second quarter of 2008, we repurchased $10.2 billion face amount of our senior unsecured notes in the aggregate, with maturity dates ranging from 2008 to 2016. Mortgage and Other Loans Also included in this segment are our mortgage and other loan portfolios, which totaled $271 million at December 31, 2010. We are no longer originating mortgage and other loans. Overhead Corporate overhead is comprised of costs related to executive management, the board of directors, accounting, finance, legal, human resources and stock option expense. Information technology costs are related to infrastructure and operations. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, operating expenses for the Other segment totaled $270 million, $243 million and $253 million, respectively. 2010 versus 2009 Operating expenses increased $27 million from 2009 to 2010. This increase in corporate overhead was primarily attributable to increased technology costs associated with disaster recovery modernization, enterprise architecture and information security upgrades. 53 Financial Condition This section provides additional information regarding the changes related to our loan portfolio assets and related liabilities as well as credit performance indicators related to our loan portfolio. Many of these disclosures will show both GAAP basis as well as Core Earnings basis disclosures. Because certain trusts were not consolidated prior to the adoption of the new consolidation accounting guidance on January 1, 2010, these trusts were treated as off balance sheet for GAAP purposes but we considered them on balance sheet for Core Earnings purposes. Subsequent to the adoption of the new consolidation accounting guidance on January 1, 2010, this difference no longer exists because all of our trusts are treated as on balance sheet for GAAP purposes. Below and elsewhere in the document, Core Earnings basis disclosures include all historically (pre January 1, 2010) off balance sheet trusts as though they were on balance sheet. We believe that providing Core Earnings basis disclosures is meaningful because when we evaluate the performance and risk characteristics of the Company we have always considered the effect of any off balance sheet trusts as though they were on balance sheet. Average Balance Sheets GAAP The following table reflects the rates earned on interest earning assets and paid on interest bearing liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

We believe this decline was a result of a variety of factors, including an overall increase in the use of federal financial aid and consumer deleveraging. 61 The following table summarizes our Private Education Loan originations. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Total Private Education Loan Originations $ 2,307 $ 3,176 $ 6,336 FFELP Loan Portfolio Performance FFELP Delinquencies and Forbearance The tables below present our FFELP Loan delinquency trends as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Delinquencies have the potential to adversely impact earnings as they are an indication of the borrowers potential to possibly default and as a result require a higher loan loss reserve than loans in current status. Delinquent loans also require increased servicing and collection efforts, resulting in higher operating costs.

Use of Forbearance as a Private Education Loan Collection Tool Forbearance involves granting the borrower a temporary cessation of payments (or temporary acceptance of smaller than scheduled payments) for a specified period of time. Using forbearance extends the original term of the loan. Forbearance does not grant any reduction in the total repayment obligation (principal or interest). While in forbearance status, interest continues to accrue and is capitalized to principal when the loan re enters repayment status. Our forbearance policies include limits on the number of forbearance months granted consecutively and the total number of forbearance months granted over the life of the loan. In some instances, we require good faith payments before granting forbearance. Exceptions to forbearance policies are permitted when such exceptions are judged to increase the likelihood of collection of the loan. Forbearance as a collection tool is used most effectively when applied based on a borrowers unique situation, including historical information and judgments. We leverage updated borrower information and other decision support tools to best determine who will be granted forbearance based on our expectations as to a borrowers ability and willingness to repay their obligation. This strategy is aimed at mitigating the overall risk of the portfolio as well as encouraging cash resolution of delinquent loans. Forbearance may be granted to borrowers who are exiting their grace period to provide additional time to obtain employment and income to support their obligations, or to current borrowers who are faced with a hardship and request forbearance time to provide temporary payment relief. In these circumstances, a borrowers loan is placed into a forbearance status in limited monthly increments and is reflected in the forbearance status at month end during this time. At the end of their granted forbearance period, the borrower 70 will enter repayment status as current and is expected to begin making their scheduled monthly payments on a go forward basis. Forbearance may also be granted to borrowers who are delinquent in their payments. In these circumstances, the forbearance cures the delinquency and the borrower is returned to a current repayment status. In more limited instances, delinquent borrowers will also be granted additional forbearance time. As we have obtained further experience about the effectiveness of forbearance, we have reduced the amount of time a loan will spend in forbearance, thereby increasing our ongoing contact with the borrower to encourage consistent repayment behavior once the loan is returned to a current repayment status. As a result, the balance of loans in a forbearance status as of month end has decreased since 2008. In addition, the monthly average number of loans granted forbearance as a percentage of loans in repayment and forbearance declined to 5.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with the year ago quarter of 5.6 percent. As of December 31, 2010, 2.4 percent of loans in current status were delinquent as of the end of the prior month, but were granted a forbearance that made them current as of December 31, 2010 (borrowers made payments on approximately 20 percent of these loans prior to being granted forbearance). The table below reflects the historical effectiveness of using forbearance. Our experience has shown that three years after being granted forbearance for the first time, 68 percent of the loans are current, paid in full, or receiving an in school grace or deferment, and 17 percent have defaulted. The default experience associated with loans which utilize forbearance is considered in our allowance for loan losses. Tracking by First Time in Forbearance Compared to All Loans Entering Repayment Status distribution Status distribution 36 months after Status distribution 36 months after being granted 36 months after entering repayment for forbearance entering repayment loans never entering for the first time (all loans) forbearance In school/grace/deferment 9.2 % 8.5 % 4.1 % Current 50.2 57.4 64.1 Delinquent 31 60 days 3.1 2.0 0.4 Delinquent 61 90 days 1.9 1.1 0.2 Delinquent greater than 90 days 4.8 2.7 0.3 Forbearance 4.7 3.5 Defaulted 17.4 9.1 4.8 Paid 8.7 15.7 26.1 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 71 The tables below show the composition and status of the Core Earnings basis Private Education Loan portfolio aged by number of months in active repayment status (months for which a scheduled monthly payment was due). As indicated in the tables, the percentage of loans in forbearance status decreases the longer the loans have been in active repayment status. At December 31, 2010, loans in forbearance status as a percentage of loans in repayment and forbearance were 6.2 percent for loans that have been in active repayment status for less than 25 months.

If actual periodic recoveries are less than expected, the difference is charged off and immediately included in provision expense. 73 The following tables summarize the activity in the receivable for partially charged off loans for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Private Education Loan Repayment Options Certain loan programs allow borrowers to select from a variety of repayment options depending on their loan type and their enrollment/loan status, which include the ability to extend their repayment term or change their monthly payment. The chart below provides the optional repayment offerings in addition to the standard level principal and interest payments as of December 31, 2010. Loan Program Signature and Career (Dollars in millions) Other Smart Option Training Total $ in Repayment $23,179 $2,532 $2,141 $ 27,852 $ in Total 32,779 2,536 2,217 37,532 Payment method by enrollment status: In school/Grace Deferred(1) Interest only or fixed $25/month Interest only or fixed $25/month Repayment Level principal and interest or graduated Level principal and interest Level principal and interest (1) Deferred includes loans for which no payments are required and interest charges are capitalized into the loan balance. The graduated repayment program that is part of Signature and Other Loans includes an interest only payment option. This program is available to borrowers in repayment, after their grace period, who would like a temporary lower payment from the required principal and interest payment amount. Borrowers participating in this program pay monthly interest with no amortization of their principal balance for up to 48 payments after entering repayment (dependent on the loan product type). The maturity date of the loan is not extended when a borrower participates in this program. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, borrowers in repayment owing approximately $7.5 billion (27 percent of loans in repayment) and $7.0 billion (29 percent of loans in repayment), respectively, were enrolled in the interest only program. 74 Liquidity and Capital Resources Funding and Liquidity Risk Management The following Liquidity and Capital Resources discussion concentrates on our FFELP Loans and Consumer Lending segments. Our Business Services and Other segments need little capital. We define liquidity risk as the potential inability to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations, on or off balance sheet, as they come due, as well as the potential inability to originate Private Education Loans. Our primary liquidity objective is to ensure our ongoing ability to meet our funding needs for our businesses throughout market cycles, including during periods of financial stress. Our two primary liquidity needs are funding the originations of Private Education Loans and retiring unsecured debt when it matures. To achieve that objective we analyze and monitor our liquidity needs, maintain excess liquidity and access diverse funding sources including the issuance of unsecured debt, the issuance of secured debt primarily through asset backed securitizations and or financing facilities and through deposits at Sallie Mae Bank (the Bank), our Utah industrial bank subsidiary. We define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high quality liquid unencumbered securities, that we can use to meet our funding requirements as those obligations arise. Our primary liquidity risk relates to our ability to fund new originations and raise replacement funding at a reasonable cost as our unsecured debt matures. In addition, we must continue to obtain funding at reasonable rates to meet our other business obligations and to continue to grow our business. Key risks associated with our liquidity relates to our ability to access the capital markets and access them at reasonable rates. This ability may be affected by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions, including over the counter derivatives. Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions subject to ongoing review by the ratings agencies and may change from time to time based on our financial performance, industry dynamics and other factors. Other factors that influence our credit ratings include the ratings agencies assessment of the general operating environment, our relative positions in the markets in which we compete, reputation, liquidity position, the level and volatility of earnings, corporate governance and risk management policies, capital position and capital management practices. A negative change in our credit rating could have a negative effect on our liquidity because it would raise the cost and availability of funding and potentially require additional cash collateral or restrict cash currently held as collateral on existing borrowings or derivative collateral arrangements. It is our objective to improve our credit ratings so that we can continue to access the capital markets even in difficult economic and market conditions. We expect to fund our ongoing liquidity needs, including the origination of new Private Education Loans and the repayment of $4.4 billion of senior unsecured notes to mature in the next twelve months, primarily through our current cash and investment position and very predictable operating cash flows provided by earnings and repayment of principal on unencumbered student loan assets, distributions from our securitization trusts (including servicing fees which are priority payments within the trusts), as well as drawdowns under the 2010 ABCP Facility, the issuance of term ABS, the collection of additional term bank deposits and the issuance of unsecured debt. We primarily fund our student loan originations at the Bank. Currently, new Private Education Loan originations are initially funded through deposits. We plan to subsequently securitize these loans to term on a programmatic basis. We currently have $2 billion of cash at the Bank available to fund future originations. We no longer originate FFELP Loans and therefore no longer have liquidity requirements for new FFELP Loan originations. In 2009, we began using the ED Conduit Program (see ED Funding Programs of this Item 7 for a discussion of this program) to fund older FFELP Stafford and PLUS Loans. In addition, in 2008 we began funding new FFELP Stafford and PLUS Loan originations for AY 2008 2009 pursuant to EDs Loan Purchase Commitment Program (the Purchase Program) and Loan Participation Purchase Program (the Participation Program).We discuss these liquidity sources below. 75 We continued to use EDs Purchase and Participation Programs to fund FFELP Stafford and PLUS Loans disbursed through September 30, 2010 (see Item 1 Business Recent Legislation for a further discussion regarding the end of new FFELP Loan originations as of July 1, 2010). Primary Sources of Liquidity and Available Capacity The following table details our main sources of primary liquidity and the available capacity at December 31, 2010 and 2009. December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 (Dollars in millions) Available Capacity Available Capacity Sources of primary liquidity for general corporate purposes: Unrestricted cash and liquid investments: Cash and cash equivalents $ 4,342 $ 6,070 Commercial paper and asset backed commercial paper 1,150 Other 85 131 Total unrestricted cash and liquid investments(1)(2)(3) 4,427 7,351 Unused commercial paper and bank lines of credit(4) 3,485 Available borrowings to the extent collateral exists: FFELP ABCP facilities(5) 3,937 1,703 FHLB DM facility(5) 8,664 Total sources of primary liquidity for general corporate purposes(6) $ 17,028 $ 12,539 (1) At December 31, 2010 and 2009, excludes $0 and $25 million, respectively, of investments pledged as collateral related to certain derivative positions and $872 million and $708 million, respectively, of other non liquid investments, classified as investments on our balance sheet in accordance with GAAP. (2) At December 31, 2010 and 2009, includes $684 million and $821 million, respectively, of cash collateral pledged by derivative counterparties and held in our unrestricted cash. (3) At December 31, 2010 and 2009, includes $2.0 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, of cash and liquid investments at the Bank. This cash will be used primarily to originate or acquire student loans. (4) On November 24, 2010, our remaining bank line of credit was retired. (5) Borrowing capacity is subject to availability of collateral. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had $1.5 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, of outstanding unencumbered FFELP Loans, net, available for use in either the FFELP ABCP facilities or FHLB DM facility. (6) General corporate purposes primarily include originating Private Education Loans and repaying unsecured debt as it matures. In addition to the assets listed in the table above, we hold a number of other unencumbered assets, consisting primarily of Private Education Loans and other assets. At December 31, 2010, we had a total of $22.3 billion of unencumbered assets, excluding goodwill and acquired intangibles. Total student loans, net, comprised $12.6 billion of this unencumbered asset total, of which $11.1 billion are Private Education Loans, net, and $1.5 billion are FFELP Loans, net. 76 The following table reconciles encumbered and unencumbered assets and their net impact on total tangible equity. December 31, December 31, (Dollars in billions) 2010 2009 Net assets of consolidated variable interest entities $ 13.1 $ 12.7 Tangible unencumbered assets(2) 22.3 30.1 Unsecured debt (26.9 ) (35.1 ) Mark to market on unsecured hedged debt(1) (1.4 ) (1.9 ) Other liabilities, net (2.6 ) (1.7 ) Total tangible equity $ 4.5 $ 4.1 (1) At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, there were $1.4 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, of net gains on derivatives hedging this debt in unencumbered assets, which partially offset these losses. (2) Excludes goodwill and acquired intangible assets. ED Funding Programs Pursuant to ECASLA, in 2009, ED published summary terms under which it will purchase eligible FFELP Stafford and PLUS Loans from a conduit vehicle established to provide funding for eligible student lenders (the ED Conduit Program). Loans eligible for the ED Conduit Program must be first disbursed on or after October 1, 2003, but not later than July 1, 2009, and fully disbursed before September 30, 2009, and meet certain other requirements, including those relating to borrower benefits. The ED Conduit Program was launched in May 2009 and accepted eligible loans through July 1, 2010. The ED Conduit Program expires on January 19, 2014. Funding for the ED Conduit Program is provided by the capital markets at a cost based on market rates, with advance rates of 97 percent of the student loan face amount. If the conduit does not have sufficient funds to make the required payments on the notes issued by the conduit, then the notes will be repaid with funds from the Federal Financing Bank (FFB). The FFB will hold the notes for a short period of time and, if at the end of that time, the notes still cannot be paid off, the underlying FFELP Loans that serve as collateral to the ED Conduit will be sold to ED through a put agreement at a price of 97 percent of the face amount of the loans. As of December 31, 2010, approximately $24.2 billion face amount of our Stafford and PLUS Loans were funded through the ED Conduit Program. Our intent is to term securitize the loans that are in this facility before the facility expires on January 19, 2014. We are exposed to the risk associated with this program ending in 2014. The amount of loans exposed to this refinance risk will decline over time as the loans pay down. If we are not able to successfully refinance the loans before the facility expires, we will sell them to ED at a price of 97 percent of face value. In 2008, ED implemented the Participation Program pursuant to ECASLA. In October 2010, we sold $20.4 billion of loans to ED and paid off $20.3 billion of advances outstanding under the Participation Program. This program is no longer in effect and is not available as a funding source. Sallie Mae Bank In 2008, the Bank began expanding its deposit base to fund new Private Education Loan originations. The Bank raises deposits through intermediaries in the retail brokered Certificate of Deposit (CD) market and through direct retail deposit channels. As of December 31, 2010, total bank deposits were $5.9 billion, of which $4.5 billion were brokered deposits and $1.4 billion were retail and other deposits. Cash and liquid investments totaled $2.0 billion. In addition to its deposit base, the Bank has borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) through a collateralized lending facility. Borrowing capacity is limited by the availability of acceptable collateral. As of December 31, 2010, borrowing capacity was approximately $650 million and there were no outstanding borrowings. 77 ABS Transactions In early 2009, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York initiated a program, The Term Asset Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF), to facilitate renewed issuance of eligible consumer and small business ABS with a term of up to five years. For student loan collateral, TALF expired on March 31, 2010. During the program, we completed five transactions totaling $7.5 billion which were TALF eligible. Under this program we have $5.3 billion of ABS outstanding where we have the option to call the bonds at a discount between 2011 and 2014. In 2010, we completed three Private Education Loan ABS transactions totaling $4.1 billion. In 2010, we completed two FFELP long term ABS transactions totaling $2.0 billion. Although we have demonstrated our continued access to the ABS market and we expect ABS financing to remain a primary source of funding over the long term, we also expect our transaction volumes to be more limited and pricing less favorable than prior to the credit market dislocation that began in the summer of 2007, with significantly reduced opportunities to place subordinated tranches of ABS with investors. Asset Backed Financing (ABCP) Facilities In early 2008, we entered into two new asset backed financing facilities (the 2008 Asset Backed Financing Facilities) to fund FFELP Loans. In 2009, the FFELP facilities were subsequently amended and reduced and in early 2010 we terminated these facilities and entered into new multi year ABCP facilities (the 2010 Facility) which will continue to provide funding for our federally guaranteed student loans. The 2010 Facility provides for maximum funding of $10 billion for the first year, $5 billion for the second year and $2 billion for the third year. The underlying cost of borrowing under the 2010 Facility for the first year is expected to be commercial paper issuance cost plus 0.50 percent, excluding up front commitment and unused fees. Borrowings under the 2010 Facility are non recourse and the maximum amount we may borrow under the 2010 Facility is limited based on certain factors, including market conditions and the fair value of student loans in the facility. The 2010 Facility is subject to termination under certain circumstances. The principal financial covenants in this facility require us to maintain consolidated tangible net worth of at least $1.38 billion at all times. Consolidated tangible net worth as calculated for purposes of this covenant was $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2010. The covenants also require us to meet either a minimum interest coverage ratio or a minimum net adjusted revenue test based on the four preceding quarters adjusted Core Earnings financial performance. We were compliant with both of the minimum interest coverage ratio and the minimum net adjusted revenue tests as of the quarter ended December 31, 2010. Increases in the borrowing rate of up to LIBOR plus 4.50 percent could occur if certain asset coverage ratio thresholds are not met. Failure to pay off the 2010 Facility on the maturity date or to reduce amounts outstanding below the annual maximum step downs will result in a 90 day extension of the 2010 Facility with the interest rate increasing from LIBOR plus 2.00 percent to LIBOR plus 3.00 percent over that period. If, at the end of the 90 day extension, these required paydown amounts have not been made, the collateral can be foreclosed. As of December 31, 2010, there was approximately $5.9 billion outstanding in this facility. The book basis of the assets securing this facility at December 31, 2010 was $6.4 billion. On January 14, 2011, we amended the 2010 Asset Backed Financing Facility, which will continue to provide funding for our federally guaranteed student loans, expanding the size and extending the maturity. The facility amount is now $7.5 billion, reflecting an increase of $2.5 billion over the previously scheduled facility reduction. The facility size will decrease by $2.5 billion annually with a scheduled maturity date of January 10, 2014. Federal Home Loan Bank in Des Moines (FHLB DM) In early 2010, HICA Education Loan Corporation (HICA), a subsidiary of the Company, entered into a lending agreement with the FHLB DM. Under the agreement, the FHLB DM will provide advances backed by Federal Housing Finance Agency approved collateral which includes federally guaranteed student loans (but does not include Private Education Loans). The amount, price and tenor of future advances will vary and be subject to the agreements borrowing conditions as then in effect determined at the time of each borrowing. The maximum amount that can be borrowed, as of December 31, 2010, subject to available collateral, is approximately $9.6 billion. As of December 31, 2010, borrowing under the facility totaled $900 million and was secured by $1.2 billion of 78 FFELP Loans. We have provided a guarantee to the FHLB DM for the performance and payment of HICAs obligations. Senior Unsecured Debt We issue unsecured debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve cost efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile. While the cost and availability of unsecured funding may be negatively affected by general market conditions or by matters specific to the financial services industry or Sallie Mae, we seek to mitigate refinancing risk by actively managing the amount of our borrowings that we anticipate will mature within any month, quarter or year. Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions (other than a change in control would allow $4 billion of these obligations as of December 31, 2010, to be put at 101 percent) that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity, or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price. We issue unsecured debt when the pricing for the term of the debt is favorable relative to our other funding options and our overall liquidity position. In 2010 we issued $1.5 billion of unsecured debt maturing in 2020 and an all in cost of LIBOR plus 4.65 percent. On January 11, 2011, we announced and priced a $2 billion five year 6.25 percent fixed rate unsecured bond. The bond was issued to yield 6.50 percent before underwriting fees. The rate on the bond was swapped from a fixed rate to a floating rate equal to an all in cost of one month LIBOR plus 4.46 percent. The proceeds of this bond will be used for general corporate purposes. We also repurchase our outstanding unsecured debt in both open market repurchases and public tender offers. Repurchasing debt helps us better manage our short term and long term funding needs. In 2010 we repurchased $4.9 billion face amount of our senior unsecured notes in the aggregate, with maturity dates ranging from 2010 to 2014, which resulted in a total gain of $317 million. Counterparty Exposure Counterparty exposure related to financial instruments arises from the risk that a lending, investment or derivative counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations to us. Risks associated with our lending portfolio are discussed in Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition FFELP Loan Portfolio Performance and Consumer Lending Portfolio Performance. Our investment portfolio is composed of very short term securities issued by highly rated issuers limiting our counterparty exposure. Additionally, our investing activity is governed by Board approved limits on the amount that is allowed to be invested with any one issuer based on the credit rating of the issuer, further minimizing our counterparty exposure. Counterparty credit risk is considered when valuing investments and considering impairment. Related to derivative transactions, protection against counterparty risk is generally provided by International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) Credit Support Annexes (CSAs). CSAs require a counterparty to post collateral if a potential default would expose the other party to a loss. All derivative contracts entered into by SLM Corporation and the Bank are covered under such agreements and require collateral to be exchanged based on the net fair value of derivatives with each counterparty. Our securitization trusts require collateral in all cases if the counterpartys credit rating is withdrawn or downgraded below a certain level. Additionally, securitizations involving foreign currency notes issued after November 2005 also require the counterparty to post collateral to the trust based on the fair value of the derivative, regardless of credit rating. The trusts are not required to post collateral to the counterparties. In all cases, our exposure is limited to the value of the derivative contracts in a gain position net of any collateral we are holding. We consider counterparties credit risk when determining the fair value of derivative positions on our exposure net of collateral. 79 We have liquidity exposure related to collateral movements between us and our derivative counterparties. Movements in the value of the derivatives, which are primarily affected by changes in interest rate and foreign exchange rates, may require us to return cash collateral held or may require us to access primary liquidity to post collateral to counterparties. If our credit ratings are downgraded from current levels, we may be required to segregate unrestricted cash collateral into restricted accounts. The table below highlights exposure related to our derivative counterparties at December 31, 2010.

Timing of obligations is estimated based on our current projection of prepayment speeds of the securitized assets. (2) The aggregate principal amount of debt that matures in each period is $16.3 billion, $32.4 billion, $24.6 billion and $88.7 billion, respectively. Specifically excludes derivative market value adjustments of $2.6 billion for long term notes. Interest obligations on notes are predominantly variable in nature, resetting quarterly based on 3 month LIBOR. Unrecognized tax benefits were $39 million and $101 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. For additional information, see Note 18 Income Taxes. 81 Off Balance Sheet Lending Arrangements We have issued lending related financial instruments, including lines of credit, to meet the financing needs of our institutional customers. In connection with these agreements, we also enter into a participation agreement with the institution to participate in the loans as they are originated. In the event that a line of credit is drawn upon, the loan is collateralized by underlying student loans and is usually participated on the same day. The contractual amount of these financial instruments, $50 million at December 31, 2010, represents the maximum possible credit risk should the counterparty draw down the commitment, we do not participate in the loan, and the counterparty subsequently fails to perform according to the terms of our contract. The remaining total contractual amount available to be borrowed under these commitments is $50 million. All commitments mature in 2011. We do not believe that these instruments are representative of our actual future credit exposure; to the extent that the lines of credit are drawn upon, the balance outstanding is collateralized by student loans. At December 31, 2010, there were no outstanding draws on lines of credit. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations addresses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP). Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates its estimates, particularly those that include the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and are often about matters that are inherently uncertain. The most significant judgments, estimates and assumptions relate to the following critical accounting policies that are discussed in more detail below. Allowance for Loan Losses When calculating the allowance for loan loss for Private Education Loans we estimate the amount of our customers who will default over the next two years and how much we will recover over time related to the defaulted amount. Our historical experience indicates that, on average, the time between the date that a borrower experiences a default causing event (e.g., the loss trigger event) and the date that we charge off the unrecoverable portion of that loan is two years. In estimating the amount of defaults we expect to have over the next two years we divide the portfolio into categories of similar risk characteristics based on loan program type, school type, loan status (in school, grace, forbearance, repayment and delinquency), seasoning (number of months in active repayment for which a scheduled payment was due), underwriting criteria (credit scores), and existence or absence of a cosigner. The primary characteristics we use are school type, credit scores, cosigner status, loan status and seasoning. We start with historical experience of customer default behavior. We make judgments about which historical period to start with and then make further judgments about whether that historical experience is representative of future expectations and whether additional adjustment may be needed to those historical default rates. We also take into account the current and future economic environment when calculating the allowance for loan loss. We analyze key economic statistics and the effect they will have on future defaults. Key economic statistics analyzed as part of the allowance for loan loss are unemployment rates (total and specific to college graduates) and other asset type delinquency rates (credit cards, mortgages). Significantly more judgment has been required over the last three years, compared with years prior, in light of the U.S. economy and its effect on our customers ability to pay their obligations. In addition to making judgments about the amount of defaults that will occur over the next two years we also make judgments about how much we will subsequently recover from a defaulted customer and when that recovery will occur. Similar to estimating defaults, we begin with historical recovery performance when projecting future recoveries and use judgment in determining whether historical performance is representative of what we expect to recover in the future. 82 FFELP Loans are guaranteed as to their principal and accrued interest in the event of default subject to a Risk Sharing level based on the date of loan disbursement. For loans disbursed after October 1, 1993, and before July 1, 2006, we receive 98 percent reimbursement on all qualifying default claims. For loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2006, we receive 97 percent reimbursement. For loans disbursed prior to October 1, 1993, we receive 100 percent reimbursement. Similar to the allowance for Private Education Loan losses, the allowance for FFELP Loan losses uses historical experience of borrower default behavior and a two year loss confirmation period to estimate the credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio at the reporting date. We apply the default rate projections, net of applicable Risk Sharing, to each category for the current period to perform our quantitative calculation. Once the quantitative calculation is performed, we review the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and determine if qualitative adjustments need to be considered. Premium and Discount Amortization The most judgmental estimate for premium and discount amortization on student loans is the Constant Prepayment Rate (CPR), which measures the rate at which loans in the portfolio pay down principal compared to their stated terms. Loan consolidation, default, term extension and other prepayment factors affecting our CPR estimates are affected by changes in our business strategy, changes in our competitors business strategies, FFELP legislative changes, interest rates and changes to the current economic and credit environment. When we determine the CPR we begin with historical prepayment rates due to consolidation activity, defaults, payoffs and term extensions from the utilization of forbearance. We make judgments about which historical period to start with and then make further judgments about whether that historical experience is representative of future expectations and whether additional adjustment may be needed to those historical prepayment rates. In the past the consolidation of FFELP Loans and Private Education Loans significantly affected our CPRs and updating those assumptions often resulted in material adjustments to our amortization expense. As a result of the CCRAA and the current U.S. economic and credit environment, we, as well as many other industry competitors, have suspended our FFELP Loans consolidation program and Private Education Loans consolidation program. We do not expect to consolidate FFELP Loans in the future and do not currently expect others to actively consolidate our FFELP Loans. As a result, we expect CPRs related to our FFELP Loans to remain relatively stable over time. We expect that in the future both we and our competitors will begin to consolidate Private Education Loans. This is built into the CPR assumption we use for Private Education Loans. However, it is difficult to accurately project the timing and level at which this consolidation activity will begin and our assumption may need to be updated by a material amount in the future based on changes in the economy and marketplace. The level of defaults is a significant component of our FFELP Loan and Private Education Loan CPR. This component of the FFELP Loan and Private Education Loan CPR is estimated in the same manner as discussed in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Allowance for Loan Loss of this Item 7 the only difference is for premium and discount amortization purposes the estimate of defaults is a life of loan estimate whereas for allowance for loan loss it is a two year estimate. Fair Value Measurement The most significant assumptions used in fair value measurements, including those related to credit and liquidity risk, are as follows: 1. Investments Our investments primarily consist of overnight/weekly maturity instruments with high credit quality counterparties. However, we consider credit and liquidity risk involving specific instruments in determining their fair value and, when appropriate, have adjusted the fair value of these instruments for the effect of credit and liquidity risk. These assumptions have further been validated by the successful maturity of these investments in the period immediately following the end of the reporting period. 2. Derivatives When determining the fair value of derivatives, we take into account counterparty credit risk for positions where we are exposed to the counterparty on a net basis by assessing exposure net of collateral held. The net exposure for each counterparty is adjusted based on market 83 information available for that specific counterparty, including spreads from credit default swaps. Additionally, when the counterparty has exposure to us related to our derivatives, we fully collateralize the exposure, minimizing the adjustment necessary to the derivative valuations for our own credit risk. Trusts that contain derivatives are not required to post collateral to counterparties as the credit quality and securitized nature of the trusts minimizes any adjustments for the counterpartys exposure to the trusts. Adjustments related to credit risk reduced the overall value of our derivatives by $72 million as of December 31, 2010. We also take into account changes in liquidity when determining the fair value of derivative positions. We adjusted the fair value of certain less liquid positions downward by approximately $129 million to take into account a significant reduction in liquidity as of December 31, 2010, related primarily to basis swaps indexed to interest rate indices with inactive markets. A major indicator of market inactivity is the widening of the bid/ask spread in these markets. In general, the widening of counterparty credit spreads and reduced liquidity for derivative instruments as indicated by wider bid/ask spreads will reduce the fair value of derivatives. In addition, certain cross currency interest rate swaps hedging foreign currency denominated reset rate and amortizing notes in our on balance sheet trusts contain extension features that coincide with the remarketing dates of the notes. The valuation of the extension feature requires significant judgment based on internally developed inputs. 3. Student Loans Our FFELP Loans and Private Education Loans are accounted for at cost or at the lower of cost or fair value if the loan is held for sale. The fair values of our student loans are disclosed in Note 15 Fair Value Measurements. For both FFELP Loans and Private Education Loans accounted for at cost, fair value is determined by modeling loan level cash flows using stated terms of the assets and internally developed assumptions to determine aggregate portfolio yield, net present value and average life. The significant assumptions used to project cash flows are prepayment speeds, default rates, cost of funds, and required return on equity. In addition, the Floor Income component of our FFELP Loan portfolio is valued through discounted cash flow and option models using both observable market inputs and internally developed inputs. Significant inputs into the models are not generally market observable. They are either derived internally through a combination of historical experience and managements qualitative expectation of future performance (in the case of prepayment speeds, default rates, and capital assumptions) or are obtained through external broker quotes (as in the case of cost of funds). When possible, market transactions are used to validate the model. In most cases, these are either infrequent or not observable. For FFELP Loans classified as held for sale and accounted for at the lower of cost or market, the fair value is based on the committed sales price of the various loan purchase programs established by ED. For further information regarding the effect of our use of fair values on our results of operations, see Note 15 Fair Value Measurements. Transfers of Financial Assets and the Variable Interest Entity (VIE) Consolidation Model Changes in Accounting Principles effective January 1, 2010 The new consolidation accounting adopted on January 1, 2010 significantly changed the consolidation model for Variable Interest Entities (VIEs). This new rule, among other things, (1) eliminated the exemption for QSPEs, (2) provided a new approach for determining who should consolidate a VIE that is more focused on control rather than economic interest, (3) changed when it is necessary to reassess who should consolidate a VIE and (4) required additional disclosure. Under these new rules, if we have a variable interest in a VIE and we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE then we will consolidate the VIE. We are the considered the primary beneficiary if we have both: (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. There is considerable judgment that has to be used as it relates to determining who is the primary beneficiary of the VIEs with which we are associated. There are no bright line tests. Rather, the assessment of who has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most 84 significantly affects the VIEs economic performance and who has the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE is very qualitative and judgmental in nature. However, based on our current relationship with our securitization trusts and other financing vehicles which are considered VIEs, we believe the assessment is more straightforward. As it relates to our securitized assets, we are the servicer of those securitized assets (which means we have the power to direct the activities of the trust) and we own the Residual Interest (which means we have the loss and gain obligation that could potentially be significant to the VIE) of the securitization trusts. As a result we are the primary beneficiary of our securitization trusts and other financing vehicles. See Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies for further details regarding the adoption of these new rules on January 1, 2010. Derivative Accounting The most significant judgments related to derivative accounting are: (1) concluding the derivative is an effective hedge and qualifies for hedge accounting and (2) determining the fair value of certain derivatives and hedged items. To qualify for hedge accounting a derivative must be concluded to be a highly effective hedge upon designation and on an ongoing basis. There are no bright line tests on what is considered a highly effective hedge. We use a historical regression analysis to prove ongoing and prospective hedge effectiveness. See previous discussion under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Fair Value Measurement of this Item 7 for significant judgments related to the valuation of derivatives. Although some of our valuations are more judgmental than others, we compare the fair values of our derivatives that we calculate to those provided by our counterparties on a monthly basis. We view this as a critical control which helps validate these judgments. Any significant differences with our counterparties are identified and resolved appropriately. Goodwill and Intangible Assets In determining annually (or more frequently if required) whether goodwill is impaired, we determine whether an event has occurred that would indicate to us that there is the potential for the fair value of the business unit to fall below the book basis of the equity of that business unit. If we determine that this event has occurred, we perform an analysis to determine the fair value of the business unit. There are significant judgments involved in determining the fair value of a business unit, including assumptions regarding estimates of future cash flows from existing and new business activities, customer relationships, the value of existing customer contracts, the value of other tangible and intangible assets, as well as assumptions regarding what we believe a third party willing to pay for all of the assets and liabilities of the business unit. This calculation requires us to estimate the appropriate discount and growth rates to apply to those projected cash flows and the appropriate control premium to apply to arrive at the final fair value. The business units for which we must estimate the fair value are not publically traded and often there is not comparable market data available for that individual business to aid in its valuation. We use a third party appraisal firm to provide an opinion on the fair values we conclude upon. Risk Management Processes Our Approach The monitoring, assessment and oversight of risk are shared responsibilities throughout the Company. Each business division is primarily responsible and accountable for managing risks specific to its area. Our executive management team and centralized support functions, including compliance, credit risk, human resources, legal, information technology, finance and accounting, are responsible for providing our business divisions with the training, systems and specialized expertise necessary to properly perform their risk management duties. Executive management, individually and through participation in various committees, are ultimately responsible for the management of risk across our businesses. Our Risk Assessment Department regularly monitors and reports to the Audit Committee of our Board of Director on the effectiveness of various aspects of our risk management activities. Our Code of Business Conduct and the on going training our employees receive in many compliance areas provide a framework for our employees to conduct themselves with the highest integrity. We instill a risk conscious culture through communications, training, policies and procedures. We have strengthened the 85 linkage between the management performance process and individual compensation to encourage employees to work toward corporate wide compliance goals. Our Risk Assessment Department monitors our various risk management and compliance efforts, identifies areas that require increased focus and resources, and reports significant control issues to executive management and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. At least annually, the Risk Assessment Department performs a risk assessment to identify our top risks, to develop the internal audit plan. Risks are rated on significance and likelihood of occurrence and communicated to our management team members who allocate appropriate attention and resources. Results of the assessment, including survey results, identified risks and recommendations, are reported to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors and its various committees oversee our overall strategic direction and provide direction to management as to its tolerance levels of various significant risks. Through its committees, our Board of Directors regularly reviews our risk management practices. Our Significant Risks Significant risks may be grouped into the following categories: (1) funding and liquidity; (2) operations; (3) political/reputation; (4) competition; (5) credit; and (6) regulatory and compliance. More specific descriptions of the particular risks of each type we currently face are discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors. Funding and Liquidity Risk Management Funding and liquidity risk is the potential inability to fund liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, fund asset growth and business operations, and meet contractual obligations at reasonable market rates. Our primary liquidity objective is to ensure our ongoing ability to meet our funding needs for our businesses throughout market cycles, including during periods of financial stress. Our two primary liquidity needs are originating Private Education Loans and retiring secured and unsecured debt when it matures. We define excess liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high quality liquid unencumbered securities, that we can use to meet our funding requirements as those obligations arise. Our primary liquidity risk relates to our ability to raise replacement funding and raise that funding at a reasonable cost as our secured and unsecured debt matures. In addition, we must continue to obtain funding at reasonable rates to meet our other business obligations and to continue to grow our business. Key risks associated with our liquidity relates to our ability to access the capital markets and access them at reasonable rates. This ability is directly affected by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions, including over the counter derivatives. A negative change in our credit rating would have a negative effect on our liquidity because it would raise the cost, diminish the availability of funding and potentially require additional cash collateral or restrict cash currently held as collateral on existing borrowings or derivative collateral arrangements. Our funding and liquidity risk management activities are centralized within our Corporate Finance Department, which is responsible for planning and executing our funding activities and strategies. We analyze and monitor our liquidity risk, maintain excess liquidity and access diverse funding. Funding and liquidity risk are overseen and recommendations approved via one or more management committees that manage market, interest rate and balance sheet risk. The Finance Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for approving our Asset and Liability Management Policy. The Finance Committee of the Board, and in some cases the full Board, monitor our liquidity on an ongoing basis. Our liquidity risk management activities are centralized within the Corporate Finance Department, which is responsible for planning and executing our funding activities and strategies. Operations Risk Management Operations risk arises from problems with service or product delivery or from nonconformance with internal policies and procedures. The Company is exposed to transaction risk when products, services or 86 delivery channels do not fit with our operational capacity, customer demands or strategic objectives. Operations risk can increase with the implementation of new information technology to support a new, expanded or modified product or service. Failed or flawed technology, either from error, inadequate capacity or fraud, may result in the inability to deliver products or services. Operations risk is managed by our managers with assistance and training provided by our centralized support functions. Additionally, the operations risks associated with new products and services, the security and confidentiality of information, the effectiveness of our technology infrastructure, the emergency loss of technology and other infrastructure resources, the monitoring of internal controls and compliance with internal control standards, and the monitoring and dissemination of changes in regulations affecting the business are each the subject of executive management review through committees established for these particular purposes. The Finance and Operations Committee of our Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for significant operational risks and receives periodic reports from executive management regarding the effectiveness of our risk management efforts in this area. Political and Reputation Risk Management Political and reputation risk is the risk that changes in laws and regulations or actions negatively impacting our reputation could affect the profitability and sustainability of our business. Management proactively assesses and manages political and reputation risk. Our government relations team of employees manages our review and response to all formal inquiries from members of Congress, state legislators, and their staff, including providing targeted messaging that reinforces our public policy goals. We review and consider political and reputational risks on an integrated basis in connection with the risk management oversight activities conducted in the various aspects of our business on matters as diverse as the launch of new products and services, our credit underwriting activities and how we fund our operations. Significant political and reputation risks are reported to and monitored by the Finance and Operations Committee of our Board of Directors. Competition Risk Management Competition risk is the risk of losing market share or the lack of market acceptance of our products due to our competitors competing more effectively. Management closely monitors competitors and conditions. We follow changes in product pricing and features and track marketing activity across a variety of distribution channels. In addition, we measure category participants brand recognition among key consumer groups. We continuously evaluate the size of the market and analyze market developments and trends that may impact future demand for student loans. Significant market competition risks are reported to and monitored by the Finance and Operations Committee of our Board of Directors. Credit and Counterparty Risk Management Credit and counterparty risk is the risk of loss stemming from one partys failure to repay a loan or otherwise meet a contractual obligation. We have credit or counterparty risk exposure with borrowers and co borrowers with whom we have made Private Education Loans, the various counterparties with whom we have entered into derivative contracts, the various issuers with whom we make investments, and with several higher education institutions related to academic facilities loans secured by real estate. The credit risk related to Private Education Loans are managed within a credit risk infrastructure which includes (i) a well defined underwriting and collection policy framework; (ii) an ongoing monitoring and review process of portfolio segments and trends; (iii) assignment and management of credit authorities and responsibilities; and (iv) establishment of an allowance for loan losses that covers estimated losses based upon 87 portfolio and economic analysis. This infrastructure is overseen by our Chief Credit Officer and the executive management committee that he chairs. Credit and counterparty risk related to derivative contracts is managed by reviewing counterparties for credit strength on an ongoing basis and via our credit policies, which place limits on the amount of exposure we may take with any one counterparty and, in most cases, require collateral to secure the position. The credit and counterparty risk associated with derivatives is measured based on the replacement cost should the counterparties with contracts in a gain position to the Company fail to perform under the terms of the contract. The credit and counterparty risk in our investment portfolio is minimized by only investing in paper with highly rated issuers and setting limits on our exposure per issuer. Credit and counterparty risk related to derivative contracts and our investment portfolio are approved and managed by our Credit Risk Management group overseen by our Chief Credit Officer. Significant credit and counterparty risks related to derivative contracts or our investment portfolio are reported to the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. Additionally, our Chief Credit Officer reports, on a regular basis, to the Board and the Audit Committee of the Board regarding the asset quality of our Private Education Loans. Regulatory and Compliance Risk Management Regulatory and compliance risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from violations of laws, rules, or regulations. The Company is exposed to regulatory and compliance risk when key areas such as our private education lending, collections or government loan servicing businesses are not properly monitored for compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and when an oversight program does not include appropriate audit and control features. We also face regulatory and compliance risk when new, expanded or modified products or services are not properly monitored for compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Primary ownership and responsibility for regulatory and compliance risk is placed with the business areas to manage their specific regulatory and compliance risks. Our Compliance Department supports these activities through providing extensive training and monitoring of our Code of Business Conduct, maintaining consumer lending regulatory and information security policies and procedures, and working in close coordination with our other centralized support functions such as our Legal department. Compliance risks associated with new products and services, SEC disclosure obligations, security and confidentiality of information and effectiveness of our technology infrastructure, internal controls and compliance with internal control standards, dissemination of changes in regulations affecting the business, and enforcement of credit lending policies and practices are each the subject of specific review by existing management committees. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has oversight with respect to establishing standards with respect to our monitoring and control of regulatory and compliance risks and the qualification of employees overseeing these risk management functions. The Audit Committee receives periodic reports from executive management team members responsible for the regulatory and compliance risk management functions. 88 Common Stock The following table summarizes our common share repurchases and issuances for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Years Ended December 31, (Shares in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Common shares repurchased: Open market Benefit plans(1) 1.1 .3 1.0 Total shares repurchased 1.1 .3 1.0 Average purchase price per share $ 13.44 $ 20.29 $ 24.51 Common shares issued 1.8 17.8 1.9 Authority remaining at end of period for repurchases 38.8 38.8 38.8 (1) Shares withheld from stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock for employees tax withholding obligations and shares tendered by employees to satisfy option exercise costs. During 2009, we converted $339 million of our Series C Preferred Stock to common stock. As part of this conversion, we delivered to the holders of the preferred stock: (1) approximately 17 million shares (the number of common shares they would most likely receive if the preferred stock they held mandatorily converted to common shares in the fourth quarter of 2010) plus (2) a discounted amount of the preferred stock dividends the holders of the preferred stock would have received if they held the preferred stock through the mandatory conversion date. The accounting treatment for this conversion resulted in additional dividends recorded as part of preferred stock dividends for the year of approximately $53 million. On December 15, 2010, the mandatory conversion date, the remaining 810,370 shares of our Series C Preferred Stock were converted into 41 million shares of common stock. The closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2010 was $12.59 89 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis Our interest rate risk management seeks to limit the impact of short term movements in interest rates on our results of operations and financial position. The following tables summarize the effect on earnings for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the effect on fair values at December 31, 2010 and 2009, based upon a sensitivity analysis performed by management assuming a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of 100 basis points and 300 basis points while funding spreads remain constant. Additionally, as it relates to the effect on earnings, a sensitivity analysis was performed assuming the funding index increases 25 basis points while holding the asset index constant, if the funding index is different than the asset index. Both of these analyses do not consider any potential mark to market losses that may occur related to our Residual Interests (prior to the adoption of topic updates on ASC 810 on January 1, 2010) that may result from asset and funding basis divergence or a higher discount rate that would be used to compute the present value of the cash flows if long term interest rates increased.

However, as discussed in Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Segment Earnings Summary Core Earnings Basis FFELP Loans Segment Floor Income Core Earnings Basis, we can have a fixed versus floating mismatch in funding if the student loan earns at the fixed borrower rate and the funding remains floating. In addition, we can have a mismatch in the index (including the frequency of reset) of floating rate debt versus floating rate assets. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, certain FFELP Loans were earning Floor Income and we locked in a portion of that Floor Income through the use of Floor Income Contracts. The result of these hedging transactions was to convert a portion of the fixed rate nature of student loans to variable rate, and to fix the relative spread between the student loan asset rate and the variable rate liability. 91 In the preceding tables, under the scenario where interest rates increase 100 and 300 basis points, the change in pre tax net income before the unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities is primarily due to the impact of (i) our unhedged on balance sheet loans being in a fixed rate mode due to the Embedded Floor Income, while being funded with variable debt in low interest rate environments; and (ii) a portion of our variable assets being funded with fixed debt. Item (i) will generally cause income to decrease when interest rates increase from a low interest rate environment, whereas item (ii) will generally offset this decrease. In the 100 and 300 basis point scenarios for the year ended December 31, 2010, the increase in income resulted from item (ii) having a greater impact than item (i). In the prior year period, item (i) resulted in a decrease to income in the 100 and 300 basis point scenarios. Under the scenario in the tables above labeled Asset and Funding Index Mismatches, the main driver of the decrease in pre tax income before unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities is the result of LIBOR based debt funding commercial paper indexed assets. See Asset and Liability Funding Gap of this Item 7A for a further discussion. Increasing the spread between indices will also impact the unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities as it relates to basis swaps. Basis swaps used to convert LIBOR based debt to indices that we believe are economic hedges of the indices of the assets being funded resulted in an unrealized losses of $(204) million and $(102) million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Offsetting this unrealized loss are basis swaps that economically hedge our Private Education Loan securitization trusts. Unrealized gains for these basis swaps totaled $176 million and $208 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The change from a net gain in the prior year period to a net loss in the current year period was the impact of basis swap hedges in securitization trusts that were previously off balance sheet prior to new consolidation accounting adopted on January 1, 2010 (see Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Transfers of Financial Assets and the VIE Consolidation Model for further discussion). In addition to interest rate risk addressed in the preceding tables, we are also exposed to risks related to foreign currency exchange rates. Foreign currency exchange risk is primarily the result of foreign currency denominated debt issued by us. As it relates to our corporate unsecured and securitization debt programs used to fund our business, our policy is to use cross currency interest rate swaps to swap all foreign currency denominated debt payments (fixed and floating) to U.S. dollar LIBOR using a fixed exchange rate. In the tables above, there would be an immaterial impact on earnings if exchange rates were to decrease or increase, due to the terms of the hedging instrument and hedged items matching. The balance sheet interest bearing liabilities would be affected by a change in exchange rates; however, the change would be materially offset by the cross currency interest rate swaps in other assets or other liabilities. In the current economic environment, volatility in the spread between spot and forward foreign exchange rates has resulted in material mark to market impacts to current period earnings which have not been factored into the above analysis. The earnings impact is noncash, and at maturity of the instruments the cumulative mark to market impact will be zero. 92 Asset and Liability Funding Gap The tables below present our assets and liabilities (funding) arranged by underlying indices as of December 31, 2010. In the following GAAP presentation, the funding gap only includes derivatives that qualify as effective hedges (those derivatives which are reflected in net interest margin, as opposed to those reflected in the gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities, net line on the consolidated statements of income). The difference between the asset and the funding is the funding gap for the specified index. This represents our exposure to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk, which is the risk that the different indices may reset at different frequencies or may not move in the same direction or at the same magnitude. Management analyzes interest rate risk and in doing so includes all derivatives that are economically hedging our debt whether they qualify as effective hedges or not (Core Earnings basis). Accordingly, we are also presenting the asset and liability funding gap on a Core Earnings basis in the table that follows the GAAP presentation. GAAP Basis Frequency of Index Variable Funding (Dollars in billions) Resets Assets Funding(1) Gap 3 month Commercial paper daily $ 139.2 $ .1 $ 139.1 3 month Treasury bill weekly 8.2 8.2 Prime annual .8 .8 Prime quarterly 5.4 5.4 Prime monthly 23.1 23.1 Prime daily 3.0 (3.0 ) PLUS Index annual .5 .5 3 month LIBOR daily 3 month LIBOR quarterly 132.1 (132.1 ) 1 month LIBOR monthly 7.3 15.3 (8.0 ) CMT/CPI Index monthly/quarterly 2.0 (2.0 ) Non Discrete reset(2) monthly 34.6 (34.6 ) Non Discrete reset(3) daily/weekly 11.5 2.3 9.2 Fixed Rate(4) 9.3 15.9 (6.6 ) Total $ 205.3 $ 205.3 $ (1) Funding includes all derivatives that qualify as hedges. (2) Funding consists of auction rate securities, the ABCP Facilities and the ED Conduit Program facility. (3) Assets include restricted and unrestricted cash equivalents and other overnight type instruments. Funding includes retail and other deposits and cash collateral held related to derivatives exposures that are recorded as a short term debt obligation. (4) Assets include receivables and other assets (including goodwill and acquired intangibles). Funding includes other liabilities and stockholders equity (excluding series B Preferred Stock). 93 The Funding Gaps in the above table are primarily interest rate mismatches in short term indices between our assets and liabilities. We address this issue typically through the use of basis swaps that typically convert quarterly reset three month LIBOR to other indices that are more correlated to our asset indices. These basis swaps do not qualify as effective hedges and as a result the effect on the funding index is not included in our interest margin and is therefore excluded from the GAAP presentation. Core Earnings Basis Index Frequency of Funding (Dollars in billions) Variable Resets Assets Funding(1) Gap 3 month Commercial paper daily $ 139.2 $ .1 $ 139.1 3 month Treasury bill weekly 8.2 2.0 6.2 Prime annual .8 .8 Prime quarterly 5.4 1.5 3.9 Prime monthly 23.1 8.6 14.5 Prime daily 3.0 (3.0 ) PLUS Index annual .5 .5 3 month LIBOR daily 55.5 (55.5 ) 3 month LIBOR quarterly 54.6 (54.6 ) 1 month LIBOR monthly 7.3 20.1 (12.8 ) 1 month LIBOR daily 9.0 (9.0 ) Non Discrete reset(2) monthly 34.6 (34.6 ) Non Discrete reset(3) daily/weekly 11.5 2.3 9.2 Fixed Rate(4) 6.6 11.3 (4.7 ) Total $ 202.6 $ 202.6 $ (1) Funding includes all derivatives that management considers economic hedges of interest rate risk and reflects how we internally manage our interest rate exposure. (2) Funding consists of auction rate securities, the ABCP Facilities and the ED Conduit Program facility. (3) Assets include restricted and unrestricted cash equivalents and other overnight type instruments. Funding includes retail and other deposits and cash collateral held related to derivatives exposures that are recorded as a short term debt obligation. (4) Assets include receivables and other assets (including goodwill and acquired intangibles). Funding includes other liabilities and stockholders equity (excluding series B Preferred Stock). We use interest rate swaps and other derivatives to achieve our risk management objectives. To the extent possible, we fund our assets with debt (in combination with derivatives) that has the same underlying index (index type and index reset frequency). When it is more economical, we also fund our assets with debt that has a different index and or reset frequency than the asset, but only in instances where we believe there is a high degree of correlation between the interest rate movement of the two indices. For example, we use daily reset three month LIBOR to fund a large portion of our daily reset three month commercial paper indexed assets. In addition, we use quarterly reset three month LIBOR to fund a portion of our quarterly reset Prime rate indexed Private Education Loans. We also use our monthly Non Discrete reset and 1 month LIBOR funding to fund various asset types. In using different index types and different index reset frequencies to fund our assets, we are exposed to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk, which is the risk that the different indices that may reset at different frequencies will not move in the same direction or at the same magnitude. While we believe that this risk is low, as all of these indices are short term with rate movements that are highly correlated over a long period of time, market disruptions can lead to a temporary divergence between indices as was experienced beginning in the second half of 2007 through the second quarter of 2009 with the commercial paper and LIBOR indices. As of December 31, 2010, we have approximately $92.6 billion of FFELP Loans indexed to three month commercial paper (3M CP) that are funded with debt indexed to 3M LIBOR. 94 Weighted Average Life The following table reflects the weighted average life for our earning assets and liabilities at December 31, 2010.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. This discussion and analysis also contains forward looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in Forward Looking and Cautionary Statements and Item 1A Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Through this discussion and analysis, we intend to provide the reader with some narrative context for how our management views our consolidated financial statements, additional context within which to assess our operating results, and information on the quality and variability of our earnings, liquidity and cash flows. Overview We provide Private Education Loans that help students and their families bridge the gap between family resources, federal loans, grants, student aid, scholarships, and the cost of a college education. We also provide savings products to help save for a college education. In addition we provide servicing and collection services on federal loans. We also offer servicing, collection and transaction support directly to colleges and universities in addition to the saving for college industry. Finally, we are the largest private owner of FFELP Loans. Effective July 1, 2010, HCERA legislation eliminated the authority to originate new loans under FFELP. Consequently, we no longer originate FFELP Loans. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2010 we changed the way we regularly monitor and assess our ongoing operations and results by realigning our business segments into four reportable segments: (1) FFELP Loans, (2) Consumer Lending, (3) Business Services and (4) Other. Management now views our business as consisting of three primary segments comprised of one runoff business (FFELP Loans) and two continuing growth businesses (Consumer Lending and Business Services). FFELP Loans Segment Our FFELP Loans segment consists of our $148.6 billion FFELP Loan portfolio and underlying debt and capital funding these loans. This includes the acquisition of loans from the Student Loan Corporation on December 31, 2010 (see Segment Earnings Summary Core Earnings Basis FFELP Loans Segment of this Item 7 for further discussion). Because we no longer originate FFELP Loans the portfolio is in runoff and is expected to amortize over approximately the next 25 years with a weighted average remaining life of 7.7 years. We actively seek to acquire FFELP Loan portfolios to leverage our servicing scale and expertise to generate incremental earnings and cash flow to create additional shareholder value. Of our total FFELP Loan portfolio, 77 percent was funded to term through securitization trusts, 16 percent was funded through the ED Conduit Program which terminates on January 19, 2014, 5 percent was funded in our multi year ABCP facility and FHLB DM facility, and the remainder was funded with unsecured debt. It is expected to generate a stable net interest margin and significant amounts of cash as the portfolio amortizes. Consumer Lending Segment In our Consumer Lending segment we originate, acquire, finance and service Private Education Loans. As of December 31, 2010 we had $35.7 billion of Private Education Loans outstanding. In 2010 we originated $2.3 billion of Private Education Loans, down from $3.2 billion in the prior year. We provide Private Education Loans to students and their families to help them pay for a college education. We provide loans through the financial aid office, direct to consumer and through referral and partner lenders. We also provide savings products, primarily in the form of retail deposits, to help customers save for a college education (we refer to this as our Direct Banking business line). Business Services Segment In our Business Services segment we provide loan servicing to our FFELP Loans segment, ED and other third parties. We provide default aversion work and contingency collections on behalf of Guarantors, colleges and ED. We also perform Campus Payment Solutions, account asset servicing and transaction processing activities. Other Our Other segment primarily consists of the financial results related to the repurchase of debt, the corporate liquidity portfolio and all overhead. We also include results from smaller wind down and discontinued operations within this segment. 23 The following table shows how we realigned our old reportable segments existing prior to the fourth quarter of 2010 into our new business lines as part of the change in business segments discussed above. Business Lines/Activities New Business Segment Prior Business Segment FFELP Loan business FFELP Loans Lending Private Education Loan business Consumer Lending Lending Direct Banking Consumer Lending Lending Intercompany servicing of FFELP Loans Business Services Lending FFELP Loan default aversion services Business Services APG FFELP defaulted loan portfolio management services Business Services APG FFELP Guarantor servicing Business Services Other Contingency collections Business Services APG Third party loan servicing Business Services Other ED loan servicing Business Services Other Upromise Business Services Other Campus Payment Solutions Business Services Other Purchased Paper Non Mortgage Other APG Purchased Paper Mortgage/Properties Other APG Mortgage and other loans Other Lending Debt repurchase gains Other Lending Corporate liquidity portfolio Other Lending Overhead expenses Other Lending, APG and Other Key Financial Measures Our operating results are primarily driven by net interest income from our student loan portfolios, provision for loan losses, financing costs, costs necessary to generate new assets, the revenues and expenses generated by our service businesses and gains and losses on loan sales, debt repurchases and derivatives. We manage and assess the performance of each business segment separately as each is focused on different customer bases and derive their revenue from different activities and services. A brief summary of our key financial measures are listed below. Net Interest Income The most significant portion of our earnings are generated by the spread earned between the interest revenue we receive on assets in our student loan portfolios and the interest cost of funding these loans. We report these earnings as net interest income. Net interest income in our FFELP Loans and Consumer Lending segments are driven by significantly different factors. FFELP Loans Segment Net interest income will be the primary source of cash flow generated by this segment as the portfolio runs off and we will no longer generate revenues from new originations. We may continue to acquire existing portfolios of FFELP Loans from third parties. We would expect any acquisitions to be accretive. The FFELP Loans segments net interest margin was 93 basis points in 2010 compared with 67 basis points in 2009. The major sources of variability in net interest margin are expected to be the CP/LIBOR spread and Floor Income. We refer to the spread between the Federal Reserves 3 month financial commercial paper index (CP) and 3 month LIBOR as the CP/LIBOR spread. Interest earned on our FFELP Loan assets are indexed primarily to CP and interest paid on their related funding liabilities are primarily indexed to 3 month LIBOR. Movements in the CP and 3 month LIBOR rates expand or contract the CP/LIBOR spread and our net interest income decreases or increases as a result. During the capital markets turmoil of recent years, the CP/LIBOR spread has suffered dramatic fluctuations that have negatively affected net interest income significantly. For 2010, the average CP/LIBOR spread returned to historical levels. Pursuant to the terms of the FFELP, certain FFELP Loans, in certain situations, continue to earn interest at the stated fixed rate of interest even if underlying debt costs decrease. We refer to this additional spread 24 income as Floor Income. This Floor Income can be volatile as rates on underlying debt move up and down. We will generally hedge this risk by selling Floor Income Contracts which lock in the value of the Floor Income over the term of the contract. Additional cash flow should be generated within this segment as many of our secured financing vehicles are over collateralized, creating the potential for additional cash flow to be distributed to us over time as the loans amortize. Consumer Lending Segment We expect to grow our Private Education Loan portfolio primarily through our school and direct to consumer channels. Net interest income in this segment is determined by the Private Education Loan asset yields, which are determined by interest rates established by us based upon the credit of the borrower and any co borrower, the level of price competition in the Private Education Loan market and our cost of funds. Our cost of funds can be influenced by a number of factors including the quality of the loans in our portfolio, our corporate credit rating, general economic conditions, investor demand for ABS and corporate unsecured debt and competition in the deposit market. Loans are priced to anticipate our cost of funds and expected charge off rate over the life of the loans. Our Private Education Loans earn variable rate interest and are funded primarily with variable rate liabilities. The Consumer Lending segments net interest margin was 3.85 percent in 2010 and 2009. Provision For Loan Losses Management estimates and maintains an allowance for loan losses equal to charge offs expected over the next two years. The provision is an income statement item that reduces segment revenues. Generally the allowance rises when charge offs are expected to increase and falls when charge offs are expected to decline. Our loss exposure and resulting provision for losses is smaller for FFELP Loans than for Private Education Loans because we bear a maximum of 3 percent loss exposure on FFELP Loans. Our provision for losses in our FFELP Loans segment was $98 million in 2010 compared with $119 million in 2009. Our loss exposure and resulting provision in our Consumer Lending segment is much greater than our FFELP Loans segment. Losses in our Consumer Lending segment are primarily driven by risk characteristics such as loan program type, school type, loan status (in school, grace, forbearance, repayment and delinquency), seasoning (number of months in active repayment for which a scheduled payment was due), underwriting criteria (e.g., credit scores), existence or absence of a cosigner and the current economic environment. Our provision for loan losses in our Consumer Lending segment was $1.298 billion in 2010 compared with $1.399 billion in 2009. Charge Offs and Delinquencies When we conclude a loan is uncollectable (from the borrower or Guarantor), the unrecoverable portion of the loan is charged against the allowance for loan losses in the relevant lending segment. Information regarding charge offs provides relevant information over time with respect to the actual performance of our loan portfolios as compared against the provisions for loan losses on those portfolios. The Consumer Lending segments charge off rate was 5 percent of loans in 2010 compared with 6 percent in 2009. Delinquencies are a very important indicator of the potential future credit performance. Management focuses on the overall level of delinquencies as well as the progression of loans from early to late stage delinquency. Core Earnings basis Private Education Loan delinquencies as a percentage of Private Education Loans in repayment decreased from 12.1 percent at December 31, 2009 to 10.6 percent at December 31, 2010. Servicing and Contingency Revenues We earn servicing revenues from servicing student loans, Campus Payment Solutions, and from account asset servicing related to 529 college savings plans. We earn contingency revenue related to default aversion and contingency collections work we do primarily on federal loans. The fees we recognize are primarily driven by our success in collecting or rehabilitating defaulted loans, the number of transactions processed and the underlying volume of loans we are servicing on behalf of others. 25 Other Income/(Loss) In managing our loan portfolios and funding sources we periodically engage in sales of loans and the repurchase of our outstanding debt. In each case, depending on market conditions, we may incur gains or losses from these transactions that affect our results from operations. We also recognize gains and losses in accordance with GAAP on our derivative and hedging activities from the changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and ineffectiveness on derivatives that do qualify for hedge accounting. Operating Expenses The operating expenses reported for our Consumer Lending and Business Services segments are those that are directly attributable to the generation of revenues by those segments. The operating expenses for the FFELP Loans segment primarily represent an intercompany servicing charge from the Business Services segment and do not reflect our actual underlying costs incurred to service the loans. We have included corporate overhead expenses and certain information technology costs (together referred to as Overhead) in our Other segment rather than allocate those expenses by segment. These overhead expenses include costs related to executive management, the board of directors, accounting, finance, legal, human resources, stock option expense and certain information technology costs related to infrastructure and operations. Core Earnings Management uses Core Earnings as the primary financial performance measure to evaluate performance and to allocate resources. Core Earnings is the basis in which we prepare our segment disclosures as required by GAAP under ASC 280 Segment Reporting (see Note 19 Segment Reporting). For a full explanation of the contents and limitations of Core Earnings see Core Earnings Definition and Limitations of this Item 7. 2010 Summary We overcame considerable challenges and achieved significant accomplishments in 2010. We continue to operate in an extremely challenging macroeconomic environment marked by high unemployment and periods of extreme illiquidity in the capital markets. Effective July 1, 2010, HCERA eliminated FFELP Loan originations, a major source of our net income. As a result, we will no longer have revenue related to FFELP Loan originations and will have declining net income related to our portfolio of FFELP Loans and related FFELP Loan servicing and collections activities. HCERA does not alter or affect the terms and conditions of our existing FFELP Loans. Net interest income we earn on our FFELP Loan portfolio will decline over time as the portfolio amortizes. We will no longer earn any origination fees for originating FFELP Loans (which was $34 million in 2010) and the Guarantor maintenance fees (which was $56 million in 2010) will decline as the portfolio pays down. In addition, we earned $245 million in FFELP contingency revenue in 2010, which we expect to remain relatively stable through 2012 and then steadily decline as the portfolio of defaulted FFELP Loans we manage is resolved and amortizes. In response to these legislative and economic challenges we explored splitting the Company into two publicly traded companies, representing our runoff and growth businesses. We also explored selling our residual interests in our securitized FFELP Loans to effectively remove the securitized loans from our balance sheet. After evaluating both strategies we determined that neither strategy currently provides better economic returns to investors than our current operating structure. On December 31, 2010, we closed on our agreement to purchase the $26.1 billion of securitized federal loans and related assets from the Student Loan Corporation. This transaction will be accretive to 2011 earnings and beyond. We continue to seek to acquire FFELP Loan portfolios. Despite the economic environment, we saw significant improvements in the quality of our lending business segments. 26 At the end of the year, our FFELP Loan portfolio was 93 percent funded to term with long term liabilities including the ED sponsored Straight A conduit. We also completed $2 billion of FFELP Loan asset backed securitization transactions in 2010. The net interest margin in our FFELP Loans segment improved to 93 basis points in 2010 from 67 basis points in 2009 as the CP/LIBOR spread returned to historical levels. In addition, we sold $20.4 billion of loans to ED in 2010 resulting in gains of $321 million. In our Private Education Loan portfolio, delinquencies greater than 90 days trended lower throughout the year to 5.3 percent of loans in repayment at year end compared to 6.4 percent of loans in repayment at the end of the first quarter of the year. The quarterly provision for loan losses ended the year at $294 million, down from the second quarter 2010 peak of $349 million. Private Education Loan originations improved over the course of 2010 as well. After falling more than 40 percent in each of the first two quarters of the year compared with the year ago quarters they fell just 6 percent in the third quarter and increased 8 percent in the fourth quarter. We completed $4.1 billion of Private Education Loan asset backed securitization transactions in 2010. The Consumer Lending segment returned to profitability in 2010 after posting a loss in the prior year. In our Business Services segment, we saw increased revenue in our third party servicing, contingency collections and account asset servicing lines of business. We decided to discontinue our Purchased Paper collection business at the end of 2010. In response to the elimination of FFELP, in 2010 we expanded an ongoing operating expense reduction initiative, including closing our Florida and Texas servicing centers and relocating our headquarters to Newark, Delaware by March 31, 2011. Core Earnings improved significantly to $1 billion from $807 million in the prior year. This was due to a number of factors including lower provision for loan losses, and a higher net interest margin. In 2010 we issued $1.5 billion of 10 year unsecured debt and repurchased $4.9 billion of unsecured debt. Combined with our asset backed securitization transactions, these actions significantly improved the overall maturity profile of our outstanding debt. 2011 Outlook We do not expect the economic environment to improve significantly in 2011. A high unemployment rate is expected to result in a challenging environment for financial services companies such as ours. We expect our Core Earnings business results to improve principally due to the significant improvement in the quality of our Private Education Loan portfolio. Increases in the cost of attaining a higher education and enrollments should drive increased volume in our consumer lending, servicing and collection businesses. Core Earnings are expected to be lower in 2011 than in 2010; however, this is principally due to a sharp decline in gains on debt repurchases and the absence of revenue generated from the sale of FFELP Loans to ED. In 2008 we significantly tightened our underwriting criteria and exited certain lending segments. In addition, each successive repayment cohort, i.e., a group of loans that enter their initial repayment status in the same calendar year upon exiting their grace period following graduation/separation from school, has been of higher quality. In 2009 we began to offer Smart Option Student Loans, which require students to make interest payments while they are in school, a departure from past practices where all required payments were deferred until the student graduated. In 2010, we began offering the Fixed Pay repayment option, which requires a payment during school that is less than a full interest payment. The loans that entered repayment in the fourth quarter of 2010 will influence delinquency trends in the first half of 2011 and charge offs in the second half. This cohort of loans is significantly smaller and of higher quality than previous repay cohorts, it has a higher average credit score and is comprised of significantly smaller amounts of higher risk non traditional and non cosigned loans on a percentage basis and in total volume. On January 11, 2011 we issued $2 billion, five year 6.25 percent fixed rate unsecured notes. The rate on the notes was swapped from a fixed rate to a floating rate equal to an all in cost of one month LIBOR plus 4.46 percent. Investor demand was the highest ever for a Sallie Mae issue, which we believe reflects investors views that our financial condition has strengthened. In 2011, we expect to access the unsecured debt market 27 and the term asset backed securities market to re finance both FFELP and Private Education Loans. We believe that conditions in these markets have improved as compared to last year and are conducive to funding at more favorable spreads and advance rates. Retail Bank deposits are also expected to continue to be a source of funding at favorable rates. We currently expect our net interest margins in the coming year to be stable in both our FFELP Loans and Consumer Lending segments. 2011 Management Objectives In 2011 we have set out five major goals to create shareholder value. They are: (1) Reduce our operating expenses; (2) Maximize cash flows from FFELP Loans; (3) Prudently grow Consumer Lending segment assets and revenue; (4) Increase Business Services segment revenue; and (5) Reinstate dividends and or share repurchases. Here is how we plan to achieve these objectives. Reduce Operating Expenses The elimination of FFELP by HCERA greatly reduced the scope of our historical revenue generating capabilities. In 2010 we originated $14 billion of loans, 84 percent of them FFELP Loans; in 2011 we expect to originate $2.5 billion of new loans, all of them Private Education Loans. Our FFELP related revenues will decline over the coming years. As a result, we must effectively match our cost structure to our ongoing business. Operating expenses will be reduced company wide. We have set a goal of getting to an annualized operating expense quarterly run rate of $250 million by the fourth quarter of 2011. Maximize Cash Flows from FFELP Loans We have a $148.6 billion portfolio of FFELP Loans that is expected to generate significant amounts of cash flow and earnings in the coming years. We plan to reduce related costs, minimize income volatility and opportunistically purchase other FFELP Loan portfolios like we did with SLC. Grow Consumer Lending Segment Assets and Revenue Successfully growing Private Education Loan lending is the key component of our long term plan to grow shareholder value. We must originate increasing numbers of high quality Private Education Loans, increase net interest margins and further reduce charge offs and provision for loan losses. To manage our borrowing costs, we must achieve more attractive term asset backed securities market access and prices in the coming year. Increase Business Services Segment Revenue Our Business Services segment is comprised of several businesses with customers related to FFELP that will experience revenue declines and several businesses with customers that provide growth opportunities. Our growth businesses are ED servicing, ED collections, other school based asset type servicing and collections, Campus Payment Solutions, transaction processing and 529 college savings plan account asset servicing. We currently have a 22 percent market share of the ED Servicing Contract. This volume will grow organically as more loans are originated under DL. Our goal is to further expand our market share and broaden the services we provide to ED and other third party servicing clients. The ED collection contract will also grow organically as more loans are originated under DL. We also seek to increase our market share through improved performance. Campus Payment Solutions is a business line that we expect to grow by expanding our product offerings and leveraging our deep relationships with colleges and universities. Assets under management in 529 college savings plans total $34.5 billion and have been growing at a rate of 21 percent over the last three years. Our goal is to service additional 529 plans. Reinstate Dividends and or Share Repurchases We suspended our dividend and share repurchase programs in April 2007 and have not since reinstated these programs. We now believe that our cash flow and capital positions have strengthened sufficiently that by 28 the second half of 2011, we will be able to recommend to our board of directors that we either reinstate a dividend, begin to repurchase shares or do a combination of both. Results of Operations We present the results of operations first on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP. As discussed earlier, we have four business segments, FFELP Loans, Consumer Lending, Business Services and Other segments. Since these segments operate in distinct business environments, the discussion following the Consolidated Earnings Summary is presented on a segment basis and is shown on a Core Earnings basis. See Item 1 Business Business Segments for further discussion on the components of each segment. 29 GAAP Statements of Income Increase (Decrease) Years Ended December 31, 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 $ % $ % Interest income FFELP Loans $ 3,345 $ 3,094 $ 5,173 $ 251 8 % $ (2,079 ) (40 )% Private Education Loans 2,353 1,582 1,738 771 49 (156 ) (9 ) Other loans 30 56 83 (26 ) (46 ) (27 ) (33 ) Cash and investments 26 26 276 (250 ) (91 ) Total interest income 5,754 4,758 7,270 996 21 (2,512 ) (35 ) Total interest expense 2,275 3,035 5,905 (760 ) (25 ) (2,870 ) (49 ) Net interest income 3,479 1,723 1,365 1,756 102 358 26 Less: provisions for loan losses 1,419 1,119 720 300 27 399 55 Net interest income after provisions for loan losses 2,060 604 645 1,456 241 (41 ) (6 ) Other income (loss): Securitization servicing and Residual Interest revenue 295 262 (295 ) (100 ) 33 13 Gains (losses) on sales of loans and securities, net 325 284 (186 ) 41 14 470 253 Losses on derivative and hedging activities, net (361 ) (604 ) (445 ) 243 (40 ) (159 ) 36 Servicing revenue 405 440 408 (35 ) (8 ) 32 8 Contingency revenue 330 294 330 36 12 (36 ) (11 ) Gains on debt repurchases 317 536 64 (219 ) (41 ) 472 738 Other income 6 88 39 (82 ) (93 ) 49 126 Total other income 1,022 1,333 472 (311 ) (23 ) 861 182 Expenses: Operating expenses 1,208 1,043 1,029 165 16 14 1 Goodwill and acquired intangible assets impairment and amortization expense 699 76 50 623 820 26 52 Restructuring expenses 85 10 72 75 750 (62 ) (86 ) Total expenses 1,992 1,129 1,151 863 76 (22 ) (2 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations, before income tax expense (benefit) 1,090 808 (34 ) 282 35 842 2,476 Income tax expense (benefit) 493 264 (36 ) 229 87 300 833 Net income from continuing operations 597 544 2 53 10 542 27,100 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (67 ) (220 ) (215 ) 153 (70 ) (5 ) 2 Net income (loss) 530 324 (213 ) 206 64 537 252 Preferred stock dividends 72 146 111 (74 ) (51 ) 35 32 Net income (loss) attributable to common stock $ 458 $ 178 $ (324 ) $ 280 157 % $ 502 155 % Basic earnings (loss) per common share: Continuing operations $ 1.08 $ .85 $ (.23 ) $ .23 27 % $ 1.08 470 % Discontinued operations $ (.14 ) $ (.47 ) $ (.46 ) $ .33 (70 )% $ (.01 ) 2 % Total $ .94 $ .38 $ (.69 ) $ .56 147 % $ 1.07 155 % Diluted earnings (loss) per common share: Continuing operations $ 1.08 $ .85 $ (.23 ) $ .23 27 % $ 1.08 470 % Discontinued operations $ (.14 ) $ (.47 ) $ (.46 ) $ .33 (70 )% $ (.01 ) 2 % Total $ .94 $ .38 $ (.69 ) $ .56 147 % $ 1.07 155 % Dividends per common share $ $ $ $ % $ % 30 Consolidated Earnings Summary GAAP basis Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2009 For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, net income was $530 million, or $.94 diluted earnings per common share, and $324 million, or $.38 diluted earnings per common share, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, net income from continuing operations was $597 million, or $1.08 diluted earnings per common share, and $544 million, or $.85 diluted earnings per common share, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, net loss from discontinued operations was $67 million, or $.14 diluted loss per common share, and $220 million, or $.47 diluted loss per common share from discontinued operations per common share, respectively. Income from Continuing Operations before Income Tax Expense Income from continuing operations before income tax expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2010, by $282 million as compared with the prior year primarily due to a $1.5 billion increase in net interest income after provisions for loan losses and a $243 million decrease in net losses on derivative and hedging activities. These improvements were partially offset by a $660 million goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge, a $165 million increase in operating expenses, a $219 million decrease in gains on debt repurchases and a decrease in securitization servicing and Residual Interest revenue of $295 million. The primary contributors to each of the identified drivers of changes in income from continuing operations before income tax expense for the year over year period are as follows: Net interest income after provisions for loan losses increased by $1.5 billion in the year ended December 31, 2010 from the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in net interest income and provisions for loan losses was partially due to the adoption as of January 1, 2010 of the new consolidation accounting guidance which resulted in the consolidation of $35.0 billion of assets and $34.4 billion of liabilities in certain securitizations trusts. (See Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies for a further discussion of the effect of adopting the new consolidation accounting guidance). The consolidation of these securitization trusts as of January 1, 2010 resulted in $998 million of additional net interest income and $355 million of additional provisions for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2010. Excluding the effect of the trusts being consolidated as of January 1, 2010, net interest income increased $758 million from the year ended 2009 and provisions for loan losses decreased $55 million from the year ended 2009. The increase in net interest income, excluding the effect of the new consolidation accounting guidance, was primarily the result of an increase in the FFELP Loans net interest margin primarily due to an improvement in our funding costs, a 24 basis point tightening of the CP/LIBOR spread and the effect of not receiving hedge accounting treatment for derivatives used to economically hedge risk affecting net interest income. The decrease in the provisions for loan losses relates to the Private Education Loan loss provision, which decreased as a result of the improving performance of the portfolio. Securitization servicing and Residual Interest revenue was no longer recorded in fiscal year 2010 due to the adoption of the new consolidation accounting guidance; however, we recognized $295 million in the prior year. Gains on sales of loans and securities increased $41 million from the prior year primarily related to the gains on sales of additional FFELP Loans to ED as part of EDs Loan Purchase Commitment Program (the Purchase Program). These gains will not occur in the future as the Purchase Program ended in 2010. Losses on derivatives and hedging activities, net, declined by $243 million in 2010 compared with 2009. The primary factor affecting the change in losses in 2010 was interest rates. Valuations of derivative instruments vary based upon many factors including changes in interest rates, credit risk, foreign currency fluctuations and other market factors. As a result, we expect gains and (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities, net, to vary significantly in future periods. 31 Servicing revenue decreased by $35 million primarily due to HCERA becoming effective as of July 1, 2010, thereby eliminating our ability to earn additional guarantor issuance fees on new FFELP Loans, as well as to a decline in outstanding FFELP Loans for which we were earning additional fees. Contingency revenue increased $36 million primarily from increased collections on defaulted FFELP Loans. Gains on debt repurchases decreased $219 million year over year while the principal amount of debt repurchased increased to $4.9 billion, as compared with the $3.4 billion repurchased in fiscal year 2009. We expect to continue to repurchase debt in the future and the amount of gains in the future will be dependent on market conditions and available liquidity. Other income declined by $82 million primarily due to a $71 million decrease in foreign currency translation gains. The foreign currency translation gains relate to a portion of our foreign currency denominated debt that does not receive hedge accounting treatment. These gains were partially offset by the losses on derivative and hedging activities, net line item on the income statement related to the derivatives used to economically hedge these debt instruments. Operating expenses, excluding restructuring related asset impairments of $19 million in 2010, increased $146 million year over year primarily due to an increase in legal contingency expense, costs related to the ED Servicing Contract, higher collection and servicing costs from a higher number of loans in repayment and in delinquent status, and higher marketing and technology enhancement costs related to Private Education Loans. Goodwill and intangible asset impairment and amortization increased $623 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to the $660 million of impairment recognized as a result of the passage of HCERA and its negative effects on the anticipated cash flows for certain of our reporting units and the reduced market values of these units. The amortization of acquired intangibles for continuing operations and for discontinued operations each remained relatively unchanged for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. For additional discussion regarding the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets see Note 6 Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets. Restructuring expenses increased $69 million in the year ended December 31, 2010, which is a result of a $75 million increase in restructuring expenses in continuing operations partially offset by a $6 million decrease in restructuring expenses attributable to discontinued operations. The following details our ongoing restructuring efforts: On March 30, 2010, President Obama signed into law H.R. 4872, HCERA, which included the SAFRA Act. Effective July 1, 2010, this legislation eliminated FFELP and requires all new federal loans to be made through the DSLP. Restructuring our operations in response to this change in law requires a significant reduction of operating costs from the elimination of positions and facilities associated with the origination of FFELP Loans. Expenses associated with continuing operations under this restructuring plan were $83 million in fiscal year 2010. We are currently finalizing this restructuring plan and expect to incur an estimated $11 million of additional restructuring costs in 2011. The majority of these expenses are severance costs related to the partially completed and planned elimination of approximately 2,500 positions, approximately 30 percent of our workforce that existed as of the first quarter 2010. In response to the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 (CCRAA) and challenges in the capital markets, we also initiated a restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of 2007. Under this ongoing plan, restructuring expenses associated with continuing operations of $2 million and $10 million were recognized in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The majority of these restructuring expenses were also severance costs related to the elimination of approximately 3,000 positions, or approximately 25 percent of our workforce that existed as of the fourth quarter 2007. 32 Income tax expense from continuing operations increased $229 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared with the prior year. The effective tax rates for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were 45 percent and 33 percent, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily driven by the impact of non deductible goodwill impairments recorded in 2010 and state tax rate changes recorded in both periods. Net Loss from Discontinued Operations. Net loss from discontinued operations in the year ended December 31, 2010 was $67 million compared with a net loss from discontinued operations of $220 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we sold our Purchased Paper Mortgage/Properties business for $280 million which resulted in an after tax loss of $95 million. As a result of this sale, the results of operations of this business were presented in discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2009. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we began actively marketing our Purchased Paper Non Mortgage business for sale and have concluded it is probable this business will be sold within one year at which time we would exit the business. As a result, the results of operations of this business were also required to be presented in discontinued operations beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010. In connection with this presentation, we are required to carry this business at the lower of fair value or historical cost basis. As a result, we recorded an after tax loss of $52 million from discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2010, primarily due to adjusting the value of this business to its estimated fair value. Our Purchased Paper businesses are presented in discontinued operations for the current and prior periods. The additional losses for both years that are more than the losses discussed above relate to ongoing impairment recorded as a result of the weakened economys effect on our ability to collect the receivables. Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2008 For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, net income was $324 million, or $.38 diluted earnings per common share, and a net loss of $213 million, or $.69 diluted loss per common share, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, net income from continuing operations was $544 million, or $.85 diluted earnings per common share, and $2 million, or $.23 diluted loss per common share, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, net loss from discontinued operations was $220 million, or $.47 diluted loss per common share, and $215 million, or $.46 diluted loss from discontinued operations per common share, respectively. Income from Continuing Operations before Income Tax Expense. Income from continuing operations before income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased $842 million from the prior year. The $842 million increase was primarily due to an increase in gains on debt repurchases of $472 million and an increase in gains on sales of loans and securities of $470 million offset by an increase of $159 million in net losses on derivative and hedging activities. The primary contributors to each of the identified drivers of changes in income from continuing operations before income tax expense for the year over year period are as follows: Net interest income after provisions for loan losses decreased by $41 million in the year ended December 31, 2009 from the prior year. This decrease was due to a $399 million increase in provisions for loan losses partially offset by a $358 million increase in net interest income. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to an increase in the FFELP Loans net interest margin primarily due to an increase in Gross Floor Income and the impact of derivative accounting and a $15 billion increase in the average balance of GAAP basis student loans. The increase in provisions for loan losses related primarily to increases in charge off expectations on Private Education Loans primarily as a result of the continued weakening of the U.S. economy. Securitization servicing and Residual Interest revenue increased by $33 million from the prior year primarily due to a $95 million decrease in the current year unrealized mark to market loss on our Residual Interests compared with the prior year, partially offset by a decrease in net Embedded Floor value. 33 Gains on sales of loans and securities increased $470 million from the prior year. The increase is primarily attributable to a $284 million gain on our sale of approximately $18.5 billion of FFELP Loans to ED as part of the ED Purchase Program and the $186 million loss incurred in fiscal year 2008. The 2008 loss resulted from our repurchase of delinquent Private Education Loans from our off balance sheet securitization trusts and the sale of approximately $1.0 billion FFELP Loans to the ED under ECASLA, which resulted in a $53 million loss. Losses on derivatives and hedging activities, net, increased by $159 million in 2009 compared with 2008. The primary factors affecting the change in losses in 2009 were interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Valuations of derivative instruments vary based upon many factors, including changes in interest rates, credit risk, foreign currency fluctuations and other market factors. As a result, we expect gains and (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities, net, to vary significantly in future periods. Servicing Revenue increased $32 million when compared with the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the initiation of Direct Lending servicing in 2009. Contingency revenue decreased $36 million when compared with the prior year primarily as a result of less Guarantor collections revenue from rehabilitating delinquent FFELP Loans. Gains on debt repurchases increased $472 million when compared with the prior year. We repurchased $3.4 billion of our unsecured corporate debt as compared with $1.9 billion in the prior year. Other income increased by $49 million primarily due to a $54 million increase in foreign currency translation gains. These gains were partially offset by the losses on derivative and hedging activities, net line item on the income statement related to the derivatives used to economically hedge these debt instruments. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, operating expenses, excluding restructuring related asset impairments of $0 and $6 million, respectively, were $1,043 million compared with $1,023 million, respectively. The $20 million increase from the prior year relates to increased marketing expense related to our direct to consumer marketing activities, increased technology costs as well as increased collections costs. Goodwill and intangible asset impairment for continuing operations increased by $35 million in 2009 and the goodwill and intangible asset impairment for discontinued operations decreased by like amount as compared with the prior year. For additional discussion regarding the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets see Note 6 Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets. The amortization of acquired intangibles for continuing operations totaled $38 million and $48 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and the amortization of acquired intangibles for discontinued operations totaled $1 million and $6 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Restructuring expenses of $22 million and $84 million were recognized in the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, of which $10 million and $72 million were in continuing operations and $12 million and $12 million were in discontinued operations, respectively. Income tax expense from continuing operations was $264 million in 2009 compared with an income tax benefit of $36 million in 2008, resulting in effective tax rates of 33 percent and 106 percent, respectively. The movement in the effective tax rate in 2009 compared with the prior year was primarily driven by the reduction of tax and interest on U.S. federal and state uncertain tax positions in both periods, as well as the permanent tax impact of deducting Proposed Merger related transaction costs in 2008. Also contributing to the higher effective tax rate in 2008 was the effect of significantly higher reported pre tax income in 2009 and the resulting changes in the proportion of income subject to federal and state taxes. For additional information, see Note 18 Income Taxes. 34 Net Loss from Discontinued Operations. Net loss from discontinued operations in the year ended December 31, 2009 increased $5 million from the prior year. Our Purchased Paper businesses are presented in discontinued operations for the current and prior years. Preferred Stock Dividend Expense During 2009, we converted $339 million of our Series C Preferred Stock to common stock. As part of this conversion, we delivered to the holders of the preferred stock: (1) approximately 17 million shares (the number of common shares they would most likely receive if the preferred stock they held mandatorily converted to common shares in the fourth quarter of 2010) plus (2) a discounted amount of the preferred stock dividends the holders of the preferred stock would have received if they held the preferred stock through the mandatory conversion date. The accounting treatment for this conversion resulted in additional expense recorded as a part of preferred stock dividends for the period of approximately $53 million. Core Earnings Definition and Limitations We prepare financial statements in accordance with GAAP. However, we also evaluate our business segments on a basis that differs from GAAP. We refer to this different basis of presentation as Core Earnings. We provide this Core Earnings basis of presentation on a consolidated basis for each business segment because this is what we internally review when making management decisions regarding our performance and how we allocate resources. We also refer to this information in our presentations with credit rating agencies, lenders and investors. Because our Core Earnings basis of presentation corresponds to our segment financial presentations, we are required by GAAP to provide Core Earnings disclosure in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for our business segments. For additional information, see Note 19 Segment Reporting. Core Earnings are not a substitute for reported results under GAAP. We use Core Earnings to manage each business segment because Core Earnings reflect adjustments to GAAP financial results for three items, discussed below, that create significant volatility mostly due to timing factors generally beyond the control of management. Accordingly, we believe that Core Earnings provide management with a useful basis from which to better evaluate results from ongoing operations against the business plan or against results from prior periods. Consequently, we disclose this information as we believe it provides investors with additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely assessed by management. The three items adjusted for in our Core Earnings presentations are (1) the off balance sheet treatment of certain securitization transactions, (2) our use of derivatives instruments to hedge our economic risks that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment or do qualify for hedge accounting treatment but result in ineffectiveness and (3) the accounting for goodwill and acquired intangible assets. While GAAP provides a uniform, comprehensive basis of accounting, for the reasons described above, our Core Earnings basis of presentation does not. Core Earnings are subject to certain general and specific limitations that investors should carefully consider. For example, there is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance for management reporting. Our Core Earnings are not defined terms within GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Accordingly, our Core Earnings presentation does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Investors, therefore, may not be able to compare our performance with that of other financial services companies based upon Core Earnings. Core Earnings results are only meant to supplement GAAP results by providing additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely used by management, our board of directors, rating agencies, lenders and investors to assess performance.

Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Core Earnings $ 1,028 $ 807 $ 583 Core Earnings adjustments: Net impact of derivative accounting 83 (502 ) (751 ) Net impact of goodwill and acquired intangibles (699 ) (76 ) (73 ) Net impact of securitization accounting (201 ) (442 ) Total Core Earnings adjustments before income tax effect (616 ) (779 ) (1,266 ) Net income tax effect 118 296 470 Total Core Earnings adjustments (498 ) (483 ) (796 ) GAAP net income (loss) $ 530 $ 324 $ (213 ) 1) Derivative Accounting: Core Earnings exclude periodic unrealized gains and losses that are caused primarily by the mark to market valuations on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under GAAP. To a lesser extent, these periodic unrealized gains and losses are also a result of ineffectiveness recognized related to effective hedges. These unrealized gains and losses occur in our FFELP Loans, Consumer Lending and Other business segments. Under GAAP, for derivatives we generally use that are held to maturity, the cumulative net unrealized gain or loss at the time of maturity will equal $0 except for Floor Income Contracts where the cumulative unrealized gain will equal the amount for which we sold the contract. In our Core Earnings presentation, we recognize the economic effect of these hedges, which generally results in any cash paid or received being recognized ratably as an expense or revenue over the hedged items life. The accounting for derivatives requires that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments be recognized currently in earnings, with no fair value adjustment of the hedged item, unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. We believe that our derivatives are effective economic hedges, and as such, are a critical element of our interest rate and foreign currency risk management strategy. However, some of our derivatives, primarily Floor Income Contracts and certain basis swaps, do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and the stand alone derivative must be marked to market in the income statement with no consideration for the corresponding change in fair value of the hedged item. These gains and losses recorded in Gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net are primarily caused by interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate volatility and changing credit spreads during the period as well as the volume and term of derivatives not receiving hedge accounting treatment. Our Floor Income Contracts are written options that must meet more stringent requirements than other hedging relationships to achieve hedge effectiveness. Specifically, our Floor Income Contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment because the pay down of principal of the student loans underlying the Floor Income embedded in those student loans does not exactly match the change in the notional amount of our written Floor Income Contracts. Under derivatives accounting treatment, the upfront payment is deemed a liability and changes in fair value are recorded through income throughout the life of the contract. The change in the value of Floor Income Contracts is primarily caused by changing interest rates that cause the amount of Floor Income earned on the underlying student loans and paid to the counterparties to vary. This is economically offset by the change in value of the student loan portfolio earning Floor Income but that offsetting change in value is not recognized. We believe the Floor Income Contracts are economic hedges because they effectively fix the amount of Floor Income earned over the contract period, thus eliminating the timing and uncertainty that changes in interest rates can have on Floor Income for that period. Therefore, for purposes of Core Earnings, we have removed the unrealized gains and losses related to these contracts and added back the amortization of the net premiums received on the Floor Income Contracts. The amortization of the net premiums received on the Floor Income Contracts for Core Earnings is reflected in student loan interest income. Under GAAP accounting, the premium received on the Floor Income Contracts is recorded as revenue in the gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities, net line item by the end of the contracts life. Basis swaps are used to convert floating rate debt from one floating interest rate index to another to better match the interest rate characteristics of the assets financed by that debt. We primarily use basis swaps to 39 hedge our student loan assets that are primarily indexed to a commercial paper, Prime or Treasury bill index. In addition, we use basis swaps to convert debt indexed to the Consumer Price Index to three month LIBOR debt. The accounting for derivatives requires that when using basis swaps, the change in the cash flows of the hedge effectively offset both the change in the cash flows of the asset and the change in the cash flows of the liability. Our basis swaps hedge variable interest rate risk; however, they generally do not meet this effectiveness test because the index of the swap does not exactly match the index of the hedged assets as required for hedge accounting treatment. Additionally, some of our FFELP Loans can earn at either a variable or a fixed interest rate depending on market interest rates and therefore swaps written on the FFELP Loans do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting treatment. As a result, under GAAP, these swaps are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected currently in the income statement. The table below quantifies the adjustments for derivative accounting on our net income for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 when compared with the accounting principles employed in all years prior to the adoption of ASC 815 related to accounting for derivative financial instruments. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Core Earnings derivative adjustments: Gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net, included in other income(1) $ (361 ) $ (604 ) $ (445 ) Less: Realized (gains) losses on derivative and hedging activities, net(1) 815 322 (107 ) Unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net 454 (282 ) (552 ) Amortization of net premiums on Floor Income Contracts in net interest income (317 ) (197 ) (191 ) Other pre change in derivatives accounting adjustments (54 ) (23 ) (8 ) Total net impact derivative accounting(2) $ 83 $ (502 ) $ (751 ) (1) See Reclassification of Realized Gains (Losses) on Derivative and Hedging Activities below for a detailed breakdown of the components of realized losses on derivative and hedging activities. (2) Negative amounts are subtracted from Core Earnings to arrive at GAAP net income and positive amounts are added to Core Earnings to arrive at GAAP net income. Reclassification of Realized Gains (Losses) on Derivative and Hedging Activities The accounting for derivative instruments requires net settlement income/expense on derivatives and realized gains/losses related to derivative dispositions (collectively referred to as realized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities) that do not qualify as hedges to be recorded in a separate income statement line item below net interest income. Under our Core Earnings presentation, these gains and (losses) are reclassified to the income statement line item of the economically hedged item. For our Core Earnings net interest margin, this would primarily include: (a) reclassifying the net settlement amounts related to our Floor Income Contracts to student loan interest income and (b) reclassifying the net settlement amounts related to certain of our basis swaps to debt interest expense. The table below summarizes the realized losses on derivative and hedging activities and the associated reclassification on a Core Earnings basis for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Reclassification of realized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities: Net settlement expense on Floor Income Contracts reclassified to net interest income $ (888 ) $ (717 ) $ (488 ) Net settlement income (expense) on interest rate swaps reclassified to net interest income 69 412 563 Foreign exchange derivatives gains/(losses) reclassified to other income (15 ) 11 Net realized gains (losses) on terminated derivative contracts reclassified to other income 4 (2 ) 21 Total reclassifications of realized (gains)losses on derivative and hedging activities (815 ) (322 ) 107 Add: Unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net(1) 454 (282 ) (552 ) Gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net $ (361 ) $ (604 ) $ (445 ) 40 (1) Unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net comprises the following unrealized mark to market gains (losses): Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Floor Income Contracts $ 156 $ 483 $ (529 ) Basis swaps 341 (413 ) (239 ) Foreign currency hedges (83 ) (255 ) 328 Other 40 (97 ) (112 ) Total unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net $ 454 $ (282 ) $ (552 ) 2) Goodwill and Acquired Intangibles: Our Core Earnings exclude goodwill and intangible impairment and the amortization of acquired intangibles. The following table summarizes the goodwill and acquired intangible adjustments for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Core Earnings goodwill and acquired intangibles adjustments: Goodwill and intangible impairment of acquired intangibles from continuing operations $ (660 ) $ (36 ) $ (1 ) Goodwill and intangible impairment of acquired intangibles from discontinued operations, net of tax (1 ) (20 ) Amortization of acquired intangibles from continuing operations (39 ) (38 ) (48 ) Amortization of acquired intangibles from discontinued operations, net of tax (1 ) (4 ) Total Core Earnings goodwill and acquired intangibles adjustments(1) $ (699 ) $ (76 ) $ (73 ) (1) Negative amounts are subtracted from Core Earnings to arrive at GAAP net income and positive amounts are added to Core Earnings to arrive at GAAP net income. 3) Securitization Accounting: On January 1, 2010, we adopted the new consolidation accounting guidance which now consolidates our off balance sheet securitization trusts. As a result, going forward, there will no longer be differences between our GAAP and Core Earnings presentation for securitization accounting. (See Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies for further detail). Prior to the adoption of the new consolidation accounting guidance on January 1, 2010, certain securitization transactions in our FFELP Loans and Consumer Lending business segments were accounted for as sales of assets. Under Core Earnings for the FFELP Loans and Consumer Lending business segments, we presented all securitization transactions as long term non recourse financings. The upfront gains on sale from securitization transactions, as well as ongoing securitization servicing and Residual Interest revenue (loss) presented in accordance with GAAP, were excluded from Core Earnings and were replaced by interest income, provisions for loan losses, and interest expense as earned or incurred on the securitization loans. This additional net interest margin included for Core Earnings contains any related fees or costs such as Consolidation Loan Rebate Fees, premium and discount amortization as well as any Repayment Borrower Benefit yield adjustments. We also excluded transactions with our off balance sheet trusts from Core Earnings as they were considered intercompany transactions on a Core Earnings basis. While we believe that our Core Earnings presentation presents the economic substance of results from our loan portfolios, when compared to GAAP results, it understates earnings volatility from securitization gains, securitization servicing income and Residual Interest income. 41 The following table summarizes Core Earnings securitization adjustments for the FFELP Loans and Consumer Lending business segments for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Core Earnings securitization adjustments: Net interest income on securitized loans, before provisions for loan losses and before intercompany transactions $ (942 ) $ (872 ) Provisions for loan losses 445 309 Net interest income on securitized loans, after provisions for loan losses, before intercompany transactions (497 ) (563 ) Intercompany transactions with off balance sheet trusts 1 (141 ) Net interest income on securitized loans, after provisions for loan losses (496 ) (704 ) Securitization servicing and Residual Interest revenue 295 262 Total Core Earnings securitization adjustments(1) $ (201 ) $ (442 ) (1) Negative amounts are subtracted from Core Earnings to arrive at GAAP net income and positive amounts are added to Core Earnings to arrive at GAAP net income. Intercompany transactions with off balance sheet trusts in the above table relate primarily to losses that result from the repurchase of delinquent loans from our off balance sheet securitization trusts. When Private Education Loans in our securitization trusts settling before September 30, 2005 became 180 days delinquent, we previously exercised our contingent call option to repurchase these loans at par value out of the trust and recorded a loss for the difference in the par value paid and the fair market value of the loan at the time of purchase. We do not hold the contingent call option for any trusts settled after September 30, 2005. In October 2008, we decided to no longer exercise our contingent call option. Business Segments As a result of the change in segment reporting that occurred in the fourth quarter 2010, past periods have been recast for comparison purposes. In connection with changing the reportable segments the following lists other significant changes we made related to the new segment presentation: The operating expenses reported for each segment are directly attributable to the generation of revenues by that segment. We have included corporate overhead and certain information technology costs (together referred to as Overhead) in our Other segment rather than allocate those expenses by segment. The creation of the FFELP Loans and Business Services segments has resulted in our accounting for the significant servicing revenue we earn on FFELP Loans we own in the Business Services segment. This bifurcates the FFELP interest income between the FFELP Loans and Business Services segment, with an intercompany servicing fee charge from the Business Services segment. The intercompany amounts are the contractual rates for encumbered loans within a financing facility or a similar market rate if the loan is not in a financing facility and accordingly exceed our costs. In our GAAP basis financial presentation we allocated existing goodwill to the new reporting units within the reportable segments based upon relative fair value. During the fourth quarter 2010, we also evaluated our goodwill for impairment using both the old reporting and new reporting unit framework and there was no impairment under either analysis. Similar to prior periods, capital is assigned to each segment based on internally determined risk adjusted weightings for the assets in each segment. These weightings have been updated and differ depending on the relative risk of each asset type and represent managements view of the level of capital needed to support different assets. Unsecured debt is allocated based on the remaining funding needed for each segment after direct funding and the capital allocation has been considered. 42 As part of the change in the reportable segments in the fourth quarter of 2010, we also changed our calculation of Core Earnings. When our FFELP Loan portfolio was growing, management and our investors valued it based on recurring income streams. Given the uncertain and volatile nature of unhedged Floor Income, little future value was attributed to it by the financial markets; therefore, we excluded unhedged Floor Income from Core Earnings. Now that our FFELP Loan portfolio is amortizing down, management and investors are focused on the total amount of cash the FFELP Loan portfolio generates, including unhedged Floor Income. As a result, we now include unhedged Floor Income in Core Earnings and have recast past Core Earnings financial results to reflect this change. The effect of including unhedged Floor Income, net of tax, on Core Earnings was an increase of $21 million, $210 million and $57 million for the years ending December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

This was primarily the result of a significant reduction in the cost of our ABCP Facility, a 24 basis point improvement in the CP/LIBOR Spread and a significantly higher margin on the loans within the EDs Loan Participation Purchase Program (the Participation Program) facility compared to the prior year. As of December 31, 2010, our FFELP Loan portfolio totaled approximately $149 billion, comprised of $56 billion of FFELP Stafford and $93 billion of FFELP Consolidation Loans. The weighted average life of these portfolios is 4.9 years and 9.4 years, respectively, assuming a CPR of 6 percent and 3 percent, respectively. On December 31, 2010, we closed on our agreement to purchase an interest in $26.1 billion of securitized federal student loans and related assets from the Student Loan Corporation (SLC), a subsidiary of Citibank, N.A. The purchase price was approximately $1.1 billion. The assets purchased include the residual interest in 13 of SLCs 14 FFELP loan securitizations and its interest in SLC Funding Note Issuer related to the U.S. Department of Educations Straight A Funding asset backed commercial paper conduit. We will also service these assets and administer the securitization trusts. However, SLC will subservice these trusts on our behalf in 2011 until we transition these functions to our own servicing platform during the latter part of 2011. Because we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of these trusts we have consolidated these trusts onto our balance sheet. In addition, we contracted the right to service approximately $0.8 billion of additional FFELP securitized assets from SLC. (We did not consolidate this underlying trust because we are not the primary beneficiary of this trust.) The purchase was funded by a 5 year term loan provided by Citibank in an amount equal to the purchase price. See Note 3 Student Loans and Note 7 Borrowings for additional details regarding assets and terms of funding. 44 Floor Income Core Earnings Basis The following table analyzes the ability of the FFELP Loans in our Core Earnings portfolio to earn Floor Income after December 31, 2010 and 2009, based on interest rates as of those dates.

The following table presents a projection of the average Core Earnings basis balance of FFELP Consolidation Loans for which Fixed Rate Floor Income has been economically hedged through Floor Income Contracts for the period January 1, 2011 to March 31, 2014. The hedges related to these loans do not qualify as effective hedges. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in billions) 2011 2012 2013 2014 Average balance of FFELP Consolidation Loans whose Floor Income is economically hedged $ 28.8 $ 20.6 $ 5.6 $ .2 FFELP Provisions for Loan Losses and Loan Charge Offs The following tables summarize the total FFELP provisions for loan losses and FFELP Loan charge offs on both a GAAP basis and a Core Earnings basis for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 FFELP provisions for loan losses: Total GAAP basis $ 98 $ 106 $ 106 Total Core Earnings basis 98 119 127 FFELP loan charge offs: Total GAAP basis $ 87 $ 79 $ 58 Total Core Earnings basis 87 94 79 45 Servicing Revenue and Other Income FFELP Loans Segment The following table summarizes the components of Core Earnings other income for our FFELP Loans segment for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Servicing revenue $ 68 $ 75 $ 77 Gains (losses) on sales of loans and securities, net 325 284 (51 ) Other (5 ) 8 9 Total other income, net $ 388 $ 367 $ 35 Servicing revenue for our FFELP Loans segment primarily consists of borrower late fees. The gains on sales of loans and securities in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, related primarily to the sale of $20.4 billion and $18.5 billion loans, respectively, of FFELP Loans to ED as part of the ED Purchase Program. The loss in 2008 primarily relates to the sale of approximately $1.0 billion of FFELP Loans to the ED under ECASLA, which resulted in a $53 million loss. Operating Expenses FFELP Loans Segment Operating expenses for our FFELP Loans segment primarily include the contractual rates we are paid to service loans in term asset backed securitization trusts or a similar rate if a loan is not in a term financing facility, the fees we pay for third party loan servicing and costs incurred to acquire loans. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, operating expenses for our FFELP Loans segment totaled $736 million, $754 million and $745 million, respectively. The intercompany revenue charged from the Business Services segment and included in those amounts was $648 million, $659 million and $632 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. These amounts exceed the actual cost of servicing the loans. 2010 versus 2009 Operating expenses decreased $18 million from the prior year, primarily due to the effect of our cost cutting initiative in connection with the passage of HCERA. This was partially offset by a one time fee paid to acquire the SLC portfolio, an increase in legal contingency expenses and costs related to closing and selling two loan originations centers in 2010. Operating expenses, excluding restructuring related asset impairments, were 51 basis points and 50 basis points of average Core Earnings basis FFELP Loans in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 2009 versus 2008 Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009, increased $9 million from the prior year primarily due to an increase in our servicing expense as a result of an $8 billion increase in the average balance of our FFELP Loan portfolio. 46 Consumer Lending Segment The following table includes Core Earnings results for our Consumer Lending segment. Years Ended December 31, % Increase (Decrease) (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Core Earnings interest income: Private Education Loans $ 2,353 $ 2,254 $ 2,752 4 % (18 )% Cash and investments 14 13 79 8 (84 ) Total Core Earnings interest income 2,367 2,267 2,831 4 (20 ) Total Core Earnings interest expense 758 721 1,280 5 (44 ) Net Core Earnings interest income 1,609 1,546 1,551 4 Less: provisions for loan losses 1,298 1,399 874 (7 ) 60 Net Core Earnings interest income after provisions for loan losses 311 147 677 112 (78 ) Servicing revenue 72 70 65 3 8 Other income 1 (100 ) Direct operating expenses: Sales and origination 125 81 67 54 21 Servicing 60 47 36 28 31 Collections 94 90 67 4 34 Information technology 68 52 23 31 126 Other 3 (5 ) 8 160 (163 ) Total direct operating expenses 350 265 201 32 32 Restructuring expenses 12 2 25 500 (92 ) Total expenses 362 267 226 36 18 Income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit) 21 (50 ) 517 142 (110 ) Income tax expense (benefit) 8 (18 ) 186 144 (110 ) Core Earnings (loss) $ 13 $ (32 ) $ 331 (141 )% (110 )% 47 Consumer Lending Core Earnings Net Interest Margin The following table shows the Consumer Lending Core Earnings net interest margin along with a reconciliation to the GAAP basis Consumer Lending net interest margin before provisions for loan losses.

The decrease in the net interest margin from 2008 to 2009 was primarily a result of a higher costs of funds due to the extreme turmoil in the capital markets. Private Education Loans Provisions for Loan Losses and Loan Charge Offs The following tables summarize the total Private Education Loans provisions for loan losses and charge offs on both a GAAP basis and a Core Earnings basis for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Private Education Loans provision for loan losses: Total GAAP basis $ 1,298 $ 967 $ 586 Total Core Earnings basis 1,298 1,399 874 Private Education Loans charge offs: Total GAAP basis $ 1,291 $ 876 $ 320 Total Core Earnings basis 1,291 1,299 473 The 2010 Core Earnings basis provision expense and charge offs are down from 2009 as the portfolios credit performance continued to improve since the weakening in the U.S. economy that began in 2008. The Private Education Loan portfolio experienced a significant increase in delinquencies through the first quarter of 2009 (delinquencies as a percentage of loans in repayment were 13.4 percent at March 31, 2009); however, delinquencies as a percentage of loans in repayment have now declined to 10.6 percent at December 31, 2010. Core Earnings basis Private Education Loan delinquencies as a percentage of loans in repayment decreased from 12.1 percent to 10.6 percent from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010. Core Earnings Private Education Loans in forbearance as a percentage of loans in repayment and forbearance decreased from 5.5 percent at December 31, 2009 to 4.6 percent at December 31, 2010. The Core Earnings basis Private 48 Education Loan allowance coverage of annual charge offs ratio was 1.6 at December 31, 2010 compared with 1.5 at December 31, 2009. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of ending Private Education Loans in repayment decreased from 8.1 percent at December 31, 2009 to 7.3 percent at December 31, 2010. We analyzed changes in the key ratios disclosed in the tables above when determining the appropriate Private Education Loan allowance for loan losses. Servicing Revenue and Other Income Consumer Lending Segment Servicing revenue for our Consumer Lending segment primarily includes late fees and forbearance fees. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, servicing revenue for our Consumer Lending segment totaled $72 million, $70 million and $65 million, respectively. Operating Expenses Consumer Lending Segment Operating expenses for our Consumer Lending segment include costs incurred to originate Private Education Loans and to service and collect on our Core Earnings basis Private Education Loan portfolio. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, operating expenses for our Consumer Lending segment totaled $350 million, $265 million and $201 million, respectively. 2010 versus 2009 Operating expenses increased $85 million from 2009, primarily as the result of a non recurring $11 million benefit in 2009 related to reversing a contingency reserve, an increase in collection and servicing costs from a higher number of loans in repayment and delinquency status and higher marketing and technology enhancement costs related to Private Education Loans in 2010. Operating expenses, excluding restructuring related asset impairments, were 96 basis points and 74 basis points, respectively, of average Core Earnings basis Private Education Loans in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. 2009 versus 2008 Operating expenses increased $64 million from 2008, primarily as a result of an increase in collection and servicing costs from a higher number of loans in repayment and delinquency status and higher marketing and technology enhancement costs related to Private Education Loans in 2009. Operating expenses, excluding restructuring related asset impairments, were 74 basis points and 61 basis points, respectively, of average Core Earnings basis Private Education Loans in the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. 49 Business Services Segment The following tables include Core Earnings results for our Business Services segment. Years Ended December 31, % Increase (Decrease) (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Net interest income after provision $ 17 $ 20 $ 26 (15 )% (23 )% Servicing revenue: Intercompany loan servicing 648 659 632 (2 ) 4 Third party loan servicing 77 53 26 45 104 Account asset servicing 68 62 61 10 2 Campus Payment Solutions 26 28 26 (7 ) 8 Guarantor servicing 93 152 152 (39 ) Total servicing revenue 912 954 897 (4 ) 6 Contingency revenue 330 294 330 12 (11 ) Transaction fees 48 50 48 (4 ) 4 Other 3 5 4 (40 ) 25 Total other income 1,293 1,303 1,279 (1 ) 2 Direct operating expenses: Sales and originations 22 36 47 (39 ) (23 ) Servicing 191 162 158 18 3 Collections 183 157 197 17 (20 ) Information technology 81 85 60 (5 ) 42 Other 23 100 Total direct operating expenses 500 440 462 14 (5 ) Restructuring expenses 7 2 10 250 (80 ) Total expenses 507 442 472 15 (6 ) Income from continuing operations, before income tax expense 803 881 833 (9 ) 6 Income tax expense 288 311 300 (7 ) 4 Core Earnings $ 515 $ 570 $ 533 (10 )% 7 % Our Business Services segment earns intercompany loan servicing fees from servicing the FFELP Loans in our FFELP Loans segment. The average balance of this portfolio was $127 billion, $135 billion and $125 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease from 2009 to 2010 is primarily the result of the amortization of the underlying portfolio as well as the $20.4 billion of FFELP Loans sold to ED in October 2010. We are servicing approximately 3.3 million accounts under the ED Servicing Contract as of December 31, 2010. The increase in third party loan servicing revenue in 2010 is the result of the increase in the loans we are servicing under the ED Servicing Contract. Loan servicing fees in 2010 and 2009 included $44 million and $9 million, respectively, of servicing revenue related to the loans we are servicing under the ED Servicing Contract. Account asset servicing revenue represents fees earned on program management, transfer and servicing agent services and administration services for our various 529 college savings plans. Campus Payment Solutions revenue is earned from our Campus Payment Solutions business whose services include comprehensive financing and transaction processing solutions that we provide to college financial aid offices and students to streamline the financial aid process. 50 The decrease in Guarantor servicing revenue compared with the year ago period was primarily due to HCERA being effective as of July 1, 2010, our no longer earning Guarantor issuance fees and the lower balance of outstanding FFELP Loans on which we earn other fees. In 2010, contingency revenue increased $36 million from 2009 due to an increase in collections on defaulted FFELP Loans. Contingency revenue decreased in 2009 from 2008 as the result of significantly less Guarantor collections revenue associated with rehabilitating delinquent FFELP Loans. Loans are considered rehabilitated after a certain number of on time payments have been collected. We earn a rehabilitation fee only when the Guarantor sells the rehabilitated loan. The disruption in the credit markets limited the sale of rehabilitated loans. The following table presents the outstanding inventory of contingent collections receivables that our Business Services segment will collect on behalf of others. As of December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Contingency: Student loans $ 10,362 $ 8,762 $ 9,852 Other 1,730 1,262 1,726 Total $ 12,092 $ 10,024 $ 11,578 Transaction fees are earned in conjunction with our rewards program from participating companies based on member purchase activity, either online or in stores, depending on the contractual arrangement with the participating company. Typically, a percentage of the purchase price of the consumer members eligible purchases with participating companies is set aside in an account maintained by us on behalf of our members. Revenues related to services performed on FFELP Loans accounted for 78 percent, 79 percent and 79 percent, respectively, of total segment revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Operating Expenses Business Services Segment For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, operating expenses for the Business Services segment totaled $500 million, $440 million and $462 million, respectively. 2010 versus 2009 Operating expenses increased $60 million from 2009 to 2010 primarily due to higher technology and other expenses related to preparation for higher volumes for the ED Servicing Contract as well as an increase in legal contingency expenses. 2009 versus 2008 Operating expenses decreased $22 million in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to our cost reduction initiatives. Other Segment The Other segment primarily consists of the financial results related to the repurchase of debt, the corporate liquidity portfolio and all overhead. We also include results from smaller wind down and discontinued operations within this segment. These are the Purchased Paper businesses and mortgage and other loan businesses. The Other segment includes our remaining businesses that do not pertain directly to the primary segments identified above. Overhead expenses include costs related to executive management, the board of directors, accounting, finance, legal, human resources, stock option expense and certain information technology costs related to infrastructure and operations. 51 The following table includes Core Earnings results for our Other segment. Years Ended December 31, % Increase (Decrease) (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Net interest loss after provision $ (35 ) $ (66 ) $ (11 ) (47 )% 500 % Gains on debt repurchases 317 536 64 (41 ) 738 Other 14 1 15 1,300 (93 ) Total income 331 537 79 (38 ) 580 Direct operating expenses: Servicing 9 6 17 50 (65 ) Other 3 100 Total direct operating expenses 12 6 17 100 (65 ) Overhead expenses: Corporate overhead 128 138 150 (7 ) (8 ) Unallocated information technology costs 130 99 86 31 15 Total overhead expenses 258 237 236 9 Total operating expenses 270 243 253 11 (4 ) Restructuring expenses 12 (2 ) (5 ) 700 60 Total expenses 282 241 248 17 (3 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations, before income tax expense (benefit) 14 230 (180 ) (94 ) 228 Income tax expense (benefit) 4 81 (65 ) (95 ) 225 Net income (loss) from continuing operations 10 149 (115 ) (93 ) 230 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (67 ) (220 ) (188 ) (70 ) 17 Core Earnings net loss $ (57 ) $ (71 ) $ (303 ) (20 )% (77 )% Purchased Paper Business In 2008, we concluded that our Purchased Paper businesses were no longer a strategic fit. The businesses are presented in discontinued operations for the current and prior periods. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we sold our Purchased Paper Mortgage/Properties business for $280 million, which resulted in an after tax loss of $95 million. In the fourth quarter of 2010 we began actively marketing our Purchased Paper Non Mortgage business for sale. We have concluded it is probable this business will be sold within one year and, as a result, the results of operations of this business were presented in discontinued operations beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010. In connection with this classification, we are required to carry this business at the lower of fair value or historical cost basis. This resulted in us recording an after tax loss of $52 million from discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2010, primarily due to adjusting the value of this business to its estimated fair value. The following table summarizes the carrying value of the Purchased Paper Non Mortgage portfolio: December 31, December 31, December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Carrying value of purchased paper $ 95 $ 285 $ 544 52 Gains on Debt Repurchases We began repurchasing our outstanding debt in the second quarter of 2008. We repurchased $4.9 billion, $3.4 billion and $1.9 billion face amount of our senior unsecured notes for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Since the second quarter of 2008, we repurchased $10.2 billion face amount of our senior unsecured notes in the aggregate, with maturity dates ranging from 2008 to 2016. Mortgage and Other Loans Also included in this segment are our mortgage and other loan portfolios, which totaled $271 million at December 31, 2010. We are no longer originating mortgage and other loans. Overhead Corporate overhead is comprised of costs related to executive management, the board of directors, accounting, finance, legal, human resources and stock option expense. Information technology costs are related to infrastructure and operations. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, operating expenses for the Other segment totaled $270 million, $243 million and $253 million, respectively. 2010 versus 2009 Operating expenses increased $27 million from 2009 to 2010. This increase in corporate overhead was primarily attributable to increased technology costs associated with disaster recovery modernization, enterprise architecture and information security upgrades. 53 Financial Condition This section provides additional information regarding the changes related to our loan portfolio assets and related liabilities as well as credit performance indicators related to our loan portfolio. Many of these disclosures will show both GAAP basis as well as Core Earnings basis disclosures. Because certain trusts were not consolidated prior to the adoption of the new consolidation accounting guidance on January 1, 2010, these trusts were treated as off balance sheet for GAAP purposes but we considered them on balance sheet for Core Earnings purposes. Subsequent to the adoption of the new consolidation accounting guidance on January 1, 2010, this difference no longer exists because all of our trusts are treated as on balance sheet for GAAP purposes. Below and elsewhere in the document, Core Earnings basis disclosures include all historically (pre January 1, 2010) off balance sheet trusts as though they were on balance sheet. We believe that providing Core Earnings basis disclosures is meaningful because when we evaluate the performance and risk characteristics of the Company we have always considered the effect of any off balance sheet trusts as though they were on balance sheet. Average Balance Sheets GAAP The following table reflects the rates earned on interest earning assets and paid on interest bearing liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Delinquencies have the potential to adversely impact earnings as they are an indication of the borrowers potential to possibly default and as a result require a higher loan loss reserve than loans in current status. Delinquent loans also require increased servicing and collection efforts, resulting in higher operating costs.

Delinquencies have the potential to adversely impact earnings as they are an indication of the borrowers potential to possibly default and as a result require a higher loan loss reserve than loans in current status. Delinquent loans also require increased servicing and collection efforts, resulting in higher operating costs.

Use of Forbearance as a Private Education Loan Collection Tool Forbearance involves granting the borrower a temporary cessation of payments (or temporary acceptance of smaller than scheduled payments) for a specified period of time. Using forbearance extends the original term of the loan. Forbearance does not grant any reduction in the total repayment obligation (principal or interest). While in forbearance status, interest continues to accrue and is capitalized to principal when the loan re enters repayment status. Our forbearance policies include limits on the number of forbearance months granted consecutively and the total number of forbearance months granted over the life of the loan. In some instances, we require good faith payments before granting forbearance. Exceptions to forbearance policies are permitted when such exceptions are judged to increase the likelihood of collection of the loan. Forbearance as a collection tool is used most effectively when applied based on a borrowers unique situation, including historical information and judgments. We leverage updated borrower information and other decision support tools to best determine who will be granted forbearance based on our expectations as to a borrowers ability and willingness to repay their obligation. This strategy is aimed at mitigating the overall risk of the portfolio as well as encouraging cash resolution of delinquent loans. Forbearance may be granted to borrowers who are exiting their grace period to provide additional time to obtain employment and income to support their obligations, or to current borrowers who are faced with a hardship and request forbearance time to provide temporary payment relief. In these circumstances, a borrowers loan is placed into a forbearance status in limited monthly increments and is reflected in the forbearance status at month end during this time. At the end of their granted forbearance period, the borrower 70 will enter repayment status as current and is expected to begin making their scheduled monthly payments on a go forward basis. Forbearance may also be granted to borrowers who are delinquent in their payments. In these circumstances, the forbearance cures the delinquency and the borrower is returned to a current repayment status. In more limited instances, delinquent borrowers will also be granted additional forbearance time. As we have obtained further experience about the effectiveness of forbearance, we have reduced the amount of time a loan will spend in forbearance, thereby increasing our ongoing contact with the borrower to encourage consistent repayment behavior once the loan is returned to a current repayment status. As a result, the balance of loans in a forbearance status as of month end has decreased since 2008. In addition, the monthly average number of loans granted forbearance as a percentage of loans in repayment and forbearance declined to 5.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with the year ago quarter of 5.6 percent. As of December 31, 2010, 2.4 percent of loans in current status were delinquent as of the end of the prior month, but were granted a forbearance that made them current as of December 31, 2010 (borrowers made payments on approximately 20 percent of these loans prior to being granted forbearance). The table below reflects the historical effectiveness of using forbearance. Our experience has shown that three years after being granted forbearance for the first time, 68 percent of the loans are current, paid in full, or receiving an in school grace or deferment, and 17 percent have defaulted. The default experience associated with loans which utilize forbearance is considered in our allowance for loan losses. Tracking by First Time in Forbearance Compared to All Loans Entering Repayment Status distribution Status distribution 36 months after Status distribution 36 months after being granted 36 months after entering repayment for forbearance entering repayment loans never entering for the first time (all loans) forbearance In school/grace/deferment 9.2 % 8.5 % 4.1 % Current 50.2 57.4 64.1 Delinquent 31 60 days 3.1 2.0 0.4 Delinquent 61 90 days 1.9 1.1 0.2 Delinquent greater than 90 days 4.8 2.7 0.3 Forbearance 4.7 3.5 Defaulted 17.4 9.1 4.8 Paid 8.7 15.7 26.1 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 71 The tables below show the composition and status of the Core Earnings basis Private Education Loan portfolio aged by number of months in active repayment status (months for which a scheduled monthly payment was due). As indicated in the tables, the percentage of loans in forbearance status decreases the longer the loans have been in active repayment status. At December 31, 2010, loans in forbearance status as a percentage of loans in repayment and forbearance were 6.2 percent for loans that have been in active repayment status for less than 25 months. The percentage drops to 1.9 percent for loans that have been in active repayment status for more than 48 months. Approximately 79 percent of our Core Earnings basis Private Education Loans in forbearance status has been in active repayment status less than 25 months.

Private Education Loan Repayment Options Certain loan programs allow borrowers to select from a variety of repayment options depending on their loan type and their enrollment/loan status, which include the ability to extend their repayment term or change their monthly payment. The chart below provides the optional repayment offerings in addition to the standard level principal and interest payments as of December 31, 2010.

The graduated repayment program that is part of Signature and Other Loans includes an interest only payment option. This program is available to borrowers in repayment, after their grace period, who would like a temporary lower payment from the required principal and interest payment amount. Borrowers participating in this program pay monthly interest with no amortization of their principal balance for up to 48 payments after entering repayment (dependent on the loan product type). The maturity date of the loan is not extended when a borrower participates in this program. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, borrowers in repayment owing approximately $7.5 billion (27 percent of loans in repayment) and $7.0 billion (29 percent of loans in repayment), respectively, were enrolled in the interest only program. 74 Liquidity and Capital Resources Funding and Liquidity Risk Management The following Liquidity and Capital Resources discussion concentrates on our FFELP Loans and Consumer Lending segments. Our Business Services and Other segments need little capital. We define liquidity risk as the potential inability to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations, on or off balance sheet, as they come due, as well as the potential inability to originate Private Education Loans. Our primary liquidity objective is to ensure our ongoing ability to meet our funding needs for our businesses throughout market cycles, including during periods of financial stress. Our two primary liquidity needs are funding the originations of Private Education Loans and retiring unsecured debt when it matures. To achieve that objective we analyze and monitor our liquidity needs, maintain excess liquidity and access diverse funding sources including the issuance of unsecured debt, the issuance of secured debt primarily through asset backed securitizations and or financing facilities and through deposits at Sallie Mae Bank (the Bank), our Utah industrial bank subsidiary. We define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high quality liquid unencumbered securities, that we can use to meet our funding requirements as those obligations arise. Our primary liquidity risk relates to our ability to fund new originations and raise replacement funding at a reasonable cost as our unsecured debt matures. In addition, we must continue to obtain funding at reasonable rates to meet our other business obligations and to continue to grow our business. Key risks associated with our liquidity relates to our ability to access the capital markets and access them at reasonable rates. This ability may be affected by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions, including over the counter derivatives. Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions subject to ongoing review by the ratings agencies and may change from time to time based on our financial performance, industry dynamics and other factors. Other factors that influence our credit ratings include the ratings agencies assessment of the general operating environment, our relative positions in the markets in which we compete, reputation, liquidity position, the level and volatility of earnings, corporate governance and risk management policies, capital position and capital management practices. A negative change in our credit rating could have a negative effect on our liquidity because it would raise the cost and availability of funding and potentially require additional cash collateral or restrict cash currently held as collateral on existing borrowings or derivative collateral arrangements. It is our objective to improve our credit ratings so that we can continue to access the capital markets even in difficult economic and market conditions. We expect to fund our ongoing liquidity needs, including the origination of new Private Education Loans and the repayment of $4.4 billion of senior unsecured notes to mature in the next twelve months, primarily through our current cash and investment position and very predictable operating cash flows provided by earnings and repayment of principal on unencumbered student loan assets, distributions from our securitization trusts (including servicing fees which are priority payments within the trusts), as well as drawdowns under the 2010 ABCP Facility, the issuance of term ABS, the collection of additional term bank deposits and the issuance of unsecured debt. We primarily fund our student loan originations at the Bank. Currently, new Private Education Loan originations are initially funded through deposits. We plan to subsequently securitize these loans to term on a programmatic basis. We currently have $2 billion of cash at the Bank available to fund future originations. We no longer originate FFELP Loans and therefore no longer have liquidity requirements for new FFELP Loan originations. In 2009, we began using the ED Conduit Program (see ED Funding Programs of this Item 7 for a discussion of this program) to fund older FFELP Stafford and PLUS Loans. In addition, in 2008 we began funding new FFELP Stafford and PLUS Loan originations for AY 2008 2009 pursuant to EDs Loan Purchase Commitment Program (the Purchase Program) and Loan Participation Purchase Program (the Participation Program).We discuss these liquidity sources below. 75 We continued to use EDs Purchase and Participation Programs to fund FFELP Stafford and PLUS Loans disbursed through September 30, 2010 (see Item 1 Business Recent Legislation for a further discussion regarding the end of new FFELP Loan originations as of July 1, 2010). Primary Sources of Liquidity and Available Capacity The following table details our main sources of primary liquidity and the available capacity at December 31, 2010 and 2009. December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 (Dollars in millions) Available Capacity Available Capacity Sources of primary liquidity for general corporate purposes: Unrestricted cash and liquid investments: Cash and cash equivalents $ 4,342 $ 6,070 Commercial paper and asset backed commercial paper 1,150 Other 85 131 Total unrestricted cash and liquid investments(1)(2)(3) 4,427 7,351 Unused commercial paper and bank lines of credit(4) 3,485 Available borrowings to the extent collateral exists: FFELP ABCP facilities(5) 3,937 1,703 FHLB DM facility(5) 8,664 Total sources of primary liquidity for general corporate purposes(6) $ 17,028 $ 12,539 (1) At December 31, 2010 and 2009, excludes $0 and $25 million, respectively, of investments pledged as collateral related to certain derivative positions and $872 million and $708 million, respectively, of other non liquid investments, classified as investments on our balance sheet in accordance with GAAP. (2) At December 31, 2010 and 2009, includes $684 million and $821 million, respectively, of cash collateral pledged by derivative counterparties and held in our unrestricted cash. (3) At December 31, 2010 and 2009, includes $2.0 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, of cash and liquid investments at the Bank. This cash will be used primarily to originate or acquire student loans. (4) On November 24, 2010, our remaining bank line of credit was retired. (5) Borrowing capacity is subject to availability of collateral. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had $1.5 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, of outstanding unencumbered FFELP Loans, net, available for use in either the FFELP ABCP facilities or FHLB DM facility. (6) General corporate purposes primarily include originating Private Education Loans and repaying unsecured debt as it matures. In addition to the assets listed in the table above, we hold a number of other unencumbered assets, consisting primarily of Private Education Loans and other assets. At December 31, 2010, we had a total of $22.3 billion of unencumbered assets, excluding goodwill and acquired intangibles. Total student loans, net, comprised $12.6 billion of this unencumbered asset total, of which $11.1 billion are Private Education Loans, net, and $1.5 billion are FFELP Loans, net. 76 The following table reconciles encumbered and unencumbered assets and their net impact on total tangible equity. December 31, December 31, (Dollars in billions) 2010 2009 Net assets of consolidated variable interest entities $ 13.1 $ 12.7 Tangible unencumbered assets(2) 22.3 30.1 Unsecured debt (26.9 ) (35.1 ) Mark to market on unsecured hedged debt(1) (1.4 ) (1.9 ) Other liabilities, net (2.6 ) (1.7 ) Total tangible equity $ 4.5 $ 4.1 (1) At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, there were $1.4 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, of net gains on derivatives hedging this debt in unencumbered assets, which partially offset these losses. (2) Excludes goodwill and acquired intangible assets. ED Funding Programs Pursuant to ECASLA, in 2009, ED published summary terms under which it will purchase eligible FFELP Stafford and PLUS Loans from a conduit vehicle established to provide funding for eligible student lenders (the ED Conduit Program). Loans eligible for the ED Conduit Program must be first disbursed on or after October 1, 2003, but not later than July 1, 2009, and fully disbursed before September 30, 2009, and meet certain other requirements, including those relating to borrower benefits. The ED Conduit Program was launched in May 2009 and accepted eligible loans through July 1, 2010. The ED Conduit Program expires on January 19, 2014. Funding for the ED Conduit Program is provided by the capital markets at a cost based on market rates, with advance rates of 97 percent of the student loan face amount. If the conduit does not have sufficient funds to make the required payments on the notes issued by the conduit, then the notes will be repaid with funds from the Federal Financing Bank (FFB). The FFB will hold the notes for a short period of time and, if at the end of that time, the notes still cannot be paid off, the underlying FFELP Loans that serve as collateral to the ED Conduit will be sold to ED through a put agreement at a price of 97 percent of the face amount of the loans. As of December 31, 2010, approximately $24.2 billion face amount of our Stafford and PLUS Loans were funded through the ED Conduit Program. Our intent is to term securitize the loans that are in this facility before the facility expires on January 19, 2014. We are exposed to the risk associated with this program ending in 2014. The amount of loans exposed to this refinance risk will decline over time as the loans pay down. If we are not able to successfully refinance the loans before the facility expires, we will sell them to ED at a price of 97 percent of face value. In 2008, ED implemented the Participation Program pursuant to ECASLA. In October 2010, we sold $20.4 billion of loans to ED and paid off $20.3 billion of advances outstanding under the Participation Program. This program is no longer in effect and is not available as a funding source. Sallie Mae Bank In 2008, the Bank began expanding its deposit base to fund new Private Education Loan originations. The Bank raises deposits through intermediaries in the retail brokered Certificate of Deposit (CD) market and through direct retail deposit channels. As of December 31, 2010, total bank deposits were $5.9 billion, of which $4.5 billion were brokered deposits and $1.4 billion were retail and other deposits. Cash and liquid investments totaled $2.0 billion. In addition to its deposit base, the Bank has borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) through a collateralized lending facility. Borrowing capacity is limited by the availability of acceptable collateral. As of December 31, 2010, borrowing capacity was approximately $650 million and there were no outstanding borrowings. 77 ABS Transactions In early 2009, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York initiated a program, The Term Asset Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF), to facilitate renewed issuance of eligible consumer and small business ABS with a term of up to five years. For student loan collateral, TALF expired on March 31, 2010. During the program, we completed five transactions totaling $7.5 billion which were TALF eligible. Under this program we have $5.3 billion of ABS outstanding where we have the option to call the bonds at a discount between 2011 and 2014. In 2010, we completed three Private Education Loan ABS transactions totaling $4.1 billion. In 2010, we completed two FFELP long term ABS transactions totaling $2.0 billion. Although we have demonstrated our continued access to the ABS market and we expect ABS financing to remain a primary source of funding over the long term, we also expect our transaction volumes to be more limited and pricing less favorable than prior to the credit market dislocation that began in the summer of 2007, with significantly reduced opportunities to place subordinated tranches of ABS with investors. Asset Backed Financing (ABCP) Facilities In early 2008, we entered into two new asset backed financing facilities (the 2008 Asset Backed Financing Facilities) to fund FFELP Loans. In 2009, the FFELP facilities were subsequently amended and reduced and in early 2010 we terminated these facilities and entered into new multi year ABCP facilities (the 2010 Facility) which will continue to provide funding for our federally guaranteed student loans. The 2010 Facility provides for maximum funding of $10 billion for the first year, $5 billion for the second year and $2 billion for the third year. The underlying cost of borrowing under the 2010 Facility for the first year is expected to be commercial paper issuance cost plus 0.50 percent, excluding up front commitment and unused fees. Borrowings under the 2010 Facility are non recourse and the maximum amount we may borrow under the 2010 Facility is limited based on certain factors, including market conditions and the fair value of student loans in the facility. The 2010 Facility is subject to termination under certain circumstances. The principal financial covenants in this facility require us to maintain consolidated tangible net worth of at least $1.38 billion at all times. Consolidated tangible net worth as calculated for purposes of this covenant was $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2010. The covenants also require us to meet either a minimum interest coverage ratio or a minimum net adjusted revenue test based on the four preceding quarters adjusted Core Earnings financial performance. We were compliant with both of the minimum interest coverage ratio and the minimum net adjusted revenue tests as of the quarter ended December 31, 2010. Increases in the borrowing rate of up to LIBOR plus 4.50 percent could occur if certain asset coverage ratio thresholds are not met. Failure to pay off the 2010 Facility on the maturity date or to reduce amounts outstanding below the annual maximum step downs will result in a 90 day extension of the 2010 Facility with the interest rate increasing from LIBOR plus 2.00 percent to LIBOR plus 3.00 percent over that period. If, at the end of the 90 day extension, these required paydown amounts have not been made, the collateral can be foreclosed. As of December 31, 2010, there was approximately $5.9 billion outstanding in this facility. The book basis of the assets securing this facility at December 31, 2010 was $6.4 billion. On January 14, 2011, we amended the 2010 Asset Backed Financing Facility, which will continue to provide funding for our federally guaranteed student loans, expanding the size and extending the maturity. The facility amount is now $7.5 billion, reflecting an increase of $2.5 billion over the previously scheduled facility reduction. The facility size will decrease by $2.5 billion annually with a scheduled maturity date of January 10, 2014. Federal Home Loan Bank in Des Moines (FHLB DM) In early 2010, HICA Education Loan Corporation (HICA), a subsidiary of the Company, entered into a lending agreement with the FHLB DM. Under the agreement, the FHLB DM will provide advances backed by Federal Housing Finance Agency approved collateral which includes federally guaranteed student loans (but does not include Private Education Loans). The amount, price and tenor of future advances will vary and be subject to the agreements borrowing conditions as then in effect determined at the time of each borrowing. The maximum amount that can be borrowed, as of December 31, 2010, subject to available collateral, is approximately $9.6 billion. As of December 31, 2010, borrowing under the facility totaled $900 million and was secured by $1.2 billion of 78 FFELP Loans. We have provided a guarantee to the FHLB DM for the performance and payment of HICAs obligations. Senior Unsecured Debt We issue unsecured debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve cost efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile. While the cost and availability of unsecured funding may be negatively affected by general market conditions or by matters specific to the financial services industry or Sallie Mae, we seek to mitigate refinancing risk by actively managing the amount of our borrowings that we anticipate will mature within any month, quarter or year. Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions (other than a change in control would allow $4 billion of these obligations as of December 31, 2010, to be put at 101 percent) that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity, or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price. We issue unsecured debt when the pricing for the term of the debt is favorable relative to our other funding options and our overall liquidity position. In 2010 we issued $1.5 billion of unsecured debt maturing in 2020 and an all in cost of LIBOR plus 4.65 percent. On January 11, 2011, we announced and priced a $2 billion five year 6.25 percent fixed rate unsecured bond. The bond was issued to yield 6.50 percent before underwriting fees. The rate on the bond was swapped from a fixed rate to a floating rate equal to an all in cost of one month LIBOR plus 4.46 percent. The proceeds of this bond will be used for general corporate purposes. We also repurchase our outstanding unsecured debt in both open market repurchases and public tender offers. Repurchasing debt helps us better manage our short term and long term funding needs. In 2010 we repurchased $4.9 billion face amount of our senior unsecured notes in the aggregate, with maturity dates ranging from 2010 to 2014, which resulted in a total gain of $317 million. Counterparty Exposure Counterparty exposure related to financial instruments arises from the risk that a lending, investment or derivative counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations to us. Risks associated with our lending portfolio are discussed in Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition FFELP Loan Portfolio Performance and Consumer Lending Portfolio Performance. Our investment portfolio is composed of very short term securities issued by highly rated issuers limiting our counterparty exposure. Additionally, our investing activity is governed by Board approved limits on the amount that is allowed to be invested with any one issuer based on the credit rating of the issuer, further minimizing our counterparty exposure. Counterparty credit risk is considered when valuing investments and considering impairment. Related to derivative transactions, protection against counterparty risk is generally provided by International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) Credit Support Annexes (CSAs). CSAs require a counterparty to post collateral if a potential default would expose the other party to a loss. All derivative contracts entered into by SLM Corporation and the Bank are covered under such agreements and require collateral to be exchanged based on the net fair value of derivatives with each counterparty. Our securitization trusts require collateral in all cases if the counterpartys credit rating is withdrawn or downgraded below a certain level. Additionally, securitizations involving foreign currency notes issued after November 2005 also require the counterparty to post collateral to the trust based on the fair value of the derivative, regardless of credit rating. The trusts are not required to post collateral to the counterparties. In all cases, our exposure is limited to the value of the derivative contracts in a gain position net of any collateral we are holding. We consider counterparties credit risk when determining the fair value of derivative positions on our exposure net of collateral. 79 We have liquidity exposure related to collateral movements between us and our derivative counterparties. Movements in the value of the derivatives, which are primarily affected by changes in interest rate and foreign exchange rates, may require us to return cash collateral held or may require us to access primary liquidity to post collateral to counterparties. If our credit ratings are downgraded from current levels, we may be required to segregate unrestricted cash collateral into restricted accounts. The table below highlights exposure related to our derivative counterparties at December 31, 2010.

Timing of obligations is estimated based on our current projection of prepayment speeds of the securitized assets. (2) The aggregate principal amount of debt that matures in each period is $16.3 billion, $32.4 billion, $24.6 billion and $88.7 billion, respectively. Specifically excludes derivative market value adjustments of $2.6 billion for long term notes. Interest obligations on notes are predominantly variable in nature, resetting quarterly based on 3 month LIBOR. Unrecognized tax benefits were $39 million and $101 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. For additional information, see Note 18 Income Taxes. 81 Off Balance Sheet Lending Arrangements We have issued lending related financial instruments, including lines of credit, to meet the financing needs of our institutional customers. In connection with these agreements, we also enter into a participation agreement with the institution to participate in the loans as they are originated. In the event that a line of credit is drawn upon, the loan is collateralized by underlying student loans and is usually participated on the same day. The contractual amount of these financial instruments, $50 million at December 31, 2010, represents the maximum possible credit risk should the counterparty draw down the commitment, we do not participate in the loan, and the counterparty subsequently fails to perform according to the terms of our contract. The remaining total contractual amount available to be borrowed under these commitments is $50 million. All commitments mature in 2011. We do not believe that these instruments are representative of our actual future credit exposure; to the extent that the lines of credit are drawn upon, the balance outstanding is collateralized by student loans. At December 31, 2010, there were no outstanding draws on lines of credit. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations addresses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP). Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates its estimates, particularly those that include the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and are often about matters that are inherently uncertain. The most significant judgments, estimates and assumptions relate to the following critical accounting policies that are discussed in more detail below. Allowance for Loan Losses When calculating the allowance for loan loss for Private Education Loans we estimate the amount of our customers who will default over the next two years and how much we will recover over time related to the defaulted amount. Our historical experience indicates that, on average, the time between the date that a borrower experiences a default causing event (e.g., the loss trigger event) and the date that we charge off the unrecoverable portion of that loan is two years. In estimating the amount of defaults we expect to have over the next two years we divide the portfolio into categories of similar risk characteristics based on loan program type, school type, loan status (in school, grace, forbearance, repayment and delinquency), seasoning (number of months in active repayment for which a scheduled payment was due), underwriting criteria (credit scores), and existence or absence of a cosigner. The primary characteristics we use are school type, credit scores, cosigner status, loan status and seasoning. We start with historical experience of customer default behavior. We make judgments about which historical period to start with and then make further judgments about whether that historical experience is representative of future expectations and whether additional adjustment may be needed to those historical default rates. We also take into account the current and future economic environment when calculating the allowance for loan loss. We analyze key economic statistics and the effect they will have on future defaults. Key economic statistics analyzed as part of the allowance for loan loss are unemployment rates (total and specific to college graduates) and other asset type delinquency rates (credit cards, mortgages). Significantly more judgment has been required over the last three years, compared with years prior, in light of the U.S. economy and its effect on our customers ability to pay their obligations. In addition to making judgments about the amount of defaults that will occur over the next two years we also make judgments about how much we will subsequently recover from a defaulted customer and when that recovery will occur. Similar to estimating defaults, we begin with historical recovery performance when projecting future recoveries and use judgment in determining whether historical performance is representative of what we expect to recover in the future. 82 FFELP Loans are guaranteed as to their principal and accrued interest in the event of default subject to a Risk Sharing level based on the date of loan disbursement. For loans disbursed after October 1, 1993, and before July 1, 2006, we receive 98 percent reimbursement on all qualifying default claims. For loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2006, we receive 97 percent reimbursement. For loans disbursed prior to October 1, 1993, we receive 100 percent reimbursement. Similar to the allowance for Private Education Loan losses, the allowance for FFELP Loan losses uses historical experience of borrower default behavior and a two year loss confirmation period to estimate the credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio at the reporting date. We apply the default rate projections, net of applicable Risk Sharing, to each category for the current period to perform our quantitative calculation. Once the quantitative calculation is performed, we review the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and determine if qualitative adjustments need to be considered. Premium and Discount Amortization The most judgmental estimate for premium and discount amortization on student loans is the Constant Prepayment Rate (CPR), which measures the rate at which loans in the portfolio pay down principal compared to their stated terms. Loan consolidation, default, term extension and other prepayment factors affecting our CPR estimates are affected by changes in our business strategy, changes in our competitors business strategies, FFELP legislative changes, interest rates and changes to the current economic and credit environment. When we determine the CPR we begin with historical prepayment rates due to consolidation activity, defaults, payoffs and term extensions from the utilization of forbearance. We make judgments about which historical period to start with and then make further judgments about whether that historical experience is representative of future expectations and whether additional adjustment may be needed to those historical prepayment rates. In the past the consolidation of FFELP Loans and Private Education Loans significantly affected our CPRs and updating those assumptions often resulted in material adjustments to our amortization expense. As a result of the CCRAA and the current U.S. economic and credit environment, we, as well as many other industry competitors, have suspended our FFELP Loans consolidation program and Private Education Loans consolidation program. We do not expect to consolidate FFELP Loans in the future and do not currently expect others to actively consolidate our FFELP Loans. As a result, we expect CPRs related to our FFELP Loans to remain relatively stable over time. We expect that in the future both we and our competitors will begin to consolidate Private Education Loans. This is built into the CPR assumption we use for Private Education Loans. However, it is difficult to accurately project the timing and level at which this consolidation activity will begin and our assumption may need to be updated by a material amount in the future based on changes in the economy and marketplace. The level of defaults is a significant component of our FFELP Loan and Private Education Loan CPR. This component of the FFELP Loan and Private Education Loan CPR is estimated in the same manner as discussed in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Allowance for Loan Loss of this Item 7 the only difference is for premium and discount amortization purposes the estimate of defaults is a life of loan estimate whereas for allowance for loan loss it is a two year estimate. Fair Value Measurement The most significant assumptions used in fair value measurements, including those related to credit and liquidity risk, are as follows: 1. Investments Our investments primarily consist of overnight/weekly maturity instruments with high credit quality counterparties. However, we consider credit and liquidity risk involving specific instruments in determining their fair value and, when appropriate, have adjusted the fair value of these instruments for the effect of credit and liquidity risk. These assumptions have further been validated by the successful maturity of these investments in the period immediately following the end of the reporting period. 2. Derivatives When determining the fair value of derivatives, we take into account counterparty credit risk for positions where we are exposed to the counterparty on a net basis by assessing exposure net of collateral held. The net exposure for each counterparty is adjusted based on market 83 information available for that specific counterparty, including spreads from credit default swaps. Additionally, when the counterparty has exposure to us related to our derivatives, we fully collateralize the exposure, minimizing the adjustment necessary to the derivative valuations for our own credit risk. Trusts that contain derivatives are not required to post collateral to counterparties as the credit quality and securitized nature of the trusts minimizes any adjustments for the counterpartys exposure to the trusts. Adjustments related to credit risk reduced the overall value of our derivatives by $72 million as of December 31, 2010. We also take into account changes in liquidity when determining the fair value of derivative positions. We adjusted the fair value of certain less liquid positions downward by approximately $129 million to take into account a significant reduction in liquidity as of December 31, 2010, related primarily to basis swaps indexed to interest rate indices with inactive markets. A major indicator of market inactivity is the widening of the bid/ask spread in these markets. In general, the widening of counterparty credit spreads and reduced liquidity for derivative instruments as indicated by wider bid/ask spreads will reduce the fair value of derivatives. In addition, certain cross currency interest rate swaps hedging foreign currency denominated reset rate and amortizing notes in our on balance sheet trusts contain extension features that coincide with the remarketing dates of the notes. The valuation of the extension feature requires significant judgment based on internally developed inputs. 3. Student Loans Our FFELP Loans and Private Education Loans are accounted for at cost or at the lower of cost or fair value if the loan is held for sale. The fair values of our student loans are disclosed in Note 15 Fair Value Measurements. For both FFELP Loans and Private Education Loans accounted for at cost, fair value is determined by modeling loan level cash flows using stated terms of the assets and internally developed assumptions to determine aggregate portfolio yield, net present value and average life. The significant assumptions used to project cash flows are prepayment speeds, default rates, cost of funds, and required return on equity. In addition, the Floor Income component of our FFELP Loan portfolio is valued through discounted cash flow and option models using both observable market inputs and internally developed inputs. Significant inputs into the models are not generally market observable. They are either derived internally through a combination of historical experience and managements qualitative expectation of future performance (in the case of prepayment speeds, default rates, and capital assumptions) or are obtained through external broker quotes (as in the case of cost of funds). When possible, market transactions are used to validate the model. In most cases, these are either infrequent or not observable. For FFELP Loans classified as held for sale and accounted for at the lower of cost or market, the fair value is based on the committed sales price of the various loan purchase programs established by ED. For further information regarding the effect of our use of fair values on our results of operations, see Note 15 Fair Value Measurements. Transfers of Financial Assets and the Variable Interest Entity (VIE) Consolidation Model Changes in Accounting Principles effective January 1, 2010 The new consolidation accounting adopted on January 1, 2010 significantly changed the consolidation model for Variable Interest Entities (VIEs). This new rule, among other things, (1) eliminated the exemption for QSPEs, (2) provided a new approach for determining who should consolidate a VIE that is more focused on control rather than economic interest, (3) changed when it is necessary to reassess who should consolidate a VIE and (4) required additional disclosure. Under these new rules, if we have a variable interest in a VIE and we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE then we will consolidate the VIE. We are the considered the primary beneficiary if we have both: (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. There is considerable judgment that has to be used as it relates to determining who is the primary beneficiary of the VIEs with which we are associated. There are no bright line tests. Rather, the assessment of who has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most 84 significantly affects the VIEs economic performance and who has the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE is very qualitative and judgmental in nature. However, based on our current relationship with our securitization trusts and other financing vehicles which are considered VIEs, we believe the assessment is more straightforward. As it relates to our securitized assets, we are the servicer of those securitized assets (which means we have the power to direct the activities of the trust) and we own the Residual Interest (which means we have the loss and gain obligation that could potentially be significant to the VIE) of the securitization trusts. As a result we are the primary beneficiary of our securitization trusts and other financing vehicles. See Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies for further details regarding the adoption of these new rules on January 1, 2010. Derivative Accounting The most significant judgments related to derivative accounting are: (1) concluding the derivative is an effective hedge and qualifies for hedge accounting and (2) determining the fair value of certain derivatives and hedged items. To qualify for hedge accounting a derivative must be concluded to be a highly effective hedge upon designation and on an ongoing basis. There are no bright line tests on what is considered a highly effective hedge. We use a historical regression analysis to prove ongoing and prospective hedge effectiveness. See previous discussion under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Fair Value Measurement of this Item 7 for significant judgments related to the valuation of derivatives. Although some of our valuations are more judgmental than others, we compare the fair values of our derivatives that we calculate to those provided by our counterparties on a monthly basis. We view this as a critical control which helps validate these judgments. Any significant differences with our counterparties are identified and resolved appropriately. Goodwill and Intangible Assets In determining annually (or more frequently if required) whether goodwill is impaired, we determine whether an event has occurred that would indicate to us that there is the potential for the fair value of the business unit to fall below the book basis of the equity of that business unit. If we determine that this event has occurred, we perform an analysis to determine the fair value of the business unit. There are significant judgments involved in determining the fair value of a business unit, including assumptions regarding estimates of future cash flows from existing and new business activities, customer relationships, the value of existing customer contracts, the value of other tangible and intangible assets, as well as assumptions regarding what we believe a third party willing to pay for all of the assets and liabilities of the business unit. This calculation requires us to estimate the appropriate discount and growth rates to apply to those projected cash flows and the appropriate control premium to apply to arrive at the final fair value. The business units for which we must estimate the fair value are not publically traded and often there is not comparable market data available for that individual business to aid in its valuation. We use a third party appraisal firm to provide an opinion on the fair values we conclude upon. Risk Management Processes Our Approach The monitoring, assessment and oversight of risk are shared responsibilities throughout the Company. Each business division is primarily responsible and accountable for managing risks specific to its area. Our executive management team and centralized support functions, including compliance, credit risk, human resources, legal, information technology, finance and accounting, are responsible for providing our business divisions with the training, systems and specialized expertise necessary to properly perform their risk management duties. Executive management, individually and through participation in various committees, are ultimately responsible for the management of risk across our businesses. Our Risk Assessment Department regularly monitors and reports to the Audit Committee of our Board of Director on the effectiveness of various aspects of our risk management activities. Our Code of Business Conduct and the on going training our employees receive in many compliance areas provide a framework for our employees to conduct themselves with the highest integrity. We instill a risk conscious culture through communications, training, policies and procedures. We have strengthened the 85 linkage between the management performance process and individual compensation to encourage employees to work toward corporate wide compliance goals. Our Risk Assessment Department monitors our various risk management and compliance efforts, identifies areas that require increased focus and resources, and reports significant control issues to executive management and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. At least annually, the Risk Assessment Department performs a risk assessment to identify our top risks, to develop the internal audit plan. Risks are rated on significance and likelihood of occurrence and communicated to our management team members who allocate appropriate attention and resources. Results of the assessment, including survey results, identified risks and recommendations, are reported to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors and its various committees oversee our overall strategic direction and provide direction to management as to its tolerance levels of various significant risks. Through its committees, our Board of Directors regularly reviews our risk management practices. Our Significant Risks Significant risks may be grouped into the following categories: (1) funding and liquidity; (2) operations; (3) political/reputation; (4) competition; (5) credit; and (6) regulatory and compliance. More specific descriptions of the particular risks of each type we currently face are discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors. Funding and Liquidity Risk Management Funding and liquidity risk is the potential inability to fund liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, fund asset growth and business operations, and meet contractual obligations at reasonable market rates. Our primary liquidity objective is to ensure our ongoing ability to meet our funding needs for our businesses throughout market cycles, including during periods of financial stress. Our two primary liquidity needs are originating Private Education Loans and retiring secured and unsecured debt when it matures. We define excess liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high quality liquid unencumbered securities, that we can use to meet our funding requirements as those obligations arise. Our primary liquidity risk relates to our ability to raise replacement funding and raise that funding at a reasonable cost as our secured and unsecured debt matures. In addition, we must continue to obtain funding at reasonable rates to meet our other business obligations and to continue to grow our business. Key risks associated with our liquidity relates to our ability to access the capital markets and access them at reasonable rates. This ability is directly affected by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions, including over the counter derivatives. A negative change in our credit rating would have a negative effect on our liquidity because it would raise the cost, diminish the availability of funding and potentially require additional cash collateral or restrict cash currently held as collateral on existing borrowings or derivative collateral arrangements. Our funding and liquidity risk management activities are centralized within our Corporate Finance Department, which is responsible for planning and executing our funding activities and strategies. We analyze and monitor our liquidity risk, maintain excess liquidity and access diverse funding. Funding and liquidity risk are overseen and recommendations approved via one or more management committees that manage market, interest rate and balance sheet risk. The Finance Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for approving our Asset and Liability Management Policy. The Finance Committee of the Board, and in some cases the full Board, monitor our liquidity on an ongoing basis. Our liquidity risk management activities are centralized within the Corporate Finance Department, which is responsible for planning and executing our funding activities and strategies. Operations Risk Management Operations risk arises from problems with service or product delivery or from nonconformance with internal policies and procedures. The Company is exposed to transaction risk when products, services or 86 delivery channels do not fit with our operational capacity, customer demands or strategic objectives. Operations risk can increase with the implementation of new information technology to support a new, expanded or modified product or service. Failed or flawed technology, either from error, inadequate capacity or fraud, may result in the inability to deliver products or services. Operations risk is managed by our managers with assistance and training provided by our centralized support functions. Additionally, the operations risks associated with new products and services, the security and confidentiality of information, the effectiveness of our technology infrastructure, the emergency loss of technology and other infrastructure resources, the monitoring of internal controls and compliance with internal control standards, and the monitoring and dissemination of changes in regulations affecting the business are each the subject of executive management review through committees established for these particular purposes. The Finance and Operations Committee of our Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for significant operational risks and receives periodic reports from executive management regarding the effectiveness of our risk management efforts in this area. Political and Reputation Risk Management Political and reputation risk is the risk that changes in laws and regulations or actions negatively impacting our reputation could affect the profitability and sustainability of our business. Management proactively assesses and manages political and reputation risk. Our government relations team of employees manages our review and response to all formal inquiries from members of Congress, state legislators, and their staff, including providing targeted messaging that reinforces our public policy goals. We review and consider political and reputational risks on an integrated basis in connection with the risk management oversight activities conducted in the various aspects of our business on matters as diverse as the launch of new products and services, our credit underwriting activities and how we fund our operations. Significant political and reputation risks are reported to and monitored by the Finance and Operations Committee of our Board of Directors. Competition Risk Management Competition risk is the risk of losing market share or the lack of market acceptance of our products due to our competitors competing more effectively. Management closely monitors competitors and conditions. We follow changes in product pricing and features and track marketing activity across a variety of distribution channels. In addition, we measure category participants brand recognition among key consumer groups. We continuously evaluate the size of the market and analyze market developments and trends that may impact future demand for student loans. Significant market competition risks are reported to and monitored by the Finance and Operations Committee of our Board of Directors. Credit and Counterparty Risk Management Credit and counterparty risk is the risk of loss stemming from one partys failure to repay a loan or otherwise meet a contractual obligation. We have credit or counterparty risk exposure with borrowers and co borrowers with whom we have made Private Education Loans, the various counterparties with whom we have entered into derivative contracts, the various issuers with whom we make investments, and with several higher education institutions related to academic facilities loans secured by real estate. The credit risk related to Private Education Loans are managed within a credit risk infrastructure which includes (i) a well defined underwriting and collection policy framework; (ii) an ongoing monitoring and review process of portfolio segments and trends; (iii) assignment and management of credit authorities and responsibilities; and (iv) establishment of an allowance for loan losses that covers estimated losses based upon 87 portfolio and economic analysis. This infrastructure is overseen by our Chief Credit Officer and the executive management committee that he chairs. Credit and counterparty risk related to derivative contracts is managed by reviewing counterparties for credit strength on an ongoing basis and via our credit policies, which place limits on the amount of exposure we may take with any one counterparty and, in most cases, require collateral to secure the position. The credit and counterparty risk associated with derivatives is measured based on the replacement cost should the counterparties with contracts in a gain position to the Company fail to perform under the terms of the contract. The credit and counterparty risk in our investment portfolio is minimized by only investing in paper with highly rated issuers and setting limits on our exposure per issuer. Credit and counterparty risk related to derivative contracts and our investment portfolio are approved and managed by our Credit Risk Management group overseen by our Chief Credit Officer. Significant credit and counterparty risks related to derivative contracts or our investment portfolio are reported to the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. Additionally, our Chief Credit Officer reports, on a regular basis, to the Board and the Audit Committee of the Board regarding the asset quality of our Private Education Loans. Regulatory and Compliance Risk Management Regulatory and compliance risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from violations of laws, rules, or regulations. The Company is exposed to regulatory and compliance risk when key areas such as our private education lending, collections or government loan servicing businesses are not properly monitored for compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and when an oversight program does not include appropriate audit and control features. We also face regulatory and compliance risk when new, expanded or modified products or services are not properly monitored for compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Primary ownership and responsibility for regulatory and compliance risk is placed with the business areas to manage their specific regulatory and compliance risks. Our Compliance Department supports these activities through providing extensive training and monitoring of our Code of Business Conduct, maintaining consumer lending regulatory and information security policies and procedures, and working in close coordination with our other centralized support functions such as our Legal department. Compliance risks associated with new products and services, SEC disclosure obligations, security and confidentiality of information and effectiveness of our technology infrastructure, internal controls and compliance with internal control standards, dissemination of changes in regulations affecting the business, and enforcement of credit lending policies and practices are each the subject of specific review by existing management committees. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has oversight with respect to establishing standards with respect to our monitoring and control of regulatory and compliance risks and the qualification of employees overseeing these risk management functions. The Audit Committee receives periodic reports from executive management team members responsible for the regulatory and compliance risk management functions. 88 Common Stock The following table summarizes our common share repurchases and issuances for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Years Ended December 31, (Shares in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Common shares repurchased: Open market Benefit plans(1) 1.1 .3 1.0 Total shares repurchased 1.1 .3 1.0 Average purchase price per share $ 13.44 $ 20.29 $ 24.51 Common shares issued 1.8 17.8 1.9 Authority remaining at end of period for repurchases 38.8 38.8 38.8 (1) Shares withheld from stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock for employees tax withholding obligations and shares tendered by employees to satisfy option exercise costs. During 2009, we converted $339 million of our Series C Preferred Stock to common stock. As part of this conversion, we delivered to the holders of the preferred stock: (1) approximately 17 million shares (the number of common shares they would most likely receive if the preferred stock they held mandatorily converted to common shares in the fourth quarter of 2010) plus (2) a discounted amount of the preferred stock dividends the holders of the preferred stock would have received if they held the preferred stock through the mandatory conversion date. The accounting treatment for this conversion resulted in additional dividends recorded as part of preferred stock dividends for the year of approximately $53 million. On December 15, 2010, the mandatory conversion date, the remaining 810,370 shares of our Series C Preferred Stock were converted into 41 million shares of common stock. The closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2010 was $12.59 89 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis Our interest rate risk management seeks to limit the impact of short term movements in interest rates on our results of operations and financial position. The following tables summarize the effect on earnings for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the effect on fair values at December 31, 2010 and 2009, based upon a sensitivity analysis performed by management assuming a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of 100 basis points and 300 basis points while funding spreads remain constant. Additionally, as it relates to the effect on earnings, a sensitivity analysis was performed assuming the funding index increases 25 basis points while holding the asset index constant, if the funding index is different than the asset index. Both of these analyses do not consider any potential mark to market losses that may occur related to our Residual Interests (prior to the adoption of topic updates on ASC 810 on January 1, 2010) that may result from asset and funding basis divergence or a higher discount rate that would be used to compute the present value of the cash flows if long term interest rates increased.

However, as discussed in Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Segment Earnings Summary Core Earnings Basis FFELP Loans Segment Floor Income Core Earnings Basis, we can have a fixed versus floating mismatch in funding if the student loan earns at the fixed borrower rate and the funding remains floating. In addition, we can have a mismatch in the index (including the frequency of reset) of floating rate debt versus floating rate assets. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, certain FFELP Loans were earning Floor Income and we locked in a portion of that Floor Income through the use of Floor Income Contracts. The result of these hedging transactions was to convert a portion of the fixed rate nature of student loans to variable rate, and to fix the relative spread between the student loan asset rate and the variable rate liability. 91 In the preceding tables, under the scenario where interest rates increase 100 and 300 basis points, the change in pre tax net income before the unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities is primarily due to the impact of (i) our unhedged on balance sheet loans being in a fixed rate mode due to the Embedded Floor Income, while being funded with variable debt in low interest rate environments; and (ii) a portion of our variable assets being funded with fixed debt. Item (i) will generally cause income to decrease when interest rates increase from a low interest rate environment, whereas item (ii) will generally offset this decrease. In the 100 and 300 basis point scenarios for the year ended December 31, 2010, the increase in income resulted from item (ii) having a greater impact than item (i). In the prior year period, item (i) resulted in a decrease to income in the 100 and 300 basis point scenarios. Under the scenario in the tables above labeled Asset and Funding Index Mismatches, the main driver of the decrease in pre tax income before unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities is the result of LIBOR based debt funding commercial paper indexed assets. See Asset and Liability Funding Gap of this Item 7A for a further discussion. Increasing the spread between indices will also impact the unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities as it relates to basis swaps. Basis swaps used to convert LIBOR based debt to indices that we believe are economic hedges of the indices of the assets being funded resulted in an unrealized losses of $(204) million and $(102) million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Offsetting this unrealized loss are basis swaps that economically hedge our Private Education Loan securitization trusts. Unrealized gains for these basis swaps totaled $176 million and $208 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The change from a net gain in the prior year period to a net loss in the current year period was the impact of basis swap hedges in securitization trusts that were previously off balance sheet prior to new consolidation accounting adopted on January 1, 2010 (see Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Transfers of Financial Assets and the VIE Consolidation Model for further discussion). In addition to interest rate risk addressed in the preceding tables, we are also exposed to risks related to foreign currency exchange rates. Foreign currency exchange risk is primarily the result of foreign currency denominated debt issued by us. As it relates to our corporate unsecured and securitization debt programs used to fund our business, our policy is to use cross currency interest rate swaps to swap all foreign currency denominated debt payments (fixed and floating) to U.S. dollar LIBOR using a fixed exchange rate. In the tables above, there would be an immaterial impact on earnings if exchange rates were to decrease or increase, due to the terms of the hedging instrument and hedged items matching. The balance sheet interest bearing liabilities would be affected by a change in exchange rates; however, the change would be materially offset by the cross currency interest rate swaps in other assets or other liabilities. In the current economic environment, volatility in the spread between spot and forward foreign exchange rates has resulted in material mark to market impacts to current period earnings which have not been factored into the above analysis. The earnings impact is noncash, and at maturity of the instruments the cumulative mark to market impact will be zero. 92 Asset and Liability Funding Gap The tables below present our assets and liabilities (funding) arranged by underlying indices as of December 31, 2010. In the following GAAP presentation, the funding gap only includes derivatives that qualify as effective hedges (those derivatives which are reflected in net interest margin, as opposed to those reflected in the gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities, net line on the consolidated statements of income). The difference between the asset and the funding is the funding gap for the specified index. This represents our exposure to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk, which is the risk that the different indices may reset at different frequencies or may not move in the same direction or at the same magnitude. Management analyzes interest rate risk and in doing so includes all derivatives that are economically hedging our debt whether they qualify as effective hedges or not (Core Earnings basis). Accordingly, we are also presenting the asset and liability funding gap on a Core Earnings basis in the table that follows the GAAP presentation. GAAP Basis Frequency of Index Variable Funding (Dollars in billions) Resets Assets Funding(1) Gap 3 month Commercial paper daily $ 139.2 $ .1 $ 139.1 3 month Treasury bill weekly 8.2 8.2 Prime annual .8 .8 Prime quarterly 5.4 5.4 Prime monthly 23.1 23.1 Prime daily 3.0 (3.0 ) PLUS Index annual .5 .5 3 month LIBOR daily 3 month LIBOR quarterly 132.1 (132.1 ) 1 month LIBOR monthly 7.3 15.3 (8.0 ) CMT/CPI Index monthly/quarterly 2.0 (2.0 ) Non Discrete reset(2) monthly 34.6 (34.6 ) Non Discrete reset(3) daily/weekly 11.5 2.3 9.2 Fixed Rate(4) 9.3 15.9 (6.6 ) Total $ 205.3 $ 205.3 $ (1) Funding includes all derivatives that qualify as hedges. (2) Funding consists of auction rate securities, the ABCP Facilities and the ED Conduit Program facility. (3) Assets include restricted and unrestricted cash equivalents and other overnight type instruments. Funding includes retail and other deposits and cash collateral held related to derivatives exposures that are recorded as a short term debt obligation. (4) Assets include receivables and other assets (including goodwill and acquired intangibles). Funding includes other liabilities and stockholders equity (excluding series B Preferred Stock). 93 The Funding Gaps in the above table are primarily interest rate mismatches in short term indices between our assets and liabilities. We address this issue typically through the use of basis swaps that typically convert quarterly reset three month LIBOR to other indices that are more correlated to our asset indices. These basis swaps do not qualify as effective hedges and as a result the effect on the funding index is not included in our interest margin and is therefore excluded from the GAAP presentation. Core Earnings Basis Index Frequency of Funding (Dollars in billions) Variable Resets Assets Funding(1) Gap 3 month Commercial paper daily $ 139.2 $ .1 $ 139.1 3 month Treasury bill weekly 8.2 2.0 6.2 Prime annual .8 .8 Prime quarterly 5.4 1.5 3.9 Prime monthly 23.1 8.6 14.5 Prime daily 3.0 (3.0 ) PLUS Index annual .5 .5 3 month LIBOR daily 55.5 (55.5 ) 3 month LIBOR quarterly 54.6 (54.6 ) 1 month LIBOR monthly 7.3 20.1 (12.8 ) 1 month LIBOR daily 9.0 (9.0 ) Non Discrete reset(2) monthly 34.6 (34.6 ) Non Discrete reset(3) daily/weekly 11.5 2.3 9.2 Fixed Rate(4) 6.6 11.3 (4.7 ) Total $ 202.6 $ 202.6 $ (1) Funding includes all derivatives that management considers economic hedges of interest rate risk and reflects how we internally manage our interest rate exposure. (2) Funding consists of auction rate securities, the ABCP Facilities and the ED Conduit Program facility. (3) Assets include restricted and unrestricted cash equivalents and other overnight type instruments. Funding includes retail and other deposits and cash collateral held related to derivatives exposures that are recorded as a short term debt obligation. (4) Assets include receivables and other assets (including goodwill and acquired intangibles). Funding includes other liabilities and stockholders equity (excluding series B Preferred Stock). We use interest rate swaps and other derivatives to achieve our risk management objectives. To the extent possible, we fund our assets with debt (in combination with derivatives) that has the same underlying index (index type and index reset frequency). When it is more economical, we also fund our assets with debt that has a different index and or reset frequency than the asset, but only in instances where we believe there is a high degree of correlation between the interest rate movement of the two indices. For example, we use daily reset three month LIBOR to fund a large portion of our daily reset three month commercial paper indexed assets. In addition, we use quarterly reset three month LIBOR to fund a portion of our quarterly reset Prime rate indexed Private Education Loans. We also use our monthly Non Discrete reset and 1 month LIBOR funding to fund various asset types. In using different index types and different index reset frequencies to fund our assets, we are exposed to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk, which is the risk that the different indices that may reset at different frequencies will not move in the same direction or at the same magnitude. While we believe that this risk is low, as all of these indices are short term with rate movements that are highly correlated over a long period of time, market disruptions can lead to a temporary divergence between indices as was experienced beginning in the second half of 2007 through the second quarter of 2009 with the commercial paper and LIBOR indices. As of December 31, 2010, we have approximately $92.6 billion of FFELP Loans indexed to three month commercial paper (3M CP) that are funded with debt indexed to 3M LIBOR. 94 Weighted Average Life The following table reflects the weighted average life for our earning assets and liabilities at December 31, 2010.

Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition FFELP Loan Portfolio Performance and Consumer Lending Portfolio Performance. Our investment portfolio is composed of very short term securities issued by highly rated issuers limiting our counterparty exposure. Additionally, our investing activity is governed by Board approved limits on the amount that is allowed to be invested with any one issuer based on the credit rating of the issuer, further minimizing our counterparty exposure. Counterparty credit risk is considered when valuing investments and considering impairment. Related to derivative transactions, protection against counterparty risk is generally provided by International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) Credit Support Annexes (CSAs). CSAs require a counterparty to post collateral if a potential default would expose the other party to a loss. All derivative contracts entered into by SLM Corporation and the Bank are covered under such agreements and require collateral to be exchanged based on the net fair value of derivatives with each counterparty. Our securitization trusts require collateral in all cases if the counterpartys credit rating is withdrawn or downgraded below a certain level. Additionally, securitizations involving foreign currency notes issued after November 2005 also require the counterparty to post collateral to the trust based on the fair value of the derivative, regardless of credit rating. The trusts are not required to post collateral to the counterparties. In all cases, our exposure is limited to the value of the derivative contracts in a gain position net of any collateral we are holding. We consider counterparties credit risk when determining the fair value of derivative positions on our exposure net of collateral. 79 We have liquidity exposure related to collateral movements between us and our derivative counterparties. Movements in the value of the derivatives, which are primarily affected by changes in interest rate and foreign exchange rates, may require us to return cash collateral held or may require us to access primary liquidity to post collateral to counterparties. If our credit ratings are downgraded from current levels, we may be required to segregate unrestricted cash collateral into restricted accounts. The table below highlights exposure related to our derivative counterparties at December 31, 2010.

Timing of obligations is estimated based on our current projection of prepayment speeds of the securitized assets. (2) The aggregate principal amount of debt that matures in each period is $16.3 billion, $32.4 billion, $24.6 billion and $88.7 billion, respectively. Specifically excludes derivative market value adjustments of $2.6 billion for long term notes. Interest obligations on notes are predominantly variable in nature, resetting quarterly based on 3 month LIBOR. Unrecognized tax benefits were $39 million and $101 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. For additional information, see Note 18 Income Taxes. 81 Off Balance Sheet Lending Arrangements We have issued lending related financial instruments, including lines of credit, to meet the financing needs of our institutional customers. In connection with these agreements, we also enter into a participation agreement with the institution to participate in the loans as they are originated. In the event that a line of credit is drawn upon, the loan is collateralized by underlying student loans and is usually participated on the same day. The contractual amount of these financial instruments, $50 million at December 31, 2010, represents the maximum possible credit risk should the counterparty draw down the commitment, we do not participate in the loan, and the counterparty subsequently fails to perform according to the terms of our contract. The remaining total contractual amount available to be borrowed under these commitments is $50 million. All commitments mature in 2011. We do not believe that these instruments are representative of our actual future credit exposure; to the extent that the lines of credit are drawn upon, the balance outstanding is collateralized by student loans. At December 31, 2010, there were no outstanding draws on lines of credit. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations addresses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP). Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates its estimates, particularly those that include the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and are often about matters that are inherently uncertain. The most significant judgments, estimates and assumptions relate to the following critical accounting policies that are discussed in more detail below. Allowance for Loan Losses When calculating the allowance for loan loss for Private Education Loans we estimate the amount of our customers who will default over the next two years and how much we will recover over time related to the defaulted amount. Our historical experience indicates that, on average, the time between the date that a borrower experiences a default causing event (e.g., the loss trigger event) and the date that we charge off the unrecoverable portion of that loan is two years. In estimating the amount of defaults we expect to have over the next two years we divide the portfolio into categories of similar risk characteristics based on loan program type, school type, loan status (in school, grace, forbearance, repayment and delinquency), seasoning (number of months in active repayment for which a scheduled payment was due), underwriting criteria (credit scores), and existence or absence of a cosigner. The primary characteristics we use are school type, credit scores, cosigner status, loan status and seasoning. We start with historical experience of customer default behavior. We make judgments about which historical period to start with and then make further judgments about whether that historical experience is representative of future expectations and whether additional adjustment may be needed to those historical default rates. We also take into account the current and future economic environment when calculating the allowance for loan loss. We analyze key economic statistics and the effect they will have on future defaults. Key economic statistics analyzed as part of the allowance for loan loss are unemployment rates (total and specific to college graduates) and other asset type delinquency rates (credit cards, mortgages). Significantly more judgment has been required over the last three years, compared with years prior, in light of the U.S. economy and its effect on our customers ability to pay their obligations. In addition to making judgments about the amount of defaults that will occur over the next two years we also make judgments about how much we will subsequently recover from a defaulted customer and when that recovery will occur. Similar to estimating defaults, we begin with historical recovery performance when projecting future recoveries and use judgment in determining whether historical performance is representative of what we expect to recover in the future. 82 FFELP Loans are guaranteed as to their principal and accrued interest in the event of default subject to a Risk Sharing level based on the date of loan disbursement. For loans disbursed after October 1, 1993, and before July 1, 2006, we receive 98 percent reimbursement on all qualifying default claims. For loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2006, we receive 97 percent reimbursement. For loans disbursed prior to October 1, 1993, we receive 100 percent reimbursement. Similar to the allowance for Private Education Loan losses, the allowance for FFELP Loan losses uses historical experience of borrower default behavior and a two year loss confirmation period to estimate the credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio at the reporting date. We apply the default rate projections, net of applicable Risk Sharing, to each category for the current period to perform our quantitative calculation. Once the quantitative calculation is performed, we review the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and determine if qualitative adjustments need to be considered. Premium and Discount Amortization The most judgmental estimate for premium and discount amortization on student loans is the Constant Prepayment Rate (CPR), which measures the rate at which loans in the portfolio pay down principal compared to their stated terms. Loan consolidation, default, term extension and other prepayment factors affecting our CPR estimates are affected by changes in our business strategy, changes in our competitors business strategies, FFELP legislative changes, interest rates and changes to the current economic and credit environment. When we determine the CPR we begin with historical prepayment rates due to consolidation activity, defaults, payoffs and term extensions from the utilization of forbearance. We make judgments about which historical period to start with and then make further judgments about whether that historical experience is representative of future expectations and whether additional adjustment may be needed to those historical prepayment rates. In the past the consolidation of FFELP Loans and Private Education Loans significantly affected our CPRs and updating those assumptions often resulted in material adjustments to our amortization expense. As a result of the CCRAA and the current U.S. economic and credit environment, we, as well as many other industry competitors, have suspended our FFELP Loans consolidation program and Private Education Loans consolidation program. We do not expect to consolidate FFELP Loans in the future and do not currently expect others to actively consolidate our FFELP Loans. As a result, we expect CPRs related to our FFELP Loans to remain relatively stable over time. We expect that in the future both we and our competitors will begin to consolidate Private Education Loans. This is built into the CPR assumption we use for Private Education Loans. However, it is difficult to accurately project the timing and level at which this consolidation activity will begin and our assumption may need to be updated by a material amount in the future based on changes in the economy and marketplace. The level of defaults is a significant component of our FFELP Loan and Private Education Loan CPR. This component of the FFELP Loan and Private Education Loan CPR is estimated in the same manner as discussed in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Allowance for Loan Loss of this Item 7 the only difference is for premium and discount amortization purposes the estimate of defaults is a life of loan estimate whereas for allowance for loan loss it is a two year estimate. Fair Value Measurement The most significant assumptions used in fair value measurements, including those related to credit and liquidity risk, are as follows: 1. Investments Our investments primarily consist of overnight/weekly maturity instruments with high credit quality counterparties. However, we consider credit and liquidity risk involving specific instruments in determining their fair value and, when appropriate, have adjusted the fair value of these instruments for the effect of credit and liquidity risk. These assumptions have further been validated by the successful maturity of these investments in the period immediately following the end of the reporting period. 2. Derivatives When determining the fair value of derivatives, we take into account counterparty credit risk for positions where we are exposed to the counterparty on a net basis by assessing exposure net of collateral held. The net exposure for each counterparty is adjusted based on market 83 information available for that specific counterparty, including spreads from credit default swaps. Additionally, when the counterparty has exposure to us related to our derivatives, we fully collateralize the exposure, minimizing the adjustment necessary to the derivative valuations for our own credit risk. Trusts that contain derivatives are not required to post collateral to counterparties as the credit quality and securitized nature of the trusts minimizes any adjustments for the counterpartys exposure to the trusts. Adjustments related to credit risk reduced the overall value of our derivatives by $72 million as of December 31, 2010. We also take into account changes in liquidity when determining the fair value of derivative positions. We adjusted the fair value of certain less liquid positions downward by approximately $129 million to take into account a significant reduction in liquidity as of December 31, 2010, related primarily to basis swaps indexed to interest rate indices with inactive markets. A major indicator of market inactivity is the widening of the bid/ask spread in these markets. In general, the widening of counterparty credit spreads and reduced liquidity for derivative instruments as indicated by wider bid/ask spreads will reduce the fair value of derivatives. In addition, certain cross currency interest rate swaps hedging foreign currency denominated reset rate and amortizing notes in our on balance sheet trusts contain extension features that coincide with the remarketing dates of the notes. The valuation of the extension feature requires significant judgment based on internally developed inputs. 3. Student Loans Our FFELP Loans and Private Education Loans are accounted for at cost or at the lower of cost or fair value if the loan is held for sale. The fair values of our student loans are disclosed in Note 15 Fair Value Measurements. For both FFELP Loans and Private Education Loans accounted for at cost, fair value is determined by modeling loan level cash flows using stated terms of the assets and internally developed assumptions to determine aggregate portfolio yield, net present value and average life. The significant assumptions used to project cash flows are prepayment speeds, default rates, cost of funds, and required return on equity. In addition, the Floor Income component of our FFELP Loan portfolio is valued through discounted cash flow and option models using both observable market inputs and internally developed inputs. Significant inputs into the models are not generally market observable. They are either derived internally through a combination of historical experience and managements qualitative expectation of future performance (in the case of prepayment speeds, default rates, and capital assumptions) or are obtained through external broker quotes (as in the case of cost of funds). When possible, market transactions are used to validate the model. In most cases, these are either infrequent or not observable. For FFELP Loans classified as held for sale and accounted for at the lower of cost or market, the fair value is based on the committed sales price of the various loan purchase programs established by ED. For further information regarding the effect of our use of fair values on our results of operations, see Note 15 Fair Value Measurements. Transfers of Financial Assets and the Variable Interest Entity (VIE) Consolidation Model Changes in Accounting Principles effective January 1, 2010 The new consolidation accounting adopted on January 1, 2010 significantly changed the consolidation model for Variable Interest Entities (VIEs). This new rule, among other things, (1) eliminated the exemption for QSPEs, (2) provided a new approach for determining who should consolidate a VIE that is more focused on control rather than economic interest, (3) changed when it is necessary to reassess who should consolidate a VIE and (4) required additional disclosure. Under these new rules, if we have a variable interest in a VIE and we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE then we will consolidate the VIE. We are the considered the primary beneficiary if we have both: (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. There is considerable judgment that has to be used as it relates to determining who is the primary beneficiary of the VIEs with which we are associated. There are no bright line tests. Rather, the assessment of who has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most 84 significantly affects the VIEs economic performance and who has the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE is very qualitative and judgmental in nature. However, based on our current relationship with our securitization trusts and other financing vehicles which are considered VIEs, we believe the assessment is more straightforward. As it relates to our securitized assets, we are the servicer of those securitized assets (which means we have the power to direct the activities of the trust) and we own the Residual Interest (which means we have the loss and gain obligation that could potentially be significant to the VIE) of the securitization trusts. As a result we are the primary beneficiary of our securitization trusts and other financing vehicles. See Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies for further details regarding the adoption of these new rules on January 1, 2010. Derivative Accounting The most significant judgments related to derivative accounting are: (1) concluding the derivative is an effective hedge and qualifies for hedge accounting and (2) determining the fair value of certain derivatives and hedged items. To qualify for hedge accounting a derivative must be concluded to be a highly effective hedge upon designation and on an ongoing basis. There are no bright line tests on what is considered a highly effective hedge. We use a historical regression analysis to prove ongoing and prospective hedge effectiveness. See previous discussion under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Fair Value Measurement of this Item 7 for significant judgments related to the valuation of derivatives. Although some of our valuations are more judgmental than others, we compare the fair values of our derivatives that we calculate to those provided by our counterparties on a monthly basis. We view this as a critical control which helps validate these judgments. Any significant differences with our counterparties are identified and resolved appropriately. Goodwill and Intangible Assets In determining annually (or more frequently if required) whether goodwill is impaired, we determine whether an event has occurred that would indicate to us that there is the potential for the fair value of the business unit to fall below the book basis of the equity of that business unit. If we determine that this event has occurred, we perform an analysis to determine the fair value of the business unit. There are significant judgments involved in determining the fair value of a business unit, including assumptions regarding estimates of future cash flows from existing and new business activities, customer relationships, the value of existing customer contracts, the value of other tangible and intangible assets, as well as assumptions regarding what we believe a third party willing to pay for all of the assets and liabilities of the business unit. This calculation requires us to estimate the appropriate discount and growth rates to apply to those projected cash flows and the appropriate control premium to apply to arrive at the final fair value. The business units for which we must estimate the fair value are not publically traded and often there is not comparable market data available for that individual business to aid in its valuation. We use a third party appraisal firm to provide an opinion on the fair values we conclude upon. Risk Management Processes Our Approach The monitoring, assessment and oversight of risk are shared responsibilities throughout the Company. Each business division is primarily responsible and accountable for managing risks specific to its area. Our executive management team and centralized support functions, including compliance, credit risk, human resources, legal, information technology, finance and accounting, are responsible for providing our business divisions with the training, systems and specialized expertise necessary to properly perform their risk management duties. Executive management, individually and through participation in various committees, are ultimately responsible for the management of risk across our businesses. Our Risk Assessment Department regularly monitors and reports to the Audit Committee of our Board of Director on the effectiveness of various aspects of our risk management activities. Our Code of Business Conduct and the on going training our employees receive in many compliance areas provide a framework for our employees to conduct themselves with the highest integrity. We instill a risk conscious culture through communications, training, policies and procedures. We have strengthened the 85 linkage between the management performance process and individual compensation to encourage employees to work toward corporate wide compliance goals. Our Risk Assessment Department monitors our various risk management and compliance efforts, identifies areas that require increased focus and resources, and reports significant control issues to executive management and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. At least annually, the Risk Assessment Department performs a risk assessment to identify our top risks, to develop the internal audit plan. Risks are rated on significance and likelihood of occurrence and communicated to our management team members who allocate appropriate attention and resources. Results of the assessment, including survey results, identified risks and recommendations, are reported to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors and its various committees oversee our overall strategic direction and provide direction to management as to its tolerance levels of various significant risks. Through its committees, our Board of Directors regularly reviews our risk management practices. Our Significant Risks Significant risks may be grouped into the following categories: (1) funding and liquidity; (2) operations; (3) political/reputation; (4) competition; (5) credit; and (6) regulatory and compliance. More specific descriptions of the particular risks of each type we currently face are discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors. Funding and Liquidity Risk Management Funding and liquidity risk is the potential inability to fund liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, fund asset growth and business operations, and meet contractual obligations at reasonable market rates. Our primary liquidity objective is to ensure our ongoing ability to meet our funding needs for our businesses throughout market cycles, including during periods of financial stress. Our two primary liquidity needs are originating Private Education Loans and retiring secured and unsecured debt when it matures. We define excess liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high quality liquid unencumbered securities, that we can use to meet our funding requirements as those obligations arise. Our primary liquidity risk relates to our ability to raise replacement funding and raise that funding at a reasonable cost as our secured and unsecured debt matures. In addition, we must continue to obtain funding at reasonable rates to meet our other business obligations and to continue to grow our business. Key risks associated with our liquidity relates to our ability to access the capital markets and access them at reasonable rates. This ability is directly affected by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions, including over the counter derivatives. A negative change in our credit rating would have a negative effect on our liquidity because it would raise the cost, diminish the availability of funding and potentially require additional cash collateral or restrict cash currently held as collateral on existing borrowings or derivative collateral arrangements. Our funding and liquidity risk management activities are centralized within our Corporate Finance Department, which is responsible for planning and executing our funding activities and strategies. We analyze and monitor our liquidity risk, maintain excess liquidity and access diverse funding. Funding and liquidity risk are overseen and recommendations approved via one or more management committees that manage market, interest rate and balance sheet risk. The Finance Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for approving our Asset and Liability Management Policy. The Finance Committee of the Board, and in some cases the full Board, monitor our liquidity on an ongoing basis. Our liquidity risk management activities are centralized within the Corporate Finance Department, which is responsible for planning and executing our funding activities and strategies. Operations Risk Management Operations risk arises from problems with service or product delivery or from nonconformance with internal policies and procedures. The Company is exposed to transaction risk when products, services or 86 delivery channels do not fit with our operational capacity, customer demands or strategic objectives. Operations risk can increase with the implementation of new information technology to support a new, expanded or modified product or service. Failed or flawed technology, either from error, inadequate capacity or fraud, may result in the inability to deliver products or services. Operations risk is managed by our managers with assistance and training provided by our centralized support functions. Additionally, the operations risks associated with new products and services, the security and confidentiality of information, the effectiveness of our technology infrastructure, the emergency loss of technology and other infrastructure resources, the monitoring of internal controls and compliance with internal control standards, and the monitoring and dissemination of changes in regulations affecting the business are each the subject of executive management review through committees established for these particular purposes. The Finance and Operations Committee of our Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for significant operational risks and receives periodic reports from executive management regarding the effectiveness of our risk management efforts in this area. Political and Reputation Risk Management Political and reputation risk is the risk that changes in laws and regulations or actions negatively impacting our reputation could affect the profitability and sustainability of our business. Management proactively assesses and manages political and reputation risk. Our government relations team of employees manages our review and response to all formal inquiries from members of Congress, state legislators, and their staff, including providing targeted messaging that reinforces our public policy goals. We review and consider political and reputational risks on an integrated basis in connection with the risk management oversight activities conducted in the various aspects of our business on matters as diverse as the launch of new products and services, our credit underwriting activities and how we fund our operations. Significant political and reputation risks are reported to and monitored by the Finance and Operations Committee of our Board of Directors. Competition Risk Management Competition risk is the risk of losing market share or the lack of market acceptance of our products due to our competitors competing more effectively. Management closely monitors competitors and conditions. We follow changes in product pricing and features and track marketing activity across a variety of distribution channels. In addition, we measure category participants brand recognition among key consumer groups. We continuously evaluate the size of the market and analyze market developments and trends that may impact future demand for student loans. Significant market competition risks are reported to and monitored by the Finance and Operations Committee of our Board of Directors. Credit and Counterparty Risk Management Credit and counterparty risk is the risk of loss stemming from one partys failure to repay a loan or otherwise meet a contractual obligation. We have credit or counterparty risk exposure with borrowers and co borrowers with whom we have made Private Education Loans, the various counterparties with whom we have entered into derivative contracts, the various issuers with whom we make investments, and with several higher education institutions related to academic facilities loans secured by real estate. The credit risk related to Private Education Loans are managed within a credit risk infrastructure which includes (i) a well defined underwriting and collection policy framework; (ii) an ongoing monitoring and review process of portfolio segments and trends; (iii) assignment and management of credit authorities and responsibilities; and (iv) establishment of an allowance for loan losses that covers estimated losses based upon 87 portfolio and economic analysis. This infrastructure is overseen by our Chief Credit Officer and the executive management committee that he chairs. Credit and counterparty risk related to derivative contracts is managed by reviewing counterparties for credit strength on an ongoing basis and via our credit policies, which place limits on the amount of exposure we may take with any one counterparty and, in most cases, require collateral to secure the position. The credit and counterparty risk associated with derivatives is measured based on the replacement cost should the counterparties with contracts in a gain position to the Company fail to perform under the terms of the contract. The credit and counterparty risk in our investment portfolio is minimized by only investing in paper with highly rated issuers and setting limits on our exposure per issuer. Credit and counterparty risk related to derivative contracts and our investment portfolio are approved and managed by our Credit Risk Management group overseen by our Chief Credit Officer. Significant credit and counterparty risks related to derivative contracts or our investment portfolio are reported to the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. Additionally, our Chief Credit Officer reports, on a regular basis, to the Board and the Audit Committee of the Board regarding the asset quality of our Private Education Loans. Regulatory and Compliance Risk Management Regulatory and compliance risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from violations of laws, rules, or regulations. The Company is exposed to regulatory and compliance risk when key areas such as our private education lending, collections or government loan servicing businesses are not properly monitored for compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and when an oversight program does not include appropriate audit and control features. We also face regulatory and compliance risk when new, expanded or modified products or services are not properly monitored for compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Primary ownership and responsibility for regulatory and compliance risk is placed with the business areas to manage their specific regulatory and compliance risks. Our Compliance Department supports these activities through providing extensive training and monitoring of our Code of Business Conduct, maintaining consumer lending regulatory and information security policies and procedures, and working in close coordination with our other centralized support functions such as our Legal department. Compliance risks associated with new products and services, SEC disclosure obligations, security and confidentiality of information and effectiveness of our technology infrastructure, internal controls and compliance with internal control standards, dissemination of changes in regulations affecting the business, and enforcement of credit lending policies and practices are each the subject of specific review by existing management committees. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has oversight with respect to establishing standards with respect to our monitoring and control of regulatory and compliance risks and the qualification of employees overseeing these risk management functions. The Audit Committee receives periodic reports from executive management team members responsible for the regulatory and compliance risk management functions. 88 Common Stock The following table summarizes our common share repurchases and issuances for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Years Ended December 31, (Shares in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Common shares repurchased: Open market Benefit plans(1) 1.1 .3 1.0 Total shares repurchased 1.1 .3 1.0 Average purchase price per share $ 13.44 $ 20.29 $ 24.51 Common shares issued 1.8 17.8 1.9 Authority remaining at end of period for repurchases 38.8 38.8 38.8 (1) Shares withheld from stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock for employees tax withholding obligations and shares tendered by employees to satisfy option exercise costs. During 2009, we converted $339 million of our Series C Preferred Stock to common stock. As part of this conversion, we delivered to the holders of the preferred stock: (1) approximately 17 million shares (the number of common shares they would most likely receive if the preferred stock they held mandatorily converted to common shares in the fourth quarter of 2010) plus (2) a discounted amount of the preferred stock dividends the holders of the preferred stock would have received if they held the preferred stock through the mandatory conversion date. The accounting treatment for this conversion resulted in additional dividends recorded as part of preferred stock dividends for the year of approximately $53 million. On December 15, 2010, the mandatory conversion date, the remaining 810,370 shares of our Series C Preferred Stock were converted into 41 million shares of common stock. The closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2010 was $12.59 89 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis Our interest rate risk management seeks to limit the impact of short term movements in interest rates on our results of operations and financial position. The following tables summarize the effect on earnings for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the effect on fair values at December 31, 2010 and 2009, based upon a sensitivity analysis performed by management assuming a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of 100 basis points and 300 basis points while funding spreads remain constant. Additionally, as it relates to the effect on earnings, a sensitivity analysis was performed assuming the funding index increases 25 basis points while holding the asset index constant, if the funding index is different than the asset index. Both of these analyses do not consider any potential mark to market losses that may occur related to our Residual Interests (prior to the adoption of topic updates on ASC 810 on January 1, 2010) that may result from asset and funding basis divergence or a higher discount rate that would be used to compute the present value of the cash flows if long term interest rates increased.

However, as discussed in Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Segment Earnings Summary Core Earnings Basis FFELP Loans Segment Floor Income Core Earnings Basis, we can have a fixed versus floating mismatch in funding if the student loan earns at the fixed borrower rate and the funding remains floating. In addition, we can have a mismatch in the index (including the frequency of reset) of floating rate debt versus floating rate assets. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, certain FFELP Loans were earning Floor Income and we locked in a portion of that Floor Income through the use of Floor Income Contracts. The result of these hedging transactions was to convert a portion of the fixed rate nature of student loans to variable rate, and to fix the relative spread between the student loan asset rate and the variable rate liability. 91 In the preceding tables, under the scenario where interest rates increase 100 and 300 basis points, the change in pre tax net income before the unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities is primarily due to the impact of (i) our unhedged on balance sheet loans being in a fixed rate mode due to the Embedded Floor Income, while being funded with variable debt in low interest rate environments; and (ii) a portion of our variable assets being funded with fixed debt. Item (i) will generally cause income to decrease when interest rates increase from a low interest rate environment, whereas item (ii) will generally offset this decrease. In the 100 and 300 basis point scenarios for the year ended December 31, 2010, the increase in income resulted from item (ii) having a greater impact than item (i). In the prior year period, item (i) resulted in a decrease to income in the 100 and 300 basis point scenarios. Under the scenario in the tables above labeled Asset and Funding Index Mismatches, the main driver of the decrease in pre tax income before unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities is the result of LIBOR based debt funding commercial paper indexed assets. See Asset and Liability Funding Gap of this Item 7A for a further discussion. Increasing the spread between indices will also impact the unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities as it relates to basis swaps. Basis swaps used to convert LIBOR based debt to indices that we believe are economic hedges of the indices of the assets being funded resulted in an unrealized losses of $(204) million and $(102) million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Offsetting this unrealized loss are basis swaps that economically hedge our Private Education Loan securitization trusts. Unrealized gains for these basis swaps totaled $176 million and $208 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The change from a net gain in the prior year period to a net loss in the current year period was the impact of basis swap hedges in securitization trusts that were previously off balance sheet prior to new consolidation accounting adopted on January 1, 2010 (see Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Transfers of Financial Assets and the VIE Consolidation Model for further discussion). In addition to interest rate risk addressed in the preceding tables, we are also exposed to risks related to foreign currency exchange rates. Foreign currency exchange risk is primarily the result of foreign currency denominated debt issued by us. As it relates to our corporate unsecured and securitization debt programs used to fund our business, our policy is to use cross currency interest rate swaps to swap all foreign currency denominated debt payments (fixed and floating) to U.S. dollar LIBOR using a fixed exchange rate. In the tables above, there would be an immaterial impact on earnings if exchange rates were to decrease or increase, due to the terms of the hedging instrument and hedged items matching. The balance sheet interest bearing liabilities would be affected by a change in exchange rates; however, the change would be materially offset by the cross currency interest rate swaps in other assets or other liabilities. In the current economic environment, volatility in the spread between spot and forward foreign exchange rates has resulted in material mark to market impacts to current period earnings which have not been factored into the above analysis. The earnings impact is noncash, and at maturity of the instruments the cumulative mark to market impact will be zero. 92 Asset and Liability Funding Gap The tables below present our assets and liabilities (funding) arranged by underlying indices as of December 31, 2010. In the following GAAP presentation, the funding gap only includes derivatives that qualify as effective hedges (those derivatives which are reflected in net interest margin, as opposed to those reflected in the gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities, net line on the consolidated statements of income). The difference between the asset and the funding is the funding gap for the specified index. This represents our exposure to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk, which is the risk that the different indices may reset at different frequencies or may not move in the same direction or at the same magnitude. Management analyzes interest rate risk and in doing so includes all derivatives that are economically hedging our debt whether they qualify as effective hedges or not (Core Earnings basis). Accordingly, we are also presenting the asset and liability funding gap on a Core Earnings basis in the table that follows the GAAP presentation. GAAP Basis Frequency of Index Variable Funding (Dollars in billions) Resets Assets Funding(1) Gap 3 month Commercial paper daily $ 139.2 $ .1 $ 139.1 3 month Treasury bill weekly 8.2 8.2 Prime annual .8 .8 Prime quarterly 5.4 5.4 Prime monthly 23.1 23.1 Prime daily 3.0 (3.0 ) PLUS Index annual .5 .5 3 month LIBOR daily 3 month LIBOR quarterly 132.1 (132.1 ) 1 month LIBOR monthly 7.3 15.3 (8.0 ) CMT/CPI Index monthly/quarterly 2.0 (2.0 ) Non Discrete reset(2) monthly 34.6 (34.6 ) Non Discrete reset(3) daily/weekly 11.5 2.3 9.2 Fixed Rate(4) 9.3 15.9 (6.6 ) Total $ 205.3 $ 205.3 $ (1) Funding includes all derivatives that qualify as hedges. (2) Funding consists of auction rate securities, the ABCP Facilities and the ED Conduit Program facility. (3) Assets include restricted and unrestricted cash equivalents and other overnight type instruments. Funding includes retail and other deposits and cash collateral held related to derivatives exposures that are recorded as a short term debt obligation. (4) Assets include receivables and other assets (including goodwill and acquired intangibles). Funding includes other liabilities and stockholders equity (excluding series B Preferred Stock). 93 The Funding Gaps in the above table are primarily interest rate mismatches in short term indices between our assets and liabilities. We address this issue typically through the use of basis swaps that typically convert quarterly reset three month LIBOR to other indices that are more correlated to our asset indices. These basis swaps do not qualify as effective hedges and as a result the effect on the funding index is not included in our interest margin and is therefore excluded from the GAAP presentation.

(3) Assets include restricted and unrestricted cash equivalents and other overnight type instruments. Funding includes retail and other deposits and cash collateral held related to derivatives exposures that are recorded as a short term debt obligation. (4) Assets include receivables and other assets (including goodwill and acquired intangibles). Funding includes other liabilities and stockholders equity (excluding series B Preferred Stock). We use interest rate swaps and other derivatives to achieve our risk management objectives. To the extent possible, we fund our assets with debt (in combination with derivatives) that has the same underlying index (index type and index reset frequency). When it is more economical, we also fund our assets with debt that has a different index and or reset frequency than the asset, but only in instances where we believe there is a high degree of correlation between the interest rate movement of the two indices. For example, we use daily reset three month LIBOR to fund a large portion of our daily reset three month commercial paper indexed assets. In addition, we use quarterly reset three month LIBOR to fund a portion of our quarterly reset Prime rate indexed Private Education Loans. We also use our monthly Non Discrete reset and 1 month LIBOR funding to fund various asset types. In using different index types and different index reset frequencies to fund our assets, we are exposed to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk, which is the risk that the different indices that may reset at different frequencies will not move in the same direction or at the same magnitude. While we believe that this risk is low, as all of these indices are short term with rate movements that are highly correlated over a long period of time, market disruptions can lead to a temporary divergence between indices as was experienced beginning in the second half of 2007 through the second quarter of 2009 with the commercial paper and LIBOR indices. As of December 31, 2010, we have approximately $92.6 billion of FFELP Loans indexed to three month commercial paper (3M CP) that are funded with debt indexed to 3M LIBOR. 94 Weighted Average Life The following table reflects the weighted average life for our earning assets and liabilities at December 31, 2010.

(2) Funding consists of auction rate securities, the ABCP Facilities and the ED Conduit Program facility. (3) Assets include restricted and unrestricted cash equivalents and other overnight type instruments. Funding includes retail and other deposits and cash collateral held related to derivatives exposures that are recorded as a short term debt obligation. (4) Assets include receivables and other assets (including goodwill and acquired intangibles). Funding includes other liabilities and stockholders equity (excluding series B Preferred Stock). We use interest rate swaps and other derivatives to achieve our risk management objectives. To the extent possible, we fund our assets with debt (in combination with derivatives) that has the same underlying index (index type and index reset frequency). When it is more economical, we also fund our assets with debt that has a different index and or reset frequency than the asset, but only in instances where we believe there is a high degree of correlation between the interest rate movement of the two indices. For example, we use daily reset three month LIBOR to fund a large portion of our daily reset three month commercial paper indexed assets. In addition, we use quarterly reset three month LIBOR to fund a portion of our quarterly reset Prime rate indexed Private Education Loans. We also use our monthly Non Discrete reset and 1 month LIBOR funding to fund various asset types. In using different index types and different index reset frequencies to fund our assets, we are exposed to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk, which is the risk that the different indices that may reset at different frequencies will not move in the same direction or at the same magnitude. While we believe that this risk is low, as all of these indices are short term with rate movements that are highly correlated over a long period of time, market disruptions can lead to a temporary divergence between indices as was experienced beginning in the second half of 2007 through the second quarter of 2009 with the commercial paper and LIBOR indices. As of December 31, 2010, we have approximately $92.6 billion of FFELP Loans indexed to three month commercial paper (3M CP) that are funded with debt indexed to 3M LIBOR. 94 Weighted Average Life The following table reflects the weighted average life for our earning assets and liabilities at December 31, 2010.
