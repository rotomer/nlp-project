Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management Overview In November 2004, Mr. Jack D. Michaels was elected Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Snap on, after having previously served as a member of Snap ons Board of Directors since 1998. Shortly thereafter, Snap on announced near term priorities to improve operating efficiencies, respond to customer needs and market changes more quickly, address performance issues in its commercial and industrial businesses, and generally accelerate the pace of change towards achieving long term profitable growth. During 2005, measurable progress in each of these areas was realized. Significant improvement was made in first time fill rates an important element of manufacturing effectiveness and in tracking service to customers and franchisees. As of year end 2005, fill rates in the Snap on Dealer Group improved 19%. Prior year fill rates had been adversely impacted by the disruption caused from the closure of two U.S. hand tool plants in 2004. Initiatives to improve organizational alignment and working capital, reduce complexity and lower costs were launched early in 2005. These efforts, coupled with the introduction of Rapid Continuous Improvement (RCI), resulted in a 120 basis point increase in operating earnings margin for the year, largely from the improvement achieved in the Commercial and Industrial Group and a 3.6% increase in sales per associate year over year, despite the lower sales volume in 2005. Operating earnings margin as a percent of revenue increased to 7.1% in 2005, as compared to 5.9% in 2004, despite a slight decline in total revenue from prior year levels. Additionally, RCI is now becoming a part of the Snap on culture and is helping ensure that progress continues towards further improving manufacturing efficiencies and reducing costs. While this progress is encouraging, the company believes more must be done to improve Snap ons operating performance. Our strategic priorities and plans for 2006 continue to build on the improvement initiatives already underway in the Commercial and Industrial and the Diagnostics and Information Groups, while expanded efforts are being launched to strengthen the operating and financial performance of the Snap on Dealer Group. These priorities and plans are aimed at enabling us to continue the progress made in achieving our long term goals of profitably growing sales, further lowering costs, and maintaining strong cash flow. Significant progress has been made in improving the operating performance of the Commercial and Industrial Group. Snap on rationalized brands and the Groups operating footprint, moved toward lower cost sourcing and manufacturing, and created an integrated pan European marketing presence. Investments have also been made to support advanced technology products, such as Snap ons next generation tire and wheel service equipment introduced in the last two years, and to establish an operating presence in emerging growth markets such as China, India and Eastern Europe. As a result, Snap on is seeing improved levels of customer service, market penetration and profitability. While year over year segment revenue grew slightly (from $1.11 billion in 2004 to $1.13 billion in 2005), operating earnings grew to $69.6 million from $23.5 million in 2004. Snap ons 2006 plans for the Commercial and Industrial Group builds on this success and on the following strategic priorities: Continue to invest in emerging market growth initiatives; Increase market share in industrial tools through continued improvements in fill rates and product innovation, and by reaching new customers; Continue to invest in productivity enhancing products that utilize advanced technology; and Continue to rationalize the Groups operating footprint and move toward lower cost sourcing and manufacturing. 22 In the Diagnostics and Information Group, significant accomplishments have been made during the past three years as a result of our strategic focus on creating an integrated instrumentation with information business. Two thirds of the Groups engineering development is now concentrated on high value added data stream applications; Complexity and structural costs were reduced and faster product development cycles achieved; and Investments were made to support better business to business initiatives that include development and distribution of essential diagnostics and tools, and facilitation services for vehicle manufacturers and their dealership networks. For 2005, the Diagnostics and Information Groups segment revenue declined to $432.7 million from $487.0 million in 2004, reflecting the comparison against the successful global launch of new, Snap on brand diagnostics products in the prior year, as well as the impact of lower Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) facilitation sales year over year. Notwithstanding the lower sales, operating margin improved to 10.8% in 2005 as compared to 9.7% in the prior year. Strategic priorities for the Diagnostics and Information Group in 2006 will continue to emphasize process improvements and new products, such as the recent launch of the new Mitchell1 customer service programs. Snap on also expects to leverage its market leading capabilities to capitalize on the growing need for products and services related to advanced diagnostics, vehicle interface and data stream communications. In the Snap on Dealer Group, total revenue declined to $994.5 million in 2005 from $1.0 billion in the prior year, largely due to a decrease in the average number of U.S. franchise dealer vans in operation compared with the prior year. Despite the year over year revenue decline, operating earnings were $82.2 million in 2005 compared with $80.4 million in 2004. During 2005, considerable effort was made in the Snap on Dealer Group to evaluate and analyze marketplace data, the existing franchise business and its growth potential. These efforts reaffirmed the growth opportunities available to Snap on, as well as the competitive strengths of the company namely, the Snap on brand, the companys mobile van tool distribution system, which is the preferred distribution system for the automotive service industry, and the substantial breadth and experience of Snap ons franchisees. To fully capitalize on these strengths, the Snap on Dealer Group also concluded that more investment would enhance the companys responsiveness to its franchisees and customers, and identify better ways to assist franchisees in strengthening their businesses. Accordingly, Snap ons 2006 strategic priorities to increase sales and profitability for the Snap on Dealer Group are focused on the following: Continue on the companys existing path to improve and transform manufacturing and the supply chain into a market demand based replenishment system, with lower costs; Continue to improve service and value to franchisees and customers; Further enhance the sales and profitability of Snap ons franchisees; and Extend the Groups brand and product lines into targeted niche markets that are currently underdeveloped. Specific initiatives in each of these areas are underway. Snap on believes that by executing on these focus areas, along with a continued commitment to new innovative products and RCI to drive lower costs, the company and its franchisees will realize stronger growth and profitability. In 2005, Snap on also continued its emphasis on improving cash flow. Cash on hand at the end of 2005 increased to $170.4 million from $150.0 million at year end 2004. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities increased to $221.1 million from $146.8 million in 2004. The company used cash flow to, in part, pay dividends totaling $57.8 million and to repurchase 912,100 shares of Snap on common stock for $32.1 million. Snap on also retired $100 million of 6.625%, 10 year notes with available cash during the fourth quarter of 2005 upon their maturity, and invested $40.1 million in capital expenditures to largely improve manufacturing efficiency and flexibility. 23 Over the last several years, the company has also been focused on improving cash flow and asset utilization by making more effective use of its investment in certain working capital items. In 2005, Snap on made considerable progress in its efforts to further reduce inventory levels and days sales outstanding from the improvements attained in 2004. As of year end 2005, inventory decreased $58.7 million from prior year, including $19.2 million from currency translation, and days sales outstanding improved to 74 days from 81 days at year end 2004. Results of Operations Fiscal 2005 vs. Fiscal 2004 Highlights of Snap ons results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005 (fiscal 2005), and January 1, 2005 (fiscal 2004), are as follows: (Amounts in millions) 2005 2004 Increase/ (Decrease) Net sales $ 2,308.6 97.7 % $ 2,329.1 96.8 % $ (20.5 ) 0.9 % Financial services revenue 53.6 2.3 % 78.1 3.2 % (24.5 ) 31.4 % Total revenue 2,362.2 100.0 % 2,407.2 100.0 % (45.0 ) 1.9 % Cost of goods sold 1,288.7 54.6 % 1,319.8 54.8 % (31.1 ) 2.4 % Operating expenses 905.5 38.3 % 945.1 39.3 % (39.6 ) 4.2 % Operating earnings 168.0 7.1 % 142.3 5.9 % 25.7 18.1 % Interest expense 21.7 0.9 % 23.0 1.0 % (1.3 ) 5.7 % Other (income) expense net (1.7 ) 0.1 % (1.1 ) 0.1 % 0.6 54.5 % Earnings before income taxes 148.0 6.3 % 120.4 5.0 % 27.6 22.9 % Income tax expense 55.1 2.4 % 38.7 1.6 % 16.4 42.4 % Net earnings $ 92.9 3.9 % $ 81.7 3.4 % $ 11.2 13.7 % Total revenue in 2005 decreased $45.0 million, or 1.9%, from prior year levels due to lower financial services revenue of $24.5 million and lower net sales of $20.5 million. The $20.5 million decrease in net sales includes $33.1 million of lower sales partially offset by $12.6 million of favorable currency translation. The $33.1 million net sales decline principally reflects the impact of lower sales in the companys North American franchise operations along with lower sales in the OEM facilitation and worldwide equipment businesses, partially offset by increased sales of tools for industrial and commercial applications, including growth in emerging markets, and higher international dealer sales. Gross profit (defined as net sales less cost of goods sold) was $1,019.9 million, or 44.2% of net sales, in 2005, as compared to $1,009.3 million, or 43.3% in 2004. The $10.6 million, or 90 basis points (100 basis points equals 1.0 percent), improvement in year over year gross profit primarily reflects benefits from higher selling prices and lower costs, including benefits from efficiency and productivity initiatives of $15.4 million, higher last in, first out (LIFO) inventory benefits of $5.6 million, $3.2 million of favorable currency translation, and $2.5 million of lower pension, postretirement and insurance expenses due, in part, to favorable demographic changes in the companys U.S. hourly pension plans, including a decline in the number of participants. These year over year improvements in gross profit were partially offset by the impact of the lower sales volume, higher production costs in U.S. manufacturing facilities to improve order fill rates, and $22.3 million of higher steel costs. Restructuring costs included in Cost of goods sold on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings totaled $3.0 million in 2005, as compared to $16.0 million in 2004. Operating expenses in 2005 decreased $39.6 million, or 100 basis points as a percentage of total revenue, from prior year levels. The decline in year over year operating expenses primarily reflects benefits of $41.4 million from efficiency and cost reduction initiatives, $12.7 million of lower bad debt expense and dealer termination costs, as well as the absence, in 2005, of both the $3.6 million charge for the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) settlement and the $3.3 million of severance costs related to the November 2004 resignation of the companys former chairman, president and chief executive officer (former officer). These decreases in year over year operating expenses were partially offset by $6.9 million of higher pension, postretirement and insurance expenses, primarily due to demographic and actuarial assumption changes in the companys U.S. salaried pension plans, $5.0 million of higher freight costs, largely due to fuel surcharges and more frequent shipments to dealers, $4.0 million of unfavorable currency translation, and $3.0 million of costs to terminate a supplier relationship. Restructuring costs included in Operating expenses on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings totaled $16.3 million in 2005, as compared to $5.7 million in 2004. 24 Interest expense of $21.7 million in 2005 was lower than the $23.0 million incurred in 2004 primarily due to benefits from lower average debt levels, including the fourth quarter 2005 repayment of $100 million of unsecured 6.625% notes on October 3, 2005, partially offset by the impact of higher year over year interest rates. Other income (expense) net was income of $1.7 million in 2005, as compared to income of $1.1 million in 2004. This line item includes the impact of all non operating items such as interest income, minority interest, hedging and currency exchange rate transaction gains and losses, and other miscellaneous non operating items. Benefits from higher year over year interest income and foreign exchange gains in 2005, as compared with foreign exchange losses in 2004, were partially offset by an increase in minority interest expense. Minority interest expense was $3.6 million in 2005, as compared to $2.0 million in 2004. Snap ons effective tax rate of 37.2% for 2005 included $3.3 million of additional U.S. income tax expense related to the repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the AJCA). Under the provisions of the AJCA, Snap on repatriated approximately $93 million of qualifying dividends during the second half of 2005. Snap ons effective tax rate of 32.1% in 2004 benefited from the conclusion of prior year tax matters. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of income taxes. Exit or Disposal Activities For a discussion of Snap ons exit and disposal activities, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment Results Snap ons business segments are based on the organization structure used by management for making operating and investment decisions and for assessing performance. Snap ons reportable business segments include: (i) the Snap on Dealer Group; (ii) the Commercial and Industrial Group; (iii) the Diagnostics and Information Group; and (iv) Financial Services. The Snap on Dealer Group consists of Snap ons business operations serving the worldwide franchised dealer van channel. The Commercial and Industrial Group consists of the business operations providing tools and equipment products and equipment repair services to a broad range of industrial and commercial customers worldwide through direct, distributor and other non franchised distribution channels. The Diagnostics and Information Group consists of the business operations providing diagnostics equipment, vehicle service information, business management systems, and other solutions for vehicle service to customers in the worldwide vehicle service and repair marketplace. Financial Services consists of the business operations of Snap on Credit LLC (SOC), a consolidated, 50% owned joint venture between Snap on and The CIT Group, Inc. (CIT), and Snap ons wholly owned finance subsidiaries in those international markets where Snap on has dealer operations. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of SOC. Snap on evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment revenues and operating earnings, exclusive of financing activities and income taxes. Segment revenues are defined as total revenues, including both external customer revenue and intersegment revenue. Segment operating earnings are defined as segment revenues less cost of goods sold and operating expenses, including restructuring costs. Snap on accounts for intersegment sales and transfers based primarily on standard costs with reasonable mark ups established between the segments. Identifiable assets by segment are those assets used in the respective reportable segments operations. Intersegment amounts are eliminated to arrive at consolidated financial results. 25 Due to changes in Snap ons management organization structure, Snap on realigned its business segments during the first quarter of fiscal 2005. The primary changes included the transfer of Snap ons technical representative (tech rep) support organization from the Snap on Dealer Group to the Diagnostics and Information Group and the segregation of Snap ons general corporate expenses from the operating earnings of the business segments. Prior to fiscal 2005, shared services and general corporate expenses and corporate assets were allocated to the business segments based on segment revenues. Beginning in fiscal 2005, the business segments are charged only for those shared services utilized by the business segment based on an estimate of the value of services provided; general corporate expenses and corporate assets are not allocated to the business segments. Corporate assets consist principally of those assets that are centrally managed including cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, pension assets and income taxes, as well as corporate real estate and related assets. Prior year financial data by segment has been restated to reflect these reportable business segment realignments. Snap on Dealer Group (Amounts in millions) 2005 2004 Increase/ (Decrease) External revenue $ 994.5 100.0 % $ 1,020.6 100.0 % $ (26.1 ) 2.6 % Intersegment revenue Total segment revenue 994.5 100.0 % 1,020.6 100.0 % (26.1 ) 2.6 % Cost of goods sold 548.9 55.2 % 573.4 56.2 % (24.5 ) 4.3 % Gross profit 445.6 44.8 % 447.2 43.8 % (1.6 ) 0.4 % Operating expenses 363.4 36.5 % 366.8 35.9 % (3.4 ) 0.9 % Segment operating earnings $ 82.2 8.3 % $ 80.4 7.9 % $ 1.8 2.2 % Total segment revenue in 2005 decreased $26.1 million, or 2.6%, from prior year levels. The year over year decrease reflects $30.8 million of lower sales, primarily due to a lower average number of U.S. dealer vans in operation in 2005, partially offset by higher sales in international markets and $4.7 million of favorable currency translation. The number of U.S. dealer vans in operation at December 31, 2005, was down 5.8% from year end 2004 levels. Segment gross profit in 2005 decreased $1.6 million, but increased 100 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue, from prior year levels. The year over year decrease reflects the impact of the lower sales volume, higher production costs in U.S. manufacturing facilities to improve order fill rates and $9.8 million of higher steel costs. These declines in gross profit were partially offset by benefits from higher selling prices, an improved mix of higher margin diagnostics products, and lower depreciation, largely due to the absence of depreciation related to two U.S. hand tool facility closures in 2004. Gross profit in 2005 also benefited from $5.6 million of higher year over year LIFO benefits, $8.5 million in lower restructuring costs, $2.5 million of favorable currency translation and $2.2 million of lower pension, postretirement and insurance costs. Operating expenses for the Snap on Dealer Group decreased $3.4 million year over year, but increased 60 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue. The year over year decrease primarily includes benefits from efficiency and cost reduction initiatives of $9.1 million, lower bad debt expense and dealer termination costs of $4.4 million, and the operating expense impact from lower sales. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by $4.8 million in higher restructuring costs related to 2005 severance actions, $3.0 million of costs incurred in the first quarter of 2005 to terminate a supplier relationship, $4.3 million of higher freight costs and $1.9 million of unfavorable currency translation. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings in 2005 increased $1.8 million, or 40 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue, over prior year levels. 26 Commercial and Industrial Group (Amounts in millions) 2005 2004 Increase/ (Decrease) External revenue $ 1,009.0 89.4 % $ 987.2 88.9 % $ 21.8 2.2 % Intersegment revenue 120.2 10.6 % 123.0 11.1 % (2.8 ) 2.3 % Total segment revenue 1,129.2 100.0 % 1,110.2 100.0 % 19.0 1.7 % Cost of goods sold 734.7 65.1 % 735.2 66.2 % (0.5 ) 0.1 % Gross profit 394.5 34.9 % 375.0 33.8 % 19.5 5.2 % Operating expenses 324.9 28.7 % 351.5 31.7 % (26.6 ) 7.6 % Segment operating earnings $ 69.6 6.2 % $ 23.5 2.1 % $ 46.1 196.2 % Total segment revenue in 2005 increased $19.0 million, or 1.7%, over prior year levels. The year over year increase includes $11.1 million from higher sales and $7.9 million of favorable currency translation. The $11.1 million year over year sales increase primarily reflects higher sales and pricing of tools for industrial and commercial applications, including significant growth in emerging markets, and higher sales as a result of the launch of new power tool products. These year over year increases in sales were partially offset by lower equipment sales due primarily to a continued soft European market, the impact from certain discontinued products, and a decline in equipment servicing revenues. Segment gross profit in 2005 increased $19.5 million, or 110 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue, over prior year levels. Benefits from higher sales and pricing, as well as lower costs, including benefits from efficiency and productivity initiatives of $12.5 million and lower year over year restructuring costs of $3.9 million, were partially offset by $12.5 million of higher steel costs. Operating expenses for the Commercial and Industrial Group decreased $26.6 million or 300 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue. The improvement in year over year operating expenses includes benefits from efficiency and cost reduction initiatives of $20.0 million, lower bad debt expense of $7.4 million, and the absence of the $3.6 million GSA settlement charge incurred in 2004. These reductions in year over year operating expenses were partially offset by $2.2 million of increased freight costs, $2.1 million of unfavorable currency translation and $1.2 million of lower gains on sales of facilities. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings in 2005 increased $46.1 million over prior year levels. Diagnostics and Information Group (Amounts in millions) 2005 2004 Increase/ (Decrease) External revenue $ 305.1 70.5 % $ 321.3 66.0 % $ (16.2 ) 5.0 % Intersegment revenue 127.6 29.5 % 165.7 34.0 % (38.1 ) 23.0 % Total segment revenue 432.7 100.0 % 487.0 100.0 % (54.3 ) 11.1 % Cost of goods sold 252.9 58.4 % 299.9 61.6 % (47.0 ) 15.7 % Gross profit 179.8 41.6 % 187.1 38.4 % (7.3 ) 3.9 % Operating expenses 132.9 30.8 % 139.8 28.7 % (6.9 ) 4.9 % Segment operating earnings $ 46.9 10.8 % $ 47.3 9.7 % $ (0.4 ) 0.8 % Total segment revenue in 2005 decreased $54.3 million, or 11.1%, from prior year levels, including $54.8 million of lower sales partially offset by $0.5 million of favorable currency translation. The $54.8 million sales decline primarily reflects the comparison against the 2004 successful launch of new, Snap on brand diagnostics products, lower sales in the OEM facilitation business and state emission program updates that were not repeated in 2005. Segment gross profit in 2005 decreased $7.3 million, but increased 320 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue, from prior year. The impact of lower sales and $1.3 million of higher freight costs was partially offset by benefits from lower costs, including benefits from efficiency and productivity initiatives of $4.8 million. Operating expenses for the Diagnostics and Information Group decreased $6.9 million, but increased 210 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue. Benefits from continuous improvement actions of $6.9 million and lower bad debt expense of $2.5 million were partially offset by $2.7 million of higher year over year restructuring costs. As a result, segment operating earnings in 2005 decreased $0.4 million, but increased 110 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue, from prior year levels. 27 Financial Services Increase/ (Amounts in millions) 2005 2004 (Decrease) Segment revenue $ 53.6 100.0 % $ 78.1 100.0 % $ (24.5 ) 31.4 % Operating expenses 37.9 70.7 % 44.0 56.3 % (6.1 ) 13.9 % Segment operating earnings $ 15.7 29.3 % $ 34.1 43.7 % $ (18.4 ) 54.0 % Segment revenues and operating earnings were $53.6 million and $15.7 million in 2005, down $24.5 million and $18.4 million from prior year levels, primarily due to the impact of higher year over year interest rates in Snap ons domestic financing business, as well as an 11.4% decline in credit originations. Corporate Snap ons general corporate expenses totaled $46.4 million in 2005, up from $43.0 million in 2004. Savings realized from cost reduction initiatives, as well as the absence, in 2005, of $3.3 million of severance costs related to the resignation of a former officer, were more than offset by higher pension and postretirement costs of $8.8 million primarily due to demographic and actuarial assumption changes in the companys U.S. salaried pension plans, higher mark to market adjustments and other adjustments on stock based incentive and deferred compensation plans of $2.5 million, and higher year over year restructuring costs of $1.3 million. In addition, Snap ons North American based Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system became fully depreciated mid year 2004, resulting in lower depreciation expense year over year. Fourth Quarter Highlights of Snap ons results of operations for the quarters ended December 31, 2005, and January 1, 2005, are as follows: Three Months Ended Increase/ (Amounts in millions) December 31, 2005 January 1, 2005 (Decrease) Net sales $ 563.4 98.2 % $ 591.8 97.0 % $ (28.4 ) 4.8 % Financial services revenue 10.2 1.8 % 18.2 3.0 % (8.0 ) 44.0 % Total revenue 573.6 100.0 % 610.0 100.0 % (36.4 ) 6.0 % Cost of goods sold 316.2 55.1 % 327.1 53.7 % (10.9 ) 3.3 % Operating expenses 213.8 37.3 % 244.9 40.1 % (31.1 ) 12.7 % Operating earnings 43.6 7.6 % 38.0 6.2 % 5.6 14.7 % Interest expense 4.6 0.8 % 5.6 0.9 % (1.0 ) 17.9 % Other (income) expense net (3.9 ) 0.7 % (4.7 ) 0.8 % (0.8 ) 17.0 % Earnings before income taxes 42.9 7.5 % 37.1 6.1 % 5.8 15.6 % Income tax expense 15.5 2.7 % 13.1 2.2 % 2.4 18.3 % Net earnings $ 27.4 4.8 % $ 24.0 3.9 % $ 3.4 14.2 % Total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2005 decreased $36.4 million, or 6.0%, from prior year levels due to lower net sales of $28.4 million and lower financial services revenue of $8.0 million. The $28.4 million decrease in net sales includes $14.4 million of unfavorable currency translation and $14.0 million of lower sales. The $14.0 million net sales decline principally reflects the impact of lower sales in the companys North American dealer operations, along with lower sales in the OEM facilitation and worldwide equipment businesses and lower diagnostics products sales. These year over year sales declines were partially offset by higher sales of hand tools for industrial and commercial applications and growth in emerging markets. Financial services revenue in 2005 declined $8.0 million from 2004 levels, primarily reflecting the impact of higher interest rates in Snap ons domestic financing business, as well as the impact of lower credit originations. 28 Gross profit decreased $17.5 million, or 80 basis points, from prior year levels, primarily reflecting the impact of lower sales, higher production costs in U.S. manufacturing facilities to improve order fill rates, $6.1 million of unfavorable currency translation and $3.9 million of higher steel costs. These declines in gross profit were partially offset by benefits from higher pricing, as well as efficiency and productivity initiatives of $4.5 million and $3.6 million of higher year over year LIFO benefits. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2005 decreased $31.1 million, or 280 basis points as a percentage of total revenue, from the fourth quarter of 2004. The year over year improvement in operating expenses primarily reflects benefits of $12.3 million from efficiency and cost reduction initiatives, $6.8 million of lower bad debt expense and dealer termination costs, $4.8 million of favorable currency translation, lower restructuring costs of $1.4 million and the absence, in 2005, of $3.3 million of severance costs related to the resignation of a former officer. These improvements in operating expenses were partially offset by higher pension, postretirement and insurance expenses of $3.1 million, higher freight costs of $1.4 million, and lower year over year gains on the sales of facilities of $1.1 million. Interest expense of $4.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 was down slightly from the $5.6 million incurred in the fourth quarter of 2004, primarily due to the repayment of $100 million of unsecured notes on October 3, 2005, partially offset by the impact of higher year over year interest rates. Other income (expense) net was income of $3.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, as compared to income of $4.7 million in the comparable prior year period, primarily due to higher minority interest expense in 2005, partially offset by favorable year over year foreign exchange transaction gains and other miscellaneous non operating items. Snap ons effective tax rate of 36.1% in the fourth quarter of 2005 included $0.5 million of additional U.S. income tax expense as the actual amount of foreign dividends repatriated under the AJCA during 2005 was approximately $18 million higher than earlier estimates. Snap ons effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2004 was 35.3%. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of income taxes. Snap on Dealer Group Three Months Ended Increase/ (Amounts in millions) December 31, 2005 January 1, 2005 (Decrease) External revenue $ 233.3 100.0 % $ 247.7 100.0 % $ (14.4 ) 5.8 % Intersegment revenue Total segment revenue 233.3 100.0 % 247.7 100.0 % (14.4 ) 5.8 % Cost of goods sold 130.4 55.9 % 134.8 54.4 % (4.4 ) 3.3 % Gross profit 102.9 44.1 % 112.9 45.6 % (10.0 ) 8.9 % Operating expenses 82.3 35.3 % 90.2 36.4 % (7.9 ) 8.8 % Segment operating earnings $ 20.6 8.8 % $ 22.7 9.2 % $ (2.1 ) 9.3 % Total segment revenue in the fourth quarter of 2005 decreased $14.4 million, or 5.8%, from prior year levels, including lower sales of $12.1 million and unfavorable currency translation of $2.3 million. Sales in the North American franchise businesses were down 4.9% year over year, primarily due to a lower average number of U.S. dealer vans in operation. Sales in the international franchise businesses decreased 9.5% year over year, largely due to unfavorable currency translation. 29 Segment gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2005 decreased $10.0 million, or 150 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue, from prior year levels. The year over year decrease reflects the impact of the lower sales volume, higher production costs in U.S. manufacturing facilities to improve order fill rates and $1.4 million of higher steel costs. These declines in gross profit were partially offset by benefits from higher selling prices and $3.6 million of higher year over year LIFO benefits. Operating expenses for the Snap on Dealer Group decreased $7.9 million or 110 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue. The $7.9 million decrease primarily reflects benefits of $4.4 million from efficiency and cost reduction initiatives, $1.8 million of lower bad debt expense and dealer termination costs and lower expenses from the lower sales. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by $1.7 million of higher freight expense, largely due to fuel surcharges and more frequent shipments to dealers. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005 decreased $2.1 million, or 40 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2004. Commercial and Industrial Group Three Months Ended Increase/ (Amounts in millions) December 31, 2005 January 1, 2005 (Decrease) External revenue $ 254.3 91.4 % $ 258.5 89.4 % $ (4.2 ) 1.6 % Intersegment revenue 23.9 8.6 % 30.8 10.6 % (6.9 ) 22.4 % Total segment revenue 278.2 100.0 % 289.3 100.0 % (11.1 ) 3.8 % Cost of goods sold 178.1 64.0 % 188.3 65.1 % (10.2 ) 5.4 % Gross profit 100.1 36.0 % 101.0 34.9 % (0.9 ) 0.9 % Operating expenses 77.2 27.8 % 88.5 30.6 % (11.3 ) 12.8 % Segment operating earnings $ 22.9 8.2 % $ 12.5 4.3 % $ 10.4 83.2 % Total segment revenue in the fourth quarter of 2005 decreased $11.1 million, or 3.8%, from prior year levels, of which $10.6 million was due to unfavorable currency translation. Increased sales of hand tools for commercial and industrial applications worldwide were offset by a decline in vehicle service equipment sales. Segment gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2005 decreased $0.9 million from prior year, but increased 110 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue. The year over year decrease in segment gross profit primarily reflects $4.5 million of unfavorable currency translation, $2.5 million of higher steel costs and $1.9 million of other inflationary price increases. These declines in gross margin were partially offset by benefits of $3.6 million from product cost reduction and facilities rationalization and consolidation initiatives, higher pricing, and $0.9 million of lower year over year restructuring costs. Operating expenses for the Commercial and Industrial Group decreased $11.3 million or 280 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue. The improvement in year over year operating expenses primarily includes $4.0 million of lower bad debt expense, $3.4 million of benefits from efficiency and productivity initiatives, $3.1 million of favorable currency translation and $1.6 million of lower restructuring costs. These improvements in year over year operating expenses were partially offset by $1.5 million of lower gains on sales of facilities in 2005 and by continued investment spending to support Snap ons growth strategy in Asia and other emerging markets. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005 increased $10.4 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2004. 30 Diagnostics and Information Group Three Months Ended Increase/ (Amounts in millions) December 31, 2005 January 1, 2005 (Decrease) External revenue $ 75.8 75.3 % $ 85.6 68.5 % $ (9.8 ) 11.4 % Intersegment revenue 24.9 24.7 % 39.3 31.5 % (14.4 ) 36.6 % Total segment revenue 100.7 100.0 % 124.9 100.0 % (24.2 ) 19.4 % Cost of goods sold 56.5 56.1 % 74.1 59.3 % (17.6 ) 23.8 % Gross profit 44.2 43.9 % 50.8 40.7 % (6.6 ) 13.0 % Operating expenses 32.1 31.9 % 38.4 30.8 % (6.3 ) 16.4 % Segment operating earnings $ 12.1 12.0 % $ 12.4 9.9 % $ (0.3 ) 2.4 % Total segment revenue in the fourth quarter of 2005 decreased $24.2 million, or 19.4%, from prior year levels, including $22.6 million of lower sales and $1.6 million of unfavorable currency translation. The $22.6 million sales decline primarily reflects the comparison against the third quarter 2004 successful launch of new, Snap on brand diagnostics products, as well as the impact of lower OEM facilitation sales year over year. Segment gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2005 decreased $6.6 million, but increased 320 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue, from the same period last year, largely due to the lower sales and unfavorable currency translation of $0.8 million, partially offset by benefits from efficiency and productivity initiatives of $2.6 million. Operating expenses for the Diagnostics and Information Group decreased $6.3 million, but increased 110 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue, primarily due to $2.9 million of lower bad debt expense, $1.7 million of benefits from efficiency and productivity initiatives and $0.8 million of favorable currency translation. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005 decreased $0.3 million, but increased 210 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2004. Financial Services Three Months Ended Increase/ (Amounts in millions) December 31, 2005 January 1, 2005 (Decrease) Segment revenue $ 10.2 100.0 % $ 18.2 100.0 % $ (8.0 ) 44.0 % Operating expenses 7.4 72.5 % 12.0 65.9 % (4.6 ) 38.3 % Segment operating earnings $ 2.8 27.5 % $ 6.2 34.1 % $ (3.4 ) 54.8 % Segment revenues and operating earnings were $10.2 million and $2.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, down $8.0 million and $3.4 million from prior year levels, primarily due to the impact of higher year over year interest rates in Snap ons domestic financing business, as well as an 11.9% decline in credit originations. Corporate Snap ons general corporate expenses totaled $14.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, down $1.0 million from $15.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Savings realized from cost reduction initiatives, as well as the absence, in 2005, of $3.3 million of severance costs related to the resignation of a former officer, were more than offset by higher pension and postretirement costs of $3.6 million and higher year over year restructuring costs of $0.7 million. 31 Fiscal 2004 vs. Fiscal 2003 The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued interpretation (FIN) No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (an interpretation of ARB No. 51) in December 2003, which became effective for Snap on at the beginning of its 2004 fiscal year. FIN No. 46R provides consolidation guidance regarding the identification of variable interest entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights. Based on the companys analysis of FIN No. 46R, the company concluded that Snap on would consolidate SOC as of January 4, 2004, the beginning of Snap ons 2004 fiscal year. Snap on previously accounted for SOC, a 50% owned joint venture, using the equity method. As Snap on consolidated SOC on a prospective basis, previously issued financial statements have not been restated. As a result of the consolidation of SOC in fiscal 2004, Snap on began reporting the results of its finance operations as a new business segment, Financial Services. The impact of the consolidation of SOC on Snap ons consolidated balance sheet was not significant. See Notes 2, 7 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of SOC and Snap ons business segments. Highlights of Snap ons results of operations for the fiscal years ended January 1, 2005 (fiscal 2004), and January 3, 2004 (fiscal 2003), are as follows: (Amounts in millions) 2004 2003 Increase/(Decrease) Net sales $ 2,329.1 96.8 % $ 2,233.2 100.0 % $ 95.9 4.3 % Financial services revenue 78.1 3.2 % 78.1 NM Total revenue 2,407.2 100.0 % 2,233.2 100.0 % 174.0 7.8 % Cost of goods sold 1,319.8 54.8 % 1,268.5 56.8 % 51.3 4.0 % Operating expenses 945.1 39.3 % 858.4 38.4 % 86.7 10.1 % Net finance income 43.8 1.9 % (43.8 ) NM Operating earnings 142.3 5.9 % 150.1 6.7 % (7.8 ) 5.2 % Interest expense 23.0 1.0 % 24.4 1.1 % (1.4 ) 5.7 % Other (income) expense net (1.1 ) 0.1 % 9.0 0.4 % (10.1 ) NM Earnings before income taxes 120.4 5.0 % 116.7 5.2 % 3.7 3.2 % Income tax expense 38.7 1.6 % 38.0 1.7 % 0.7 1.8 % Net earnings $ 81.7 3.4 % $ 78.7 3.5 % $ 3.0 3.8 % NM Not Meaningful Snap ons 2004 fiscal year contained 52 weeks of operating results. Snap ons 2003 fiscal year contained 53 weeks of operating results, with the additional week occurring in the fourth quarter. The impact of the additional week of operations on full year 2003 operating earnings was not material. Total revenue in 2004 increased $174.0 million, or 7.8%, over prior year levels. Of the year over year increase, $86.6 million was attributable to currency translation, and $78.1 million resulted from the consolidation of SOC, previously accounted for under the equity method, and Snap ons wholly owned financial services subsidiaries. The year over year revenue increase also includes higher sales of handheld diagnostics tools, increased sales in the international dealer businesses, higher sales of equipment in North America, and higher sales of commercial and industrial tools in both Europe and Asia. These revenue increases were partially offset by lower sales in the U.S. dealer businesses and by lower sales of industrial tools in North America. Gross profit in 2004 increased $44.6 million, or 10 basis points, to 43.3% of net sales. The year over year improvement in gross profit reflects the impact of the higher sales, $31.1 million of currency translation, $9.6 million of net savings from cost reduction initiatives and $8.9 million in lower year over year restructuring costs. These improvements in gross profit were partially offset by $11.3 million in increased year over year steel costs, $10.2 million of higher expenses from production inefficiencies and other manufacturing variances associated with the relocation of production from the closure of two U.S. hand tool plants in March 2004, and lower LIFO benefits and other inventory costs totaling $7.6 million. 32 Operating expenses in 2004 increased $86.7 million, or 90 basis points as a percentage of total revenue, over prior year levels, including $44.0 million from the consolidation of SOC, previously accounted for under the equity method, and Snap ons wholly owned financial services subsidiaries. Foreign currency translation contributed $25.9 million to the year over year operating expense increase. Operating expenses in 2004 were also impacted by the higher sales, $3.6 million in costs associated with the settlement of two GSA contract audits and $3.5 million of higher freight costs, reflecting increased freight rates and smaller, but more frequent, shipments to dealers. In addition, operating expenses in 2004 included $3.5 million of higher start up costs associated with the companys expansion of its distribution system and operating presence in emerging markets and $3.3 million for severance costs related to the November 2004 resignation of a former officer. Interest expense was $23.0 million in 2004, down $1.4 million from $24.4 million in 2003. The year over year decline primarily reflects lower interest paid on dealer deposits. Other income (expense) net was income of $1.1 million in 2004, as compared to an expense of $9.0 million in 2003. This line item includes the impact of all non operating items such as interest income, minority interest, hedging and currency exchange rate transaction gains and losses, and other miscellaneous non operating items. The year over year change in other income (expense) includes $6.0 million of lower foreign exchange losses and $1.1 million of lower minority interests, along with higher interest and other income. Minority interests for 2004 and 2003 were $2.0 million and $3.1 million. Snap ons effective tax rates of 32.1% in 2004 and 32.6% in 2003 benefited from the conclusion of prior year tax matters in both years. Exit or Disposal Activities For a discussion of Snap ons exit and disposal activities, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment Results Snap ons business segments are based on the organization structure used by management for making operating and investment decisions and for assessing performance. Snap ons reportable business segments include: (i) the Snap on Dealer Group; (ii) the Commercial and Industrial Group; (iii) the Diagnostics and Information Group; and (iv) Financial Services. The Snap on Dealer Group consists of Snap ons business operations serving the worldwide franchised dealer van channel. The Commercial and Industrial Group consists of the business operations providing tools and equipment products and equipment repair services to a broad range of industrial and commercial customers worldwide through direct, distributor and other non franchised distribution channels. The Diagnostics and Information Group consists of the business operations providing diagnostics equipment, vehicle service information, business management systems and other solutions for vehicle service to customers in the worldwide vehicle service and repair marketplace. Financial Services, which consists of the business operations of SOC and Snap ons wholly owned finance subsidiaries in those international markets where Snap on has dealer operations, became a new business segment in fiscal 2004. Prior year segment disclosures were not restated to include the Financial Services segment due to the prospective adoption of FIN No. 46R. See Notes 2 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of SOC and the companys adoption of FIN No. 46R. Snap on evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment revenues and operating earnings, exclusive of financing activities and income taxes. Segment revenues are defined as total revenues, including both external customer revenue and intersegment revenue. Segment operating earnings are defined as segment revenues less cost of goods sold and operating expenses, including restructuring costs. Snap on accounts for intersegment sales and transfers based primarily on standard costs with reasonable mark ups established between the segments. Identifiable assets by segment are those assets used in the respective reportable segments operations. Intersegment amounts are eliminated to arrive at consolidated financial results. 33 Due to changes in Snap ons management organization structure, Snap on realigned its business segments during the first quarter of fiscal 2005. The primary changes included the transfer of Snap ons tech rep organization from the Snap on Dealer Group to the Diagnostics and Information Group and the segregation of Snap ons general corporate expenses from the operating earnings of the business segments. Prior to fiscal 2005, shared services and general corporate expenses and corporate assets were allocated to the business segments based on segment revenues. Beginning in fiscal 2005, the business segments are charged only for those shared services utilized by the business segment based on an estimate of the value of services provided; general corporate expenses and corporate assets are not allocated to the business segments. Corporate assets consist principally of those assets that are centrally managed including cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, pension assets and income taxes, as well as corporate real estate and related assets. The accompanying 2004 and 2003 financial data by segment has been restated to reflect the 2005 reportable business segment realignments. Snap on Dealer Group (Amounts in millions) 2004 2003 Increase/(Decrease) External revenue $ 1,020.6 100.0 % $ 1,013.3 100.0 % $ 7.3 0.7 % Intersegment revenue Total segment revenue 1,020.6 100.0 % 1,013.3 100.0 % 7.3 0.7 % Cost of goods sold 573.4 56.2 % 556.4 54.9 % 17.0 3.1 % Gross profit 447.2 43.8 % 456.9 45.1 % (9.7 ) 2.1 % Operating expenses 366.8 35.9 % 369.2 36.4 % (2.4 ) 0.7 % Segment operating earnings $ 80.4 7.9 % $ 87.7 8.7 % $ (7.3 ) 8.3 % Total segment revenue in 2004 increased $7.3 million, or 0.7%, over prior year levels due to $22.7 million of currency translation partially offset by a sales decrease of $15.4 million. In the United States, sales were 3.5% lower year over year. The average number of U.S. dealer vans in operation during 2004 was down 4% from year end 2003, primarily due to a lower level of new dealer additions in 2004. During the first quarter of 2004, Snap on tightened eligibility requirements for its franchise dealer expansion and enhancement initiative and the recruitment standards for prospective dealers, aimed at improving the strength of its franchised dealer network. In the companys non U.S. dealer businesses, segment revenue increased $34.4 million year over year, including $22.7 million from currency translation. Segment gross profit in 2004 decreased $9.7 million, or 130 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue, from last year, reflecting the impact of lower sales volume and $8.6 million of higher costs associated with production inefficiencies and other manufacturing variances related to the relocation of production from two U.S. hand tool plants. Segment gross profit in 2004 was also impacted by $4.1 million of lower year over year LIFO benefits and other inventory costs and by $7.7 million from increased steel costs. These higher costs were partially offset by $8.4 million of currency translation, $13.1 million in lower year over year restructuring costs and $1.3 million of lower pension, postretirement and other insurance costs. Operating expenses for the Snap on Dealer Group decreased $2.4 million year over year, down 50 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue. The $2.4 million decrease includes the operating expense impact from lower sales volume, as well as $8.0 million of lower bad debt expense and $2.3 million in lower year over year restructuring costs. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by $6.8 million of currency translation and $3.4 million of higher freight expense, reflecting increased freight rates and smaller, but more frequent, shipments to dealers. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings in 2004 decreased $7.3 million, or 80 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue, as compared to the prior year. 34 Commercial and Industrial Group (Amounts in millions) 2004 2003 Increase/(Decrease) External revenue $ 987.2 88.9 % $ 916.5 88.5 % $ 70.7 7.7 % Intersegment revenue 123.0 11.1 % 119.3 11.5 % 3.7 3.1 % Total segment revenue 1,110.2 100.0 % 1,035.8 100.0 % 74.4 7.2 % Cost of goods sold 735.2 66.2 % 684.7 66.1 % 50.5 7.4 % Gross profit 375.0 33.8 % 351.1 33.9 % 23.9 6.8 % Operating expenses 351.5 31.7 % 318.7 30.8 % 32.8 10.3 % Segment operating earnings $ 23.5 2.1 % $ 32.4 3.1 % $ (8.9 ) 27.5 % Total segment revenue in 2004 increased $74.4 million, or 7.2%, over prior year levels, due to $56.3 million of currency translation and $18.1 million in higher sales. Demand for tools improved in both North America and Europe in 2004, despite lower sales of industrial tools in North America. In addition, higher sales of vehicle service equipment were achieved in North America through the companys Technical Automotive Group (TAG) distribution channel, which was launched mid year 2003. Segment gross profit in 2004 increased $23.9 million, but decreased 10 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue. Benefits realized from higher sales, $19.5 million of currency translation, $4.2 million of lower inventory costs and $2.7 million from cost reduction initiatives were partially offset by $6.2 million of higher year over year restructuring costs, $3.1 million of increased steel costs and $2.3 million of increased freight costs. Operating expenses for the Commercial and Industrial Group increased $32.8 million or 90 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue. The increase in operating expenses reflects the impact of higher sales, $16.2 million of currency translation, $6.3 million in higher bad debt expense, $3.6 million of costs associated with the GSA contract audits settlement and a $3.6 million year over year increase in restructuring costs, partially offset by $2.9 million of benefits from cost reduction initiatives and a $2.9 million year over year increase in gains on the sales of facilities. Operating expenses were also impacted by $3.5 million of start up costs associated with the companys investment to expand its distribution and operating presence in emerging markets. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings in 2004 decreased $8.9 million as compared to 2003. Diagnostics and Information Group (Amounts in millions) 2004 2003 Increase/(Decrease) External revenue $ 321.3 66.0 % $ 303.4 67.6 % $ 17.9 5.9 % Intersegment revenue 165.7 34.0 % 145.5 32.4 % 20.2 13.9 % Total segment revenue 487.0 100.0 % 448.9 100.0 % 38.1 8.5 % Cost of goods sold 299.9 61.6 % 292.2 65.1 % 7.7 2.6 % Gross profit 187.1 38.4 % 156.7 34.9 % 30.4 19.4 % Operating expenses 139.8 28.7 % 134.6 30.0 % 5.2 3.9 % Segment operating earnings $ 47.3 9.7 % $ 22.1 4.9 % $ 25.2 114.0 % Total segment revenue in 2004 increased $38.1 million, or 8.5%, over prior year levels due to $28.1 million in higher sales, principally of handheld diagnostics, and $10.0 million of currency translation. Segment gross profit in 2004 increased $30.4 million, or 350 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue, from prior year, largely reflecting the growth in sales of handheld diagnostics and information products, $8.1 million of benefits from cost reduction initiatives and $3.2 million of currency translation. Segment gross profit also benefited from $2.9 million in lower year over year costs for restructuring, primarily reflecting the absence of costs incurred in 2003 for the closure of the segments large platform diagnostics facility. Operating expenses for the Diagnostics and Information Group increased $5.2 million, but decreased 130 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue, reflecting $2.8 million of currency translation, $2.5 million from the absence of gains realized from the sale of facilities in 2003 and $2.1 million of higher bad debt expense. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings in 2004 increased $25.2 million, or 480 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue, as compared to the prior year. 35 Financial Services (Amounts in millions) 2004 Segment revenue $ 78.1 100.0 % Operating expenses 44.0 56.3 % Segment operating earnings $ 34.1 43.7 % Segment operating earnings in 2004 were $34.1 million. Net finance income was $43.8 million in 2003. Operating earnings for 2004 decreased year over year primarily due to lower loan originations and higher market interest rates. Snap on believes that the decline in loan originations is primarily due to sales mix in the Snap on Dealer Group and a reduced level of dealer borrowings as a result of the strengthening fiscal health of dealers, combined with the tightening of both the eligibility requirements for franchise dealer expansion and the recruitment standards for new prospective dealers. Corporate Snap ons general corporate expenses totaled $43.0 million in 2004, up $7.1 million from $35.9 million in 2003. Savings realized from lower pension and postretirement expense of $5.4 million, primarily due to benefits from changes in actuarial assumptions as a result of higher plan asset returns and favorable demographic changes, were more then offset by higher accounting and audit related costs related to the companys evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, $3.3 million of severance costs related to the resignation of a former officer, and higher mark to market adjustments on stock based incentive and other compensation plans. Financial Condition Snap ons growth has historically been funded by a combination of cash provided by operating activities and debt financing. Snap on believes that its cash from operations, coupled with its sources of borrowings, are sufficient to fund its anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, restructuring activities, acquisitions, common stock repurchases and dividend payments. Due to Snap ons credit rating over the years, external funds have been available at a reasonable cost. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, Snap ons long term debt and commercial paper was rated A2 and P 1 by Moodys Investors Service and A and A 1 by Standard & Poors. Snap on believes that the strength of its balance sheet affords the company the financial flexibility to respond to both internal growth opportunities and those available through acquisitions. 36 The following discussion focuses on information included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Snap on has been focused on improving asset utilization by making more effective use of its investment in certain working capital items. As of December 31, 2005, working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) of $566.8 million was up $48.4 million from $518.4 million as of January 1, 2005 (fiscal 2004 year end). The company assesses managements operating performance and effectiveness relative to those components of working capital, particularly accounts receivable and inventories, that are more directly impacted by operational decisions. The following represents the companys working capital position as of December 31, 2005, and January 1, 2005. (Amounts in millions) 2005 2004 Cash $ 170.4 $ 150.0 Accounts receivable net of allowances 485.9 542.0 Inventories 283.2 341.9 Other current assets 133.4 158.7 Total current assets 1,072.9 1,192.6 Accounts payable (135.4 ) (194.9 ) Notes payable and current maturities of long term debt (24.8 ) (127.8 ) Other current liabilities (345.9 ) (351.5 ) Total current liabilities (506.1 ) (674.2 ) Total working capital $ 566.8 $ 518.4 Accounts receivable at the end of 2005 was $485.9 million, down $56.1 million from year end 2004 levels, largely reflecting an improvement in days sales outstanding from 81 days at year end 2004 to 74 days at year end 2005 and a $23.6 million decrease from currency translation. Inventories totaled $283.2 million at the end of 2005, down $58.7 million from year end 2004 levels, including $19.2 million from currency translation. The decrease in inventories from year end 2004 primarily reflects the companys efforts to increase inventory turns, reduce on hand inventory levels and improve inventory management through just in time raw material delivery. Inventories accounted for using the first in, first out (FIFO) method as of December 31, 2005, and January 1, 2005, approximated 63% and 65% of total inventories. All other inventories are accounted for using the LIFO cost method. The companys LIFO reserve increased from $76.3 million at January 1, 2005, to $82.1 million at December 31, 2005. Inventory turns (full year cost of goods sold, divided by the average of the beginning and ending inventory balances for the year) at December 31, 2005, were 4.1 turns as compared to 3.8 turns at year end 2004. Accounts payable at December 31, 2005, was $135.4 million, down $59.5 million from year end 2004 levels due to the timing of payments and an $8.7 million decrease from currency translation. Notes payable and long term debt at December 31, 2005, and January 1, 2005, totaled $226.5 million and $331.0 million. Notes payable to banks under uncommitted lines of credit totaled $20.9 million at December 31, 2005, and $2.5 million at January 1, 2005. Amounts payable to CIT pursuant to a working capital agreement with SOC totaled $3.9 million at December 31, 2005. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of SOC. At January 1, 2005, Snap on had commercial paper outstanding of $25 million. Snap on repaid $25 million of commercial paper borrowings in the second quarter of 2005; no commercial paper was outstanding at December 31, 2005. On October 3, 2005, Snap on repaid its $100 million, 10 year, 6.625% unsecured notes upon their maturity. The $100 million debt repayment was made with available cash on hand; the company did not borrow any funds under its existing credit facilities or committed bank lines of credit to fund the debt repayment. 37 At December 31, 2005, Snap on had a $400 million multi currency revolving credit facility that terminates on July 27, 2009. The $400 million multi currency revolving credit facilitys financial covenant requires that Snap on maintain a ratio of debt to the sum of total debt plus shareholders equity of not greater than 0.60 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2005, Snap on believes that it was in compliance with all covenants of this revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2005, Snap on also had $20 million of unused committed bank lines of credit, of which $10 million expires on July 31, 2006, and $10 million expires on August 31, 2006. At December 31, 2005, Snap on had approximately $420 million of unused available debt capacity under the terms of its revolving credit facility and committed bank lines of credit. Snap on maintains sufficient committed lines of credit and liquidity facilities to cover its expected funding needs on both a short term and long term basis. Snap on manages its aggregate short term borrowings so as not to exceed its availability under its revolving credit facility and committed lines of credit. The company accesses short term debt markets, predominantly through commercial paper issuances, to fund its short term requirements and to ensure near term liquidity. Near term liquidity requirements for Snap on in 2006 include the funding of its investments in capital expenditures, restructuring activities, and payments of dividends and share repurchases. Snap on expects to make contributions to its foreign pension plans in 2006 of $6.2 million; Snap on is not required to make a contribution to its domestic pension plans in 2006. Depending on market and other conditions, however, Snap on may elect to make discretionary cash contributions to its domestic pension plans in 2006. As funding needs are determined to be of a longer term nature, Snap on could access medium and long term debt markets, as appropriate, to refinance short term borrowings and, thus, replenish its short term liquidity. Snap ons long term financing strategy is to maintain continuous access to the debt markets to accommodate its liquidity needs. For additional information on Snap ons debt and credit facilities, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion focuses on information included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. Cash flow provided from operating activities was $221.1 million in 2005, as compared to $146.8 million in 2004. The increase in cash flow from operating activities in 2005 includes the impact of higher year over year net earnings and lower inventory levels, along with an increase in year over year cash flow from the impacts of combined net changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash flow from operating activities in 2004 included a $63.6 million voluntary U.S. pension contribution and a $10.0 million payment to the U.S. Department of Justice pursuant to an agreement to resolve a government audit relating to two contracts with the GSA, partially offset by a $10.7 million income tax refund, primarily resulting from a $78.2 million voluntary U.S. pension contribution made in the fourth quarter of 2003. Cash flow from operating activities in 2003 was $177.0 million, net of pension contributions of $92.2 million. The consolidation of SOC as of January 4, 2004, did not have a material impact on cash flow. Depreciation in 2005 was $49.5 million, compared with $58.5 million in 2004 and $58.2 million in 2003. The decline in 2005 depreciation from prior year levels reflects the absence of depreciation for both the companys North American based ERP system, which became fully depreciated mid year 2004, and the two U.S. hand tool facilities that were closed in 2004. Amortization expense was $2.7 million in 2005, $2.5 million in 2004 and $2.1 million in 2003. Capital expenditures in 2005 were $40.1 million, compared to $38.7 million in 2004 and $29.4 million in 2003. Capital expenditures in all three years reflect new product related, quality, efficiency and cost reduction capital investments, including the installation of new production equipment and machine tooling to enhance manufacturing and distribution operations, as well as ongoing replacements of manufacturing and distribution facilities and equipment. Snap on anticipates that 2006 capital expenditures will be in a range of $50 million to $55 million, including approximately $7 million to replace and enhance its existing global ERP management information system over a period of several years. Snap on believes that its cash generated from operations, as well as the funds available from its credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund the companys capital expenditure requirements in 2006. 38 Snap on has undertaken stock repurchases from time to time to offset dilution created by shares issued for employee and dealer stock purchase plans, stock options, and other corporate purposes, as well as to repurchase shares when the company believes market conditions are favorable. In 2005, Snap on repurchased 912,100 shares of common stock for $32.1 million under its previously announced share repurchase programs. As of December 31, 2005, Snap on has remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $136.7 million in common stock pursuant to the Board of Directors authorizations. The purchase of Snap on common stock is at the companys discretion, subject to prevailing financial and market conditions. Snap on repurchased 1,200,000 shares of common stock for $38.2 million in 2004 and 450,000 shares of common stock for $12.5 million in 2003. Snap on believes that its cash generated from operations, as well as the funds available from its credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund the companys share repurchases in 2006. On October 3, 2005, Snap on repaid its $100 million, 10 year, 6.625% unsecured notes upon their maturity. The $100 million debt repayment was made with available cash on hand; the company did not borrow any funds under its existing credit facilities or committed bank lines of credit to fund the debt repayment. Snap on has paid consecutive quarterly cash dividends, without interruption or reduction, since 1939. Cash dividends paid in 2005, 2004 and 2003 totaled $57.8 million, $57.7 million and $58.2 million. 2005 2004 2003 Cash dividends paid per common share $ 1.00 $ 1.00 $ 1.00 Cash dividends paid as a percent of prior year retained earnings 5.2 % 5.3 % 5.5 % On February 1, 2006, Snap on announced that its Board of Directors approved a $0.02 per share, or 8%, increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.27 per share. Snap on believes that its cash generated from operations, as well as the funds available from its credit facilities, will be sufficient to pay dividends in 2006. Contractual Obligations and Commitments A summary of Snap ons future contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2005, are as follows: (Amounts in millions) Total Less Than 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years More Than 5 Years Contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 201.7 $ $ $ $ 201.7 Interest on fixed rate debt 70.2 12.5 25.0 25.0 7.7 Operating leases 82.7 22.9 29.5 14.1 16.2 Capital leases 25.7 1.4 2.7 2.7 18.9 Purchase obligations 5.1 1.7 3.4 Total $ 385.4 $ 38.5 $ 60.6 $ 41.8 $ 244.5 Snap on entered into a 20 year, $25.7 million capital lease commitment in 2005 for office and distribution facilities for the Snap on Dealer Group operations in Japan. The impact of recording the capital lease commitment was excluded from the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow as the recording of the capital lease commitment was a non cash item. At December 31, 2005, $19.2 million of loans originated by SOC have a primary recourse provision to Snap on (primarily for dealer van loans) if the loans become more than 90 days past due. For information on SOC, long term debt and operating leases see Notes 2, 7, 10 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 39 Environmental Matters Snap on is subject to various federal, state and local government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Snap ons policy is to comply with these requirements, and the company believes that, as a general matter, its policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with its business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in some of Snap ons operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses. Snap on is and has been engaged in the handling, manufacture, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies. The company believes that, as a general matter, its handling, manufacture, use and disposal of these substances are in accordance with environmental laws and regulations. It is possible, however, that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could bring into question the companys handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these substances. Consolidated Joint Venture SOC, a consolidated, 50% owned joint venture between Snap on and CIT, provides a broad range of financial services to Snap ons U.S. dealer and customer network and to Snap ons industrial and other customers. Snap on began consolidating SOC as of January 4, 2004, the beginning of Snap ons 2004 fiscal year, as a result of the adoption of FIN No. 46R. Snap on previously accounted for SOC using the equity method. Snap on and CIT have identical voting and participation rights and responsibilities in SOC. See Notes 2 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of SOC. Snap on receives royalty and management fee income from SOC based on the volume of financings originated by SOC. Snap on also shares ratably with CIT in any residual net profit or loss of the joint venture after operating expenses, including royalty and management fees, interest costs and credit loss provisions. Snap on provides extended term financing internationally through its wholly owned finance subsidiaries. SOC sells substantially all of its originated contracts on a limited recourse basis to CIT, net of certain fees. SOC continues to service these contracts for an estimated market rate servicing fee. In 2005, SOC originated contracts totaling $413.8 million, as compared to $481.2 million in 2004 and $522.4 million in 2003. Financial information regarding SOC loan originations is as follows: 2005 2004 2003 Originations (Amounts in millions): Extended credit receivables $ 327.0 $ 371.9 $ 381.8 Equipment leases 41.1 44.5 38.6 Dealer financing 45.7 64.8 102.0 Total $ 413.8 $ 481.2 $ 522.4 Number of accounts outstanding: Extended credit receivables 172,147 183,502 186,356 Equipment leases 12,045 12,823 13,476 Dealer financing 3,477 3,866 3,765 Total 187,669 200,191 203,597 40 Snap on has credit risk exposure for certain SOC originated contracts with recourse provisions against Snap on (primarily for dealer van loans). At December 31, 2005, and January 1, 2005, $19.2 million and $14.8 million of loans, with terms ranging from six months to ten years, have a primary recourse provision to Snap on if the loans become more than 90 days past due. The asset value of the collateral underlying these recourse loans would serve to mitigate Snap ons loss in the event of default. The estimated fair value of the guarantees for all loan originations with recourse as of December 31, 2005, was not material. CIT and Snap on have agreed to lend funds to support SOCs working capital requirements on a 50/50 basis, with a combined maximum borrowing limit not to exceed $24 million. As of December 31, 2005, SOC owed both Snap on and CIT $3.9 million each pursuant to this agreement. Other Matters Government Contract Matters On July 23, 2004, Snap on reached an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice to resolve the government audit, previously discussed in the companys 2004 Annual Report on Form 10 K, relating to two contracts with the GSA. Snap on agreed to settle the claims over the interpretation and application of the price reduction and billing provisions of these two contracts for sales from March 1996 through the July 23, 2004, settlement date for $10.0 million. Snap on remitted the $10.0 million cash settlement to the U.S. Department of Justice on August 5, 2004. On February 8, 2005, the GSA requested information from Snap on to evaluate possible administrative action against the company. On May 24, 2005, Snap on and the GSA discussed Snap ons pricing and contract compliance practices. On August 5, 2005, the GSA notified the company that it would take no administrative action against Snap on in connection with the Federal Supply Schedule contracts referred to above. The company considers the matter closed. Other Legal Matters Snap on is also involved in various legal matters that are being litigated and or settled in the ordinary course of business. In certain matters, former dealers, purportedly on behalf of current and former franchised dealers, are seeking adjudication of certain claims as a class within an arbitration proceeding. As an initial step, certain claimants have successfully asserted in arbitration the right to further proceedings to determine whether class certification in arbitration would be appropriate. Snap on will continue to vigorously assert defenses in these matters, including its belief that class certification is not appropriate. Snap on has taken steps in court to maintain its right to challenge adverse results of the arbitral proceedings. Depending upon future developments and circumstances in these matters, Snap on will continue to pursue all available strategies from dispositive class motions to settlement. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these legal matters due, in part, to the uncertainty inherent in legal proceedings, including the absence of precedents and clear procedures regarding class proceedings in arbitration. New Accounting Standards See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting standards. Critical Accounting Policies The consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to managements discussion and analysis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are generally based on historical experience, current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources, as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Snap on considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the companys financial position, results of operations and cash flow. 41 Allowances for Doubtful Accounts: Snap ons accounts receivable are reported net of estimated bad debt allowances, which are regularly evaluated by management for adequacy. The evaluations take into consideration various financial and qualitative factors that may affect customers ability to pay. These factors may include customers financial condition, collateral, debt servicing capacity, past payment experience and credit bureau information. Snap on regularly reviews the allowance estimation process and adjusts the allowances as appropriate. It is possible, however, that the accuracy of Snap ons estimation process could be adversely impacted if the financial condition of its customers were to deteriorate. The company does not believe that accounts receivable represent significant concentrations of credit risk because of the diversified portfolio of individual customers and geographical areas. Inventory Valuation: Snap on values its inventory at the lower of cost or market and adjusts for the value of inventory that is estimated to be excess, obsolete or otherwise unmarketable. Inventory adjustments for raw materials are largely based on analysis of raw material age and actual physical inspection of raw material for fitness for use. As part of evaluating work in progress and finished goods, management reviews individual product stock keeping units (SKUs) by product category and product life cycle. Cost adjustments for each product category/product life cycle state are generally established and maintained based on a combination of historical experience, forecasted sales and promotions, technological obsolescence, inventory age and other actual known conditions and circumstances. Should actual product marketability and raw material fitness for use be affected by conditions that are different from management estimates, further adjustments to inventory allowances may be required. Warranty Accruals: Snap on provides product warranties for specific product lines and accrues for estimated future warranty costs in the period in which the sale is recorded. Snap on calculates its accrual requirements based on historic warranty loss experience that is periodically adjusted for recent actual experience, including the timing of claims during the warranty period and actual costs incurred. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of Snap ons warranty accrual. Pension Benefits: The calculation of Snap ons pension expense and projected benefit obligation requires the use of a number of assumptions. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of Snap ons control and can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements. Snap on believes that the two most critical assumptions are the expected return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate. For a discussion of the development of Snap ons pension plans and expected return on plan assets assumption, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases. Lowering the expected rate of return assumption for Snap ons domestic pension plan assets by 0.5% would increase Snap ons 2006 domestic pension expense by approximately $3 million. At year end 2005, Snap ons domestic plan assets comprised approximately 90% of Snap ons worldwide pension plan assets. Snap on establishes the discount rate using the current rates earned on long term bonds with a Moodys Aa rating. Pension expense and projected benefit obligation both increase as the discount rate is reduced. Lowering Snap ons domestic discount rate assumption by 0.5% would increase Snap ons 2006 domestic pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately $3.7 million and $50.3 million, respectively. At year end 2005, Snap ons domestic projected benefit obligation comprised approximately 84% of Snap ons worldwide projected benefit obligation. Income Taxes: The company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. While the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. 42 In addition, the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. Outlook Snap on expects to improve its current 7.1% operating margin to 10% or greater over the next three years, as it continues making progress towards a targeted long term goal of a mid teens operating margin. Snap on believes its end customer markets will grow at rates approximating Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and that the successful achievement of its plans and initiatives should improve the companys market share over time. For 2006, Snap on expects, on a consolidated basis, continued improving performance in the Commercial and Industrial and the Diagnostics and Information Groups to be offset by a higher level of spending in the Snap on Dealer Group, particularly in the first two quarters of 2006, as it implements certain initiatives to improve its franchise system, resulting in an expected decline in Dealer segment operating earnings year over year in 2006. On a consolidated basis, this is expected to result in modestly lower year over year net earnings in the first two quarters of 2006; Snap on expects a recovery in its net earnings performance to occur in the second half of 2006 and to make steady progress into 2007. Consolidated net sales in 2006 are expected to grow at a low single digit rate year over year, reflecting increased sales in all segments except the Snap on Dealer Group, where sales are expected to remain flat for the full year. In the Commercial and Industrial and the Diagnostics and Information business segments, Snap on expects that the realization of its strategic priorities will result in increased operating earnings in 2006 over the level of 2005. Tempering this growth in 2006 will be an expected $10 million to $15 million of higher operating spending to continue the companys expansion in Asia and other emerging growth markets, and to support innovative new, information based diagnostics products. In the Snap on Dealer segment, the company expects to incur approximately $15 million of incremental costs in 2006 to increase field support and to support other franchise system initiatives. An additional $8 million to $10 million of investment spending will be necessary in 2006 to support customer service and supply chain initiatives, and to support important new marketing programs to increase market share. It is expected that the benefits of these programs will reduce inventories, increase the number of technicians being served and lower costs. Snap on also expects to realize $13 million of annual cost savings in 2006 associated with ongoing initiatives to further improve its manufacturing facilities. The company will invest an additional $10 million to $15 million of capital expenditures to upgrade U.S. manufacturing plants. Additionally, as part of ongoing initiatives aimed at integrating the companys global operating footprint and lowering its cost structure, Snap on expects to incur restructuring costs of approximately $20 million in 2006, consistent with 2005 levels. In the Financial Services segment, Snap on expects results to continue to be under pressure from rising interest rates, although not as significantly as in 2005. Snap on also anticipates that the impact of adopting new stock option accounting rules, at current and anticipated grant levels, will reduce consolidated operating income in 2006 by approximately $6 million to $8 million. As a result of retiring $100 million of its debt in October 2005, Snap on expects lower interest expense for 2006. Snap on believes its 2006 effective tax rate will approximate 35%, compared with the 37.2% incurred in 2005. 43 Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market, Credit and Economic Risks Market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments. Snap on is exposed to market risk from changes in both foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Snap on monitors its exposure to these risks and attempts to manage the underlying economic exposures through the use of financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements. Snap on does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Snap ons broad based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole. Snap ons management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. Foreign Currency Risk Management Snap on has significant international operations and is subject to certain risks inherent with foreign operations that include currency fluctuations and restrictions on movement of funds. Foreign exchange risk exists to the extent that Snap on has payment obligations or receipts denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. To manage these exposures, Snap on identifies naturally offsetting positions and then generally purchases hedging instruments to protect the residual net anticipated exposures. Snap ons financial position and results of operations have not been materially affected by such events to date. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of foreign currency risk management. Interest Rate Risk Management Snap ons interest rate risk management policies are designed to reduce the potential earnings volatility that could arise from changes in interest rates. Through the use of interest rate swaps, Snap on aims to stabilize funding costs by managing the exposure created by the differing maturities and interest rate structures of Snap ons assets and liabilities. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of interest rate risk management. Snap on utilizes a Value at Risk (VAR) model to determine the potential one day loss in the fair value of its interest rate and foreign exchange sensitive financial instruments from adverse changes in market factors. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. Snap ons computations are based on the inter relationships among movements in various currencies and interest rates (variance/co variance technique). These inter relationships were determined by observing interest rate and foreign currency market changes over the preceding quarter. The estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value, calculated using the VAR model, at December 31, 2005, was $0.3 million on interest rate sensitive financial instruments and $0.4 million on foreign currency sensitive financial instruments. The VAR model is a risk management tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by Snap on, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors. Credit Risk Credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. Prior to granting credit, each customer is evaluated, taking into consideration the borrowers financial condition, collateral, debt servicing capacity, past payment experience, credit bureau information and other financial and qualitative factors that may affect the borrowers ability to repay. Specific credit reviews and standard industry credit scoring models are used in performing this evaluation. Loans that have been granted are typically monitored through an asset quality review process that closely monitors past due accounts and initiates collection actions when appropriate. In addition to its direct credit risk exposure, Snap on also has credit risk exposure for certain SOC loan originations with recourse provisions against Snap on (primarily for dealer van loans). At December 31, 2005, $19.2 million of loans originated by SOC have a recourse provision to Snap on if the loans become more than 90 days past due. For additional information on SOC, refer to the section entitled Consolidated Joint Venture in this Managements Discussion and Analysis and Notes 2 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 44 Commodity Risk The company is a purchaser of certain commodities, including steel and energy sources such as natural gas and electricity. The company is also a purchaser of components and parts that are integrated into the companys end products, as well as the purchaser of certain finished goods, all of which may contain various commodities including steel, aluminum and others. Snap ons supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers. Snap on experienced higher pricing related to certain grades and alloys of steel in 2004 and 2005 due to global demand for these materials. The company generally buys these commodities based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process. The company does not anticipate experiencing any significant pricing or availability issues with regards to 2006 raw material steel purchases. Several of the companys distribution channels, particularly the mobile dealer van channel, can be significantly impacted by increases in gasoline and fuel prices. As these costs rise, dealers may limit their driving, resulting in fewer customer calls and generally lower product sales. Snap on also experienced higher fuel surcharges on material and product shipments in 2005 as a result of the increase in gasoline and fuel prices. To the extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm pricing agreements with its suppliers, the company may experience margin declines to the extent that it is not able to increase the selling prices of its products.
