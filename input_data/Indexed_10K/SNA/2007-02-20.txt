Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management Overview Snap on continued implementing its strategic initiatives in 2006 to create long term value for the companys shareholders, associates, franchisees and other distributor partners across all of its business segments. During 2006, measurable progress was realized. Net sales grew 7.1% year over year, driven largely by growth in the Diagnostics & Information Groups equipment solutions business, which provides essential diagnostics and equipment to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and their dealerships, as well as growth in emerging markets in the Commercial & Industrial Group. Operating earnings of $164.9 million in 2006 decreased $3.1 million from 2005 levels, largely due to a $38.0 million pretax franchisee litigation settlement charge recorded in the Snap on Tools Group; Snap on has not admitted any wrongdoing by way of this settlement. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the litigation settlement. On November 28, 2006, Snap on acquired the ProQuest Business Solutions business and certain net assets (hereinafter referred to as ProQuest Business Solutions or business solutions) from ProQuest Company for a preliminary purchase price of approximately $516 million (including $8 million of estimated transaction costs) and the assumption of approximately $19 million of debt. The acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions, a world leader in automotive parts and service information, expanded the companys Diagnostics & Information Groups product offerings. Business solutions products, which are aimed at helping OEMs and their dealerships enhance their service operations, include integrated software, services and systems that transform complex technical data for parts catalogs into easily accessed electronic information in the form of electronic parts catalogs. Other business solutions products and services include warranty and management systems and analytics to help dealerships manage and track performance. Over 33,000 automotive dealerships worldwide use business solutions electronic parts catalogs, which are available in 26 different languages and support 15 automotive manufacturers and 31 brands. Business solutions products are also sold to over 85,000 dealers in the power equipment and power sports markets. Snap on believes that the strategic acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions positions the company to add value for global OEMs and enhance the productivity and profitability of OEM dealerships, while affording growth opportunities for Snap ons other customers, associates and shareholders. While progress in 2006 has been encouraging, the company believes there is still much more to be done to improve operating performance and profitability. The strategic priorities and plans for 2007 will continue to build on the improvement initiatives already underway to achieve long term profitable growth through increased sales and further lowering of costs. In the Snap on Tools Group, considerable progress was made in strengthening its operating and financial performance. Strategic priorities in 2006 focused on efforts to enhance Snap ons responsiveness to its franchisees and customers and to strengthen the financial and operating performance of both the franchisees and the company. Through improvements in the companys supply chain and the transition to a market demand based replenishment system, Snap ons complete and on time delivery rate for the top 88% of demanded stock keeping units (SKUs) improved to 93% in 2006, with a goal to achieve a 99% complete and on time delivery rate on all SKUs by the end of 2007. The Snap on Tools Group also completed the transformation of its field support system to a team based organization in 2006, which is designed to provide more specialized and focused support to its franchisees. The company also implemented pull marketing efforts, such as increased media advertising, van merchandising and online Web site and e news, to generate product excitement and drive increased traffic to the franchisee van. In addition, the Snap on Tools Group also revamped its warehouse distribution program and launched a new mid tier product line aimed at capturing additional customers and capitalizing on more purchase occasions. Segment net sales in the Snap on Tools Group in 2006 were up 3.1% over 2005 levels, primarily due to a significant fourth quarter sales increase in the United States, combined with continued growth in international sales. Despite the sales increase and savings realized from Rapid Continuous Improvement (RCI) activities, operating earnings in 2006 of $37.6 million were negatively impacted by the $38.0 million pretax franchisee litigation settlement charge discussed above and by $13.3 million of higher planned costs to support the strategic supply chain and franchise system initiatives. 21 The Snap on Tools Group 2007 strategic priorities will continue to build on the progress made in enhancing the franchise proposition and improving the supply chain, with specific initiatives focused on the following: Continue to improve franchisee profitability; Expand pull marketing initiatives; Capture additional customers; Improve service and value to franchisees and their customers; and Build on efforts to improve the supply chain through investments in manufacturing and extensive use of RCI. By executing on these focus areas, along with a continued commitment to new, innovative products and the use of RCI to drive lower costs, Snap on continues to believe that the company and its franchisees will continue to realize stronger growth and profitability. In the Commercial & Industrial Group, progress continues to be made in improving operating performance. Segment net sales in 2006 were up 5.6%, while operating earnings were up 52.6%. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 170 basis points (100 basis points equals 1.0 percent), or $41.2 million, over 2005 levels, reflecting higher sales and pricing, including sales growth in emerging markets, and improved productivity and efficiency savings. Benefits from ongoing cost reduction and RCI actions, including increased production and sourcing of materials from lower cost regions and facilities, were major contributors to the year over year earnings improvement. As a result of continued sales growth, as well as improved levels of customer service and savings from productivity, RCI and restructuring activities, operating earnings as a percentage of net sales in 2006 increased 270 basis points, or $36.6 million, over 2005 levels. The Commercial & Industrial Group will continue to build on the following strategic priorities in 2007: Continue to invest in emerging market growth initiatives, such as China, India and Eastern Europe; Increase market share in industrial tools through continued improvements in fill rates and product innovation, and by reaching new customers; Continue to invest in productivity enhancing products that utilize advanced technology; and Continue to rationalize the Groups operating footprint and shift manufacturing activities to lower cost regions. In the Diagnostics & Information Group, significant progress continues to be realized from the strategic focus on creating an integrated information with instrumentation business. The Diagnostics & Information Groups focus on RCI has resulted in a solid financial and operating platform. The recent acquisition of business solutions, with its ability to consolidate and transform complex manufacturer data from disparate sources into cohesive, integrated and highly customized systems, was an important strategic addition for the company. By integrating the complementary capabilities of business solutions with Snap ons other Diagnostics & Information product offerings, Snap on believes that it has enhanced its ability to add value for global OEMs and their dealerships. Snap on acquired ProQuest Business Solutions for a preliminary purchase price of approximately $516 million (including $8 million of estimated transaction costs) and the assumption of approximately $19 million of debt. Snap on funded the acquisition through the issuance of approximately $305 million of commercial paper and with available cash on hand. The excess of the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired resulted in the recording of $344.6 million of goodwill, on a preliminary basis. The preliminary purchase price allocation is based upon the estimated fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired, and are subject to change upon the completion of the purchase accounting. The preliminary purchase price is also subject to a working capital adjustment that is expected to be finalized in the first six months of 2007. The Diagnostics & Information Group includes the impact of the November 28, 2006, acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions on a prospective basis. The Diagnostics & Information Group will build on the following strategic priorities in 2007: Continued growth in the base businesses and emerging markets; Successfully integrate the ProQuest Business Solutions acquisition; Leverage the opportunities afforded from the ProQuest Business Solutions acquisition to drive further innovation and growth; Continued focus on reducing complexity and structural costs; and Achieving faster product development cycles. 22 Segment net sales in 2006 were up 21.2% largely due to sales growth in the OEM equipment solutions business. Operating earnings in 2006 increased $15.0 million, or 32%, driven by higher year over year sales and an ongoing focus on RCI and cost reduction. For the approximate five week period from the November 28, 2006, acquisition date through year end, the ProQuest Business Solutions acquisition contributed $20.4 million to 2006 sales and $4.8 million to operating earnings. Cash Flows In 2006, Snap on continued to deliver strong cash flow from operations. Cash generated from operating activities was $203.4 million in 2006. The company used available cash on hand to fund, in part, approximately $203 million of the preliminary purchase price of the ProQuest Business Solutions acquisition, pay dividends totaling $63.6 million, repurchase over 2.6 million shares of Snap on common stock for $109.8 million, and invest $50.5 million in capital expenditures. In conjunction with its purchase of ProQuest Business Solutions, Snap on also issued approximately $305 million of commercial paper; these commercial paper borrowings were repaid, in part, with proceeds from a $300 million long term debt offering completed by the company on January 12, 2007. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the ProQuest Business Solutions acquisition and Note 10 for additional information on the commercial paper borrowings and January 2007 debt offering. Results of Operations Fiscal 2006 vs. Fiscal 2005 Results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2006, and December 31, 2005, are as follows: (Amounts in millions) 2006 2005 Increase/ (Decrease) Net sales $ 2,473.4 100.0 % $ 2,308.6 100.0 % $ 164.8 7.1 % Cost of goods sold 1,387.5 56.1 % 1,288.7 55.8 % 98.8 7.7 % Gross profit 1,085.9 43.9 % 1,019.9 44.2 % 66.0 6.5 % Financial services revenue 49.0 100.0 % 53.6 100.0 % (4.6 ) 8.6 % Financial services expenses 36.0 73.5 % 37.9 70.7 % (1.9 ) 5.0 % Operating income from financial services 13.0 26.5 % 15.7 29.3 % (2.7 ) 17.2 % Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative 896.0 36.2 % 867.6 37.6 % 28.4 3.3 % Litigation settlement 38.0 1.6 % 38.0 N/M Total operating expenses 934.0 37.8 % 867.6 37.6 % 66.4 7.7 % Operating earnings 164.9 6.5 % 168.0 7.1 % (3.1 ) 1.8 % Interest expense 20.6 0.8 % 21.7 0.9 % (1.1 ) 5.1 % Other (income) expense net (1.6 ) 0.1 % (1.7 ) 0.1 % (0.1 ) 5.9 % Earnings before income taxes 145.9 5.8 % 148.0 6.3 % (2.1 ) 1.4 % Income tax expense 45.8 1.8 % 55.1 2.4 % (9.3 ) 16.9 % Net earnings $ 100.1 4.0 % $ 92.9 3.9 % $ 7.2 7.8 % NM not meaningful Note: Certain 2005 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2006 income statement presentation. Percentage Disclosure: Cost of goods sold, Gross profit and Operating expenses percentages are calculated as a percentage of Net sales. Financial services expenses and Operating income from financial services percentages are calculated as a percentage of Financial services revenue. All other income statement line item percentages are calculated as a percentage of the sum of Net sales and Financial services revenue. 23 Net sales in 2006 increased $164.8 million, or 7.1%, from 2005 levels, including $11.3 million from currency translation. The increase in net sales includes higher sales in the Diagnostics & Information Groups OEM equipment solutions business, and $20.4 million of sales for the approximate five week period following the companys November 28, 2006, acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions. Sales in the Commercial & Industrial Group also increased year over year primarily due to higher sales of tools for U.S. commercial and industrial applications, improved worldwide sales of equipment products, along with continued growth in emerging markets. Sales in the Snap on Tools Group increased $30.5 million, or 3.1%, over 2005 levels, reflecting sales increases in both the North American and international franchise operations. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the ProQuest Business Solutions acquisition. Gross profit was $1,085.9 million, or 43.9% of net sales, in 2006, as compared to $1,019.9 million, or 44.2% of net sales, in 2005. The $66.0 million increase in 2006 gross profit primarily reflects benefits from higher sales and pricing, as well as benefits from lower costs, including benefits from efficiency, productivity and cost reduction initiatives of $34.9 million. The year over year increase in gross profit also includes $11.5 million from the fourth quarter 2006 acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions and $4.2 million of currency translation. These increases in gross profit were partially offset by higher year over year production costs of $22.6 million, and last in, first out (LIFO) and other inventory expenses of $11.2 million, including a $1.0 million charge related to LIFO inventories in 2006 versus a comparable $8.8 million benefit in 2005. Restructuring costs included in Cost of goods sold totaled $12.1 million in 2006, as compared to $3.0 million in 2005. The 30 basis point (100 basis points equals 1.0 percent) decline in year over year gross profit as a percentage of net sales also reflects the impact of a shift in product mix that included higher 2006 sales (and lower relative gross margin) in the OEM equipment solutions business. Financial services operating income was $13.0 million on $49.0 million of revenue in 2006, as compared with $15.7 million of operating income on $53.6 million of revenue in 2005. The decrease in operating income primarily reflects the impact of lower net interest spreads, partially offset by higher levels of originations. Operating expenses in 2006 were $934.0 million, as compared to $867.6 million in 2005. The $66.4 million increase in 2006 operating expenses is primarily due to the recording of a $38.0 million pretax charge in the second quarter of 2006 related to the settlement of franchisee litigation matters. Operating expenses in 2006 also included $22.8 million in higher spending for strategic growth initiatives and $22.0 million of higher stock based and performance based incentive compensation, including $6.3 million in costs associated with the January 1, 2006, adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, on a prospective basis. The year over year increase in 2006 operating expenses also includes $6.7 million of operating expenses from the acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions and $2.7 million of currency translation. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by benefits from efficiency and productivity initiatives of $15.3 million, as well as the absence of $3.0 million of costs incurred in 2005 to terminate a supplier relationship. Restructuring costs included in Operating expenses totaled $9.6 million in 2006, as compared to $15.4 million in 2005. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the $38.0 million pretax franchisee litigation settlement. Interest expense of $20.6 million in 2006 was slightly lower than the $21.7 million incurred in 2005 primarily due to lower average debt levels, including the October 3, 2005, repayment of $100 million of unsecured 6.625% notes. The year over year decrease in interest expense was partially offset by the impacts of higher interest rates and $1.8 million of interest expense in 2006 related to the issuance of approximately $305 million of commercial paper obligations to finance, in part, the November 28, 2006, acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the ProQuest Business Solutions acquisition and Note 10 for information on the commercial paper borrowings. Other income (expense) net was income of $1.6 million in 2006, as compared to income of $1.7 million in 2005. This line item includes the impact of all non operating items such as interest income, minority interest, hedging and currency exchange rate transaction gains and losses, and other miscellaneous non operating items. Benefits from higher year over year interest income were offset by foreign exchange losses in 2006, as compared to foreign exchange gains in 2005. Minority interest expense was $3.7 million in 2006, as compared to $3.6 million in 2005. Snap ons effective tax rate was 31.4% in 2006, as compared with 37.2% in the prior year. The lower effective tax rate in 2006 primarily reflects the mix of U.S. and non U.S. earnings, including the impacts of the $38.0 million pretax franchisee litigation settlement charge tax effected at a higher U.S. tax rate, and the reversal of foreign income tax valuation allowances as a result of foreign restructuring and other activities. Snap ons effective tax rate of 37.2% in 2005 included $3.3 million of additional U.S. income tax expense related to the repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the AJCA). Under the provisions of the AJCA, Snap on repatriated approximately $93 million of 24 qualifying dividends during the second half of 2005. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on income taxes. Net earnings in 2006 were $100.1 million, or $1.69 per diluted share, including a $23.4 million after tax charge ($0.40 per diluted share) related to the resolution of the franchisee litigation settlement, as compared with net earnings of $92.9 million, or $1.59 per diluted share, in 2005. Exit or Disposal Activities See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on Snap ons exit and disposal activities. Segment Results Snap ons business segments are based on the organization structure used by management for making operating and investment decisions and for assessing performance. Snap ons reportable business segments include: (i) the Snap on Tools Group (formerly known as the Snap on Dealer Group); (ii) the Commercial & Industrial Group; (iii) the Diagnostics & Information Group; and (iv) Financial Services. The Snap on Tools Group consists of the business operations serving the worldwide franchise van channel. The Commercial & Industrial Group consists of the business operations providing tools and equipment products and equipment repair services to a broad range of industrial and commercial customers worldwide through direct, distributor and other non franchise distribution channels. The Diagnostics & Information Group consists of the business operations providing diagnostics applications, electronic parts catalogs, vehicle service information, business management systems, and other solutions for vehicle service to customers in the worldwide vehicle service and repair marketplace. The Diagnostics & Information Group includes the impact of the November 28, 2006, acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions on a prospective basis. Financial Services consists of the business operations of Snap on Credit LLC (SOC), a consolidated, 50% owned joint venture between Snap on and The CIT Group, Inc. (CIT), and Snap ons wholly owned finance subsidiaries in those international markets where Snap on has franchise operations. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on SOC. Snap on evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment revenues and operating earnings. For the Snap on Tools, Commercial & Industrial, and Diagnostics & Information Groups, segment net sales include both external and intersegment sales. Snap on accounts for intersegment sales and transfers based primarily on standard costs with reasonable mark ups established between the segments. Identifiable assets by segment are those assets used in the respective reportable segments operations. Intersegment amounts are eliminated to arrive at consolidated financial results. Snap on Tools Group (Amounts in millions) 2006 2005 Increase/ (Decrease) Segment net sales $ 1,025.0 100.0 % $ 994.5 100.0 % $ 30.5 3.1 % Cost of goods sold 577.3 56.3 % 548.9 55.2 % 28.4 5.2 % Gross profit 447.7 43.7 % 445.6 44.8 % 2.1 0.5 % Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative 372.1 36.3 % 363.4 36.5 % 8.7 2.4 % Litigation settlement 38.0 3.7 % 38.0 NM Total operating expenses 410.1 40.0 % 363.4 36.5 % 46.7 12.9 % Segment operating earnings $ 37.6 3.7 % $ 82.2 8.3 % $ (44.6 ) 54.3 % NM not meaningful Segment net sales in 2006 increased $30.5 million from 2005 levels including $28.4 million of higher sales and $2.1 million of currency translation. Sales in the North American franchise operations were up 3.1% over 2005 levels, primarily driven by a significant year over year increase in fourth quarter U.S. sales, partially offset by a lower average number of U.S. franchisees in 2006. The average number of U.S. franchisees in 2006 was down 3.0% from 2005 levels. As the company continues implementing its strategic initiatives to improve the franchise system, it anticipates that the decline in the number of U.S. franchisees will moderate. In 2006, 25 international sales were up 3.1% from 2005 levels, largely due to strong sales growth in the United Kingdom and Australia, and currency translation. Segment gross profit of $447.7 million in 2006 was up slightly from $445.6 million in 2005. The $2.1 million increase in 2006 gross profit primarily reflects the higher sales and selling prices, as well as lower costs of $17.3 million from efficiency and productivity initiatives. These increases were partially offset by higher production costs, and $10.5 million of increased year over year LIFO and other inventory expenses, including a $1.0 million charge related to LIFO inventories in 2006, versus a comparable $8.8 million benefit in 2005. Snap on also incurred $2.0 million of higher restructuring costs in 2006 primarily related to the expected mid 2007 closure of its Johnson City, Tennessee, hand tool facility. Snap on expects to phase out production at the Johnson City facility and transfer production to other Snap on hand tool facilities and suppliers. Gross profit as a percentage of segment sales was 43.7%, down 110 basis points from 44.8% in the prior year. Operating expenses in 2006 were up $46.7 million from prior year levels, primarily due to the $38.0 million pretax franchisee litigation settlement charge, $13.3 million of higher costs, including $1.7 million of restructuring related costs, to support strategic supply chain and franchise system initiatives, and $5.5 million of higher performance based incentive compensation. These increases were partially offset by $4.6 million of benefits from cost reduction initiatives and the absence of $3.0 million of costs incurred in 2005 to terminate a supplier relationship. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings declined $44.6 million from 2005 levels. Commercial & Industrial Group (Amounts in millions) 2006 2005 Increase/ (Decrease) External net sales $ 1,048.6 88.0 % $ 1,009.0 89.4 % $ 39.6 3.9 % Intersegment net sales 143.4 12.0 % 120.2 10.6 % 23.2 19.3 % Segment net sales 1,192.0 100.0 % 1,129.2 100.0 % 62.8 5.6 % Cost of goods sold 756.3 63.4 % 734.7 65.1 % 21.6 2.9 % Gross profit 435.7 36.6 % 394.5 34.9 % 41.2 10.4 % Operating expenses 329.5 27.7 % 324.9 28.7 % 4.6 1.4 % Segment operating earnings $ 106.2 8.9 % $ 69.6 6.2 % $ 36.6 52.6 % Segment net sales in 2006 increased $62.8 million, or 5.6%, from 2005 levels due to $54.9 million of higher sales and $7.9 million of currency translation. The $54.9 million sales increase primarily reflects growth in emerging markets, higher worldwide equipment and power tool sales, and increased sales of tools for U.S. commercial and industrial applications. Segment gross profit of $435.7 million in 2006 was up $41.2 million, or 170 basis points as a percentage of segment sales, over 2005 levels. The improvement in 2006 gross profit primarily reflects benefits from increased sales of higher margin products and improved pricing, savings of $16.7 million from productivity and efficiency initiatives, including increased production and sourcing of materials from lower cost regions and facilities, and $2.4 million of currency translation. These improvements were partially offset by $5.7 million of higher restructuring costs, primarily related to manufacturing footprint initiatives in Europe, and $3.7 million of higher material and production costs. Operating expenses increased $4.6 million, but decreased 100 basis points as a percentage of segment sales, from 2005 levels. The operating expense increase includes higher sales related expenses, $6.7 million of increased spending to support the expansion of Snap ons sales and manufacturing presence in emerging growth markets and lower cost regions, higher performance based incentive compensation of $2.1 million, and $1.6 million of currency translation. These increases were partially offset by $6.5 million of benefits from efficiency and productivity initiatives and $3.6 million of lower restructuring costs. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings in 2006 increased $36.6 million over 2005 levels. 26 Diagnostics & Information Group (Amounts in millions) 2006 2005 Increase/ (Decrease) External net sales $ 399.8 76.2 % $ 305.1 70.5 % $ 94.7 31.0 % Intersegment net sales 124.7 23.8 % 127.6 29.5 % (2.9 ) 2.3 % Segment net sales 524.5 100.0 % 432.7 100.0 % 91.8 21.2 % Cost of goods sold 322.0 61.4 % 252.9 58.4 % 69.1 27.3 % Gross profit 202.5 38.6 % 179.8 41.6 % 22.7 12.6 % Operating expenses 140.6 26.8 % 132.9 30.8 % 7.7 5.8 % Segment operating earnings $ 61.9 11.8 % $ 46.9 10.8 % $ 15.0 32.0 % Segment net sales of $524.5 million in 2006 increased $91.8 million, or 21.2%, from 2005 levels, largely due to higher sales in the OEM equipment solutions business, $20.4 million of incremental sales for the approximate five week period following the companys November 28, 2006, acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions, and increased sales of Mitchell1TM information products. Currency translation contributed $1.8 million to the year over year sales increase. Segment gross profit of $202.5 million in 2006 was up $22.7 million from 2005 levels primarily due to the higher sales, including $11.5 million from the ProQuest Business Solutions acquisition, and $2.2 million of benefits from efficiency and productivity initiatives, partially offset by $1.4 million of higher restructuring costs. As a percentage of segment net sales, gross profit margin of 38.6% was down 300 basis points from 2005 levels, reflecting a shift in product mix that included higher 2006 sales (and lower relative gross margin) in the OEM equipment solutions business. Operating expenses in 2006 of $140.6 million were up $7.7 million from 2005 levels. The increase in year over year operating expenses primarily includes $6.7 million of operating expenses from the ProQuest Business Solutions acquisition and $4.5 million of higher spending to support strategic growth initiatives, partially offset by $3.3 million of benefits from efficiency and productivity initiatives. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings in 2006 increased $15.0 million over 2005 levels. Financial Services (Amounts in millions) 2006 2005 Increase/ (Decrease) Financial services revenue $ 49.0 100.0 % $ 53.6 100.0 % $ (4.6 ) 8.6 % Financial services expenses 36.0 73.5 % 37.9 70.7 % (1.9 ) 5.0 % Segment operating income $ 13.0 26.5 % $ 15.7 29.3 % $ (2.7 ) 17.2 % Note: Certain 2005 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2006 income statement presentation. Operating income was $13.0 million on $49.0 million of revenue in 2006, as compared with $15.7 million of operating income on $53.6 million of revenue in 2005. The decrease in operating income primarily reflects the impact of lower net interest spreads, partially offset by a 2.9% increase in year over year originations. Corporate Snap ons general corporate expenses totaled $53.8 million in 2006, up from $46.4 million in 2005, primarily due to $15.2 million of increased stock based and performance based incentive compensation, including $6.3 million from the January 1, 2006, adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). Increased expenses in 2006 also included $4.2 million of higher insurance and other costs. These increases in expenses were partially offset by $9.5 million of benefits from cost reduction initiatives. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the companys adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). 27 Fourth Quarter Results of operations for the quarters ended December 30, 2006, and December 31, 2005, are as follows: Three Months Ended Increase/ (Amounts in millions) December 30, 2006 December 31, 2005 (Decrease) Net sales $ 656.0 100.0 % $ 563.4 100.0 % $ 92.6 16.4 % Cost of goods sold 371.6 56.6 % 316.2 56.1 % 55.4 17.5 % Gross profit 284.4 43.4 % 247.2 43.9 % 37.2 15.0 % Financial services revenue 14.8 100.0 % 10.2 100.0 % 4.6 45.1 % Financial services expenses 9.8 66.2 % 7.4 72.5 % 2.4 32.4 % Operating income from financial services 5.0 33.8 % 2.8 27.5 % 2.2 78.6 % Operating expenses 230.2 35.1 % 206.4 36.6 % 23.8 11.5 % Operating earnings 59.2 8.8 % 43.6 7.6 % 15.6 35.8 % Interest expense 7.0 1.0 % 4.6 0.8 % 2.4 52.2 % Other (income) expense net (1.2 ) 0.2 % (3.9 ) 0.7 % (2.7 ) 69.2 % Earnings before income taxes 53.4 8.0 % 42.9 7.5 % 10.5 24.5 % Income tax expense 15.4 2.3 % 15.5 2.7 % (0.1 ) 0.6 % Net earnings $ 38.0 5.7 % $ 27.4 4.8 % $ 10.6 38.7 % Note: Certain 2005 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2006 income statement presentation. Percentage Disclosure: Cost of goods sold, Gross profit and Operating expenses percentages are calculated as a percentage of Net sales. Financial services expenses and Operating income from financial services percentages are calculated as a percentage of Financial services revenue. All other income statement line item percentages are calculated as a percentage of the sum of Net sales and Financial services revenue. Net sales in the fourth quarter of 2006 increased $92.6 million, or 16.4%, from 2005 levels, including $15.9 million from currency translation. The $92.6 million increase in net sales includes higher sales in the Diagnostics & Information Groups OEM equipment solutions business, and $20.4 million of sales for the approximate five week period from the companys November 28, 2006, acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions. Sales in the Commercial & Industrial Group also increased year over year primarily due to higher sales of equipment worldwide, increased sales of professional tools in Europe, higher sales of power tools, and continued strong sales growth in emerging markets. Sales in the Snap on Tools Group increased $28.3 million, or 12.1%, over 2005 levels, largely driven by strong U.S. sales increases in the North American franchise operations and higher international sales. Gross profit in 2006 was $284.4 million, or 43.4% of net sales, as compared to $247.2 million, or 43.9% of net sales, in 2005. The $37.2 million improvement in 2006 gross profit primarily reflects benefits from higher sales and pricing, as well as benefits from lower costs, including savings from efficiency, productivity and cost reduction initiatives of $11.3 million, and $6.0 million of lower restructuring costs. The acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions contributed $11.5 million to the year over year increase in fourth quarter gross profit, and currency translation contributed $6.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a shift in product mix that included higher sales (and lower relative gross margin) in the OEM equipment solutions business, $4.9 million of increased production and material costs, and $11.8 million of higher year over year LIFO related inventory expenses (charges of $4.1 million in 2006 and benefits of $7.7 million in 2005). Operating expenses in 2006 were $230.2 million, as compared to $206.4 million in 2005. The $23.8 million increase primarily includes $6.7 million of operating expenses from the business solutions acquisition, $5.5 million in higher costs for strategic growth initiatives, $4.3 million of currency translation, $2.8 million of higher stock based and performance based incentive compensation, and increased volume related expenses. Interest expense of $7.0 million in 2006 was up $2.4 million from 2005 levels, primarily due to $1.8 million of higher interest expense related to the issuance of approximately $305 million of commercial paper obligations to finance, in part, the November 28, 2006, acquisition of business solutions, and higher year over year interest rates. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the 28 ProQuest Business Solutions acquisition and Note 10 for additional information on the commercial paper borrowings. Other income (expense) net was income of $1.2 million in 2006, as compared to income of $3.9 million in 2005. The decrease in other income (expense) net is primarily due to unfavorable year over year foreign exchange transaction losses and higher minority interest expense in 2006, partially offset by higher interest income. Snap ons effective tax rate was 28.8% in 2006, as compared with 36.1% in the prior year. The lower effective tax rate in 2006 primarily reflects the reversal of certain foreign income tax valuation allowances. Snap ons effective tax rate of 36.1% in the fourth quarter of 2005 included $0.5 million of additional U.S. income tax expense as the actual amount of foreign dividends repatriated under the AJCA during 2005 was approximately $18 million higher than earlier estimates. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on income taxes. Snap on Tools Group Three Months Ended Increase/ (Amounts in millions) December 30, 2006 December 31, 2005 (Decrease) Segment net sales $ 261.6 100.0 % $ 233.3 100.0 % $ 28.3 12.1 % Cost of goods sold 154.5 59.1 % 130.4 55.9 % 24.1 18.5 % Gross profit 107.1 40.9 % 102.9 44.1 % 4.2 4.1 % Operating expenses 91.9 35.1 % 82.3 35.3 % 9.6 11.7 % Segment operating earnings $ 15.2 5.8 % $ 20.6 8.8 % $ (5.4 ) 26.2 % Segment net sales in the fourth quarter of 2006 increased $28.3 million, or 12.1%, from 2005 levels, including $25.6 million of higher sales and $2.7 million of currency translation. In North America, sales increased 11.7% year over year. Snap on believes the $28.3 million sales increase largely reflects the progress being made in its efforts to improve both the franchise system and order fill rates though the global supply chain. Sales in the international franchise operations increased 14.0% year over year, largely due to growth in the United Kingdom and Australia, and currency translation. Segment gross profit of $107.1 million in 2006 was up $4.2 million over 2005 levels primarily due to the higher sales and selling prices, lower costs of $5.9 million from efficiency and productivity initiatives, and $1.1 million of currency translation. These increases were partially offset by $11.8 million of higher year over year LIFO related inventory expenses (charges of $4.1 million in 2006 and benefits of $7.7 million in 2005), $4.6 million of higher production, material and other costs, and $2.1 million of increased restructuring costs related to the expected mid 2007 closure of the companys Johnson City hand tool facility. Operating expenses in 2006 were up $9.6 million from prior year levels primarily due to higher volume related expenses, as well as $2.2 million of higher costs to support strategic supply chain and franchise system initiatives, $1.3 million of increased performance based compensation expense, $0.6 million of currency translation, and $0.5 million of higher year over year restructuring costs. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2006 declined $5.4 million from 2005 levels. 29 Commercial & Industrial Group Three Months Ended Increase/ (Amounts in millions) December 30, 2006 December 31, 2005 (Decrease) External net sales $ 278.4 87.6 % $ 254.3 91.4 % $ 24.1 9.5 % Intersegment net sales 39.4 12.4 % 23.9 8.6 % 15.5 64.9 % Segment net sales 317.8 100.0 % 278.2 100.0 % 39.6 14.2 % Cost of goods sold 201.2 63.3 % 178.1 64.0 % 23.1 13.0 % Gross profit 116.6 36.7 % 100.1 36.0 % 16.5 16.5 % Operating expenses 84.4 26.6 % 77.2 27.8 % 7.2 9.3 % Segment operating earnings $ 32.2 10.1 % $ 22.9 8.2 % $ 9.3 40.6 % Segment net sales in the fourth quarter of 2006 increased $39.6 million, or 14.2%, from 2005 levels, including $28.1 million of higher sales and $11.5 million of currency translation. The $28.1 million sales increase primarily reflects higher sales of equipment products worldwide, increased sales of professional tools in Europe, higher sales of power tools, and continued strong sales growth in emerging markets. Segment gross profit of $116.6 million in 2006 was up $16.5 million over 2005 levels. The improvement in gross profit primarily reflects benefits from increased sales of higher margin products and improved pricing, savings of $5.4 million from productivity and efficiency initiatives, including increased production and sourcing of materials from lower cost regions and facilities, and $4.4 million of currency translation. These improvements were partially offset by $3.9 million of higher restructuring costs, primarily related to manufacturing footprint initiatives in Europe. Operating expenses of $84.4 million were up $7.2 million from 2005 levels, but improved 120 basis points as a percentage of segment sales. The increase in operating expenses primarily includes higher volume related expenses, $3.0 million of currency translation, and $1.6 million of increased spending to support the expansion of the companys sales and manufacturing presence in emerging growth markets and lower cost regions. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2006 increased $9.3 million over 2005 levels. Diagnostics & Information Group Three Months Ended Increase/ (Amounts in millions) December 30, 2006 December 31, 2005 (Decrease) External net sales $ 116.0 80.2 % $ 75.8 75.3 % $ 40.2 53.0 % Intersegment net sales 28.7 19.8 % 24.9 24.7 % 3.8 15.3 % Segment net sales 144.7 100.0 % 100.7 100.0 % 44.0 43.7 % Cost of goods sold 84.0 58.1 % 56.5 56.1 % 27.5 48.7 % Gross profit 60.7 41.9 % 44.2 43.9 % 16.5 37.3 % Operating expenses 39.4 27.2 % 32.1 31.9 % 7.3 22.7 % Segment operating earnings $ 21.3 14.7 % $ 12.1 12.0 % $ 9.2 76.0 % Segment net sales of $144.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 increased $44.0 million, or 43.7%, from 2005 levels, largely due to higher sales in the OEM equipment solutions business, $20.4 million of sales for the approximate five week period from the November 28, 2006, acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions, and increased sales of Mitchell1 information products. Currency translation also contributed $2.1 million to the year over year sales increase. Segment gross profit of $60.7 million in 2006 increased $16.5 million from 2005 levels primarily due to the higher sales, including $11.5 million from the acquisition of business solutions. As a percentage of segment net sales, the gross profit margin of 41.9% was down 200 basis points from 2005 levels, reflecting a shift in product mix that included higher 2006 sales (and lower relative gross margin) in the OEM equipment solutions business, partially offset by the higher relative gross margin impact from business solutions. Operating expenses of $39.4 million were up $7.3 million from 2005 levels. The increase in operating expenses primarily reflects $6.7 million of operating expenses for the business solutions acquisition and $1.7 million of higher strategic growth spending, partially offset by $1.5 million of benefits 30 from efficiency and productivity initiatives. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2006 increased $9.2 million over 2005 levels. Financial Services Three Months Ended Increase/ (Amounts in millions) December 30, 2006 December 31, 2005 (Decrease) Financial services revenue $ 14.8 100.0 % $ 10.2 100.0 % $ 4.6 45.1 % Financial services expenses 9.8 66.2 % 7.4 72.5 % 2.4 32.4 % Segment operating income $ 5.0 33.8 % $ 2.8 27.5 % $ 2.2 78.6 % Note: Certain 2005 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2006 income statement presentation. Operating income was $5.0 million on $14.8 million of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2006, as compared with $2.8 million of operating income on $10.2 million of revenue in 2005. The increase in operating income primarily reflects the impacts of reduced loan losses and higher effective yields. Originations in the fourth quarter of 2006 were essentially flat with prior year levels. Corporate Snap ons general corporate expenses totaled $14.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, down slightly from the $14.8 million incurred in the fourth quarter of 2005. The year over year decrease in expenses primarily includes savings of $1.8 million from cost reduction initiatives, partially offset by $1.6 million of increased stock based and performance based incentive compensation, including $1.1 million from the January 1, 2006, adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the companys adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). Fiscal 2005 vs. Fiscal 2004 Results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005, and January 1, 2005 (fiscal 2004), are as follows: (Amounts in millions) 2005 2004 Increase/ (Decrease) Net sales $ 2,308.6 100.0 % $ 2,329.1 100.0 % $ (20.5 ) 0.9 % Cost of goods sold 1,288.7 55.8 % 1,319.8 56.7 % (31.1 ) 2.4 % Gross profit 1,019.9 44.2 % 1,009.3 43.3 % 10.6 1.1 % Financial services revenue 53.6 100.0 % 78.1 100.0 % (24.5 ) 31.4 % Financial services expenses 37.9 70.7 % 44.0 56.3 % (6.1 ) 13.9 % Operating income from financial services 15.7 29.3 % 34.1 43.7 % (18.4 ) 54.0 % Operating expenses 867.6 37.6 % 901.1 38.7 % (33.5 ) 3.7 % Operating earnings 168.0 7.1 % 142.3 5.9 % 25.7 18.1 % Interest expense 21.7 0.9 % 23.0 1.0 % (1.3 ) 5.7 % Other (income) expense net (1.7 ) 0.1 % (1.1 ) 0.1 % 0.6 54.5 % Earnings before income taxes 148.0 6.3 % 120.4 5.0 % 27.6 22.9 % Income tax expense 55.1 2.4 % 38.7 1.6 % 16.4 42.4 % Net earnings $ 92.9 3.9 % $ 81.7 3.4 % $ 11.2 13.7 % Note: Certain 2005 and 2004 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2006 income statement presentation. Percentage Disclosure: Cost of goods sold, Gross profit and Operating expenses percentages are calculated as a percentage of Net sales. Financial services expenses and Operating income from financial services percentages are calculated as a percentage of Financial services revenue. All other income statement line item percentages are calculated as a percentage of the sum of Net sales and Financial services revenue. Net sales in 2005 decreased $20.5 million, or 0.9%, from 2004 levels due to $33.1 million of lower sales partially offset by $12.6 million of currency translation. The $33.1 million sales decline principally reflects the impact of lower sales in the companys North American franchise operations along with lower sales in the OEM 31 equipment solutions and worldwide equipment businesses, partially offset by increased sales of tools for industrial and commercial applications, including growth in emerging markets, and higher international franchise sales. Gross profit was $1,019.9 million, or 44.2% of net sales, in 2005, as compared to $1,009.3 million, or 43.3% of net sales, in 2004. The $10.6 million, or 90 basis points as a percentage of net sales, improvement in year over year gross profit primarily reflects benefits from higher selling prices and lower costs, including benefits from efficiency and productivity initiatives of $15.4 million, higher LIFO inventory benefits of $5.6 million, $3.2 million of currency translation, and $2.5 million of lower pension, postretirement and insurance expenses due, in part, to favorable demographic changes in the companys U.S. hourly pension plans, including a decline in the number of participants. These year over year improvements in gross profit were partially offset by the impact of the lower sales volume, higher production costs in U.S. manufacturing facilities to improve order fill rates, and $22.3 million of higher steel costs. Restructuring costs included in Cost of goods sold totaled $3.0 million in 2005, as compared to $16.0 million in 2004. Operating expenses in 2005 decreased $33.5 million, or 110 basis points as a percentage of net sales, from 2004 levels. The decline in year over year operating expenses primarily reflects benefits of $41.4 million from efficiency and cost reduction initiatives, $12.7 million of lower bad debt expense and franchise termination costs, as well as the absence, in 2005, of both the $3.6 million charge for the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) settlement and $3.3 million of severance costs related to the November 2004 resignation of the companys former chairman, president and chief executive officer (former officer). These decreases were partially offset by $6.9 million of higher pension, postretirement and insurance expenses, primarily due to demographic and actuarial assumption changes in the companys U.S. salaried pension plans, $5.0 million of higher freight costs, largely due to fuel surcharges and more frequent shipments to franchisees, $4.0 million of currency translation, and $3.0 million of costs to terminate a supplier relationship. Restructuring costs included in Operating expenses totaled $16.3 million in 2005, as compared to $5.7 million in 2004. Interest expense of $21.7 million in 2005 was lower than the $23.0 million incurred in 2004 primarily due to benefits from lower average debt levels, including the fourth quarter 2005 repayment of $100 million of unsecured 6.625% notes on October 3, 2005, partially offset by the impact of higher year over year interest rates. Other income (expense) net was income of $1.7 million in 2005, as compared to income of $1.1 million in 2004. Benefits from higher year over year interest income and foreign exchange gains in 2005, as compared with foreign exchange losses in 2004, were partially offset by an increase in minority interest expense. Minority interest expense was $3.6 million in 2005, as compared to $2.0 million in 2004. Snap ons effective tax rate of 37.2% for 2005 included $3.3 million of additional U.S. income tax expense related to the repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings under the AJCA. Under the provisions of the AJCA, Snap on repatriated approximately $93 million of qualifying dividends during the second half of 2005. Snap ons effective tax rate of 32.1% in 2004 benefited from the conclusion of prior year tax matters. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on income taxes. Exit or Disposal Activities See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on Snap ons exit and disposal activities. Segment Results Snap on Tools Group (Amounts in millions) 2005 2004 Increase/ (Decrease) Segment net sales $ 994.5 100.0 % $ 1,020.6 100.0 % $ (26.1 ) 2.6 % Cost of goods sold 548.9 55.2 % 573.4 56.2 % (24.5 ) 4.3 % Gross profit 445.6 44.8 % 447.2 43.8 % (1.6 ) 0.4 % Operating expenses 363.4 36.5 % 366.8 35.9 % (3.4 ) 0.9 % Segment operating earnings $ 82.2 8.3 % $ 80.4 7.9 % $ 1.8 2.2 % 32 Segment net sales in 2005 decreased $26.1 million, or 2.6%, from 2004 levels. The year over year decrease reflects $30.8 million of lower sales, primarily due to a lower average number of U.S. franchise vans in operation in 2005, partially offset by higher sales in international markets and $4.7 million of currency translation. The number of U.S. franchise vans in operation at December 31, 2005, was down 5.8% from year end 2004 levels. Segment gross profit in 2005 decreased $1.6 million, but increased 100 basis points as a percentage of segment sales, from 2004 levels. The $1.6 million decrease reflects the impact of the lower sales, higher production costs in U.S. manufacturing facilities to improve order fill rates and $9.8 million of higher steel costs. These declines were partially offset by benefits from higher selling prices, an improved mix of higher margin diagnostics products, and lower depreciation, largely due to the absence of depreciation related to two U.S. hand tool facility closures in 2004. Gross profit in 2005 also benefited from $5.6 million of higher year over year LIFO inventory benefits, $8.5 million in lower restructuring costs, $2.5 million of currency translation and $2.2 million of lower pension, postretirement and insurance costs. Operating expenses decreased $3.4 million year over year, but increased 60 basis points as a percentage of segment sales. The year over year decrease primarily includes benefits from efficiency and cost reduction initiatives of $9.1 million, lower bad debt expense and franchisee termination costs of $4.4 million, and the operating expense impact from lower sales. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by $4.8 million in higher restructuring costs related to 2005 severance actions, $3.0 million of costs incurred in the first quarter of 2005 to terminate a supplier relationship, $4.3 million of higher freight costs and $1.9 million of unfavorable currency translation. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings in 2005 increased $1.8 million, or 40 basis points as a percentage of segment sales, over prior year levels. Commercial & Industrial Group (Amounts in millions) 2005 2004 Increase/ (Decrease) External net sales $ 1,009.0 89.4 % $ 987.2 88.9 % $ 21.8 2.2 % Intersegment net sales 120.2 10.6 % 123.0 11.1 % (2.8 ) 2.3 % Segment net sales 1,129.2 100.0 % 1,110.2 100.0 % 19.0 1.7 % Cost of goods sold 734.7 65.1 % 735.2 66.2 % (0.5 ) 0.1 % Gross profit 394.5 34.9 % 375.0 33.8 % 19.5 5.2 % Operating expenses 324.9 28.7 % 351.5 31.7 % (26.6 ) 7.6 % Segment operating earnings $ 69.6 6.2 % $ 23.5 2.1 % $ 46.1 196.2 % Segment net sales in 2005 increased $19.0 million, or 1.7%, over 2004 levels. The year over year increase includes $11.1 million from higher sales and $7.9 million of currency translation. The $11.1 million sales increase primarily reflects higher sales and pricing of tools for industrial and commercial applications, including significant growth in emerging markets, and higher sales as a result of the launch of new power tool products. These year over year increases in sales were partially offset by lower equipment sales due primarily to a continued soft European market, the impact from certain discontinued products, and a decline in equipment servicing revenues. Segment gross profit in 2005 increased $19.5 million, or 110 basis points as a percentage of segment sales, over 2004 levels. Benefits from higher sales and pricing, as well as lower costs, including benefits from efficiency and productivity initiatives of $12.5 million and lower year over year restructuring costs of $3.9 million, were partially offset by $12.5 million of higher steel costs. Operating expenses decreased $26.6 million or 300 basis points as a percentage of segment sales. The improvement in year over year operating expenses includes benefits from efficiency and cost reduction initiatives of $20.0 million, lower bad debt expense of $7.4 million, and the absence of the $3.6 million GSA settlement charge incurred in 2004. These reductions in year over year operating expenses were partially offset by $2.2 million of increased freight costs, $2.1 million of unfavorable currency translation and $1.2 million of lower gains on sales of facilities. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings in 2005 increased $46.1 million over prior year levels. 33 Diagnostics & Information Group (Amounts in millions) 2005 2004 Increase/ (Decrease) External net sales $ 305.1 70.5 % $ 321.3 66.0 % $ (16.2 ) 5.0 % Intersegment net sales 127.6 29.5 % 165.7 34.0 % (38.1 ) 23.0 % Segment net sales 432.7 100.0 % 487.0 100.0 % (54.3 ) 11.1 % Cost of goods sold 252.9 58.4 % 299.9 61.6 % (47.0 ) 15.7 % Gross profit 179.8 41.6 % 187.1 38.4 % (7.3 ) 3.9 % Operating expenses 132.9 30.8 % 139.8 28.7 % (6.9 ) 4.9 % Segment operating earnings $ 46.9 10.8 % $ 47.3 9.7 % $ (0.4 ) 0.8 % Segment net sales in 2005 decreased $54.3 million, or 11.1%, from 2004 levels, including $54.8 million of lower sales partially offset by $0.5 million of currency translation. The $54.8 million sales decline primarily reflects the comparison against the 2004 successful launch of new, Snap on brand diagnostics products, lower sales in the OEM equipment solutions business and the impact of state emission program updates that were not repeated in 2005. Segment gross profit in 2005 decreased $7.3 million, but increased 320 basis points as a percentage of segment sales, from prior year. The impact of lower sales and $1.3 million of higher freight costs was partially offset by benefits from lower costs, including benefits from efficiency and productivity initiatives of $4.8 million. Operating expenses decreased $6.9 million, but increased 210 basis points as a percentage of segment sales. Benefits from continuous improvement actions of $6.9 million and lower bad debt expense of $2.5 million were partially offset by $2.7 million of higher year over year restructuring costs. As a result, segment operating earnings in 2005 decreased $0.4 million, but increased 110 basis points as a percentage of segment sales, from prior year levels. Financial Services (Amounts in millions) 2005 2004 Increase/ (Decrease) Financial services revenue $ 53.6 100.0 % $ 78.1 100.0 % $ (24.5 ) 31.4 % Financial services expenses 37.9 70.7 % 44.0 56.3 % (6.1 ) 13.9 % Segment operating income $ 15.7 29.3 % $ 34.1 43.7 % $ (18.4 ) 54.0 % Note: Certain 2005 and 2004 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2006 income statement presentation. Segment revenues and operating income were $53.6 million and $15.7 million in 2005, down $24.5 million and $18.4 million from prior year levels, primarily due to the impact of higher year over year interest rates in Snap ons domestic financing business, as well as an 11.4% decline in originations. Corporate Snap ons general corporate expenses totaled $46.4 million in 2005, up from $43.0 million in 2004. Savings realized from cost reduction initiatives, as well as the absence, in 2005, of $3.3 million of severance costs related to the resignation of a former officer, were more than offset by higher pension and postretirement costs of $8.8 million primarily due to demographic and actuarial assumption changes in the companys U.S. salaried pension plans, higher mark to market and other adjustments on stock based incentive and deferred compensation plans of $2.5 million, and higher year over year restructuring costs of $1.3 million. In addition, Snap ons North American based Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system became fully depreciated mid 2004, resulting in lower depreciation expense year over year. Financial Condition Snap ons growth has historically been funded by a combination of cash provided by operating activities and debt financing. Snap on believes that its cash from operations, coupled with its sources of borrowings, are sufficient to fund its anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, restructuring activities, acquisitions, common stock repurchases and dividend payments. Due to Snap ons credit rating over the years, external funds have been available at a reasonable cost. As of the close of business on February 16, 34 2007, Snap ons long term debt and commercial paper was rated A3 and P 2 by Moodys Investors Service and A and A 2 by Standard & Poors. Snap on believes that the strength of its balance sheet, combined with its cash flows from operating activities, affords the company the financial flexibility to respond to both internal growth opportunities and those available through acquisitions. The following discussion focuses on information included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Snap on has been focused on improving asset utilization by making more effective use of its investment in certain working capital items. The company assesses managements operating performance and effectiveness relative to those components of working capital, particularly accounts receivable and inventories, which are more directly impacted by operational decisions. As of December 30, 2006, working capital (current assets less current liabilities) of $431.2 million was down $135.6 million from $566.8 million as of December 31, 2005, primarily due to the impacts from the companys November 28, 2006, acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions. The following represents the companys working capital position as of December 30, 2006, and December 31, 2005. (Amounts in millions) 2006 2005 Cash and cash equivalents $ 63.4 $ 170.4 Accounts receivable net of allowances 559.2 485.9 Inventories 323.0 283.2 Other current assets 167.6 133.4 Total current assets 1,113.2 1,072.9 Accounts payable (178.8 ) (135.4 ) Notes payable and current maturities of long term debt (43.6 ) (24.8 ) Other current liabilities (459.6 ) (345.9 ) Total current liabilities (682.0 ) (506.1 ) Total working capital $ 431.2 $ 566.8 Cash at the end of 2006 was $63.4 million, down $107.0 million from year end 2005 levels. The decrease in cash from 2005 levels is the result of disbursing approximately $203 million of available cash on hand to fund, in part, the acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the ProQuest Business Solutions acquisition. Accounts receivable at the end of 2006 was $559.2 million, up $73.3 million from year end 2005 levels, including $35.0 million from the 2006 business solutions acquisition and $21.0 million of currency translation. The year over year increase in accounts receivable also reflects the impact of higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2006, largely driven by increased sales in the Diagnostic & Information Groups equipment solutions business. Days sales outstanding at year end 2006 was 76 days, as compared with 74 days at year end 2005. Inventories totaled $323.0 million at the end of 2006, up $39.8 million from year end 2005 levels, including $15.3 million from currency translation. The year over year increase in inventories primarily reflects the impacts of the companys decision to maintain higher inventory levels to better meet customer demand as it proceeds with implementing its strategic supply chain and other initiatives, and increased inventory associated with essential equipment and diagnostics deployments for major OEMs. Inventories accounted for using the first in, first out (FIFO) method as of December 30, 2006, and December 31, 2005, approximated 62% and 63% of total inventories. All other inventories are accounted for using the LIFO cost method. The companys LIFO reserve increased from $82.1 million at December 31, 2005, to $86.7 million at December 30, 2006. Inventory turns (full year cost of goods sold divided by the average of the beginning and ending inventory balances for the year) at December 30, 2006, were 4.6 turns as compared to 4.1 turns at year end 2005. 35 Accounts payable at December 30, 2006, was $178.8 million, up $43.4 million from year end 2005 levels primarily due to the timing of payments and higher inventory levels, as well as $6.3 million from currency translation and $6.1 million from the acquisition of business solutions. Notes payable and long term debt at December 30, 2006, was $549.2 million, up $322.7 million from $226.5 million at December 31, 2005, primarily due to the companys issuance of approximately $305 million of commercial paper to fund, in part, the companys November 28, 2006, acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions. At December 30, 2006, Snap on had commercial paper outstanding of $314.9 million. Snap on has presented $300.0 million of the commercial paper as Long term debt on the accompanying December 30, 2006, Consolidated Balance Sheet. On January 9, 2007, Snap on entered into an agreement pursuant to which the company agreed to sell $300 million of floating and fixed rate notes consisting of $150 million of floating rate notes due in 2010 and $150 million of 5.5% fixed rate notes due in 2017. The $300 million offering of debt securities closed on January 12, 2007. Snap on used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to repay commercial paper obligations issued to finance the acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions. As of January 12, 2007, the company also terminated a $250 million bridge credit agreement that Snap on established prior to its acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions. No commercial paper was outstanding at December 31, 2005. Notes payable under uncommitted lines of credit and other arrangements totaled $28.6 million, at December 30, 2006, and $20.9 million at December 31, 2005. Amounts payable to CIT pursuant to a working capital agreement with SOC totaled $0.1 million at December 30, 2006, and $3.9 million at December 31, 2005. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the companys acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions. At December 30, 2006, Snap on had a $400 million multi currency revolving credit facility that terminates on July 27, 2009, and the $250 million bridge credit agreement (discussed above) that was subsequently terminated on January 12, 2007. The $400 million credit facilitys financial covenant requires that Snap on maintain a ratio of debt to the sum of total debt plus shareholders equity of not greater than 0.60 to 1.00. As of December 30, 2006, Snap on believes that it was in compliance with all covenants of its revolving and bridge credit facilities. At December 30, 2006, Snap on also had $20 million of unused committed bank lines of credit, of which $10 million expires on July 29, 2007, and $10 million expires on August 31, 2007. At December 30, 2006, Snap on had approximately $355 million of unused available debt capacity under the terms of its revolving and bridge credit facilities and its committed bank lines of credit. As of the close of business on February 16, 2007, Snap on had approximately $360 million of unused debt capacity under the terms of its revolving credit facilities and its committed bank lines of credit. In August 2001, Snap on issued $200 million of unsecured notes that require semiannual interest payments at the rate of 6.25%; the notes mature in their entirety on August 15, 2011. Snap on maintains sufficient committed lines of credit and liquidity facilities to cover its expected funding needs on both a short term and long term basis. Snap on manages its aggregate short term borrowings so as not to exceed its availability under its revolving credit facilities and committed lines of credit. The company accesses short term debt markets, predominantly through commercial paper issuances, to fund its short term requirements and to ensure near term liquidity. Near term liquidity requirements for Snap on in 2007 include the funding of its investments in capital expenditures and restructuring activities, payments for litigation settlements, payments of dividends, interest and share repurchases. Snap on expects to make contributions to its foreign pension plans in 2007 of $7.5 million; Snap on is not required to make a contribution to its domestic pension plans in 2007. Depending on market and other conditions, however, Snap on may elect to make discretionary cash contributions to its domestic pension plans in 2007. Snap ons long term financing strategy is to maintain continuous access to the debt markets to accommodate its liquidity needs. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on Snap ons debt and credit facilities. The following discussion focuses on information included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. 36 Cash flow provided from operating activities was $203.4 million in 2006, as compared to $221.1 million in 2005. The $17.7 million decrease in cash flow from operating activities in 2006 includes the impacts of higher levels of accounts receivable, primarily driven by the year over year fourth quarter sales increase, higher inventory levels to better meet customer demand as the company proceeds with implementing its strategic supply chain and other initiatives, and increased inventory associated with essential equipment and diagnostics deployments for major OEMs. Cash flow from operating activities in 2004 included a $63.6 million voluntary U.S. pension contribution and a $10.0 million payment to the U.S. Department of Justice pursuant to an agreement to resolve a government audit relating to two contracts with the GSA, partially offset by a $10.7 million income tax refund, primarily resulting from a fourth quarter 2003 voluntary U.S. pension contribution. Depreciation in 2006 was $48.5 million, compared with $49.5 million in 2005 and $58.5 million in 2004. The decline in depreciation from 2004 levels reflects the absence of depreciation for both the companys North American based ERP system, which became fully depreciated mid year 2004, and two U.S. hand tool facilities that were closed in 2004. Amortization expense was $3.4 million in 2006, $2.7 million in 2005 and $2.5 million in 2004. Capital expenditures in 2006 were $50.5 million, compared to $40.1 million in 2005 and $38.7 million in 2004. Capital expenditures in all three years reflect new product related, safety, quality, efficiency and cost reduction capital investments, including the installation of new production equipment and machine tooling to enhance manufacturing and distribution operations, as well as ongoing replacements of manufacturing and distribution facilities and equipment. Capital spending in 2006 included higher levels of spending to support the companys strategic supply chain initiatives and for the replacement and enhancement of its existing global ERP management information system, which began in 2006 and will continue over a period of several years. Snap on believes that its cash generated from operations, as well as the funds available from its credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund the companys capital expenditure requirements in 2007. Snap on has undertaken stock repurchases from time to time to offset dilution created by shares issued for employee and dealer stock purchase plans, stock options, and other corporate purposes, as well as to repurchase shares when the company believes market conditions are favorable. In 2006, Snap on repurchased 2,616,618 shares of common stock for $109.8 million under its previously announced share repurchase programs. The cash used to repurchase shares of common stock was partially offset by $89.5 million of proceeds from stock purchase and option plan exercises and $10.9 million of related excess tax benefits. As of December 30, 2006, Snap on has remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $152.1 million in common stock pursuant to the Board of Directors authorizations. The purchase of Snap on common stock is at the companys discretion, subject to prevailing financial and market conditions. Snap on repurchased 912,100 shares of common stock for $32.1 million in 2005 and 1,200,000 shares of common stock for $38.2 million in 2004. Snap on believes that its cash generated from operations, as well as the funds available from its credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund the companys share repurchases in 2007. On October 3, 2005, Snap on repaid its $100 million, 10 year, 6.625% unsecured notes upon their maturity. The $100 million debt repayment was made with available cash on hand. Snap on has paid consecutive quarterly cash dividends, without interruption or reduction, since 1939. Cash dividends paid in 2006, 2005 and 2004 totaled $63.6 million, $57.8 million and $57.7 million. At the beginning of fiscal 2006, the companys board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 8% to $0.27 per share. 2006 2005 2004 Cash dividends paid per common share $ 1.08 $ 1.00 $ 1.00 Cash dividends paid as a percent of prior year retained earnings 5.6 % 5.2 % 5.3 % Snap on believes that its cash generated from operations, as well as the funds available from its credit facilities, will be sufficient to pay dividends in 2007. 37 Contractual Obligations and Commitments A summary of Snap ons future contractual obligations and commitments as of December 30, 2006, are as follows: (Amounts in millions) Total Less Than 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years More Than 5 Years Contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 516.2 $ 10.6 $ 7.4 $ 348.2 $ 150.0 Interest on fixed rate debt 140.5 20.8 41.5 36.8 41.4 Operating leases 95.7 26.5 33.7 12.8 22.7 Capital leases 30.7 1.3 2.7 3.0 23.7 Purchase obligations 5.3 2.7 2.6 Total $ 788.4 $ 61.9 $ 87.9 $ 400.8 $ 237.8 At December 30, 2006, Snap on had commercial paper outstanding of $314.9 million. Snap on has presented $300.0 million of the $314.9 million in commercial paper borrowings as Long term debt on the accompanying December 30, 2006, Consolidated Balance Sheet as the company intended, and had the available debt capacity, to refinance these borrowings on a long term basis. The company has excluded payments related to its pension and postretirement benefit plans from the contractual obligation table above. See Notes 12 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the companys benefit plans and payments. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The company had no off balance sheet arrangements as of December 30, 2006. Environmental MattersSnap on is subject to various federal, state and local government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Snap ons policy is to comply with these requirements, and the company believes that, as a general matter, its policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with its business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in some of Snap ons operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses.Snap on is and has been engaged in the handling, manufacture, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies. The company believes that, as a general matter, its handling, manufacture, use and disposal of these substances are in accordance with environmental laws and regulations. It is possible, however, that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could bring into question the companys handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these substances. Consolidated Joint Venture SOC, a consolidated, 50% owned joint venture between Snap on and CIT, provides a broad range of financial services to Snap ons U.S. franchisee and customer network and to Snap ons industrial and other customers. Snap on began consolidating SOC as of the beginning of Snap ons 2004 fiscal year, as a result of the adoption of Financial Interpretation (FIN) No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (an interpretation of ARB No. 51). Prior to fiscal 2004, Snap on accounted for SOC using the equity method. Snap on and CIT have identical voting and participation rights and responsibilities in SOC. See Notes 1 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on SOC. Snap on receives royalty and management fee income from SOC based on the volume of financings originated by SOC. Snap on also shares ratably with CIT in any residual net profit or loss of the joint venture after operating expenses, including royalty and management fees, interest costs and credit loss provisions. Snap on provides extended term financing internationally through its wholly owned finance subsidiaries. 38 SOC sells substantially all of its originated contracts on a limited recourse basis to CIT, net of certain fees, and SOC continues to service these contracts for an estimated market rate servicing fee. In 2006, SOC originated contracts totaling $426.8 million, as compared to $413.8 million in 2005 and $481.2 million in 2004. Financial information regarding SOC loan originations is as follows: (Amounts in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Originations: Extended credit receivables $ 356.2 $ 327.0 $ 371.9 Equipment leases 28.8 41.1 44.5 Franchisee financing 41.8 45.7 64.8 Total $ 426.8 $ 413.8 $ 481.2 Number of accounts outstanding: Extended credit receivables 172,703 172,147 183,502 Equipment leases 10,710 12,045 12,823 Franchisee financing 3,306 3,477 3,866 Total 186,719 187,669 200,191 Other Matters Government Contract Matters On July 23, 2004, Snap on reached an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice to resolve the government audit relating to two contracts with the GSA. Snap on agreed to settle the claims over the interpretation and application of the price reduction and billing provisions of these two contracts for sales from March 1996 through the July 23, 2004, settlement date for $10.0 million. Snap on remitted the $10.0 million cash settlement to the U.S. Department of Justice on August 5, 2004. On August 5, 2005, the GSA notified the company that it would take no administrative action against Snap on in connection with the Federal Supply Schedule contracts referred to above. The company considers the matter closed. Other Legal Matters On May 16, 2006, Snap on reached an agreement to settle certain legal matters related to certain then current and former franchisees on a class basis. The court gave its final approval to the class settlement on October 27, 2006. Under the terms of the settlement, Snap on agreed to make payments to claimants and class counsel, plus incur certain other costs and expenses. Snap on recorded a $38.0 million pretax charge in the second quarter of 2006 representing its best estimate to settle these legal matters. Snap on disbursed funds of approximately $14 million for related legal fees, settlements and other expenses in the fourth quarter of 2006, and the company expects to disburse additional amounts, including amounts to the class claimants, beginning in the first quarter of 2007. Snap on has not admitted any wrongdoing by way of this settlement. Snap on is also involved in various other legal matters that are being litigated and or settled in the ordinary course of business. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of these other legal matters, management believes that the results will not have a material impact on Snap ons consolidated financial position or results of operations. New Accounting Standards See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on new accounting standards. 39 Critical Accounting Policies The consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to managements discussion and analysis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are generally based on historical experience, current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources, as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Snap on considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the companys financial position, results of operations and cash flow. Revenue Recognition: Snap on derives revenue primarily from the sale of tools, diagnostics and equipment solutions for professional tool and equipment users. Snap on markets its products and services through the worldwide franchise mobile van channel, company direct sales, and independent distributor and other non franchise channels, including its public Internet Web site. Snap on also derives revenue from various financing programs to facilitate the sales of its products. Snap on recognizes revenue from the sale of tools, diagnostics and equipment solutions when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) the price is fixed or determinable; (iii) collectibility is reasonably assured; and (iv) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered. Delivery generally occurs when the title and the risks and rewards of ownership have substantially transferred to the customer. For sales contingent upon customer acceptance or product installation, revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations are fulfilled. As required by SFAS No. 48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists, estimated product returns are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale based upon historical product return experience and assumptions for the gross profit margin and volume of future sales returns. Provisions for customer volume rebates, discounts and allowances are also recorded as a reduction of reported revenues at the time of sale based on historical experience and known trends. Revenue related to maintenance and subscription agreements is recognized over the term of the agreement. Financial Services Revenue: In addition to its sales of tools, diagnostics and equipment solutions, Snap on also generates revenue from various financing programs that include (i) loans to franchisees; and (ii) loans to the franchisees customer network and to Snap ons industrial and other customers for the purchase of tools and equipment on an extended term payment plan. These financing programs are offered through SOC, a consolidated, 50% owned joint venture with CIT, and the companys wholly owned international finance subsidiaries. Financial services revenue consists of SOCs sales of originated contracts to CIT and service fee income, as well as installment contract revenue and franchisee loan receivable revenue derived from SOC and Snap ons wholly owned international finance operations. The decision to finance through Snap on or another financing entity is solely at the election of the customer. When assessing customers for potential financing, Snap on considers various factors regarding ability to pay including financial condition, collateral, debt servicing ability, past payment experience and credit bureau information. Contracts originated by SOC and subsequently sold to CIT are also subject to the underwriting approval of CIT. Financing revenue from SOC is recognized primarily from the sale of originated contracts to CIT net of various fees, including securitization, warehousing, bad debt and prepayment fees. SOC continues to service these contracts for an estimated market rate servicing fee. Servicing fees are paid to SOC by CIT and such revenue is recognized over the contractual term of the loan, with a portion of the servicing fee recognized at the time of origination. Financing revenue from originated loans that are retained is recognized over the life of the contract, with interest computed on a daily basis. Snap ons wholly owned international finance subsidiaries own all of the loans originated through their financing programs. Revenue from interest income is recognized over the life of the contract, with interest computed on a daily basis. Franchise fee revenue, including nominal, non refundable initial and ongoing monthly fees (primarily for sales and business training and marketing and product promotion programs), is recognized as the fees are earned. 40 Allowances for Doubtful Accounts: Snap ons accounts receivable are reported net of estimated bad debt allowances, which are regularly evaluated by management for adequacy. The evaluations take into consideration various financial and qualitative factors that may affect customers ability to pay. These factors may include customers financial condition, collateral, debt servicing ability, past payment experience and credit bureau information. Snap on regularly reviews the allowance estimation process and adjusts the allowances as appropriate. It is possible, however, that the accuracy of Snap ons estimation process could be adversely impacted if the financial condition of its customers were to deteriorate. The company does not believe that accounts receivable represent significant concentrations of credit risk because of the diversified portfolio of individual customers and geographical areas. Inventory Valuation: Snap on values its inventory at the lower of cost or market and adjusts for the value of inventory that is estimated to be excess, obsolete or otherwise unmarketable. Inventory adjustments for raw materials are largely based on analysis of raw material age and actual physical inspection of raw material for fitness for use. As part of evaluating work in progress and finished goods, management reviews individual product SKUs by product category and product life cycle. Cost adjustments for each product category/product life cycle state are generally established and maintained based on a combination of historical experience, forecasted sales and promotions, technological obsolescence, inventory age and other actual known conditions and circumstances. Should actual product marketability and raw material fitness for use be affected by conditions that are different from management estimates, further adjustments to inventory allowances may be required. Warranty Accruals: Snap on provides product warranties for specific product lines and accrues for estimated future warranty costs in the period in which the sale is recorded. Snap on calculates its accrual requirements based on historic warranty loss experience that is periodically adjusted for recent actual experience, including the timing of claims during the warranty period and actual costs incurred. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on Snap ons warranty accrual. Pension Benefits: The calculation of Snap ons pension expense and projected benefit obligation requires the use of a number of assumptions. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of Snap ons control and can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements. Snap on believes that the two most critical assumptions are the expected return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate. Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases. Lowering the expected rate of return assumption for Snap ons domestic pension plan assets by 0.5% would increase Snap ons 2006 domestic pension expense by approximately $3.3 million. At year end 2006, Snap ons domestic plan assets comprised approximately 88% of Snap ons worldwide pension plan assets. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on Snap ons pension plans. Snap on establishes the discount rate using the current rates earned on long term bonds with a Moodys Aa rating. Pension expense and projected benefit obligation both increase as the discount rate is reduced. Lowering Snap ons domestic discount rate assumption by 0.5% would increase Snap ons 2006 domestic pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately $3.8 million and $40.8 million, respectively. At year end 2006, Snap ons domestic projected benefit obligation comprised approximately 82% of Snap ons worldwide projected benefit obligation. Income Taxes: The company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. While the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. In addition, the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. Stock based Compensation: Effective January 1, 2006, the company adopted SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, using the modified prospective method. SFAS No. 123(R) requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards (with limited exceptions). That cost, based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest, will be recognized over the period during which the employee is required to provide the service in exchange for the award. No compensation cost is recognized for awards for which employees do 41 not render the requisite service. Upon adoption, the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments was estimated using the Black Scholes valuation model. The Black Scholes valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the stock based award and stock price volatility. The assumptions used are managements best estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, the recorded and pro forma stock based compensation expense could have been materially different from that depicted in the financial statements. Outlook Snap on anticipates operating and earnings improvements in 2007. Snap on will continue implementing its strategic and rapid continuous improvement initiatives in 2007, including its focus on product innovation, strengthening the franchise proposition, enhancing customer service, improving manufacturing and process effectiveness, lowering administrative costs, and pursuing growth initiatives. Snap on expects to incur approximately $26 million to $30 million of restructuring costs in 2007, up from $22 million in 2006, as part of its ongoing efforts to lower its cost structure and improve process effectiveness. Snap on anticipates 2007 capital expenditures to be in a range of $50 million to $60 million, and depreciation and amortization expense, including higher levels of intangible amortization from the business solutions acquisition, to be in a range of $70 million to $75 million. As a result of higher debt levels from the business solutions acquisition, Snap on anticipates incurring approximately $18 million to $20 million of higher year over year interest expense in 2007. Snap on believes its 2007 effective tax rate will approximate 34.5%. 42 Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market, Credit and Economic Risks Market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments. Snap on is exposed to market risk from changes in both foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Snap on monitors its exposure to these risks and attempts to manage the underlying economic exposures through the use of financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements. Snap on does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Snap ons broad based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole. Snap ons management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. Foreign Currency Risk Management Snap on has significant international operations and is subject to certain risks inherent with foreign operations that include currency fluctuations and restrictions on movement of funds. Foreign exchange risk exists to the extent that Snap on has payment obligations or receipts denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. To manage these exposures, Snap on identifies naturally offsetting positions and then generally purchases hedging instruments to protect the residual net anticipated exposures. Snap ons financial position and results of operations have not been materially affected by such events to date. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on foreign currency risk management. Interest Rate Risk Management Snap ons interest rate risk management policies are designed to reduce the potential earnings volatility that could arise from changes in interest rates. Through the use of interest rate swaps, Snap on aims to stabilize funding costs by managing the exposure created by the differing maturities and interest rate structures of Snap ons assets and liabilities. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on interest rate risk management. Snap on utilizes a Value at Risk (VAR) model to determine the potential one day loss in the fair value of its interest rate and foreign exchange sensitive financial instruments from adverse changes in market factors. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. Snap ons computations are based on the inter relationships among movements in various currencies and interest rates (variance/co variance technique). These inter relationships were determined by observing interest rate and foreign currency market changes over the preceding quarter. The estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value, calculated using the VAR model, at December 30, 2006, was $0.3 million on interest rate sensitive financial instruments and $0.2 million on foreign currency sensitive financial instruments. The VAR model is a risk management tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by Snap on, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors. Credit Risk Credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. Prior to granting credit, each customer is evaluated, taking into consideration the borrowers financial condition, collateral, debt servicing ability, past payment experience, credit bureau information and other financial and qualitative factors that may affect the borrowers ability to repay. Specific credit reviews and standard industry credit scoring models are used in performing this evaluation. Loans that have been granted are typically monitored through an asset quality review process that closely monitors past due accounts and initiates collection actions when appropriate. In addition to its direct credit risk exposure, Snap on also has credit risk exposure for certain SOC loan originations with recourse provisions against Snap on (primarily for franchisee van loans). At December 30, 2006, $16.2 million of loans originated by SOC have a recourse provision to Snap on if the loans become more than 90 days past due. For additional information on SOC, refer to the section entitled Consolidated Joint Venture in this Managements Discussion and Analysis and Notes 1 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 43 Commodity Risk The company is a purchaser of certain commodities such as steel, natural gas and electricity. The company is also a purchaser of components and parts that are integrated into the companys end products, as well as the purchaser of certain finished goods, all of which may contain various commodities including steel, aluminum and others. Snap ons supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers. The principal raw material used in the manufacture of our products is steel, which we purchase in competitive, price sensitive markets. To meet Snap ons high quality standards, our steel needs range from specialized alloys, which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers, to commodity types of alloys. These raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality. Some of these materials have been, and in the future may be, in short supply. As some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures, we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice. Additionally, unexpected price increases could result in higher prices to our customers or an erosion of the margins on our products. We believe our ability to sell our products is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road, the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles. These factors affect the frequency, type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians, and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians, the prosperity of the technicians and, subsequently, the demand the technicians have for our tools, other products and services, and the value they place on those products and services. To the extent that gasoline prices increase, consumers may turn to other, non gasoline based, methods of transportation, including more frequent use of public transportation. A decrease in the use of gasoline consuming vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for our products. To the extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm pricing agreements with its suppliers, the company may experience margin declines to the extent that it is not able to increase the selling prices of its products.
