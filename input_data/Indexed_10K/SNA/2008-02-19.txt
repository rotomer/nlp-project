Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management Overview In 2007 Snap on continued to implement strategic initiatives intended to create long term value for company shareholders, associates, franchisees and other distributor partners across all of its business segments and channels. During the year, Snap on believes it made measurable progress on many fronts. Net sales grew 15.7% year over year, with sales increases in each segment. Operating earnings of $324.8 million in 2007 nearly doubled from $162.8 million in 2006. Higher sales, increased income from financial services, and improved operating expense margins from ongoing efficiency, productivity and cost reduction (collectively Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI) initiatives, along with the absence of the 2006 franchisee litigation settlement cost, all contributed to the significant year over year earnings improvement. Our strategic priorities and plans for 2008 will continue to build on the improvement initiatives underway to achieve sustainable, profitable growth through increased sales and lower costs. In the Commercial & Industrial Group, higher sales, including growth in emerging markets, combined with expense control and savings from restructuring initiatives to deliver continued improvements in operating performance. Segment net sales in 2007 were up 13.3% and operating earnings were up 23.8%. Benefits from ongoing cost reduction and RCI initiatives, including increased production and sourcing of materials from lower cost regions and facilities, were major contributors to the year over year earnings improvement. As a result of continued sales growth, improved levels of customer service, and savings from RCI and restructuring activities, operating earnings increased to $131.5 million in 2007. The Commercial & Industrial Group expects to continue to build on the following strategic priorities in 2008: Continue to invest in emerging market growth initiatives, such as China, India and Eastern Europe; Increase market share in key industrial market segments by reaching new customers, building business with existing customers and continually improving order fill rates; Continued innovation in productivity enhancing products that utilize increasingly advanced technology; Continue to pursue key, large customers that offer long term growth potential; and Continue to rationalize the operating footprint and shift manufacturing activities to lower cost regions. In the Snap on Tools Group, considerable progress on fundamental, strategic initiatives strengthened company operating and financial performance, as well as franchisee performance and satisfaction. Higher sales of a mid tier brand of tools and equipment (Blue Point), a re launch of the companys warehouse distribution program, and a more focused promotional program all contributed to the 8.1% sales growth in 2007. Supply chain improvements and an ongoing transition to a market demand based replenishment system continued to improve complete and on time delivery of a broad assortment of products. Operating earnings of $125.1 million in 2007 improved significantly from prior year levels, primarily due to contributions from the higher sales and benefits from ongoing cost reduction and RCI initiatives, as well as the absence of the $38.0 million franchisee litigation settlement charge in 2006. 23 The Snap on Tools Group expects to continue to build on the progress made in enhancing the franchise proposition and delivering customer productivity solutions, with specific initiatives in 2008 focused on the following: Continue to improve franchisee profitability and satisfaction; Improve service to existing customers; Introduce programs to capture un served customers; Continued new product innovation and development; Continually improve the supply chain through investments in manufacturing and use of RCI; and Integrate customer driven, pull marketing initiatives. By executing in these areas, Snap on believes the company and its franchisees will continue to serve more customers better and more profitably. In the Diagnostics & Information Group, significant progress was realized across many facets of the business in 2007. Segment sales increased 28.5% to over $650 million, despite lower original equipment manufacturers (OEM) facilitation sales, due primarily to the wind down of a major facilitation program in Europe, and the outsourcing of certain non strategic, low margin products previously manufactured for the Snap on Tools Group. The integration of the Snap on Business Solutions (Business Solutions) acquisition, which was acquired November 28, 2006, provided an opportunity to successfully build closer relationships with key OEM customers and strengthen Snap ons position as a provider of productivity solutions. New product and program offerings, coupled with a renewed focus and dedication to customer delivery, were rewarded with solid sales growth. Integrating Snap ons RCI initiatives also drove improved operating cost leverage. The diagnostics equipment and software business, as well as the shop management business, grew through the development and launch of new hardware and software products targeted at a broader and growing customer base. Focus on RCI initiatives also achieved strong cost reduction and improved inventory turns. The Diagnostics & Information Group expects to build on the following strategic priorities in 2008: Continued growth in the base business and emerging markets; Further leveraging of customer relationships and product and service offerings; and Continued innovation in new products and services. Financial Services revenue increased 28.6% to $63.0 million, and operating income of $22.4 million increased 72.3% from the prior year. Originations in 2007 were flat with prior year levels. Cash Flows Snap on delivered continued increased cash flow from operations of $231.1 million in 2007, up from $203.4 million in the prior year. Snap on used available cash in 2007 to repurchase over 1.8 million shares of Snap on common stock for $94.4 million, pay dividends totaling $64.8 million, and pay down debt of $36.6 million. Capital expenditures in 2007 of $61.9 million reflect higher levels of efficiency and cost reduction capital investments and higher levels of spending to support strategic supply chain and other growth initiatives, including the expansion of the companys manufacturing capabilities in lower cost regions and emerging markets. Cash at year end 2007 of $93.0 million was up from $63.4 million at year end 2006. In 2006, the company used available cash to fund, in part, the purchase of the Business Solutions acquisition, pay dividends totaling $63.6 million, repurchase over 2.6 million shares of Snap on common stock for $109.8 million, and invest $50.5 million in capital expenditures. 24 Results of Operations Fiscal 2007 vs. Fiscal 2006 Highlights of Snap ons results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 29, 2007, and December 30, 2006, are as follows: (Amounts in millions) 2007 2006 Change Net sales $ 2,841.2 100.0 % $ 2,455.1 100.0 % $ 386.1 15.7 % Cost of goods sold (1,574.6 ) 55.4 % (1,375.3 ) 56.0 % (199.3 ) 14.5 % Gross profit 1,266.6 44.6 % 1,079.8 44.0 % 186.8 17.3 % Financial services revenue 63.0 100.0 % 49.0 100.0 % 14.0 28.6 % Financial services expenses (40.6 ) 64.4 % (36.0 ) 73.5 % (4.6 ) 12.8 % Operating income from financial services 22.4 35.6 % 13.0 26.5 % 9.4 72.3 % Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative (964.2 ) 33.9 % (892.0 ) 36.3 % (72.2 ) 8.1 % Litigation settlement (38.0 ) 1.6 % 38.0 NM Total operating expenses (964.2 ) 33.9 % (930.0 ) 37.9 % (34.2 ) 3.7 % Operating earnings 324.8 11.2 % 162.8 6.5 % 162.0 99.5 % Interest expense (46.1 ) 1.6 % (20.6 ) 0.8 % (25.5 ) 123.8 % Other income (expense) net 5.5 0.2 % 5.3 0.2 % 0.2 3.8 % Earnings before income taxes, minority interests and equity earnings (loss) 284.2 9.8 % 147.5 5.9 % 136.7 92.7 % Income tax expense (92.5 ) 3.2 % (45.9 ) 1.8 % (46.6 ) 101.5 % Earnings before minority interests and equity earnings (loss) 191.7 6.6 % 101.6 4.1 % 90.1 88.7 % Minority interests and equity earnings (loss), net of tax (2.5 ) 0.1 % (3.7 ) 0.2 % 1.2 32.4 % Net earnings from continuing operations 189.2 6.5 % 97.9 3.9 % 91.3 93.3 % Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax (8.0 ) 0.3 % 2.2 0.1 % (10.2 ) NM Net earnings $ 181.2 6.2 % $ 100.1 4.0 % $ 81.1 81.0 % NM: Not meaningful Note: Certain 2006 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2007 income statement presentation. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the 2007 income statement presentation. Percentage Disclosure: Cost of goods sold, Gross profit and Operating expense percentages are calculated as a percentage of Net sales. Financial services expenses and Operating income from financial services percentages are calculated as a percentage of Financial services revenue. All other income statement line item percentages are calculated as a percentage of the sum of Net sales and Financial services revenue. Net sales in 2007 increased $386.1 million, or 15.7%, from 2006 levels, including $84.0 million from currency translation. Sales in the Commercial & Industrial Group increased $158.6 million, or 13.3%, year over year, primarily due to higher sales of professional tools and equipment in Europe, increased industrial sales, and continued strong sales growth in emerging markets. Sales in the Snap on Tools Group increased $82.7 million, or 8.1%, from prior year levels, primarily driven by a 6.3% increase in North American sales and continued strong growth in international sales. In the Diagnostics & Information Group, sales were up $144.4 million, or 28.5%, from 2006 levels, primarily due to sales from the November 28, 2006, acquisition of Business Solutions, partially offset by lower sales due to the wind down of an OEM facilitation program in Europe, and by lower sales as a result of outsourcing certain products previously manufactured and sold to the Snap on Tools Group. Gross profit in 2007 was $1,266.6 million, as compared to $1,079.8 million in 2006. The $186.8 million improvement in 2007 gross profit primarily reflects benefits from the higher sales, $40.6 million of savings from ongoing RCI initiatives, and $30.9 25 million of currency translation. These increases were partially offset by $22.5 million of increased production and material costs, and $6.6 million of higher year over year restructuring costs. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit improved from 44.0% in 2006 to 44.6% in 2007. Operating expenses in 2007 were $964.2 million, as compared to $930.0 million in 2006. The $34.2 million increase in operating expenses includes $62.1 million of higher year over year operating expenses for Business Solutions (twelve months of operating expense in 2007 versus approximately five weeks of post acquisition operating expense in 2006), $22.2 million of unfavorable currency translation, higher volume related expenses, and increased spending for expansion in emerging markets. These increases in year over year operating expenses were largely offset by the absence, in 2007, of a $38.0 million franchisee litigation settlement charge recorded in 2006, higher benefits of $11.5 million from ongoing RCI initiatives, $6.4 million of gains on the sale of facilities and $2.0 million of lower restructuring costs. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses of 33.9% were significantly improved from 2006 levels. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the franchisee litigation settlement. Interest expense of $46.1 million in 2007 was up from $20.6 million in 2006 primarily due to higher debt levels to finance the Business Solutions acquisition. Other income (expense) net was income of $5.5 million in 2007 as compared to income of $5.3 million in 2006. This line item includes the impact of all non operating items such as interest income and hedging and currency exchange rate transaction gains and losses. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on other income (expense) net. Snap ons effective income tax rate on earnings before minority interests and equity earnings (loss) was 32.5% in 2007, as compared with 31.1% in the prior year. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on income taxes. On June 29, 2007, Snap on sold its Sun Electric Systems (SES) business based in the Netherlands for a nominal cash purchase price. SESs primary business was the research, development and manufacture of test equipment in Europe for aircraft hydraulics. SES reported full year sales of $18.3 million in 2006 and was not a significant subsidiary of Snap on. Snap on divested of SES as it deemed SES to be non core to the companys ongoing strategies. The anticipated future capital and other resources necessary to be expended in connection with the SES business were not consistent with Snap ons growth plans. Snap on recorded an $8.0 million net loss ($9.2 million net loss on sale partially offset by $1.2 million of net earnings from operations) from the sale of SES in 2007. Certain prior year amounts were reclassified on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings to reflect the sale of SES as Discontinued operations, net of tax. For segment reporting purposes, the results of operations of SES were previously included in the Diagnostics & Information Group. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on SES. Net earnings from continuing operations in 2007 were $189.2 million, or $3.23 per diluted share. Net earnings from continuing operations in 2006 were $97.9 million, or $1.65 per diluted share, including a $23.4 million after tax charge ($0.40 per diluted share) related to the resolution of the franchisee litigation settlement. Net earnings in 2007 were $181.2 million, or $3.09 per diluted share, as compared to net earnings of $100.1 million, or $1.69 per diluted share, in 2006. Results of operations for 2007 include a full year of operating results for Business Solutions; results of operations for 2006 include approximately five weeks of post acquisition operating results for Business Solutions. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the Business Solutions acquisition. 26 Exit and Disposal Activities See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on Snap ons exit and disposal activities. Segment Results Snap ons business segments are based on the organization structure used by management for making operating and investment decisions and for assessing performance. Snap ons reportable business segments include: (i) the Commercial & Industrial Group; (ii) the Snap on Tools Group; (iii) the Diagnostics & Information Group; and (iv) Financial Services. The Commercial & Industrial Group consists of the business operations providing tools and equipment products and equipment repair services to a broad range of industrial and commercial customers worldwide through direct, distributor and other non franchise distribution channels. The Snap on Tools Group consists of the business operations serving the worldwide franchise van channel. The Diagnostics & Information Group consists of the business operations providing diagnostics equipment, vehicle service information, business management systems, electronic parts catalogs, and other solutions for vehicle service to customers in the worldwide vehicle service and repair marketplace. Financial Services consists of the business operations of Snap on Credit LLC (SOC), a consolidated, 50% owned joint venture between Snap on and The CIT Group, Inc. (CIT), and Snap ons wholly owned finance subsidiaries in those international markets where Snap on has franchise operations. Snap on evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment revenues and operating earnings. For the Commercial & Industrial, Snap on Tools, and Diagnostics & Information Groups, segment net sales include both external and intersegment net sales. Snap on accounts for intersegment sales and transfers based primarily on standard costs with reasonable mark ups established between the segments. Identifiable assets by segment are those assets used in the respective reportable segments operations. Intersegment amounts are eliminated to arrive at consolidated financial results. Commercial & Industrial Group (Amounts in millions) 2007 2006 Change External net sales $ 1,208.6 89.5 % $ 1,048.6 88.0 % $ 160.0 15.3 % Intersegment net sales 142.0 10.5 % 143.4 12.0 % (1.4 ) 1.0 % Segment net sales 1,350.6 100.0 % 1,192.0 100.0 % 158.6 13.3 % Cost of goods sold (867.1 ) 64.2 % (756.3 ) 63.4 % (110.8 ) 14.7 % Gross profit 483.5 35.8 % 435.7 36.6 % 47.8 11.0 % Operating expenses (352.0 ) 26.1 % (329.5 ) 27.7 % (22.5 ) 6.8 % Segment operating earnings $ 131.5 9.7 % $ 106.2 8.9 % $ 25.3 23.8 % Segment net sales in 2007 increased $158.6 million, or 13.3%, from 2006 levels due to $101.4 million of higher sales and $57.2 million of currency translation. The $101.4 million sales increase primarily reflects higher sales of professional tools and equipment in Europe, increased industrial sales, and continued strong sales growth in emerging markets. 27 Segment gross profit of $483.5 million in 2007 was up $47.8 million over 2006 levels primarily due to higher sales, $24.6 million of savings from ongoing RCI initiatives, and $20.7 million of currency translation. These increases were partially offset by $14.4 million of increased production and material costs and $8.4 million of higher restructuring costs. Operating expenses of $352.0 million in 2007 were up $22.5 million from 2006 levels, but improved 160 basis points (100 basis points equals 1.0 percent) as a percentage of segment sales. The increase in year over year operating expenses primarily includes $15.2 million of currency translation, higher volume related expenses, increased investment spending to further expand the companys sales and manufacturing presence in emerging growth markets and lower cost regions, and $3.1 million of higher restructuring costs. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by $5.4 million of gains on the sale of facilities in Europe and $3.1 million of savings from ongoing RCI initiatives. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings in 2007 increased $25.3 million from 2006 levels. As a percentage of segment net sales, including the impact of $11.5 million of higher restructuring costs in 2007, operating earnings for the Commercial & Industrial Group improved from 8.9% in 2006 to 9.7% in 2007. Snap on Tools Group (Amounts in millions) 2007 2006 Change Segment net sales $ 1,107.7 100.0 % $ 1,025.0 100.0 % $ 82.7 8.1 % Cost of goods sold (618.2 ) 55.8 % (577.3 ) 56.3 % (40.9 ) 7.1 % Gross profit 489.5 44.2 % 447.7 43.7 % 41.8 9.3 % Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative (364.4 ) 32.9 % (372.1 ) 36.3 % 7.7 2.1 % Litigation settlement (38.0 ) 3.7 % 38.0 NM Total operating expenses (364.4 ) 32.9 % (410.1 ) 40.0 % 45.7 11.1 % Segment operating earnings $ 125.1 11.3 % $ 37.6 3.7 % $ 87.5 232.7 % NM: Not meaningful Segment net sales in 2007 increased $82.7 million, or 8.1%, from 2006 levels primarily driven by a 6.3% increase in North American franchise sales, including higher sales from a new mid tier product offering and the re launch of the companys in house warehouse distribution program, as well as the impacts of lower levels of franchisee turnover and product returns. Sales in the companys international franchise operations increased 15.3% year over year primarily due to continued strong growth in the United Kingdom and Australia. Currency translation contributed $18.0 million of the segments year over year sales increase. Segment gross profit of $489.5 million in 2007 was up $41.8 million from 2006 levels primarily due to the higher sales and lower costs, including $15.9 million of benefits from ongoing RCI initiatives and $7.1 million of currency translation. These improvements to gross profit were partially offset by $7.0 million of higher production and material costs. Operating expenses of $364.4 million in 2007 were down $45.7 million from prior year levels primarily due to the absence of the $38.0 million franchisee litigation settlement charge recorded in 2006, lower spending of $4.4 million in 2007 related to the companys strategic supply chain and franchise system initiatives, $3.3 million of lower bad debt expense, and $3.2 million of lower restructuring costs. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by $4.2 million of currency translation and higher volume related expenses. As a result of these factors, operating earnings in 2007 for the Snap on Tools Group increased $87.5 million from 2006 levels and, as a percentage of segment net sales, improved from 3.7% in 2006 to 11.3% in 2007. 28 Diagnostics & Information Group (Amounts in millions) 2007 2006 Change External net sales $ 524.9 80.7 % $ 381.5 75.4 % $ 143.4 37.6 % Intersegment net sales 125.7 19.3 % 124.7 24.6 % 1.0 0.8 % Segment net sales 650.6 100.0 % 506.2 100.0 % 144.4 28.5 % Cost of goods sold (357.0 ) 54.9 % (309.8 ) 61.2 % (47.2 ) 15.2 % Gross profit 293.6 45.1 % 196.4 38.8 % 97.2 49.5 % Operating expenses (194.1 ) 29.8 % (136.6 ) 27.0 % (57.5 ) 42.1 % Segment operating earnings $ 99.5 15.3 % $ 59.8 11.8 % $ 39.7 66.4 % Segment net sales in 2007 of $650.6 million increased $144.4 million, or 28.5%, from 2006 levels primarily due to $179.0 million of higher sales in 2007 (twelve months of sales in 2007 versus approximately five weeks of post acquisition sales in 2006) from Business Solutions and higher sales of diagnostics and information products. Currency translation contributed $11.8 million of the year over year sales increase. These increases were partially offset by approximately $35 million of lower sales due to the wind down of an OEM facilitation program in Europe, and by lower sales from the outsourcing of certain non strategic, low margin diagnostics equipment products previously manufactured and sold to the Snap on Tools Group. Segment gross profit of $293.6 million in 2007 was up $97.2 million from 2006 levels primarily due to the higher sales and a more favorable product mix. As a percentage of segment net sales, gross profit margin of 45.1% in 2007 improved significantly from 38.8% in 2006. Operating expenses of $194.1 million were up $57.5 million from 2006 levels primarily due to $62.1 million of higher operating expenses for Business Solutions (twelve months of operating expense in 2007 versus approximately five weeks of post acquisition operating expense in 2006), partially offset by $7.3 million of savings from ongoing RCI initiatives. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Diagnostics & Information Group in 2007 increased $39.7 million from 2006 levels and, as a percentage of segment net sales, improved from 11.8% in 2006 to 15.3% in 2007. Financial Services (Amounts in millions) 2007 2006 Change Financial services revenue $ 63.0 100.0 % $ 49.0 100.0 % $ 14.0 28.6 % Financial services expenses (40.6 ) 64.4 % (36.0 ) 73.5 % (4.6 ) 12.8 % Segment operating income $ 22.4 35.6 % $ 13.0 26.5 % $ 9.4 72.3 % Financial services operating income in 2007 was $22.4 million on $63.0 million of revenue, as compared with $13.0 million of operating income on $49.0 million of revenue in 2006. The increase in operating income primarily reflects the impact of higher net yields and lower borrowing costs. Originations of $539.6 million in 2007 were essentially flat with prior year levels. Corporate Snap ons general corporate expenses of $53.7 million in 2007 were essentially flat with the $53.8 million incurred in 2006. 29 Fourth Quarter Highlights of Snap ons results of operations for the fiscal fourth quarters ended December 29, 2007, and December 30, 2006, are as follows: Three Months Ended (Amounts in millions) December 29, 2007 December 30, 2006 Change Net sales $ 742.9 100.0 % $ 651.4 100.0 % $ 91.5 14.0 % Cost of goods sold (409.5 ) 55.1 % (368.7 ) 56.6 % (40.8 ) 11.1 % Gross profit 333.4 44.9 % 282.7 43.4 % 50.7 17.9 % Financial services revenue 19.0 100.0 % 14.8 100.0 % 4.2 28.4 % Financial services expenses (11.0 ) 57.9 % (9.8 ) 66.2 % (1.2 ) 12.2 % Operating income from financial services 8.0 42.1 % 5.0 33.8 % 3.0 60.0 % Operating expenses (245.1 ) 33.0 % (229.1 ) 35.2 % (16.0 ) 7.0 % Operating earnings 96.3 12.6 % 58.6 8.8 % 37.7 64.3 % Interest expense (11.5 ) 1.5 % (7.0 ) 1.1 % (4.5 ) 64.3 % Other income (expense) net (0.4 ) 0.1 % 2.0 0.3 % (2.4 ) NM Earnings before income taxes, minority interests and equity earnings (loss) 84.4 11.0 % 53.6 8.0 % 30.8 57.5 % Income tax expense (26.3 ) 3.4 % (15.3 ) 2.3 % (11.0 ) 71.9 % Earnings before minority interests and equity earnings (loss) 58.1 7.6 % 38.3 5.7 % 19.8 51.7 % Minority interests and equity earnings (loss), net of tax (0.8 ) 0.1 % % (1.0 ) 0.1 % % 0.2 20.0 % Net earnings from continuing operations 57.3 7.5 37.3 5.6 20.0 53.6 % Income from discontinued operations, net of tax 0.7 0.1 % (0.7 ) NM Net earnings $ 57.3 7.5 % $ 38.0 5.7 % $ 19.3 50.8 % NM: Not meaningful Note: Certain 2006 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2007 income statement presentation. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the 2007 income statement presentation. Percentage Disclosure: Cost of goods sold, Gross profit and Operating expense percentages are calculated as a percentage of Net sales. Financial services expenses and Operating income from financial services percentages are calculated as a percentage of Financial services revenue. All other income statement line item percentages are calculated as a percentage of the sum of Net sales and Financial services revenue. Net sales in the fourth quarter of 2007 increased $91.5 million, or 14.0%, from 2006 levels, including $59.9 million of higher sales and $31.6 million of currency translation. Sales in the Commercial & Industrial Group increased $51.5 million, or 16.2%, year over year, primarily due to higher industrial sales, increased sales of professional tools and equipment in Europe, and continued strong sales growth in emerging markets. Sales in the Snap on Tools Group increased $11.6 million, or 4.4%, from 2006 levels primarily driven by continued strong sales in the companys international franchise operations and higher sales in North America. Sales in the Diagnostics & Information Group increased $29.4 million, or 21.0%, from 2006 levels primarily due to incremental fourth quarter sales in 2007 from the November 28, 2006, acquisition of Business Solutions (13 weeks of sales in 2007 versus approximately five weeks of post acquisition sales in 2006) and higher sales of diagnostics and information products, partially offset by lower sales due to the wind down of an OEM facilitation program in Europe. 30 Gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2007 was $333.4 million, or 44.9% of net sales, as compared to $282.7 million, or 43.4% of net sales, in 2006. The $50.7 million improvement in 2007 gross profit primarily reflects benefits from the higher sales, savings from ongoing RCI initiatives of $12.6 million, and currency translation of $11.4 million, partially offset by $7.4 million of increased production and material costs. Fourth quarter 2007 gross profit also benefited from $6.0 million of last in, first out (LIFO) related inventory benefits; gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2006 included LIFO related charges of $4.1 million. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2007 were $245.1 million, as compared to $229.1 million in 2006. The $16.0 million increase includes $9.6 million of higher year over year operating expenses for Business Solutions, $8.0 million of currency translation, higher volume related expenses, and $3.8 million of increased restructuring costs. These increases were partially offset by a $4.0 million gain on the sale of a facility in Europe, $2.6 million of lower bad debt expense, $1.9 million of benefits from ongoing RCI initiatives, and $1.7 million of lower spending in 2007 related to the companys strategic supply chain and franchise system initiatives. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses improved 220 basis points to 33.0% in the fourth quarter of 2007, as compared to 35.2% in 2006. Interest expense of $11.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 was up $4.5 million from 2006 levels primarily due to higher debt levels to finance the Business Solutions acquisition. Other income (expense) net was expense of $0.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 as compared to income of $2.0 million in 2006. This line item includes the impact of all non operating items such as interest income and hedging and currency exchange rate transaction gains and losses. Snap ons effective income tax rate on earnings before minority interests and equity earnings (loss) in the fourth quarter of 2007 was 31.2%, as compared with 28.5% in the prior year. The lower effective tax rate in 2006 primarily reflects the reversal of certain foreign income tax valuation allowances. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on income taxes. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2007 were $57.3 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, as compared with net earnings of $38.0 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, in 2006. Results of operations for the fourth quarter of 2007 include a full quarter (13 weeks) of operating results for Business Solutions; results of operations for the fourth quarter of 2006 included approximately five weeks of post acquisition operating results for Business Solutions. Commercial & Industrial Group Three Months Ended (Amounts in millions) December 29, 2007 December 30, 2006 Change External net sales $ 333.3 90.3 % $ 278.4 87.6 % $ 54.9 19.7 % Intersegment net sales 36.0 9.7 % 39.4 12.4 % (3.4 ) 8.6 % Segment net sales 369.3 100.0 % 317.8 100.0 % 51.5 16.2 % Cost of goods sold (236.8 ) 64.1 % (201.2 ) 63.3 % (35.6 ) 17.7 % Gross profit 132.5 35.9 % 116.6 36.7 % 15.9 13.6 % Operating expenses (94.3 ) 25.6 % (84.4 ) 26.6 % (9.9 ) 11.7 % Segment operating earnings $ 38.2 10.3 % $ 32.2 10.1 % $ 6.0 18.6 % Segment net sales in the fourth quarter of 2007 increased $51.5 million, or 16.2%, from 2006 levels, including $30.1 million of higher sales and $21.4 million of currency translation. The $30.1 million sales increase primarily reflects higher industrial sales, increased sales of professional tools and equipment in Europe, and continued strong sales growth in emerging markets. 31 Segment gross profit of $132.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 was up $15.9 million over 2006 levels. The improvement in gross profit primarily reflects benefits from the higher sales, $8.5 million of savings from ongoing RCI initiatives, and $7.3 million of currency translation. These improvements in gross profit were partially offset by $6.2 million of higher production and material costs and $1.1 million of higher year over year restructuring costs. Operating expenses of $94.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 were up $9.9 million from 2006 levels, but improved 100 basis points as a percentage of segment sales. The increase in operating expenses primarily includes $5.1 million of currency translation, $3.6 million of higher restructuring costs, higher volume related expenses, and increased investment spending to further expand Snap ons presence in emerging growth markets and lower cost regions. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $4.0 million gain on the sale of a facility in Europe and $1.1 million of savings from ongoing RCI initiatives. As a result of these factors, fourth quarter operating earnings for the Commercial & Industrial Group increased $6.0 million from 2006 levels. As a percentage of segment net sales, including the impact of $4.7 million of higher restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of 2007, operating earnings for the Commercial & Industrial Group improved from 10.1% in 2006 to 10.3% in 2007. Snap on Tools Group Three Months Ended (Amounts in millions) December 29, 2007 December 30, 2006 Change Segment net sales $ 273.2 100.0 % $ 261.6 100.0 % $ 11.6 4.4 % Cost of goods sold (148.1 ) 54.2 % (154.5 ) 59.1 % 6.4 4.1 % Gross profit 125.1 45.8 % 107.1 40.9 % 18.0 16.8 % Operating expenses (88.6 ) 32.4 % (91.9 ) 35.1 % 3.3 3.6 % Segment operating earnings $ 36.5 13.4 % $ 15.2 5.8 % $ 21.3 140.1 % Segment net sales in the fourth quarter of 2007 increased $11.6 million, or 4.4%, from 2006 levels. Sales in the companys international franchise operations increased $9.6 million, or 19.3%, over 2006 levels, primarily due to continued strong sales growth in the United Kingdom and higher sales in Japan. Sales in the companys North American franchise operations increased 1.0% from 2006 levels. Currency translation contributed $7.5 million of the segments year over year sales increase. Segment gross profit of $125.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 was up $18.0 million over 2006 levels primarily due to the higher sales and lower costs, including benefits of $4.1 million from ongoing RCI initiatives and $3.0 million of currency translation. Segment gross profit in 2007 also includes $6.0 million of LIFO related inventory benefits; segment gross profit in 2006 included $4.1 million of LIFO related charges. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2007 declined $3.3 million from prior year levels primarily due to $2.3 million of lower bad debt expense and $1.7 million of lower costs in 2007 related to the companys strategic supply chain and franchise system initiatives. As a result of these factors, fourth quarter operating earnings for the Snap on Tools Group increased $21.3 million from 2006 levels and, as a percentage of segment net sales, improved from 5.8% in 2006 to 13.4% in 2007. 32 Diagnostics & Information Group Three Months Ended (Amounts in millions) December 29, 2007 December 30, 2006 Change External net sales $ 136.4 80.5 % $ 111.4 79.5 % $ 25.0 22.4 % Intersegment net sales 33.1 19.5 % 28.7 20.5 % 4.4 15.3 % Segment net sales 169.5 100.0 % 140.1 100.0 % 29.4 21.0 % Cost of goods sold (93.7 ) 55.3 % (81.1 ) 57.9 % (12.6 ) 15.5 % Gross profit 75.8 44.7 % 59.0 42.1 % 16.8 28.5 % Operating expenses (48.4 ) 28.5 % (38.3 ) 27.3 % (10.1 ) 26.4 % Segment operating earnings $ 27.4 16.2 % $ 20.7 14.8 % $ 6.7 32.4 % Segment net sales of $169.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 increased $29.4 million, or 21.0%, from 2006 levels. Incremental year over year sales of $31.4 million from the acquisition of Business Solutions (13 weeks of sales in 2007 versus approximately five weeks of post acquisition sales in 2006) and higher sales of diagnostics and information products were partially offset by lower sales due to the wind down of an OEM facilitation program in Europe. Currency translation contributed $3.8 million of the year over year sales increase. Segment gross profit of $75.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 increased $16.8 million from 2006 levels primarily due to the higher sales and a more favorable product mix. As a percentage of segment net sales, gross profit margin of 44.7% was up 260 basis points from 2006 levels. Operating expenses of $48.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 were up $10.1 million from 2006 levels primarily due to $9.6 million of higher year over year operating expenses for Business Solutions, partially offset by $2.6 million of savings from ongoing RCI initiatives. As a result of these factors, fourth quarter operating earnings for the Diagnostics & Information Group increased $6.7 million from 2006 levels and, as a percentage of segment net sales, improved from 14.8% in 2006 to 16.2% in 2007. Financial Services Three Months Ended (Amounts in millions) December 29, 2007 December 30, 2006 Change Financial services revenue $ 19.0 100.0 % $ 14.8 100.0 % $ 4.2 28.4 % Financial services expenses (11.0 ) 57.9 % (9.8 ) 66.2 % (1.2 ) 12.2 % Segment operating income $ 8.0 42.1 % $ 5.0 33.8 % $ 3.0 60.0 % Financial services operating income in the fourth quarter of 2007 was $8.0 million on $19.0 million of revenue, as compared with $5.0 million of operating income on $14.8 million of revenue in 2006. The increase in operating income primarily reflects the impact of higher net yields. Originations of $139.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 were up 3.0% from prior year levels. Corporate Snap ons general corporate expenses of $13.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 were down slightly from the $14.5 million incurred in the fourth quarter of 2006. 33 Fiscal 2006 vs. Fiscal 2005 Highlights of Snap ons results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2006, and December 31, 2005, are as follows: (Amounts in millions) 2006 2005 Change Net sales $ 2,455.1 100.0 % $ 2,281.0 100.0 % $ 174.1 7.6 % Cost of goods sold (1,375.3 ) 56.0 % (1,269.8 ) 55.7 % (105.5 ) 8.3 % Gross profit 1,079.8 44.0 % 1,011.2 44.3 % 68.6 6.8 % Financial services revenue 49.0 100.0 % 53.6 100.0 % (4.6 ) 8.6 % Financial services expenses (36.0 ) 73.5 % (37.9 ) 70.7 % 1.9 5.0 % Operating income from financial services 13.0 26.5 % 15.7 29.3 % (2.7 ) 17.2 % Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative (892.0 ) 36.3 % (863.5 ) 37.9 % (28.5 ) 3.3 % Litigation settlement (38.0 ) 1.6 % NM (38.0 ) NM Total operating expenses (930.0 ) 37.9 % (863.5 ) 37.9 % (66.5 ) 7.7 % Operating earnings 162.8 6.5 % 163.4 7.0 % (0.6 ) 0.4 % Interest expense (20.6 ) 0.8 % (21.7 ) 0.9 % 1.1 5.1 % Other income (expense) net 5.3 0.2 % 3.1 0.1 % 2.2 70.9 % Earnings before income taxes, minority interests and equity earnings (loss) 147.5 5.9 % 144.8 6.2 % 2.7 1.9 % Income tax expense (45.9 ) 1.8 % (55.2 ) 2.4 % 9.3 16.8 % Earnings before minority interests and equity earnings (loss) 101.6 4.1 % 89.6 3.8 % 12.0 13.4 % Minority interests and equity earnings (loss), net of tax (3.7 ) 0.2 % (1.4 ) 0.1 % (2.3 ) NM Net earnings from continuing operations 97.9 3.9 % 88.2 3.7 % 9.7 11.0 % Income from discontinued operations, net of tax 2.2 0.1 % 4.7 0.2 % (2.5 ) 53.2 % Net earnings $ 100.1 4.0 % $ 92.9 3.9 % $ 7.2 7.8 % NM: Not meaningful Note: Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2007 income statement presentation. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the 2007 income statement presentation. Percentage Disclosure: Cost of goods sold, Gross profit and Operating expense percentages are calculated as a percentage of Net sales. Financial services expenses and Operating income from financial services percentages are calculated as a percentage of Financial services revenue. All other income statement line item percentages are calculated as a percentage of the sum of Net sales and Financial services revenue. Net sales in 2006 increased $174.1 million, or 7.6%, from 2005 levels, including $11.0 million from currency translation. The increase in net sales includes higher sales in the Diagnostics & Information Groups OEM facilitation business and $20.4 million of sales for the approximate five week period following the companys November 28, 2006, acquisition of Business Solutions. Sales in the Commercial & Industrial Group also increased year over year primarily due to higher sales of tools for U.S. commercial and industrial applications, improved worldwide sales of equipment products, along with continued growth in emerging markets. Sales in the Snap on Tools Group increased $30.5 million, or 3.1%, over 2005 levels, reflecting sales increases in both the North American and international franchise operations. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the Business Solutions acquisition. 34 Gross profit was $1,079.8 million, or 44.0% of net sales, in 2006, as compared to $1,011.2 million, or 44.3% of net sales, in 2005. The $68.6 million increase in 2006 gross profit primarily reflects benefits from higher sales and pricing, as well as benefits from lower costs, including benefits from ongoing RCI initiatives of $34.9 million. The year over year increase in gross profit also includes $11.5 million from the fourth quarter 2006 acquisition of Business Solutions and $4.2 million of currency translation. These increases in gross profit were partially offset by higher year over year production costs of $22.6 million, and LIFO and other inventory expenses of $11.2 million, including a $1.0 million charge related to LIFO inventories in 2006 versus a comparable $8.8 million benefit in 2005. Restructuring costs included in Cost of goods sold totaled $12.1 million in 2006, as compared to $3.0 million in 2005. The 30 basis point decline in year over year gross profit as a percentage of net sales also reflects the impact of a shift in product mix that included higher 2006 sales (and lower relative gross margin) in the OEM facilitation business. Financial services operating income was $13.0 million on $49.0 million of revenue in 2006, as compared with $15.7 million of operating income on $53.6 million of revenue in 2005. The decrease in operating income primarily reflects the impact of lower net interest spreads, partially offset by higher levels of originations. Operating expenses in 2006 were $930.0 million, as compared to $863.5 million in 2005. The $66.5 million increase in 2006 operating expenses is primarily due to the recording of a $38.0 million pretax charge in the second quarter of 2006 related to the settlement of franchisee litigation matters. Operating expenses in 2006 also included $22.8 million in higher spending for strategic growth initiatives and $22.0 million of higher stock based and performance based incentive compensation, including $6.3 million in costs associated with the January 1, 2006, adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, on a prospective basis. The year over year increase in 2006 operating expenses also includes $6.7 million of operating expenses from the acquisition of Business Solutions and $2.7 million of currency translation. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by benefits from ongoing RCI initiatives of $15.3 million, as well as the absence of $3.0 million of costs incurred in 2005 to terminate a supplier relationship. Restructuring costs included in Operating expenses totaled $9.6 million in 2006, as compared to $15.4 million in 2005. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the franchisee litigation settlement. Interest expense of $20.6 million in 2006 was slightly lower than the $21.7 million incurred in 2005 primarily due to lower average debt levels, including the October 3, 2005, repayment of $100 million of unsecured 6.625% notes. The year over year decrease in interest expense was partially offset by the impacts of higher interest rates and $1.8 million of interest expense in 2006 related to the issuance of approximately $305 million of commercial paper obligations to finance, in part, the November 28, 2006, acquisition of Business Solutions. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on commercial paper borrowings. Other income (expense) net was income of $5.3 million in 2006, as compared to income of $3.1 million in 2005. This line item includes the impact of all non operating items such as interest income and hedging and currency exchange rate transaction gains and losses. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on other income (expense) net. Snap ons effective income tax rate on earnings before minority interests and equity earnings (loss) was 31.1% in 2006, as compared with 38.1% in the prior year. The lower effective tax rate in 2006 primarily reflects the mix of U.S. and non U.S. earnings, including the impacts of the $38.0 million pretax franchisee litigation settlement charge that was tax effected at a higher U.S. tax rate, and the reversal of foreign income tax valuation allowances as a result of foreign restructuring and other activities. Snap ons effective income tax rate of 38.1% in 2005 included $3.3 million of additional U.S. income tax expense related to the repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the AJCA). Under the provisions of the AJCA, Snap on repatriated approximately $93 million of qualifying dividends in 2005. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on income taxes. Net earnings in 2006 were $100.1 million, or $1.69 per diluted share, including a $23.4 million after tax charge ($0.40 per diluted share) related to the resolution of the franchisee litigation settlement, as compared with net earnings of $92.9 million, or $1.59 per diluted share, in 2005. Results of operations for fiscal 2006 included approximately five weeks of operating results for the November 28, 2006, acquisition of Business Solutions. Exit and Disposal Activities See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on Snap ons exit and disposal activities. 35 Segment Results Commercial & Industrial Group (Amounts in millions) 2006 2005 Change External net sales $ 1,048.6 88.0 % $ 1,009.0 89.4 % $ 39.6 3.9 % Intersegment net sales 143.4 12.0 % 120.2 10.6 % 23.2 19.3 % Segment net sales 1,192.0 100.0 % 1,129.2 100.0 % 62.8 5.6 % Cost of goods sold (756.3 ) 63.4 % (734.7 ) 65.1 % (21.6 ) 2.9 % Gross profit 435.7 36.6 % 394.5 34.9 % 41.2 10.4 % Operating expenses (329.5 ) 27.7 % (324.9 ) 28.7 % (4.6 ) 1.4 % Segment operating earnings $ 106.2 8.9 % $ 69.6 6.2 % $ 36.6 52.6 % Segment net sales in 2006 increased $62.8 million, or 5.6%, from 2005 levels due to $54.9 million of higher sales and $7.9 million of currency translation. The $54.9 million sales increase primarily reflects growth in emerging markets, higher worldwide equipment and power tool sales, and increased sales of tools for U.S. commercial and industrial applications. Segment gross profit of $435.7 million in 2006 was up $41.2 million, or 170 basis points as a percentage of segment sales, over 2005 levels. The improvement in 2006 gross profit primarily reflects benefits from increased sales of higher margin products and improved pricing, savings of $16.7 million from ongoing RCI initiatives, including increased production and sourcing of materials from lower cost regions and facilities, and $2.4 million of currency translation. These improvements were partially offset by $5.7 million of higher restructuring costs primarily related to manufacturing footprint initiatives in Europe, and $3.7 million of higher material and production costs. Operating expenses increased $4.6 million, but decreased 100 basis points as a percentage of segment sales, from 2005 levels. The operating expense increase includes higher volume related expenses, $6.7 million of increased spending to support the expansion of Snap ons sales and manufacturing presence in emerging growth markets and lower cost regions, higher performance based incentive compensation of $2.1 million, and $1.6 million of currency translation. These increases were partially offset by $6.5 million of benefits from ongoing RCI initiatives and $3.6 million of lower restructuring costs. As a result of these factors, operating earnings in 2006 for the Commercial & Industrial Group increased $36.6 million over 2005 levels. Snap on Tools Group (Amounts in millions) 2006 2005 Change Segment net sales $ 1,025.0 100.0 % $ 994.5 100.0 % $ 30.5 3.1 % Cost of goods sold (577.3 ) 56.3 % (548.9 ) 55.2 % (28.4 ) 5.2 % Gross profit 447.7 43.7 % 445.6 44.8 % 2.1 0.5 % Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative (372.1 ) 36.3 % (363.4 ) 36.5 % (8.7 ) 2.4 % Litigation settlement (38.0 ) 3.7 % (38.0 ) NM Total operating expenses (410.1 ) 40.0 % (363.4 ) 36.5 % (46.7 ) 12.9 % Segment operating earnings $ 37.6 3.7 % $ 82.2 8.3 % $ (44.6 ) 54.3 % NM: Not meaningful Segment net sales in 2006 increased $30.5 million from 2005 levels due to $28.4 million of higher sales and $2.1 million of currency translation. Sales in the companys North American franchise operations were up 3.1% over 2005 levels, primarily driven by a significant year over year increase in fourth quarter U.S. sales, partially offset by a lower average number of U.S. franchisees in 2006. The average number of U.S. franchisees in 2006 was down 3.0% from 2005 levels. As the company continues implementing its strategic initiatives to improve the franchise system, it anticipates that the decline in the number of U.S. franchisees will moderate. In 2006, sales in the companys international franchise operations were up 3.1% from 2005 levels, largely due to strong sales growth in the United Kingdom and Australia. 36 Segment gross profit of $447.7 million in 2006 was up slightly from $445.6 million in 2005. The $2.1 million increase in 2006 gross profit primarily reflects the higher sales and selling prices, as well as lower costs of $17.3 million from ongoing RCI initiatives. These increases were partially offset by higher production costs and $10.5 million of increased year over year LIFO and other inventory expenses, including a $1.0 million charge related to LIFO inventories in 2006, versus a comparable $8.8 million benefit in 2005. Snap on also incurred $2.0 million of higher restructuring costs in 2006 primarily related to the expected mid 2007 closure of its Johnson City, Tennessee, hand tool facility. Snap on expects to phase out production at the Johnson City facility and transfer production to other Snap on hand tool facilities and suppliers. Gross profit as a percentage of segment sales was 43.7%, down 110 basis points from 44.8% in the prior year. Operating expenses in 2006 were up $46.7 million from prior year levels, primarily due to the $38.0 million pretax franchisee litigation settlement charge, $13.3 million of higher costs, including $1.7 million of restructuring related costs, to support strategic supply chain and franchise system initiatives, and $5.5 million of higher performance based incentive compensation. These increases were partially offset by $4.6 million of benefits from ongoing RCI initiatives and the absence of $3.0 million of costs incurred in 2005 to terminate a supplier relationship. As a result of these factors, operating earnings in 2006 for the Snap on Tools Group declined $44.6 million from 2005 levels. Diagnostics & Information Group (Amounts in millions) 2006 2005 Change External net sales $ 381.5 75.4 % $ 277.5 68.5 % $ 104.0 37.5 % Intersegment net sales 124.7 24.6 % 127.6 31.5 % (2.9 ) 2.3 % Segment net sales 506.2 100.0 % 405.1 100.0 % 101.1 25.0 % Cost of goods sold (309.8 ) 61.2 % (234.0 ) 57.8 % (75.8 ) 32.4 % Gross profit 196.4 38.8 % 171.1 42.2 % 25.3 14.8 % Operating expenses (136.6 ) 27.0 % (128.8 ) 31.8 % (7.8 ) 6.1 % Segment operating earnings $ 59.8 11.8 % $ 42.3 10.4 % $ 17.5 41.4 % Segment net sales of $506.2 million in 2006 increased $101.1 million, or 25.0%, from 2005 levels, largely due to higher OEM facilitation sales, $20.4 million of incremental sales for the approximate five week period following the companys November 28, 2006, acquisition of Business Solutions, and increased sales of information products. Currency translation contributed $1.5 million to the year over year sales increase. Segment gross profit of $196.4 million in 2006 was up $25.3 million from 2005 levels primarily due to the higher sales, including $11.5 million from the Business Solutions acquisition, and $2.2 million of benefits from efficiency and productivity initiatives, partially offset by $1.4 million of higher restructuring costs. As a percentage of segment net sales, gross profit margin of 38.8% was down 340 basis points from 2005 levels, reflecting a shift in product mix that included higher 2006 OEM (and lower relative gross margin) facilitation sales. Operating expenses in 2006 of $136.6 million were up $7.8 million from 2005 levels. The increase in year over year operating expenses primarily includes $6.7 million of operating expenses from the Business Solutions acquisition and $4.5 million of higher spending to support strategic growth initiatives, partially offset by $3.3 million of benefits from efficiency and productivity initiatives. As a result of these factors, operating earnings in 2006 for the Diagnostics & Information Group increased $17.5 million over 2005 levels. Financial Services (Amounts in millions) 2006 2005 Change Financial services revenue $ 49.0 100.0 % $ 53.6 100.0 % $ (4.6 ) 8.6 % Financial services expenses (36.0 ) 73.5 % (37.9 ) 70.7 % 1.9 5.0 % Segment operating income $ 13.0 26.5 % $ 15.7 29.3 % $ (2.7 ) 17.2 % Financial services operating income in 2006 was $13.0 million on $49.0 million of revenue, as compared with $15.7 million of operating income on $53.6 million of revenue in 2005. The decrease in operating income primarily reflects the impact of lower net interest spreads, partially offset by a 2.9% increase in year over year originations. 37 Corporate Snap ons general corporate expenses totaled $53.8 million in 2006, up from $46.4 million in 2005, primarily due to $15.2 million of increased stock based and performance based incentive compensation, including $6.3 million from the January 1, 2006, adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). Increased expenses in 2006 also included $4.2 million of higher insurance and other costs. These expense increases were partially offset by $9.5 million of benefits from RCI initiatives. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the companys adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). Financial Condition Snap ons growth has historically been funded by a combination of cash provided by operating activities and debt financing. Snap on believes that its cash from operations, coupled with its sources of borrowings, are sufficient to fund its anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, restructuring activities, acquisitions, common stock repurchases and dividend payments. Due to Snap ons credit rating over the years, external funds have been available at a reasonable cost. As of the close of business on February 15, 2008, Snap ons long term debt and commercial paper was rated A3 and P 2 by Moodys Investors Service and A and A 2 by Standard & Poors. Snap on believes that the strength of its balance sheet, combined with its cash flows from operating activities, affords the company the financial flexibility to respond to both internal growth opportunities and those available through acquisitions. The following discussion focuses on information included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Snap on has been focused on improving asset utilization by making more effective use of its investment in certain working capital items. The company assesses managements operating performance and effectiveness relative to those components of working capital, particularly accounts receivable and inventories, that are more directly impacted by operational decisions. As of December 29, 2007, working capital (current assets less current liabilities) of $548.2 million was up $117.0 million from $431.2 million as of December 30, 2006. The increase in year over year working capital primarily reflects higher levels of Cash and cash equivalents of $29.6 million, lower Notes payable and current maturities of long term debt of $27.7 million, and $27.7 million of increased Accounts receivable net of allowances. The following represents the companys working capital position as of December 29, 2007, and December 30, 2006. (Amounts in millions) 2007 2006 Cash and cash equivalents $ 93.0 $ 63.4 Accounts receivable net of allowances 586.9 559.2 Inventories 322.4 323.0 Other current assets 185.1 167.6 Total current assets 1,187.4 1,113.2 Accounts payable (171.6 ) (178.8 ) Notes payable and current maturities of long term debt (15.9 ) (43.6 ) Other current liabilities (451.7 ) (459.6 ) Total current liabilities (639.2 ) (682.0 ) Total working capital $ 548.2 $ 431.2 Accounts receivable at the end of 2007 was $586.9 million, up $27.7 million from year end 2006 levels. The year over year increase in accounts receivable primarily reflects the impact of higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2007 and $25.1 million of currency translation. This increase in accounts receivable was partially offset by lower levels of receivables as a result of an improvement in days sales outstanding from 76 days at year end 2006 to 73 days at year end 2007. 38 Inventories of $322.4 million at year end 2007 were essentially flat with year end 2006 levels, as a $15.3 million net decrease in inventories was largely offset by $14.7 million of currency translation. Lower year over year inventory levels from the wind down of a 2006 OEM facilitation program in Europe (essential equipment and diagnostics deployments for major OEMs) and reduced U.S. supply chain inventory, were partially offset by higher inventory levels to better meet increased demand for industrial products, and professional tools and equipment in Europe. Inventories accounted for using the first in, first out (FIFO) method as of December 29, 2007, and December 30, 2006, approximated 65% and 62%, respectively, of total inventories. All other inventories are accounted for using the LIFO cost method. The companys LIFO reserve decreased from $86.7 million at December 30, 2006, to $75.0 million at December 29, 2007. Inventory turns (full year cost of goods sold divided by the average of the beginning and ending inventory balances for the year) were 4.9 turns at year end 2007, as compared to 4.6 turns at year end 2006. Accounts payable at December 29, 2007, was $171.6 million, down $7.2 million from year end 2006 levels primarily due to the timing of payments and the impact of lower inventory levels, partially offset by $6.8 million of currency translation. Notes payable and long term debt as of December 29, 2007, was $517.9 million; no commercial paper was outstanding at December 29, 2007. As of December 30, 2006, notes payable and long term debt was $549.2 million, including $314.9 million of commercial paper. On January 12, 2007, Snap on sold $300 million in floating and fixed rate notes consisting of $150 million of floating rate notes that mature on January 12, 2010, and $150 million of fixed rate notes that mature on January 15, 2017. Interest on the floating rate notes accrues at a rate equal to the three month London Interbank offer rate plus 0.13% per year and is payable quarterly. Interest on the fixed rate notes accrues at a rate of 5.50% per year and is payable semi annually. Snap on used the proceeds from the sale of the notes, net of $1.5 million of transaction costs, to repay commercial paper obligations issued to finance the acquisition of Business Solutions. On January 12, 2007, the company also terminated a $250 million bridge credit agreement that Snap on established prior to its acquisition of Business Solutions. Average commercial paper and bank notes outstanding were $124.9 million in 2007 and $55.1 million in 2006. The weighted average interest rate on these instruments was 5.59% in 2007 and 5.63% in 2006. As of December 29, 2007, the weighted average interest rate on outstanding bank notes was 8.78%. At December 30, 2006, the weighted average interest rate on outstanding commercial paper and bank notes was 5.42%. Long term debt of $502.0 million as of December 29, 2007, includes $200 million of unsecured 6.25% notes, $150 million of unsecured floating rate notes, $150 million of unsecured 5.50% notes, and $2.0 million of other long term debt. Current maturities of long term debt and notes payable to banks under uncommitted lines of credit of $15.9 million at December 29, 2007, included $10.1 million of notes payable and $5.8 million of current maturities of long term debt. On August 10, 2007, Snap on entered into a five year, $500 million multi currency revolving credit facility that terminates on August 10, 2012. This $500 million facility replaces Snap ons previous $400 million multi currency revolving credit facility that was set to terminate on July 27, 2009. The $500 million revolving credit facilitys financial covenant requires that Snap on maintain, as of each fiscal quarter end, (i) a ratio of total debt to the sum of total debt plus shareholders equity of not greater than 0.60 to 1.00; or (ii) a ratio of total debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the preceding four fiscal quarters then ended of not greater than 3.50 to 1.00. As of December 29, 2007, Snap on was in compliance with all covenants of this revolving credit facility. As of December 29, 2007, Snap on also had $20 million of unused available debt capacity under its committed bank lines of credit, including a $10 million line of credit that expires on July 29, 2008, and a $10 million line of credit that expires on August 31, 2008. As of December 29, 2007, Snap on had $520 million of unused available debt capacity under the terms of its revolving credit facility and its committed bank lines of credit. Snap on maintains sufficient committed and uncommitted lines of credit and liquidity facilities to cover its expected funding needs on both a short term and long term basis. Snap on manages its aggregate short term borrowings so as not to exceed its availability under its revolving credit facilities and committed lines of credit. The company accesses short term debt markets predominantly through commercial paper issuances and lines of credit to fund its short term requirements and to ensure near term liquidity. Near term liquidity requirements for Snap on in 2008 include the funding of its investments in capital expenditures and restructuring activities, payments of dividends, interest and share repurchases. Snap on expects to make contributions of $10.0 million to its foreign pension plans and $1.2 million to its domestic pension plans in 2008. Depending on market and other conditions, Snap on may elect to make discretionary cash contributions to its domestic pension plans in 2008. 39 Snap ons long term financing strategy is to maintain continuous access to the debt markets to accommodate its liquidity needs. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on Snap ons debt and credit facilities.The following discussion focuses on information included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. Cash flow provided from operating activities was $231.1 million in 2007, $203.4 million in 2006, and $221.1 million in 2005. Depreciation expense was $53.5 million in 2007, $48.5 million in 2006 and $49.5 million in 2005. The increase in depreciation from 2006 levels primarily reflects the impact of higher levels of capital spending in 2006 and 2007. Capital expenditures were $61.9 million in 2007, $50.5 million in 2006 and $40.1 million in 2005. Capital expenditures in all three years mainly reflect efficiency and cost reduction capital investments, including the installation of new production equipment and machine tooling to enhance manufacturing and distribution operations, as well as ongoing replacements of manufacturing and distribution equipment. Capital spending in 2006 and 2007 also included higher levels of spending to support the companys strategic supply chain and other growth initiatives, including the expansion of the companys manufacturing capabilities in lower cost regions and emerging markets, and for the replacement and enhancement of its existing global enterprise resource planning (ERP) management information system, which will continue over a period of several years. Snap on believes that its cash generated from operations, as well as the funds available from its credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund the companys capital expenditure requirements in 2008. Amortization expense was $22.2 million in 2007, $3.4 million in 2006 and $2.7 million in 2005. The increase in 2007 amortization expense is primarily due to the amortization of intangibles from the November 2006 acquisition of Business Solutions. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on acquired intangible assets. Snap on has undertaken stock repurchases from time to time to offset dilution created by shares issued for employee and dealer stock purchase plans, stock options, and other corporate purposes, as well as to repurchase shares when the company believes market conditions are favorable. In 2007, Snap on repurchased 1,860,000 shares of common stock for $94.4 million under its previously announced share repurchase programs. The cash used to repurchase shares of common stock was partially offset by $39.2 million of proceeds from stock purchase and option plan exercises and $6.0 million of related excess tax benefits. As of December 29, 2007, Snap on had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $116.8 million in common stock pursuant to the Board of Directors (Board) authorizations. The purchase of Snap on common stock is at the companys discretion, subject to prevailing financial and market conditions. Snap on repurchased 2,616,618 shares of common stock for $109.8 million in 2006 and 912,100 shares of common stock for $32.1 million in 2005. Snap on believes that its cash generated from operations, as well as the funds available from its credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund the companys share repurchases in 2008. On October 3, 2005, Snap on repaid its $100 million, 10 year, 6.625% unsecured notes upon their maturity. The $100 million debt repayment was made with available cash on hand. Snap on has paid consecutive quarterly cash dividends, without interruption or reduction, since 1939. Cash dividends paid in 2007, 2006 and 2005 totaled $64.8 million, $63.6 million and $57.8 million, respectively. On November 1, 2007, the company announced that its Board increased the quarterly cash dividend by 11.1% to $0.30 per share ($1.20 per share per year). At the beginning of fiscal 2006, the companys Board increased the quarterly cash dividend by 8% to $0.27 per share ($1.08 per share per year). 2007 2006 2005 Cash dividends paid per common share $ 1.11 $ 1.08 $ 1.00 Cash dividends paid as a percent of prior year retained earnings 5.5 % 5.6 % 5.2 % Snap on believes that its cash generated from operations, as well as the funds available from its credit facilities, will be sufficient to pay dividends in 2008. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Except as set forth below in the section labeled Contractual Obligations and Commitments, the company had no off balance sheet arrangements as of December 29, 2007. 40 Contractual Obligations and Commitments A summary of Snap ons future contractual obligations and commitments as of December 29, 2007, are as follows: (Amounts in millions) Total 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 and thereafter Contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 507.8 $ 5.8 $ 151.6 $ 200.1 $ 150.3 Interest on fixed rate debt 140.3 20.8 41.5 36.8 41.2 Operating leases 93.7 28.9 30.5 12.7 21.6 Capital leases 30.7 1.4 3.0 3.2 23.1 Purchase obligations 5.6 2.3 3.3 Other 0.7 0.7 Total $ 778.8 $ 59.2 $ 230.6 $ 252.8 $ 236.2 The company has excluded payments related to its pension and postretirement benefit plans from the contractual obligation table above; see Notes 11 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the companys benefit plans and payments. The contractual obligation table above does not include income tax liabilities recorded in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes: an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109; see Note 8 for information on income taxes. Environmental Matters Snap on is subject to various federal, state and local government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Snap ons policy is to comply with these requirements and the company believes that, as a general matter, its policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with its business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in some of Snap ons operations and products, as it is with other compani es engaged in similar businesses. Snap on is and has been engaged in the handling, manufacture, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies. The company believes that, as a general matter, its handling, manufacture, use and disposal of these substances are in accordance with environmental laws and regulations. It is possible, however, that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could bring into question the companys handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these substances. Consolidated Joint Venture SOC, a consolidated, 50% owned joint venture between Snap on and CIT, provides a broad range of financial services to Snap ons U.S. franchisee and customer network and to Snap ons industrial and other customers. Snap on and CIT have identical voting and participation rights and responsibilities in SOC. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on SOC. Snap on receives royalty and management fee income from SOC based on the volume of financings originated by SOC. Snap on also shares ratably with CIT in any residual net profit or loss of the joint venture after operating expenses, including royalty and management fees, interest costs and credit loss provisions. Snap on provides extended term financing internationally through its wholly owned finance subsidiaries. SOC sells substantially all of its originated contracts on a limited recourse basis to CIT, net of certain fees, and SOC continues to service these contracts for an estimated market rate servicing fee. SOC originated contracts totaling $422.7 million in 2007, $426.8 million in 2006 and $413.8 million in 2005. CIT and Snap on have agreed to lend funds to support SOCs working capital requirements on a 50/50 basis. As of December 29, 2007, and December 30, 2006, SOC owed each of Snap on and CIT $0.3 million and $0.1 million, respectively, pursuant to this agreement. 41 Financial information regarding SOC loan originations is as follows: 2007 2006 2005 Originations (in millions): Extended credit receivables $ 348.1 $ 356.2 $ 327.0 Equipment leases 24.6 28.8 41.1 Franchisee financing 50.0 41.8 45.7 Total $ 422.7 $ 426.8 $ 413.8 Number of accounts outstanding: Extended credit receivables 176,126 172,703 172,147 Equipment leases 9,019 10,710 12,045 Franchisee financing 3,238 3,306 3,477 Total 188,383 186,719 187,669 New Accounting Standards See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on new accounting standards. Critical Accounting Policies The consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to managements discussion and analysis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are generally based on historical experience, current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources, as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Snap on considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the companys financial position, results of operations and cash flow. Revenue Recognition: Snap on derives revenue primarily from the sale of tools, diagnostics and equipment solutions for professional tool and equipment users. Snap on markets its products and services through the worldwide franchise mobile van channel, company direct sales, and independent distributor and other non franchise channels, including its public Internet Web site. Snap on also derives revenue from various financing programs to facilitate the sales of its products. Snap on recognizes revenue from the sale of tools, diagnostics and equipment solutions when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) the price is fixed or determinable; (iii) collectibility is reasonably assured; and (iv) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered. Delivery generally occurs when the title and the risks and rewards of ownership have substantially transferred to the customer. For sales contingent upon customer acceptance or product installation, revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations are fulfilled. As required by SFAS No. 48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists, estimated product returns are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale based upon historical product return experience and assumptions for the gross profit margin and volume of future sales returns. Provisions for customer volume rebates, discounts and allowances are also recorded as a reduction of reported revenues at the time of sale based on historical experience and known trends. Revenue related to maintenance and subscription agreements is recognized over the term of the agreement. 42 Snap on also recognizes revenue related to multiple element arrangements, including sales of software and software related services. Snap on follows the guidance under Statement of Position (SOP) 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended and Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03 5, Applicability of SOP 97 2 to Non software Deliverables Containing More than Incidental Software for software and software related elements, and EITF Issue No. 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, in conjunction with Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition, for hardware and hardware related elements. When a sales arrangement contains multiple elements, such as hardware and software products and or services, Snap on uses vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value to allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value and, when necessary, uses the residual method to assign value to the delivered elements when VSOE only exists for the undelivered elements. Snap on limits the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services. The amount assigned to future delivery of products or services is recognized when the product is delivered and or when the services are performed. In instances where the product and or services are performed over an extended period, as is the case with subscription agreements or the providing of ongoing support, revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement, which generally ranges from 12 to 60 months. Purchased software and costs incurred in the development of software that will ultimately be sold are capitalized at the time technological feasibility has been attained and the related product is ready for general release. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the company capitalized $10.6 million, $5.0 million and $4.2 million, respectively, of such costs. Amortization of capitalized software development costs was $4.9 million in 2007, $2.5 million in 2006, and $1.7 million in 2005. Unamortized capitalized software development costs were $24.0 million at December 29, 2007, and $18.3 million at December 30, 2006. Financial Services Revenue: In addition to its sales of tools, diagnostics and equipment solutions, Snap on also generates revenue from various financing programs that include (i) loans to franchisees; (ii) loans to the franchisees customers; and (iii) loans to Snap ons industrial and other customers for the purchase of tools and equipment on an extended term payment plan. These financing programs are offered through SOC, a consolidated 50% owned joint venture with CIT, and Snap ons wholly owned international finance subsidiaries. Financial services revenue consists of SOCs sales of originated contracts to CIT and service fee income, as well as installment contract revenue and franchisee loan receivable revenue derived from SOC and Snap ons wholly owned international finance operations. The decision to finance through Snap on or another financing entity is solely at the election of the customer. When assessing customers for potential financing, Snap on considers various factors regarding ability to pay including financial condition, collateral, debt servicing ability, past payment experience and credit bureau information. Contracts originated by SOC and subsequently sold to CIT are also subject to the underwriting approval of CIT. Financing revenue from SOC is recognized primarily from the sale of originated contracts to CIT net of various fees, including securitization, warehousing, bad debt and prepayment fees. SOC continues to service these contracts for an estimated market rate servicing fee. Servicing fees are paid to SOC by CIT and such revenue is recognized over the contractual term of the loan, with a portion of the servicing fee recognized at the time of origination. Financing revenue from originated loans that are retained is recognized over the life of the contract, with interest computed on a daily basis. Snap ons wholly owned international finance subsidiaries own all of the loans originated through their financing programs. Revenue from interest income is recognized over the life of the contract, with interest computed on a daily basis. Franchise fee revenue, including nominal, non refundable initial and ongoing monthly fees (primarily for sales and business training and marketing and product promotion programs), is recognized as the fees are earned. Goodwill and Other Indefinite lived Intangible Assets: Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired. Impairment tests involve the use of judgmental estimates 43 related to the fair market value of the business operations with which goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are associated, taking into consideration both historical operating performance and anticipated financial position and future earnings, discounted by the companys weighted average cost of capital. Annual impairment tests are performed by the company in the second quarter of each year; the 2007 evaluation indicated that no goodwill or intangible asset impairment adjustments were required. Should the operations of the businesses with which goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets are associated incur significant declines in profitability and cash flow in future years due to significant adverse changes in business climate, adverse actions by regulators, unanticipated competition, loss of key personnel, and or changes in technology or markets, some or all of the recorded goodwill or intangibles could be subject to impairment. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on goodwill and other intangible assets. Allowances for Doubtful Accounts: Snap ons accounts receivable are reported net of estimated bad debt allowances, which are regularly evaluated by management for adequacy. The evaluations take into consideration various financial and qualitative factors that may affect customers ability to pay. These factors may include customers financial condition, collateral, debt servicing ability, past payment experience and credit bureau information. Snap on regularly reviews the allowance estimation process and adjusts the allowances as appropriate. It is possible, however, that the accuracy of Snap ons estimation process could be adversely impacted if the financial condition of its customers were to deteriorate. The company does not believe that accounts receivable represent significant concentrations of credit risk because of the diversified portfolio of individual customers and geographical areas. Inventory Valuation: Snap on values its inventory at the lower of cost or market and adjusts for the value of inventory that is estimated to be excess, obsolete or otherwise unmarketable. Inventory adjustments for raw materials are largely based on analysis of raw material age and actual physical inspection of raw material for fitness for use. As part of evaluating work in progress and finished goods, management reviews individual product stock keeping units (SKUs) by product category and product life cycle. Cost adjustments for each product category/product life cycle state are generally established and maintained based on a combination of historical experience, forecasted sales and promotions, technological obsolescence, inventory age and other actual known conditions and circumstances. Should actual product marketability and raw material fitness for use be affected by conditions that are different from management estimates, further adjustments to inventory allowances may be required. Internal use Software: In accordance with SOP 98 1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, costs that are incurred internally in creating software solutions and enhancements to those solutions are expensed until technological feasibility has been established. Warranty Accruals: Snap on provides product warranties for specific product lines and accrues for estimated future warranty costs in the period in which the sale is recorded. Snap on calculates its accrual requirements based on historic warranty loss experience that is periodically adjusted for recent actual experience, including the timing of claims during the warranty period and actual costs incurred. If actual return rates and or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates, adjustments to cost of sales may be required in future periods. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on Snap ons warranty accrual. Pension Benefits: The calculation of Snap ons pension expense and projected benefit obligation requires the use of a number of assumptions. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of Snap ons control and can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements. Snap on believes that the two most critical assumptions are (i) the expected return on plan assets; and (ii) the assumed discount rate. Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases. Lowering the expected rate of return assumption for Snap ons domestic pension plan assets by 0.5% would have increased Snap ons 2007 domestic pension expense by approximately $3.4 million. At year end 2007, Snap ons domestic plan assets comprised approximately 87% of Snap ons worldwide pension plan assets. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on Snap ons pension plans. 44 The objective of Snap ons discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. In making this determination, the company takes into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans. The methodology for selecting the discount rate as of year end 2007 was to match the plans cash flows to that of a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on long term bonds with an Aa rating or better for each maturity. The selection of the 6.5% weighted average discount rate for Snap ons domestic pension plans represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments. Lowering Snap ons domestic discount rate assumption by 0.5% would have increased Snap ons 2007 domestic pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately $2.5 million and $35.1 million, respectively. At year end 2007, Snap ons domestic projected benefit obligation comprised approximately 81% of Snap ons worldwide projected benefit obligation. Income Taxes: The company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. While the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. In addition, the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. Stock based Compensation: Effective January 1, 2006, the company adopted SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, using the modified prospective method. SFAS No. 123(R) requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards (with limited exceptions). That cost, based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest, will be recognized over the period during which the employee is required to provide the service in exchange for the award. No compensation cost is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite service. Upon adoption, the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments was estimated using the Black Scholes valuation model. The Black Scholes valuation model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the stock based award and stock price volatility. The assumptions used are managements best estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, the recorded and pro forma stock based compensation expense could have been materially different from that depicted in the financial statements. Outlook Snap on expects to continue investing in its growth initiatives aimed at expanding value provided to its traditional customers, penetrating new and adjacent segments, and extending its presence in the emerging markets of Asia/Pacific and Eastern Europe. In addition, Snap on also expects to continue implementing its strategic growth, RCI and low cost sourcing initiatives intended to provide higher levels of growth and profitability. Snap on anticipates 2008 restructuring costs to be in a range of $15 million to $20 million, down from the $26 million incurred in 2007. Capital expenditures in 2008 are expected to be in a range of $55 million to $60 million. Snap on also expects that its 2008 effective income tax rate on earnings before minority interests and equity earnings (loss) will approximate 33%. As a result, Snap on expects full year 2008 sales and operating earnings to improve over 2007 levels. 45 Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market, Credit and Economic Risks Market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments. Snap on is exposed to market risk from changes in both foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Snap on monitors its exposure to these risks and attempts to manage the underlying economic exposures through the use of financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements. Snap on does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Snap ons broad based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole. Snap ons management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. Foreign Currency Risk Management Snap on has significant international operations and is subject to certain risks inherent with foreign operations that include currency fluctuations and restrictions on movement of funds. Foreign exchange risk exists to the extent that Snap on has payment obligations or receipts denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. To manage these exposures, Snap on identifies naturally offsetting positions and then generally purchases hedging instruments to protect the residual net anticipated exposures. Snap ons financial position and results of operations have not been materially affected by such events to date. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on foreign currency risk management. Interest Rate Risk Management Snap ons interest rate risk management policies are designed to reduce the potential earnings volatility that could arise from changes in interest rates. Through the use of interest rate swaps, Snap on aims to stabilize funding costs by managing the exposure created by the differing maturities and interest rate structures of Snap ons assets and liabilities. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on interest rate risk management. Snap on utilizes a Value at Risk (VAR) model to determine the potential one day loss in the fair value of its interest rate and foreign exchange sensitive financial instruments from adverse changes in market factors. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. Snap ons computations are based on the inter relationships among movements in various currencies and interest rates (variance/co variance technique). These inter relationships were determined by observing interest rate and foreign currency market changes over the preceding quarter. The estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value, calculated using the VAR model, at December 29, 2007, was $0.5 million on interest rate sensitive financial instruments and $0.3 million on foreign currency sensitive financial instruments. The VAR model is a risk management tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by Snap on, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors. 46 Credit Risk Credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. Prior to granting credit, each customer is evaluated, taking into consideration the borrowers financial condition, collateral, debt servicing ability, past payment experience, credit bureau information and other financial and qualitative factors that may affect the borrowers ability to repay. Specific credit reviews and standard industry credit scoring models are used in performing this evaluation. Loans that have been granted are typically monitored through an asset quality review process that closely monitors past due accounts and initiates collection actions when appropriate. In addition to its direct credit risk exposure, Snap on also has credit risk exposure for certain SOC loan originations with recourse provisions against Snap on (primarily for franchisee van loans). At December 29, 2007, $16.1 million of loans originated by SOC have a recourse provision to Snap on if the loans become more than 90 days past due. For additional information on SOC, refer to the section entitled Consolidated Joint Venture in this Managements Discussion and Analysis and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Commodity Risk The company is a purchaser of certain commodities such as steel, natural gas and electricity. The company is also a purchaser of components and parts that are integrated into the companys end products, as well as the purchaser of certain finished goods, all of which may contain various commodities including steel, aluminum and others. Snap ons supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers. The principal raw material used in the manufacture of our products is steel, which we purchase in competitive, price sensitive markets. To meet Snap ons high quality standards, our steel needs range from specialized alloys, which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers, to commodity types of alloys. These raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality. Some of these materials have been, and in the future may be, in short supply. As some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures, we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice. Additionally, unexpected price increases could result in higher prices to our customers or an erosion of the margins on our products. We believe our ability to sell our products is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road, the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles. These factors affect the frequency, type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians, and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians, the prosperity of the technicians and, subsequently, the demand the technicians have for our tools, other products and services, and the value they place on those products and services. To the extent that gasoline prices increase, consumers may turn to other, non gasoline based, methods of transportation, including more frequent use of public transportation. A decrease in the use of gasoline consuming vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for our products. To the extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm pricing agreements with its suppliers, the company may experience margin declines to the extent that it is not able to increase the selling prices of its products.
