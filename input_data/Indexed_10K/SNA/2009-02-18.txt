Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management Overview In 2008 the world experienced a global economic slowdown and tightened credit environment. Despite the challenges of a deepening global recession, many of Snap ons businesses experienced sales growth in 2008 and we continued investing in our strategic growth initiatives aimed at fortifying our business models, pursuing geographic and customer diversification, expanding our presence in emerging markets, and driving value creation processes, including innovation and rapid continuous improvement. We believe the continued advancement of these strategic initiatives will help create an environment to achieve long term value for company shareholders, associates, franchisees and other distributor partners across our varied business segments and channels. Net sales in 2008 of $2,853.3 million increased slightly from $2,841.2 million in 2007, while operating earnings of $388.8 million in 2008 increased 19.7% from $324.8 million in 2007. The significant increase in year over year operating earnings was primarily driven by contributions from our ongoing efficiency, productivity and cost reduction (collectively Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI) initiatives, as well as increased income from our financial services businesses. These benefits were partially offset by higher costs in 2008 as a result of price increases for steel, fuel and other commodities. Economic challenges, however, increased significantly during the fourth quarter of 2008 as customers curtailed spending in response to the worsening global recession. As a result of the economic slowdown, Snap ons sales in the fourth quarter of 2008 declined 10.1% from prior year levels. In response to these economic challenges, we accelerated certain RCI initiatives and are continuing even accelerating certain planned investments that include further expansion of our manufacturing capacity in China and in Eastern Europe, as we see these investments as potentially enabling near term growth. In 2009 we intend to aggressively manage the balance between investing and capturing growth opportunities with the need for additional cost reduction actions beyond those already implemented. We also experienced considerable adverse effects from foreign currency exchange rate movements in the fourth quarter of 2008. Given our increasingly global footprint, foreign currency exchange rates could have a more pronounced effect on our sales and operating profit comparisons in 2009. Our strategic priorities and plans for 2009 will continue to build on the improvement initiatives underway to achieve sustainable, profitable growth. Global market conditions, however, may affect the level and timing of resources deployed in pursuit of these initiatives in 2009. In the Commercial & Industrial Group, higher sales, including growth in emerging markets, combined with expense control and savings from restructuring initiatives delivered improvements in operating performance. Segment net sales of $1,409.3 million in 2008 were up 4.3% over 2007 levels, and operating earnings of $167.3 million in 2008 were up 27.2% over 2007 levels. Benefits from continued sales growth and improved levels of customer service, along with savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives, including increased production and sourcing of materials from lower cost regions, were major contributors to the year over year earnings improvement. The Commercial & Industrial Group expects to continue to build on the following strategic priorities in 2009: Continue to invest in emerging market growth initiatives, including China, India and Eastern Europe; Increase market share in key industrial market segments by reaching new customers, expanding our business with existing customers, and continually expanding value added content; Continue to invest in innovation that delivers productivity enhancing solutions that utilize the latest technology; Continue to pursue key customer segments that offer long term growth potential; and Continue to rationalize the operating footprint and reduce structural costs. In the Snap on Tools Group, progress continued on fundamental, strategic initiatives to strengthen the group and enhance franchisee profitability and satisfaction. Segment net sales of $1,104.0 million in 2008 were down slightly from 2007 levels primarily due to a more challenging economic environment for sales of higher priced products and hand tools. Supply chain improvements and an ongoing transition to a market demand based replenishment system in 2008 continued to improve complete and on time delivery of a broad assortment of products. Operating earnings of $117.7 million in 2008 declined from $125.1 million in 2007, primarily due to increased commodity and inflation costs, higher restructuring costs, and increased last in, first out (LIFO) related inventory valuation expense. 2008 ANNUAL REPORT 23 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) The Snap on Tools Group expects to continue to build on the progress made in enhancing the franchise proposition and delivering customer productivity solutions, with specific initiatives in 2009 focused on the following: Continue to improve franchisee profitability and satisfaction; Continue to fill open territories in the United States; Develop new programs to expand market coverage; Continue to invest in new product innovation and development; and Increase supply chain flexibility through investments in manufacturing and RCI initiatives. By executing in these areas, we believe that we, as well as our franchisees, will continue to serve more customers better and more profitably. In the Diagnostics & Information Group, segment net sales of $627.8 million in 2008 declined 3.5% from 2007 levels, while operating earnings in 2008 increased 13.5% over 2007 levels to $112.9 million. This significant increase in operating earnings reflects increased sales of certain product lines, contributions from increased productivity and lower costs as a result of RCI initiatives across all businesses, and $5.4 million from the adjustment of a pre acquisition contingency acquired with the Snap on Business Solutions (Business Solutions) acquisition in November 2006. Sales of diagnostics products worldwide and Mitchell1 information products continued to grow as a result of the development and launch of new products and the continued expansion of functionality and product integration. These sales increases were more than offset by lower original equipment manufacturer (OEM) program sales and lower sales at Business Solutions. OEM sales in 2008 declined from 2007 levels primarily as a result of the rollout of a major essential tool program in North America in 2007 that was not repeated in 2008, and the impact of the wind down of a facilitation program in Europe. Despite a year over year sales decline, including the impact from the planned exit of certain non core product lines, the 2006 acquisition of Business Solutions continues to provide a strong base for relationships with key OEM customers, strengthening our position as a provider of essential productivity solutions. The Diagnostics & Information Group expects to focus on the following strategic priorities in 2009: Continue hardware and software content upgrades; Expand product range with new products and services; Increase penetration of geographic markets; Leverage integration of software solutions; and Continue productivity advancements through RCI initiatives and leveraging of resources. Financial Services revenue increased 29.2% to $81.4 million in 2008, and operating income of $37.3 million was up 66.5% from prior year, primarily due to lower market discount rates in 2008. Originations in 2008 were essentially flat with prior year levels. Cash Flows Cash flow from operations was $215.0 million in 2008, as compared to $231.1 million in 2007. Snap on used available cash in 2008 to invest $73.9 million in capital expenditures, repurchase 1,230,000 shares of Snap on common stock for $69.8 million and pay dividends totaling $69.7 million. Capital expenditures in 2008 of $73.9 million reflect higher levels of spending to support strategic supply chain and other growth initiatives, including the expansion of the companys manufacturing capabilities in lower cost regions and emerging markets, as well as higher levels of efficiency and cost reduction capital investments. Cash at year end 2008 of $115.8 million was up from $93.0 million at year end 2007. In 2007, the company used available cash to repurchase 1,860,000 shares of Snap on common stock for $94.4 million, pay dividends totaling $64.8 million, invest $61.9 million in capital expenditures and pay down debt of $36.6 million. 24 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Results of Operations Fiscal 2008 vs. Fiscal 2007 Results of operations for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2009 (fiscal 2008), and December 29, 2007 (fiscal 2007), are as follows: (Amounts in millions) 2008 2007 Change Net sales $ 2,853.3 100.0 % $ 2,841.2 100.0 % $ 12.1 0.4 % Cost of goods sold (1,568.7 ) 55.0 % (1,574.6 ) 55.4 % 5.9 0.4 % Gross profit 1,284.6 45.0 % 1,266.6 44.6 % 18.0 1.4 % Financial services revenue 81.4 100.0 % 63.0 100.0 % 18.4 29.2 % Financial services expenses (44.1 ) 54.2 % (40.6 ) 64.4 % (3.5 ) 8.6 % Operating income from financial services 37.3 45.8 % 22.4 35.6 % 14.9 66.5 % Operating expenses (933.1 ) 32.7 % (964.2 ) 33.9 % 31.1 3.2 % Operating earnings 388.8 13.2 % 324.8 11.2 % 64.0 19.7 % Interest expense (33.8 ) 1.1 % (46.1 ) 1.6 % 12.3 26.7 % Other income (expense) net 2.8 0.1 % 5.5 0.2 % (2.7 ) 49.1 % Earnings before income taxes, equity earnings and minority interests 357.8 12.2 % 284.2 9.8 % 73.6 25.9 % Income tax expense (117.8 ) 4.0 % (92.5 ) 3.2 % (25.3 ) 27.4 % Earnings before equity earnings and minority interests 240.0 8.2 % 191.7 6.6 % 48.3 25.2 % Equity earnings, net of tax and minority interests (3.3 ) 0.1 % (2.5 ) 0.1 % (0.8 ) 32.0 % Net earnings from continuing operations 236.7 8.1 % 189.2 6.5 % 47.5 25.1 % Discontinued operations, net of tax (8.0 ) 0.3 % 8.0 100.0 % Net earnings $ 236.7 8.1 % $ 181.2 6.2 % $ 55.5 30.6 % Percentage Disclosure: Cost of goods sold, Gross profit and Operating expenses percentages are calculated as a percentage of Net sales.

All other income statement line item percentages are calculated as a percentage of the sum of Net sales and Financial services revenue. Snap ons 2008 fiscal year contained 53 weeks of operating results; Snap ons 2007 fiscal year contained 52 weeks of operating results. The impact of the additional week, which occurred in the fourth quarter, was not material to Snap ons fourth quarter or full year 2008 net sales or operating earnings. Net sales in 2008 of $2,853.3 million increased $12.1 million, or 0.4%, from 2007 levels. Excluding $35.5 million of currency translation, net sales in 2008 declined $23.4 million, or 0.8%, from 2007 levels. The year over year sales comparison was significantly impacted by weakened consumer and business demand in 2008, particularly in the fourth quarter, as customers curtailed spending primarily for purchases of higher priced products in response to the worsening global recession. Sales in the Commercial & Industrial Group of $1,409.3 million increased $58.7 million, or 4.3%, from 2007 levels; excluding $37.0 million of currency translation, organic sales (net sales, excluding currency translation effects), increased 1.6% from 2007 levels. Sales in the Snap on Tools Group of $1,104.0 million declined $3.7 million, or 0.3%, from 2007 levels; excluding $1.2 million of favorable currency translation, organic sales declined $4.9 million, or 0.4%, from 2007 levels. In the Diagnostics & Information Group, sales of $627.8 million declined $22.8 million, or 3.5%, from 2007 levels; excluding $1.6 million of currency translation, organic sales declined $21.2 million, or 3.3%, from 2007 levels. 2008 ANNUAL REPORT 25 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Gross profit in 2008 was $1,284.6 million, as compared to $1,266.6 million in 2007. The $18.0 million gross profit improvement was primarily driven by $23.4 million of savings from ongoing RCI initiatives, $16.6 million of lower restructuring costs and $9.8 million of currency translation, partially offset by $24.6 million of higher production, material and freight costs. Contributions from higher sales and pricing were more than offset by the mix impact of lower sales of higher margin products. In addition, gross profit in 2008 included $4.7 million of LIFO related inventory valuation expense; gross profit in 2007 included LIFO related inventory valuation benefits of $0.3 million. As a result of these factors, gross profit margin was 45.0% in 2008, up 40 basis points (100 basis points equals 1.0 percent) from 44.6% in 2007. Operating expenses in 2008 were $933.1 million, as compared to $964.2 million in 2007. The $31.1 million, or 3.2%, improvement in operating expenses includes $28.8 million of contributions from RCI initiatives, $10.9 million of lower franchisee termination costs, $5.0 million of lower performance based incentive compensation and $4.3 million of lower stock based incentive compensation. Operating expenses in 2008 also benefited from a $5.4 million adjustment of a pre acquisition contingency acquired with the Business Solutions acquisition in 2006. These declines in operating expenses were partially offset by $10.3 million of currency translation, $5.0 million of higher restructuring costs and $2.4 million of increased spending to further expand the companys presence in emerging growth markets and lower cost regions. The year over year operating expense comparison is also impacted by the inclusion, in 2007, of $6.4 million of gains from the sale of facilities. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses in 2008 improved 120 basis points to 32.7%, as compared to 33.9% in 2007. Operating income from Financial Services was $37.3 million on revenue of $81.4 million in 2008, as compared with $22.4 million of operating income on revenue of $63.0 million in 2007. The $14.9 million increase in year over year operating income primarily reflects the impact of lower market discount rates in 2008. Consolidated operating earnings in 2008 were $388.8 million, an increase of $64.0 million, or 19.7%, from the $324.8 million achieved in 2007. The $64.0 million increase in year over year operating earnings includes $0.8 million of unfavorable currency translation. Interest expense of $33.8 million in 2008 declined $12.3 million from $46.1 million in 2007 primarily due to declining interest rates on our floating rate debt and lower average debt levels. Other income (expense) net was income of $2.8 million in 2008, as compared to income of $5.5 million in 2007. Other income (expense) net primarily includes interest income and hedging and currency exchange rate transaction gains and losses. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on other income (expense) net. Snap ons effective income tax rate on earnings before equity earnings and minority interests was 32.9% in 2008 and 32.5% in 2007. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on income taxes. On March 5, 2008, Snap on acquired a 60% interest in Zhejiang Wanda Tools Co., Ltd. (Wanda Snap on), a tool manufacturer in China, for a cash purchase price of $15.4 million (or $14.1 million, net of cash acquired), including $1.2 million of transaction costs. The acquisition of Wanda Snap on is part of the companys ongoing strategic initiatives to further expand its manufacturing presence in emerging growth markets and lower cost regions. For segment reporting purposes, the results of operations and assets of Wanda Snap on are included in the Commercial & Industrial Group. The net sales and operating earnings impact of Wanda Snap on were not material to Snap ons fourth quarter or full year 2008 Consolidated Financial Statements. 26 SNAP ON INCORPORATED On June 29, 2007, Snap on sold its Sun Electric Systems (SES) business based in the Netherlands for a nominal cash purchase price. The sale of the SES business is reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings as Discontinued operations, net of tax. Snap on recorded an after tax loss of $8.0 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, in its 2007 results of operations related to the sale and results of operations of SES. For segment reporting purposes, the results of operations of SES were previously included in the Diagnostics & Information Group. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on SES. Net earnings and net earnings from continuing operations in 2008 were $236.7 million, or $4.07 per diluted share. Net earnings from continuing operations in 2007 were $189.2 million, or $3.23 per diluted share; net earnings in 2007 were $181.2 million, or $3.09 per diluted share.

Intersegment amounts are eliminated to arrive at consolidated financial results. 2008 ANNUAL REPORT 27 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Commercial & Industrial Group (Amounts in millions) 2008 2007 Change External net sales $ 1,260.5 89.4% $ 1,208.6 89.5% $ 51.9 4.3% Intersegment net sales 148.8 10.6% 142.0 10.5% 6.8 4.8% Segment net sales 1,409.3 100.0% 1,350.6 100.0% 58.7 4.3% Cost of goods sold (878.9 ) 62.4% (867.1 ) 64.2% (11.8 ) 1.4% Gross profit 530.4 37.6% 483.5 35.8% 46.9 9.7% Operating expenses (363.1 ) 25.7% (352.0 ) 26.1% (11.1 ) 3.2% Segment operating earnings $ 167.3 11.9% $ 131.5 9.7% $ 35.8 27.2% Segment net sales of $1,409.3 million in 2008 increased $58.7 million, or 4.3%, from 2007 levels. Excluding $37.0 million of currency translation, sales increased $21.7 million, or 1.6%, year over year primarily due to higher sales of tools, kits and tool storage products to industrial customers, increased sales of power tools and imaging alignment systems, and continued strong sales growth in emerging markets. Segment gross profit of $530.4 million in 2008 increased $46.9 million, or 9.7%, over 2007 levels. The $46.9 million increase in gross profit includes contributions from higher sales and pricing, $17.4 million of lower restructuring costs, $15.1 million of savings from RCI initiatives, and $10.7 million of currency translation. These increases in gross profit were partially offset by $9.9 million of higher production and material costs. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit of 37.6% improved 180 basis points over 35.8% in 2007. Operating expenses of $363.1 million increased $11.1 million from 2007 levels primarily due to $10.0 million of currency translation, $3.4 million of inflationary cost increases, and higher volume related and other expenses, including $2.4 million of costs to further expand the companys sales and manufacturing presence in emerging growth markets and lower cost regions. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by $10.1 million of savings from RCI initiatives. The year over year operating expense comparison is also impacted by the inclusion, in 2007, of $5.4 million of gains on the sale of facilities in Europe. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings of $167.3 million in 2008 increased $35.8 million, or 27.2%, from 2007 levels and, as a percentage of net sales, improved from 9.7% in 2007 to 11.9% in 2008. The $35.8 million increase in year over year operating earnings includes $0.7 million of favorable currency translation. Snap on Tools Group (Amounts in millions) 2008 2007 Change Segment net sales $ 1,104.0 100.0% $ 1,107.7 100.0% $ (3.7 ) 0.3% Cost of goods sold (636.5 ) 57.7% (618.2 ) 55.8% (18.3 ) 3.0% Gross profit 467.5 42.3% 489.5 44.2% (22.0 ) 4.5% Operating expenses (349.8 ) 31.6% (364.4 ) 32.9% 14.6 4.0% Segment operating earnings $ 117.7 10.7% $ 125.1 11.3% $ (7.4 ) 5.9% Segment net sales of $1,104.0 million in 2008 decreased $3.7 million, or 0.3%, from 2007 levels. Excluding $1.2 million of favorable currency translation, 2008 sales declined $4.9 million, or 0.4%, from 2007 levels, as continued higher sales in the companys international franchise operations were more than offset by lower U.S. franchise sales. Sales to U.S. franchisees declined 3.2% year over year primarily due to a more challenging economic environment for sales of higher priced products and hand tools, partially offset by increased sales of power tools and diagnostics products. At year end 2008, van count in the United States was up slightly compared to both September 27, 2008, and December 29, 2007, levels. Sales in the companys international franchise operations increased 6.6% year over year primarily due to strong growth in the United Kingdom, Japan and Australia. 28 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Segment gross profit of $467.5 million in 2008 declined $22.0 million, or 4.5%, from 2007 levels. The $22.0 million gross profit decline primarily reflects the impacts of lower U.S. sales, including a shift in product mix to higher sales of lower margin products, and $13.7 million of increased production and material costs. In addition, gross profit in 2008 included $4.7 million of LIFO related inventory valuation expense; gross profit in 2007 included $0.3 million of LIFO related inventory valuation benefits. These declines in gross profit were partially offset by contributions from higher pricing, $6.3 million of benefits from RCI initiatives, and $3.1 million of lower warranty expense. Operating expenses of $349.8 million in 2008 decreased $14.6 million, or 4.0%, from prior year levels largely due to $10.9 million of lower franchisee termination costs and $6.7 million of benefits from RCI initiatives. These decreases to operating expenses were partially offset by $4.1 million of higher restructuring costs. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings of $117.7 million in 2008 declined $7.4 million from $125.1 million in 2007 and, as a percentage of net sales, declined from 11.3% in 2007 to 10.7% in 2008. The $7.4 million decline in year over year operating earnings includes $0.8 million of unfavorable currency translation. Diagnostics & Information Group (Amounts in millions) 2008 2007 Change External net sales $ 488.8 77.9% $ 524.9 80.7% $ (36.1 ) 6.9% Intersegment net sales 139.0 22.1% 125.7 19.3% 13.3 10.6% Segment net sales 627.8 100.0% 650.6 100.0% (22.8 ) 3.5% Cost of goods sold (341.1 ) 54.3% (357.0 ) 54.9% 15.9 4.5% Gross profit 286.7 45.7% 293.6 45.1% (6.9 ) 2.4% Operating expenses (173.8 ) 27.7% (194.1 ) 29.8% 20.3 10.5% Segment operating earnings $ 112.9 18.0% $ 99.5 15.3% $ 13.4 13.5% Segment net sales of $627.8 million in 2008 declined $22.8 million, or 3.5%, from 2007 levels, including $1.6 million from currency translation. Higher sales of diagnostics and Mitchell1 information products were more than offset by approximately $40 million of lower OEM program sales and by lower sales at Business Solutions, including expected lower sales from the planned exit of certain non core product lines. The year over year decline in OEM program sales is primarily a consequence of the 2007 rollout of a major essential tool program in North America that was not repeated and the impact of the wind down of a facilitation program in Europe. Segment gross profit of $286.7 million in 2008 decreased $6.9 million, or 2.4%, from 2007 levels as the impacts of lower sales, $3.0 million of higher software development and other costs, $0.9 million of increased restructuring costs, and $0.8 million of currency translation were partially offset by gross profit contributions from a more favorable product mix and $2.0 million of benefits from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses of $173.8 million in 2008 declined $20.3 million from 2007 levels as $13.3 million of savings from RCI initiatives, lower volume related expenses, and $0.4 million of currency translation were partially offset by $0.9 million of higher restructuring costs. In addition, operating expenses in 2008 benefited from a $5.4 million adjustment of a pre acquisition contingency acquired with the Business Solutions acquisition in 2006. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings of $112.9 million in 2008 increased $13.4 million, or 13.5%, from $99.5 million in 2007 and, as a percentage of net sales, improved from 15.3% in 2007 to 18.0% in 2008. The $13.4 million increase in year over year operating earnings was reduced by $0.4 million of unfavorable currency translation. Financial Services (Amounts in millions) 2008 2007 Change Financial services revenue $ 81.4 100.0% $ 63.0 100.0% $ 18.4 29.2% Financial services expenses (44.1 ) 54.2% (40.6 ) 64.4% (3.5 ) 8.6% Segment operating income $ 37.3 45.8% $ 22.4 35.6% $ 14.9 66.5% Segment operating income in 2008 was $37.3 million on $81.4 million of revenue, as compared with $22.4 million of operating income on $63.0 million of revenue in 2007. The $14.9 million increase in year over year operating income primarily reflects the impact of lower market discount rates in 2008. Originations of $532.8 million in 2008 declined 1.3% from originations of $539.6 million in 2007. 2008 ANNUAL REPORT 29 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Corporate Snap ons general corporate expenses totaled $46.4 million in 2008, as compared to $53.7 million incurred in 2007. The $7.3 million decline in year over year corporate expenses primarily reflects lower performance based and stock based incentive compensation in 2008. Fourth Quarter Results of operations for the fiscal fourth quarters ended January 3, 2009 (fiscal 2008), and December 29, 2007 (fiscal 2007), are as follows: Three Months Ended (Amounts in millions) January 3, 2009 December 29, 2007 Change Net sales $ 667.8 100.0% $ 742.9 100.0% $ (75.1 ) 10.1% Cost of goods sold (367.8 ) 55.1% (409.5 ) 55.1% 41.7 10.2% Gross profit 300.0 44.9% 333.4 44.9% (33.4 ) 10.0% Financial services revenue 19.7 100.0% 19.0 100.0% 0.7 3.7% Financial services expenses (10.8 ) 54.8% (11.0 ) 57.9% 0.2 1.8% Operating income from financial services 8.9 45.2% 8.0 42.1% 0.9 11.3% Operating expenses (211.4 ) 31.7% (245.1 ) 33.0% 33.7 13.7% Operating earnings 97.5 14.2% 96.3 12.6% 1.2 1.2% Interest expense (8.7 ) 1.3% (11.5 ) 1.5% 2.8 24.3% Other income (expense) net (0.5 ) 0.1% (0.4 ) 0.1% (0.1 ) 25.0% Earnings before income taxes, equity earnings and minority interests 88.3 12.8% 84.4 11.0% 3.9 4.6% Income tax expense (28.2 ) 4.1% (26.3 ) 3.4% (1.9 ) 7.2% Earnings before equity earnings and minority interests 60.1 8.7% 58.1 7.6% 2.0 3.4% Equity earnings, net of tax and minority interests (1.5 ) 0.2% (0.8 ) 0.1% (0.7 ) 87.5% Net earnings $ 58.6 8.5% $ 57.3 7.5% $ 1.3 2.3% Percentage Disclosure: Cost of goods sold, Gross profit and Operating expenses percentages are calculated as a percentage of Net sales.

Snap ons 2008 fiscal year contained 53 weeks of operating results, with the extra week occurring in the fourth quarter; Snap ons 2007 fiscal year contained 52 weeks of operating results. The impact of the additional week was not material to Snap ons fourth quarter or full year 2008 net sales or operating earnings. Net sales in the fourth quarter of 2008 of $667.8 million declined $75.1 million, or 10.1%, from 2007 levels, reflecting lower levels of consumer and business spending as a result of worsening economic conditions and continued tight credit conditions. The year over year decline in fourth quarter sales also includes $42.2 million of currency translation, largely from the recent strengthening of the dollar. Snap on has significant international operations and is subject to certain risks inherent with foreign operations, including currency translation fluctuations. Excluding the $42.2 million of unfavorable currency translation, organic sales in the fourth quarter of 2008 declined 4.4% from 2007 levels. 30 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Sales in the Commercial & Industrial Group of $326.8 million declined $42.5 million, or 11.5%, from 2007 levels, including $24.4 million of unfavorable currency translation. Sales in the Snap on Tools Group of $252.4 million declined $20.8 million, or 7.6%, from 2007 levels, including $12.2 million of unfavorable currency translation. In the Diagnostics & Information Group, sales of $152.9 million declined $16.6 million, or 9.8%, from 2007 levels, including $7.1 million of unfavorable currency translation. Gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2008 was $300.0 million, as compared to $333.4 million in 2007. The $33.4 million gross profit decline primarily includes the impacts of lower sales, $16.7 million of currency translation, and $9.5 million of higher production, material and freight costs. These declines in gross profit were partially offset by contributions from higher pricing, $5.1 million of lower restructuring costs, and $4.9 million of savings from RCI initiatives. In addition, fourth quarter 2008 gross profit included $0.3 million of LIFO related inventory valuation expense; gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2007 included $6.0 million of LIFO related inventory valuation benefits. As a result of these factors, gross profit margin of 44.9% in 2008 was equal to 2007 levels. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2008 were $211.4 million, as compared to $245.1 million in 2007. The $33.7 million improvement in operating expenses primarily includes $12.6 million of savings from RCI initiatives, $10.9 million of currency translation, $5.0 million of lower performance based incentive compensation, $4.3 million of lower stock based incentive compensation, and lower volume related expenses. Operating expenses in 2008 were further reduced by a $5.4 million adjustment of a pre acquisition contingency acquired with the Business Solutions acquisition in 2006. These reductions in operating expenses were partially offset by $2.0 million of higher restructuring costs. The year over year operating expense comparison is also impacted by the inclusion, in 2007, of a $4.0 million gain from the sale of a facility in Europe. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2008 improved 130 basis points to 31.7%, as compared to 33.0% in 2007. Operating income from Financial Services was $8.9 million on revenue of $19.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, as compared with $8.0 million of operating income on revenue of $19.0 million in 2007. Contributions from higher revenues in 2008, primarily as a result of lower market discount rates, were partially offset by a 12.8% decline in originations. Consolidated operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008 were $97.5 million, an increase of $1.2 million, or 1.2%, from the $96.3 million achieved in the fourth quarter of 2007. The $1.2 million increase in year over year operating earnings includes $6.4 million of unfavorable currency translation. Interest expense of $8.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 was down $2.8 million from prior year primarily due to declining interest rates on our floating rate debt and lower average debt levels. Other income (expense) net was expense of $0.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, as compared to income of $0.4 million in 2007. Other income (expense) net primarily includes interest income and hedging and currency exchange rate transaction gains and losses. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on other income (expense) net. Snap ons effective income tax rate on earnings before equity earnings and minority interests was 31.9% in the fourth quarter of 2008 and 31.2% in the fourth quarter of 2007. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on income taxes. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008 were $58.6 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, as compared with net earnings of $57.3 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, in 2007. 2008 ANNUAL REPORT 31 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Commercial & Industrial Group Three Months Ended (Amounts in millions) January 3, 2009 December 29, 2007 Change External net sales $ 295.1 90.3% $ 333.3 90.3% $ (38.2 ) 11.5% Intersegment net sales 31.7 9.7% 36.0 9.7% (4.3 ) 11.9% Segment net sales 326.8 100.0% 369.3 100.0% (42.5 ) 11.5% Cost of goods sold (203.2 ) 62.2% (236.8 ) 64.1% 33.6 14.2% Gross profit 123.6 37.8% 132.5 35.9% (8.9 ) 6.7% Operating expenses (84.5 ) 25.8% (94.3 ) 25.6% 9.8 10.4% Segment operating earnings $ 39.1 12.0% $ 38.2 10.3% $ 0.9 2.4% Segment net sales of $326.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 declined $42.5 million, or 11.5%, from 2007 levels. Excluding $24.4 million of unfavorable currency translation, sales declined $18.1 million, or 4.9%, year over year primarily due to continued lower sales of professional tools in Europe and lower overall equipment sales worldwide, despite strong double digit increases in sales of imaging aligner units. These year over year sales declines were partially offset by continued higher sales of tools, kits and tool storage products to industrial customers and by increased sales of power tools. Segment gross profit of $123.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 declined $8.9 million, or 6.7%, from 2007 levels. The $8.9 million gross profit decline includes the impacts of lower sales, $8.9 million of currency translation and $4.8 million of higher production and material costs. These decreases to gross profit were partially offset by contributions from higher pricing, $6.3 million of lower restructuring costs and $4.2 million of savings from RCI initiatives. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit of 37.8% in the fourth quarter of 2008 improved 190 basis points over 35.9% in 2007. Operating expenses of $84.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 improved $9.8 million from 2007 levels primarily due to $5.8 million of currency translation, $5.6 million of savings from RCI initiatives, lower volume related and other expenses, and $1.0 million of lower restructuring costs. The year over year operating expense comparison is also impacted by the inclusion, in 2007, of a $4.0 million gain from the sale of a facility in Europe. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings of $39.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 increased $0.9 million from 2007 levels and, as a percentage of net sales, improved from 10.3% in 2007 to 12.0% in 2008. The $0.9 million increase in year over year operating earnings includes $3.1 million of unfavorable currency translation.

Excluding $12.2 million of unfavorable currency translation, sales declined 3.1% year over year reflecting a more challenging sales environment, particularly for sales of higher priced products and hand tools. Sales in the companys U.S. franchise operations declined 5.0% year over year despite a slight increase in the number of vans in the quarter, while organic sales in the companys international franchise operations were up slightly. 32 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Segment gross profit of $105.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 declined $20.0 million, or 16.0%, from 2007 levels. The $20.0 million gross profit decline primarily reflects the impacts of lower sales, $6.3 million of higher year over year LIFO related inventory valuation expense ($0.3 million of LIFO related expense in 2008, as compared to $6.0 million of LIFO related benefits in 2007), $5.7 million of currency translation, and $4.7 million of higher production and material costs. These decreases to gross profit were partially offset by contributions from higher pricing. Operating expenses of $85.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 improved $3.3 million from 2007 levels primarily due to $4.7 million of savings from RCI initiatives, $3.0 million of currency translation, and lower volume related expenses, partially offset by $2.8 million of higher restructuring costs. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings of $19.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 declined $16.7 million from 2007 levels and, as a percentage of net sales, declined from 13.4% in 2007 to 7.8% in 2008. The $16.7 million decline in year over year operating earnings includes $2.7 million of unfavorable currency translation.

These sales declines were partially offset by higher sales of diagnostics products in North America and increased sales of Mitchell1 information products. Excluding currency translation, organic sales declined 5.6% year over year. Segment gross profit of $71.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 declined $4.4 million, or 5.8%, from 2007 levels. The $4.4 million gross profit decline primarily reflects the impacts of lower sales, $2.1 million of currency translation, $1.4 million of increased software costs and $0.3 million of higher restructuring costs, partially offset by $0.7 million of savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses of $37.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 improved $11.3 million from 2007 levels primarily due to a $5.4 million adjustment of a pre acquisition contingency acquired with the Business Solutions acquisition in 2006, $2.3 million of savings from RCI initiatives, $2.1 million of currency translation, and lower volume related expenses. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings of $34.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 increased $6.9 million from 2007 levels and, as a percentage of net sales improved from 16.2% in 2007 to 22.4% in 2008. The $6.9 million year over year increase in operating earnings was not impacted by currency translation.

Net sales in 2007 increased $386.1 million, or 15.7%, from 2006 levels, including $84.0 million from currency translation. Sales in the Commercial & Industrial Group increased $158.6 million, or 13.3%, year over year, primarily due to higher sales of professional tools and equipment in Europe, increased industrial sales, and continued strong sales growth in emerging markets. Sales in the Snap on Tools Group increased $82.7 million, or 8.1%, from prior year levels, primarily driven by a 6.3% increase in North American sales and continued strong growth in international sales. In the Diagnostics & Information Group, sales were up $144.4 million, or 28.5%, from 2006 levels, primarily due to sales from the November 28, 2006, acquisition of Business Solutions, partially offset by lower sales due to the wind down of an OEM facilitation program in Europe, and by lower sales as a result of outsourcing certain products previously manufactured and sold to the Snap on Tools Group. 34 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Gross profit in 2007 was $1,266.6 million, as compared to $1,079.8 million in 2006. The $186.8 million improvement in 2007 gross profit primarily reflects benefits from the higher sales, $40.6 million of savings from ongoing RCI initiatives, and $30.9 million of currency translation. These increases were partially offset by $22.5 million of increased production and material costs and $6.6 million of higher year over year restructuring costs. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit improved from 44.0% in 2006 to 44.6% in 2007. Operating expenses in 2007 were $964.2 million, as compared to $930.0 million in 2006. The $34.2 million increase in operating expenses includes $62.1 million of higher year over year operating expenses for Business Solutions (twelve months of operating expense in 2007 versus approximately five weeks of post acquisition operating expense in 2006), $22.2 million of unfavorable currency translation, higher volume related expenses, and increased spending for expansion in emerging markets. These increases in year over year operating expenses were largely offset by the absence, in 2007, of a $38.0 million franchisee litigation settlement charge recorded in 2006, higher benefits of $11.5 million from ongoing RCI initiatives, $6.4 million of gains from the sale of facilities and $2.0 million of lower restructuring costs. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses of 33.9% were significantly improved from 2006 levels. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the franchisee litigation settlement. Interest expense of $46.1 million in 2007 was up from $20.6 million in 2006 primarily due to higher debt levels to finance the Business Solutions acquisition. Other income (expense) net was income of $5.5 million in 2007 as compared to income of $5.3 million in 2006. Other income (expense) net includes interest income and hedging and currency exchange rate transaction gains and losses. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on other income (expense) net. Snap ons effective income tax rate on earnings before equity earnings and minority interests was 32.5% in 2007, as compared with 31.1% in the prior year.

The $101.4 million sales increase primarily reflects higher sales of professional tools and equipment in Europe, increased industrial sales and continued strong sales growth in emerging markets. Segment gross profit of $483.5 million in 2007 was up $47.8 million over 2006 levels primarily due to higher sales, $24.6 million of savings from ongoing RCI initiatives, and $20.7 million of currency translation. These increases were partially offset by $14.4 million of increased production and material costs and $8.4 million of higher restructuring costs. Operating expenses of $352.0 million in 2007 were up $22.5 million from 2006 levels, but improved 160 basis points as a percentage of segment sales. The increase in year over year operating expenses primarily includes $15.2 million of currency translation, higher volume related expenses, increased investment spending to further expand the companys sales and manufacturing presence in emerging growth markets and lower cost regions, and $3.1 million of higher restructuring costs. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by $5.4 million of gains on the sale of facilities in Europe and $3.1 million of savings from ongoing RCI initiatives. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings in 2007 increased $25.3 million from 2006 levels. As a percentage of segment net sales, including the impact of $11.5 million of higher restructuring costs in 2007, operating earnings for the Commercial & Industrial Group improved from 8.9% in 2006 to 9.7% in 2007.

Sales in the companys international franchise operations increased 15.3% year over year primarily due to continued strong growth in the United Kingdom and Australia. Currency translation contributed $18.0 million of the segments year over year sales increase. 36 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Segment gross profit of $489.5 million in 2007 was up $41.8 million from 2006 levels primarily due to the higher sales and lower costs, including $15.9 million of benefits from ongoing RCI initiatives and $7.1 million of currency translation. These improvements to gross profit were partially offset by $7.0 million of higher production and material costs. Operating expenses of $364.4 million in 2007 were down $45.7 million from prior year levels primarily due to the absence of the $38.0 million franchisee litigation settlement charge recorded in 2006, lower spending of $4.4 million in 2007 related to the companys strategic supply chain and franchise system initiatives, $3.3 million of lower bad debt expense, and $3.2 million of lower restructuring costs. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by $4.2 million of currency translation and higher volume related expenses. As a result of these factors, operating earnings in 2007 for the Snap on Tools Group increased $87.5 million from 2006 levels and, as a percentage of segment net sales, improved from 3.7% in 2006 to 11.3% in 2007. Diagnostics & Information Group (Amounts in millions) 2007 2006 Change External net sales $ 524.9 80.7% $ 381.5 75.4% $ 143.4 37.6% Intersegment net sales 125.7 19.3% 124.7 24.6% 1.0 0.8% Segment net sales 650.6 100.0% 506.2 100.0% 144.4 28.5% Cost of goods sold (357.0 ) 54.9% (309.8 ) 61.2% (47.2 ) 15.2% Gross profit 293.6 45.1% 196.4 38.8% 97.2 49.5% Operating expenses (194.1 ) 29.8% (136.6 ) 27.0% (57.5 ) 42.1% Segment operating earnings $ 99.5 15.3% $ 59.8 11.8% $ 39.7 66.4% Segment net sales in 2007 of $650.6 million increased $144.4 million, or 28.5%, from 2006 levels primarily due to $179.0 million of higher sales in 2007 from Business Solutions (twelve months of sales in 2007 versus approximately five weeks of post acquisition sales in 2006) and higher sales of diagnostics and information products. Currency translation contributed $11.8 million of the year over year sales increase. These increases were partially offset by approximately $35 million of lower sales due to the wind down of an OEM facilitation program in Europe, and by lower sales from the outsourcing of certain non strategic, low margin diagnostics equipment products previously manufactured and sold to the Snap on Tools Group. Segment gross profit of $293.6 million in 2007 was up $97.2 million from 2006 levels primarily due to the higher sales and a more favorable product mix. As a percentage of segment net sales, gross profit margin of 45.1% in 2007 improved significantly from 38.8% in 2006. Operating expenses of $194.1 million were up $57.5 million from 2006 levels primarily due to $62.1 million of higher operating expenses for Business Solutions (twelve months of operating expense in 2007 versus approximately five weeks of post acquisition operating expense in 2006), partially offset by $7.3 million of savings from ongoing RCI initiatives. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Diagnostics & Information Group in 2007 increased $39.7 million from 2006 levels and, as a percentage of segment net sales, improved from 11.8% in 2006 to 15.3% in 2007. Financial Services (Amounts in millions) 2007 2006 Change Financial services revenue $ 63.0 100.0% $ 49.0 100.0% $ 14.0 28.6% Financial services expenses (40.6 ) 64.4% (36.0 ) 73.5% (4.6 ) 12.8% Segment operating income $ 22.4 35.6% $ 13.0 26.5% $ 9.4 72.3% Financial services operating income in 2007 was $22.4 million on $63.0 million of revenue, as compared with $13.0 million of operating income on $49.0 million of revenue in 2006. The increase in operating income primarily reflects the impact of higher net yields and lower borrowing costs. Originations of $539.6 million in 2007 were essentially flat with prior year levels. Corporate Snap ons general corporate expenses of $53.7 million in 2007 were essentially flat with the $53.8 million incurred in 2006. 2008 ANNUAL REPORT 37 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources Snap ons growth has historically been funded by a combination of cash provided by operating activities and debt financing. Snap on believes that its cash from operations, coupled with its sources of borrowings, are sufficient to fund its anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, restructuring activities, acquisitions, common stock repurchases and dividend payments. Due to Snap ons credit rating over the years, external funds have been available at a reasonable cost. As of the close of business on February 13, 2009, Snap ons long term debt and commercial paper was rated A3 and P 2 by Moodys Investors Service and A and A 2 by Standard & Poors. As of the date of this Form 10 K, the credit and financial markets are in a period of substantial instability and uncertainty that is affecting the availability of credit to borrowers. Snap on believes that its current credit arrangements are sound and that the strength of its balance sheet affords the company the financial flexibility to respond to both internal growth opportunities and those available through acquisitions. In light of the current state of the credit and financial markets, however, the company cannot provide any assurances of the availability of future financing or the terms on which it might be available. The following discussion focuses on information included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of January 3, 2009, working capital (current assets less current liabilities) of $593.2 million increased $45.0 million from $548.2 million as of December 29, 2007, including $22.8 million of higher levels of Cash and cash equivalents. The following represents the companys working capital position as of January 3, 2009, and December 29, 2007. (Amounts in millions) January 3, 2009 December 29, 2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 115.8 $ 93.0 Accounts receivable net of allowances 522.1 586.9 Inventories net 359.2 322.4 Other current assets 143.6 185.1 Total current assets 1,140.7 1,187.4 Accounts payable (126.0 ) (171.6 ) Notes payable and current maturities of long term debt (12.0 ) (15.9 ) Other current liabilities (409.5 ) (451.7 ) Total current liabilities (547.5 ) (639.2 ) Total working capital $ 593.2 $ 548.2 Accounts receivable at the end of 2008 was $522.1 million, down $64.8 million from year end 2007 levels. The $64.8 million decline includes $38.6 million of currency translation and $26.2 million of lower receivables, primarily due to lower year over year fourth quarter sales. Days sales outstanding at year end 2008 was 64 days, as compared to 73 days at year end 2007. Inventories of $359.2 million at year end 2008 were up $36.8 million from year end 2007 levels, including $55.7 million of higher inventories partially offset by $18.9 million of currency translation. The $55.7 million inventory increase primarily reflects the impacts of lower than expected sales and higher levels of inventory to support targeted growth initiatives in certain existing and emerging markets. The year over year inventory increase also reflects the impact of higher inventory costs in 2008 as a result of inflationary and commodity cost increases. Inventory turns (full year cost of goods sold divided by the average of the beginning and ending inventory balances for the year) were 4.6 turns at year end 2008, as compared to 4.9 turns at year end 2007. Inventories accounted for using the first in, first out (FIFO) method as of January 3, 2009, and December 29, 2007, approximated 64% and 65%, respectively, of total inventories. All other inventories are accounted for using the LIFO cost method. The companys LIFO reserve increased from $75.0 million at December 29, 2007, to $83.3 million at January 3, 2009. 38 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Accounts payable at January 3, 2009, was $126.0 million, down $45.6 million from year end 2007 levels primarily due to lower production levels, the timing of payments and $6.3 million of unfavorable currency translation. Notes payable and long term debt as of January 3, 2009, was $515.4 million. As of December 29, 2007, notes payable and long term debt was $517.9 million. Notes payable and current maturities of long term debt of $12.0 million at January 3, 2009, included $10.6 million of notes payable and $1.4 million of current maturities of long term debt. No commercial paper was outstanding at January 3, 2009, or December 29, 2007. Long term debt of $503.4 million as of January 3, 2009, included $150 million of unsecured floating rate notes that mature on January 12, 2010, $200 million of unsecured 6.25% notes that mature in 2011, $150 million of unsecured 5.50% notes that mature in 2017, and $3.4 million of other long term debt. The weighted average interest rate on the $150 million of unsecured floating rate notes was 3.82% in 2008 and the interest rate on these notes as of January 3, 2009, was 4.88%. The company has begun consideration of alternatives for addressing the debt maturities that will occur over the next several years. Average commercial paper and notes payable outstanding were $68.1 million in 2008 and $124.9 million in 2007. The weighted average interest rate on these instruments was 4.33% in 2008 and 5.59% in 2007. As of January 3, 2009, the weighted average interest rate on outstanding notes payable was 8.32%, as compared to 8.78% at December 29, 2007. As of January 3, 2009, Snap on had a five year, $500 million multi currency revolving credit facility that terminates on August 10, 2012. As of January 3, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under this revolving credit facility. The $500 million revolving credit facilitys financial covenant requires that Snap on maintain, as of each fiscal quarter end, (i) a ratio of total debt to the sum of total debt plus shareholders equity of not greater than 0.60 to 1.00; or (ii) a ratio of total debt to the sum of net income plus interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and other non cash or extraordinary charges for the preceding four fiscal quarters then ended of not greater than 3.50 to 1.00. As of January 3, 2009, the companys ratio of total debt to the sum of total debt plus shareholders equity was 0.30, which is in compliance with the covenants of this revolving credit facility. As of January 3, 2009, Snap on also had $20 million of unused available debt capacity under committed bank lines of credit. The committed bank lines consist of two $10 million lines of credit that expire on July 28, 2009, and August 30, 2009, respectively. As of January 3, 2009, Snap on had $520 million of unused available debt capacity under the terms of its revolving credit facility and committed bank lines of credit. Although the credit and financial markets are currently in a state of substantial instability and uncertainty, Snap on believes that it has sufficient available committed and uncommitted lines of credit and liquidity facilities to cover its expected funding needs on both a short term and long term basis. Snap on manages its aggregate short term borrowings so as not to exceed its availability under its revolving credit facilities and committed lines of credit. While the instability of the credit and financial markets has affected the market for commercial paper issuances and other short term debt, Snap on currently believes that it could access those markets for short term liquidity if the need were to arise. Snap on regularly monitors the credit and financial markets and may take advantage of what it believes are favorable market conditions to issue long term debt to further improve its liquidity and capital resources. Near term liquidity requirements for Snap on include the funding of its investments in capital expenditures and restructuring activities, payments of dividends and interest, and funding for share repurchases, if any. Snap on also expects to make contributions of $8.2 million to its foreign pension plans and $1.3 million to its domestic pension plans in 2009. Depending on market and other conditions, Snap on may elect to make discretionary cash contributions to its domestic pension plans in 2009. Snap ons long term financing strategy is to maintain continuous access to the debt markets to accommodate its liquidity needs. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on Snap ons debt and credit facilities. Since 1999, CIT has been the exclusive purchaser of the credit and installment financing contracts originated by SOC in the United States. Snap on has been monitoring its relationship with CIT carefully, particularly in view of the current instability in the credit markets. If CIT were to no longer purchase the credit and installment financing contracts originated by SOC, Snap on believes it has, and or would have access to, alternative means to finance these contracts, including the use of its existing credit facilities. 2008 ANNUAL REPORT 39 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) The SOC joint venture agreement between Snap on and CIT automatically renews on an annual basis unless either Snap on or CIT provides a six month advance notice of their intent to not renew the agreement. This advance notice must be given during the first six months of the calendar year. The joint venture agreement also provides for a nine month transition period in the event the joint venture agreement is not renewed. The following discussion focuses on information included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. Cash flow provided from operating activities was $215.0 million in 2008, $231.1 million in 2007, and $203.4 million in 2006. Depreciation expense was $47.9 million in 2008, $53.5 million in 2007 and $48.5 million in 2006. The lower depreciation expense in 2008 primarily reflects the impact of favorable currency translation partially offset by higher depreciation as a result of increased capital spending in recent years. Capital expenditures were $73.9 million in 2008, $61.9 million in 2007 and $50.5 million in 2006. The increase in 2008 capital expenditures over 2007 levels included continued higher spending to accelerate the expansion of the companys manufacturing capabilities in lower cost regions and emerging markets, as well as increased spending to construct a new headquarters and development facility for Snap on Business Solutions, the companys automotive parts and service information business, which is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2009. Capital expenditures in all three years include higher levels of spending to support the companys strategic supply chain and other growth initiatives, including the installation of new production equipment and machine tooling to enhance manufacturing and distribution operations, as well as provide ongoing replacements of manufacturing and distribution equipment. Capital spending over the last three years also included spending for the replacement and enhancement of the companys existing global enterprise resource planning (ERP) management information systems, which will continue over a period of several years. Snap on believes that its cash generated from operations, as well as the funds available from its credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund the companys capital expenditure requirements in 2009. Amortization expense was $24.1 million in 2008, $22.2 million in 2007 and $3.4 million in 2006. The increase in amortization expense over 2006 levels is primarily due to the amortization of intangibles from the November 2006 acquisition of Business Solutions. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on acquired intangible assets. On March 5, 2008, Snap on acquired a 60% interest in Wanda Snap on, a tool manufacturer in China, for a cash purchase price of $15.4 million (or $14.1 million, net of cash acquired), including $1.2 million of transaction costs. The acquisition of Wanda Snap on is part of the companys ongoing strategic initiatives to further expand its manufacturing presence in emerging growth markets and lower cost regions. The Wanda Snap on joint venture agreement granted a redeemable minority interest right to the minority shareholder that could require Snap on to acquire the minority interest at a purchase price of either 64.9 million Chinese yuan (approximately $9.5 million at year end 2008 exchange rates) or 75.7 million Chinese yuan (approximately $11.1 million at year end 2008 exchange rates) if certain financial metrics (as defined in the joint venture agreement) are reached during the five year period subsequent to the acquisition date. On January 12, 2007, Snap on sold $300 million in floating and fixed rate notes consisting of $150 million of floating rate notes and $150 million of fixed rate notes. Snap on used the proceeds from the sales of these notes, net of $1.5 million of transaction costs, to repay commercial paper obligations issued to finance the November 2006 acquisition of Snap on Business Solutions. Snap on has undertaken stock repurchases from time to time to offset dilution created by shares issued for employee and dealer stock purchase plans, stock options, and other corporate purposes, as well as to repurchase shares when the company believes market conditions are favorable. In 2008, Snap on repurchased 1,230,000 shares of common stock for $69.8 million under its previously announced share repurchase programs. The cash used to repurchase shares of common stock was partially offset by $41.7 million of proceeds from stock purchase plans and stock option exercises and $5.7 million of related excess tax benefits. As of January 3, 2009, Snap on had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $117.2 million in common stock pursuant to Board authorizations. The purchase of Snap on common stock is at the companys discretion, subject to prevailing financial and market conditions. Snap on repurchased 1,860,000 shares of common stock for $94.4 million in 2007 and 2,616,618 shares of common stock for $109.8 million in 2006. Snap on believes that its cash generated from operations, as well as the funds available from its credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund the companys share repurchases, if any, in 2009. 40 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Snap on has paid consecutive quarterly cash dividends, without interruption or reduction, since 1939. Cash dividends paid in 2008, 2007 and 2006 totaled $69.7 million, $64.8 million and $63.6 million, respectively. On November 1, 2007, the Board increased the quarterly cash dividend by 11.1% to $0.30 per share ($1.20 per share per year). 2008 2007 2006 Cash dividends paid per common share $ 1.20 $ 1.11 $ 1.08 Cash dividends paid as a percent of prior year retained earnings 5.4% 5.5% 5.6% Snap on believes that its cash generated from operations, as well as the funds available from its credit facilities, will be sufficient to pay dividends in 2009. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Except as set forth below in the section labeled Contractual Obligations and Commitments and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the company had no off balance sheet arrangements as of January 3, 2009. Contractual Obligations and Commitments A summary of Snap ons future contractual obligations and commitments as of January 3, 2009, are as follows: (Amounts in millions) Total 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 and thereafter Contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 504.8 $ 1.4 $ 353.2 $ 0.1 $ 150.1 Interest on fixed rate debt 99.1 20.7 36.8 16.5 25.1 Operating leases 92.2 24.4 29.2 17.0 21.6 Capital leases 28.2 1.8 3.6 3.6 19.2 Purchase obligations 13.5 13.3 0.2 Other 0.7 0.7 Total $ 738.5 $ 62.3 $ 423.0 $ 37.2 $ 216.0 The company has excluded payments related to its pension and postretirement benefit plans from the contractual obligation table above; see Notes 11 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the companys benefit plans and payments. The contractual obligation table above does not include income tax liabilities recorded in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes: an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109; see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on income taxes. Environmental Matters Snap on is subject to various federal, state and local government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Snap ons policy is to comply with these requirements and the company believes that, as a general matter, its policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with its business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in some of Snap ons operations and products, as it is with other compan ies engaged in similar businesses. Snap on is and has been engaged in the handling, manufacture, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies. The company believes that, as a general matter, its handling, manufacture, use and disposal of these substances are in accordance with environmental laws and regulations. It is possible, however, that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could bring into question the companys handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these substances. 2008 ANNUAL REPORT 41 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Consolidated Joint Venture SOC, a consolidated, 50% owned joint venture between Snap on and CIT, provides a broad range of financial services to Snap ons U.S. franchisee and customer network and to Snap ons industrial and other customers. Snap on and CIT have identical voting and participation rights and responsibilities in SOC. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on SOC. Snap on receives royalty and management fee income from SOC based on the volume of financings originated by SOC. Snap on also shares ratably with CIT in any residual net profit or loss of the joint venture after operating expenses, including royalty and management fees, interest costs and credit loss provisions. Snap on provides extended term financing internationally through its wholly owned finance subsidiaries. SOC sells substantially all of its originated contracts on a limited recourse basis to CIT, net of certain fees, and SOC continues to service these contracts for an estimated servicing fee. SOC originated contracts totaling $424.2 million in 2008, $422.7 million in 2007 and $426.8 million in 2006. CIT and Snap on have agreed to lend funds to support SOCs working capital requirements on a 50/50 basis. As of January 3, 2009, and December 29, 2007, no amounts were loaned to SOC by either Snap on or CIT pursuant to this agreement. Financial information regarding SOC loan originations is as follows: 2008 2007 2006 Originations (in millions): Extended credit receivables $ 337.4 $ 348.1 $ 356.2 Equipment leases 24.6 24.6 28.8 Franchisee financing 62.2 50.0 41.8 Total $ 424.2 $ 422.7 $ 426.8 The SOC joint venture agreement between Snap on and CIT automatically renews on an annual basis unless either Snap on or CIT provides a six month advance notice of their intent to not renew the agreement. This advance notice must be given during the first six months of the calendar year. The joint venture agreement also provides for a nine month transition period in the event the joint venture agreement is not renewed. New Accounting Standards See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on new accounting standards. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to managements discussion and analysis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are generally based on historical experience, current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources, as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The companys significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Snap on considers the following policies and estimates to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 42 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Revenue Recognition: Snap on recognizes revenue from the sale of tools, diagnostics and equipment solutions when contract terms are met, collectibility is reasonably assured and a product is shipped or risk of ownership has been transferred to and accepted by the customer. For sales contingent upon customer acceptance or product installation, revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations are fulfilled. Estimated product returns are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale based upon historical product return experience and gross profit margin adjusted for known trends. Provisions for customer volume rebates, discounts and allowances are also recorded as a reduction of reported revenues at the time of sale based on historical experience and known trends. Revenue related to maintenance and subscription agreements is recognized over the term of the agreement. Snap on also recognizes revenue related to multiple element arrangements, including sales of software and software related services. When a sales arrangement contains multiple elements, such as hardware and software products and or services, Snap on uses vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value to allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value and, when necessary, uses the residual method to assign value to the delivered elements when VSOE only exists for the undelivered elements. Snap on limits the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services. The amount assigned to future delivery of products or services is recognized when the product is delivered and or when the services are performed. In instances where the product and or services are performed over an extended period, as is the case with subscription agreements or the providing of ongoing support, revenue is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement, which generally ranges from 12 to 60 months. Financial Services Revenue: Snap on also generates revenue from various financing programs that include (i) loans to franchisees; (ii) loans to franchisees customers; and (iii) loans to Snap ons industrial and other customers for the purchase of tools and equipment on an extended term payment plan. These financing programs are offered through SOC, a consolidated 50% owned joint venture with CIT, and Snap ons wholly owned international finance subsidiaries. Financial services revenue consists of SOCs sales of originated contracts to CIT and service fee income, as well as installment contract revenue and franchisee loan receivable revenue derived from SOC and Snap ons wholly owned international finance operations. The decision to finance through Snap on or another financing entity is solely at the election of the customer. When assessing customers for potential financing, Snap on considers various factors regarding ability to pay including financial condition, collateral, debt servicing ability, past payment experience and credit bureau information. Contracts originated by SOC and subsequently sold to CIT are also subject to the underwriting approval of CIT. Financing revenue from SOC is recognized primarily from the sale of originated contracts to CIT. SOC continues to service these contracts based on an estimated servicing fee. Servicing fees are paid to SOC by CIT and such revenue is recognized over the contractual term of the loan, with a portion of the servicing fee recognized at the time of origination. Financing revenue from originated loans that are retained is recognized over the life of the contract, with interest computed on a daily basis. Snap ons wholly owned international finance subsidiaries own the loans originated through their financing programs. Revenue from interest income is recognized over the life of the contract, with interest computed on a daily basis. Franchise fee revenue, including nominal, non refundable initial and ongoing monthly fees (primarily for sales and business training and marketing and product promotion programs), is recognized as the fees are earned. Internally Developed Software: Costs incurred in the development of software that will ultimately be sold are capitalized from the time technological feasibility has been attained and ceases when the related product is ready for general release. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, the company capitalized $9.7 million, $10.6 million and $5.0 million, respectively, of such costs. Amortization of capitalized software development costs was $8.2 million in 2008, $4.9 million in 2007, and $2.5 million in 2006. Unamortized capitalized software development costs were $25.5 million at January 3, 2009, and $24.0 million at December 29, 2007. Impairment of Goodwill and Other Indefinite lived Intangible Assets: Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. Annual impairment tests are performed by the company in the second quarter of each fiscal year. Snap on evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the businesses to which the goodwill relates. Estimated cash flows and related goodwill are grouped at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment, or under certain circumstances, a component of an operating segment that constitutes a business. When estimated future discounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the net assets and related goodwill, an 2008 ANNUAL REPORT 43 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) impairment test is performed to measure and recognize the amount of the impairment loss, if any. Impairment losses, which are limited to the carrying value of goodwill, represent the excess of the carrying amount of a reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. In determining the estimated future cash flows, Snap on considers current and projected future levels of income, as well as business trends, prospects and market and economic conditions. Impairment tests involve the use of judgmental estimates related to the fair market value of the business operations with which goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are associated, taking into consideration both historical operating performance and anticipated financial position and future earnings, discounted by the companys weighted average cost of capital. Snap on cannot predict the occurrence of certain events that might adversely affect the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. Should the operations of the businesses with which goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets are associated incur significant declines in profitability and cash flow in future years due to significant adverse changes in business climate, adverse actions by regulators, unanticipated competition, loss of key customers, and or changes in technology or markets, some or all of the recorded goodwill or intangibles could be subject to impairment. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on goodwill and other intangible assets. Impairment of Long lived and Amortized Intangible Assets: Snap on performs impairment evaluations of its long lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives, whenever business conditions or events indicate that those assets may be impaired. When the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying value of the long lived assets, the assets are written down to fair market value and a charge is recorded to current operations. Significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate, adverse actions by regulators, unanticipated competition, loss of key customers and or changes in technology or markets, could require a provision for impairment in a future period. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: Snap on evaluates the collectibility of receivables based on a combination of various financial and qualitative factors that may affect customers ability to pay. These factors may include customers financial condition, collateral, debt servicing ability, past payment experience and credit bureau information. Snap on does not believe that accounts receivable represent significant concentrations of credit risk because of its diversified portfolio of individual customers and geographical areas. Snap on regularly reviews the accounts receivable allowance estimation process and adjusts the allowances as appropriate. In circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations, a specific reserve is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected. Additional reserves are established based upon the companys perception of the quality of the current receivables, including the length of time the receivables are past due, past experience of collectibility and underlying economic conditions. If the financial condition of the companys customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional reserves would be required. Excess and Obsolete Inventory: Snap on records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions. Allowances for raw materials are largely based on an analysis of raw material age and actual physical inspection of raw material for fitness for use. As part of evaluating the adequacy of allowances for work in progress and finished goods, management reviews individual product stock keeping units (SKUs) by product category and product life cycle. Cost adjustments for each product category/product life cycle state are generally established and maintained based on a combination of historical experience, forecasted sales and promotions, technological obsolescence, inventory age and other actual known conditions and circumstances. Should actual product marketability and raw material fitness for use be affected by conditions that are different from management estimates, further adjustments to inventory allowances may be required. Warranty: Snap ons policy is to record a liability for the expected cost of warranty related claims at the time of sale. The amount of warranty liability accrued reflects managements best estimate of the expected future cost of honoring the companys obligations under its warranty plans. Snap on calculates its accrual requirements based on historic warranty loss experience that is periodically adjusted for recent actual experience, including the timing of claims during the warranty period and actual costs incurred. If actual return rates and or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates, adjustments to cost of sales may be required in future periods. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on warranty. 44 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Stock based Compensation: Snap on recognizes the cost of employee services in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards (with limited exceptions). That cost, based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest, is recognized on a straight line basis over the period during which the employee is required to provide the service in exchange for the award. No compensation cost is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite service. The grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments is estimated using the Black Scholes valuation model. The Black Scholes valuation model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the stock based award and stock price volatility. The assumptions used are managements best estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, the recorded stock based compensation expense could have been materially different from that depicted in the financial statements. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on stock based compensation. Pension Benefits: The pension benefit obligation and related pension expense are calculated in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of Snap ons control and can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements. Snap on believes that the two most critical assumptions are (i) the expected return on plan assets; and (ii) the assumed discount rate. Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases. Lowering the expected rate of return assumption for Snap ons domestic pension plan assets by 0.5% would have increased Snap ons 2008 domestic pension expense by approximately $3.6 million. Snap on uses a three year, market related value asset method of amortizing the difference between actual and expected returns on its U.S. plan assets. The objective of Snap ons discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. In making this determination, the company takes into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans. The methodology for selecting the discount rate as of year end 2008 was to match the plans cash flows to that of a theoretical bond portfolio yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zero coupon bonds with an Aa rating or better for each maturity. The selection of the 6.3% weighted average discount rate for Snap ons domestic pension plans represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments. Lowering Snap ons domestic discount rate assumption by 0.5% would have increased Snap ons 2008 domestic pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately $0.8 million and $40.3 million, respectively. At year end 2008, Snap ons domestic projected benefit obligation comprised approximately 85% of Snap ons worldwide projected benefit obligation. Actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or market related value of assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period of active participants. Prior service costs resulting from plan amendments are amortized in equal annual amounts over the average remaining service period of affected active participants or over the remaining life expectancy of affected retired participants. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on pension benefits. Postretirement Benefits: Snap ons postretirement benefits obligation and related expense are calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions, including health care trend rates. An increase of one percentage point in health care costs would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $1.5 million and would increase the annual service and interest cost by $0.1 million. A corresponding decrease of one percentage point would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit by $1.4 million and decrease the annual service and interest cost by $0.1 million. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on postretirement plans. Income Taxes: Snap on records deferred income tax assets and liabilities for differences between the book basis and tax basis of the related net assets. Snap on records a valuation allowance, when appropriate, to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. While the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. 2008 ANNUAL REPORT 45 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) In addition, the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on income taxes. Outlook The challenges posed by the global economy increased significantly during the fourth quarter, furthering the impact on Snap ons sales of higher priced products, such as tool storage and vehicle repair equipment. Additional slowdowns in the economies of Europe, particularly Southern Europe, negatively impacted volume at the companys European based tools business. Furthermore, the general economic difficulties are now spreading across more industries and to additional geographies, creating more widespread pressure on business activity. In the near term, Snap on anticipates no change in this environment and, as a result, expects sales and credit originations in the first quarter of 2009 to be down year over year. Additional headwinds in 2009 now include approximately $3.0 million per quarter of higher year over year pension expense due to declines in pension asset values. Assuming foreign currency exchange rates remain at recent levels, the company also anticipates approximately $8.0 million of unfavorable foreign exchange impact on first quarter operating earnings. Snap on believes that its business models are sound and that it continues to maintain and expand its strong brand positions. When coupled with its innovation processes, Snap on believes that these strengths have enabled the advancement of its market position in 2008. The company expects to benefit from those strengths in 2009 and to improve its strategic position going forward. Snap on also expects further benefits in 2009 from its RCI, sourcing and other cost reduction initiatives that will help to limit the impact of any volume decline. Snap on does not, as a general practice, furnish quarterly sales or earnings projections. However, in light of these factors and conditions, the company believes that first quarter 2009 sales and earnings will be lower than reported first quarter 2008 amounts. Snap on is responding to the global macroeconomic challenges by deepening and accelerating its RCI and cost reduction initiatives. Snap on recorded $6.7 million of restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of 2008, bringing full year 2008 restructuring costs to $14.7 million; Snap on expects to incur approximately $12 million to $16 million of restructuring costs in full year 2009. Snap on is also continuing and accelerating a number of its planned growth investments, including further expansion of its manufacturing capacity in China and in Eastern Europe. As a result, capital expenditures in 2009 are expected to be in a range of $75 million to $80 million. Snap on views these investments as potentially enabling near term growth. For full year 2009, Snap on anticipates that its effective income tax rate on earnings before equity earnings and minority interests will approximate 34%. In 2009, Snap on will continue to aggressively manage the balance between investing and capturing growth opportunities with the need for cost reduction actions beyond those already implemented; the current economic uncertainty makes it extremely difficult to presently predict this balance as the company continually adjusts to the challenging business environment. 46 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market, Credit and Economic Risks Market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments. Snap on is exposed to market risk from changes in both foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Snap on monitors its exposure to these risks and attempts to manage the underlying economic exposures through the use of financial instruments such as interest rate swap, foreign exchange and treasury lock agreements. Snap on does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Snap ons broad based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole. Snap ons management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. Foreign Currency Risk Management Snap on has significant international operations and is subject to certain risks inherent with foreign operations that include currency fluctuations and restrictions on movement of funds. Foreign exchange risk exists to the extent that Snap on has payment obligations or receipts denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. To manage these exposures, Snap on identifies naturally offsetting positions and then generally purchases hedging instruments to protect the residual net exposures. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on foreign currency risk management. Interest Rate Risk Management Snap ons interest rate risk management policies are designed to reduce the potential volatility of earnings that could arise from changes in interest rates. Through the use of interest rate swaps, Snap on aims to stabilize funding costs by managing the exposure created by the differing maturities and interest rate structures of Snap ons assets and liabilities. Snap on also enters into treasury lock agreements to manage the risk associated with changing benchmark interest rates on its extended contract installment loans that are sold to CIT. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on interest rate risk management. Snap on utilizes a Value at Risk (VAR) model to determine the potential one day loss in the fair value of its interest rate and foreign exchange sensitive financial instruments from adverse changes in market factors. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. Snap ons computations are based on the inter relationships among movements in various currencies and interest rates (variance/co variance technique). These inter relationships were determined by observing interest rate and foreign currency market changes over the preceding quarter. The estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value, calculated using the VAR model, at January 3, 2009, was $1.2 million on interest rate sensitive financial instruments and $1.9 million on foreign currency sensitive financial instruments. The VAR model is a risk management tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by Snap on, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors. 2008 ANNUAL REPORT 47 Credit Risk Credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. Prior to granting credit, each customer is evaluated, taking into consideration the borrowers financial condition, collateral, debt servicing ability, past payment experience, credit bureau information, and other financial and qualitative factors that may affect the borrowers ability to repay. Specific credit reviews and standard industry credit scoring models are used in performing this evaluation. Loans that have been granted are typically monitored through an asset quality review process that closely monitors past due accounts and initiates collection actions when appropriate. In addition to its direct credit risk exposure, Snap on also has credit risk exposure for certain SOC originated contracts for franchisee van loans with recourse to Snap on. At January 3, 2009, $15.4 million of loans originated by SOC have a recourse provision to Snap on if the loans become more than 90 days past due. For additional information on SOC, refer to the section entitled Consolidated Joint Venture in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Counterparty Risk Snap on is exposed to credit losses in the event of non performance by the counterparties to various financial agreements, including its interest rate swap, foreign exchange and treasury lock agreements. Snap on does not obtain collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk, but monitors the credit standing of the counterparties and enters into agreements only with financial institution counterparties with a credit rating of A or better. Snap on does not anticipate non performance by its counterparties. Economic Risk Economic risk is the possibility of loss resulting from economic instability in certain areas of the world. Snap on continually monitors its exposure in these markets. As a result of the above market, credit and economic risks, net income and revenues in any particular period may not be representative of full year results and may vary significantly from year to year. Inflation has not had a significant impact on the company. Commodity Risk The company is a purchaser of certain commodities such as steel, natural gas and electricity. The company is also a purchaser of components and parts that are integrated into the companys end products, as well as the purchaser of certain finished goods, all of which may contain various commodities including steel, aluminum and others. Snap ons supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers. The principal raw material used in the manufacture of our products is steel, which we purchase in competitive, price sensitive markets. To meet Snap ons high quality standards, our steel needs range from specialized alloys, which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers, to commodity types of alloys. These raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality. Some of these materials have been, and in the future may be, in short supply. As some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures, we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice. Additionally, unexpected price increases could result in higher prices to our customers or an erosion of the margins on our products. We believe our ability to sell our products is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road, the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles. These factors affect the frequency, type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians, and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians, the prosperity of the technicians and, subsequently, the demand the technicians have for our tools, other products and services, and the value they place on those products and services. To the extent that gasoline prices increase, consumers may turn to other, non gasoline based, methods of transportation, including more frequent use of public transportation. A decrease in the use of gasoline consuming vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for our products. 48 SNAP ON INCORPORATED To the extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm pricing agreements with its suppliers, the company may experience margin declines to the extent that it is not able to increase the selling prices of its products.
