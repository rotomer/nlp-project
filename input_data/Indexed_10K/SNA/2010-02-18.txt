Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management Overview Unless otherwise indicated, references in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to fiscal 2009 or 2009 refer to the fiscal year ended January 2, 2010; references to fiscal 2008 or 2008 refer to the fiscal year ended January 3, 2009; references to fiscal 2007 or 2007 refer to the fiscal year ended December 29, 2007. References to year end 2009, 2008 and 2007 refer to January 2, 2010, January 3, 2009, and December 29, 2007, respectively. The economic slowdown and tightened credit environment that began in 2008 continued into 2009, as customers curtailed spending in response to the worsening global recession. Despite the challenges of the ongoing recession, we continued investing in, and even accelerated, certain of our strategic growth initiatives aimed at strengthening our business models, pursuing geographic and customer diversification, expanding our presence in emerging markets and driving value creation processes, including innovation and Rapid Continuous Improvement (described below). We continue to believe that the advancement of these strategic initiatives will help create an environment to achieve long term value for company shareholders, associates, franchisees and other distributor partners across our varied business segments and channels. Net sales in 2009 of $2,362.5 million decreased $490.8 million, or 17.2%, from 2008 levels, with unfavorable currency translation contributing $98.5 million, or 20.0%, of the sales decline. Operating earnings of $250.7 million in 2009 decreased $138.1 million from 2008 levels primarily due to the lower sales volumes. In 2009, operating earnings contributions from the companys ongoing efficiency and productivity (collectively Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI) initiatives and other cost reduction activities, including benefits from restructuring, material cost reductions, and savings from cost containment actions, more than offset the impacts of costs to carry manufacturing capacity in light of lower demand and inventory reduction efforts, unfavorable currency effects, lower financial services income and higher year over year restructuring costs. On July 16, 2009, Snap on terminated its joint venture agreement with CIT Group Inc. (CIT) relating to the parties Snap on Credit LLC (SOC) financial services joint venture and subsequently purchased CITs 50% ownership interest in the joint venture for $8.1 million pursuant to the terms of the joint venture agreement. Since July 16, 2009, Snap on is providing financing for the majority of new loans originated by SOC and SOC is recording the interest yield on the new on book receivables over the life of the contracts. Previously, SOC sold new contract originations to CIT and recorded gains on the sale of the contracts as financial services revenue. The change from recognizing gains on contract sales to CIT, to recognizing the interest yield on the on book receivables, was a primary factor in the year over year decline in both financial services revenues and operating earnings. As a result of this change, Snap on anticipates that financial services revenue and operating income will, through the second quarter of 2010, decline compared to prior year periods as the company builds its portfolio of on book finance receivables. Snap on expects that operating income from financial services will improve as the on book finance portfolio grows. In response to the global economic challenges, we accelerated certain RCI and other strategic initiatives in 2009, including those planned investments that we see as potentially enabling near term growth, such as the further expansion of our manufacturing capacity in China and Eastern Europe. In 2010, we intend to aggressively manage the balance between investing and capturing growth opportunities with the need for additional cost reduction actions beyond those already implemented or planned. In 2009, we experienced adverse effects from foreign currency exchange rate movements; given our increasingly global footprint, foreign currency rates could continue to have a more pronounced effect on our sales and operating profit comparisons. Our strategic priorities and plans for 2010 will continue to build on the improvement initiatives underway to achieve sustainable, profitable growth. Global market conditions in 2010, however, may affect the level and timing of resources deployed in pursuit of these initiatives. In the Commercial & Industrial Group, segment net sales in 2009 of $1,083.8 million were down 23.1% from 2008 levels, primarily as a result of the economic downturn that particularly impacted sales volumes in various European markets. Excluding $63.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic (excluding foreign currency translation effects) sales in 2009 declined $261.6 million, or 19.4%, year over year. Operating earnings of $48.3 million in 2009 declined $119.0 million from 2008 levels as the impacts of lower sales, costs to carry manufacturing capacity in light of lower demand and inventory reduction efforts, primarily in Europe, and higher restructuring costs were only partially offset by $52.3 million of savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives, including savings from cost containment actions. The Commercial & Industrial Group incurred $18.2 million of restructuring costs in 2009 primarily to improve the segments cost structure in Europe. 2009 ANNUAL REPORT 25 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) The Commercial & Industrial Group intends to build on the following strategic priorities in 2010: Continuing to invest in emerging market growth initiatives, including China, India and Eastern Europe; Increasing market share in key industrial market segments by reaching new customers, expanding our business with existing customers, and continually expanding value added content; Continuing to invest in innovation that delivers productivity enhancing solutions that utilize the latest technology; and Continuing to rationalize the operating footprint and reduce structural costs. In the Snap on Tools Group, progress continued on fundamental, strategic initiatives to strengthen the group and enhance franchisee profitability and satisfaction. Segment net sales of $998.5 million in 2009 declined $105.5 million, or 9.6%, from 2008 levels, primarily due to the continued challenging global economy. Excluding $23.7 million of unfavorable currency translation, organic sales declined 7.6%. However, supply chain improvements and an ongoing transition to a market demand based replenishment system continued to improve complete and on time delivery of a broad assortment of products in 2009. Operating earnings in 2009 of $110.8 million declined $6.9 million from 2008 levels, as the impacts of the lower sales and $20.9 million of unfavorable currency effects were largely offset by $43.5 million of savings from ongoing RCI and other cost reduction initiatives, including benefits from restructuring, material cost reductions and savings from cost containment actions. The Snap on Tools Group intends to continue to build on the progress made in enhancing the franchise proposition and delivering customer productivity solutions, with specific initiatives in 2010 focused on the following: Continuing to improve franchisee profitability and satisfaction; Continuing to fill open territories in the United States and Canada; Developing new programs to expand market coverage; Continuing to invest in new product innovation and development; and Increasing operational flexibility in back office support functions, manufacturing and the supply chain through RCI initiatives and investment, as required. By executing in these areas, we believe that we, as well as our franchisees, will continue to serve more customers better and more profitably. In the Diagnostics & Information Group, segment net sales of $530.6 million in 2009 declined $97.2 million, or 15.5%, from 2008 levels, while operating earnings in 2009 increased $6.5 million year over year to $119.4 million. The increase in operating earnings primarily reflects the impacts of a more favorable sales mix of higher margin diagnostics and software products, despite the lower sales, and $24.8 million of savings from ongoing RCI and other cost reduction initiatives, including savings from cost containment actions. The improved sales mix of diagnostics and Mitchell1 information products in 2009 benefited from the development and launch of new products and the continued expansion of functionality, content and product integration. Sales of the companys electronic parts catalogs to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and their franchised dealer networks declined from 2008 levels primarily due to lower non recurring hardware, training and installation revenue resulting from the completion of a major multi year deployment in 2008, and the impact of automotive dealership closures in North America. Fewer major essential tool distribution programs by OEMs in North America and the impact of the wind down of a major facilitation program in Europe also impacted 2009 sales. In addition, many OEM dealerships delayed capital investment programs in 2009 as they evaluated the impacts of the substantial and continued weakness in the automotive industry. Despite lower year over year sales, the 2006 acquisition of Snap on Business Solutions continues to provide a strong base for relationships with key OEM customers, strengthening our position as a provider of essential productivity solutions. 26 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Table of Contents The Diagnostics & Information Group intends to focus on the following strategic priorities in 2010: Continuing software and hardware upgrades; Expanding product range with new products and services; Increasing penetration in geographic markets; Leveraging integration of software solutions; and Continuing productivity advancements through RCI initiatives and leveraging of resources. Financial Services revenue and operating earnings in 2009 decreased to $58.3 million and $17.5 million, respectively. Financial services revenue and operating earnings in 2008 totaled $81.4 million and $37.3 million, respectively. As discussed above, on July 16, 2009, Snap on terminated its financial services joint venture agreement with CIT. Since July 16, 2009, Snap on is providing financing for the majority of new loans originated by SOC and SOC is recording the interest yield on the new on book receivables over the life of the contracts as financial services revenue. Previously, SOC sold new contract originations to CIT and recorded gains on the sale of the contracts as financial services revenue. The decrease in year over year financial services revenue and operating earnings is primarily due to the change from recognizing gains on contract sales to CIT, to recognizing the interest yield on the on book receivables. Originations of $498.1 million in 2009 decreased $12.6 million, or 2.5%, from 2008 levels. Financial Services intends to focus on the following strategic priorities in 2010: Delivering financial products and services that attract and sustain profitable franchisees; Delivering financial products and services that foster lifetime customer loyalty; Delivering high quality in all of our financial products and processes through the use of RCI initiatives; and Improving overall portfolio performance. Cash Flows Net cash provided from operating activities was $347.1 million in 2009 as compared to $220.4 million in 2008. The $126.7 million increase in cash flow from operating activities in 2009 resulted primarily from net changes in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by lower 2009 net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $241.7 million in 2009 included additions to, and collections of, finance receivables of $265.5 million and $82.0 million, respectively, following the July 2009 termination of the financial services joint venture agreement with CIT. Capital expenditures in 2009 of $64.4 million included continued spending to support the companys strategic growth initiatives, including the expansion of manufacturing capabilities in emerging growth markets and lower cost regions. Capital expenditures in 2009 also included spending to complete the construction of a new headquarters and research and development facility for the companys automotive parts and service information business, which was completed in the fourth quarter. Subsequent to the July 16, 2009 termination of the financial services joint venture agreement with CIT, Snap on acquired CITs 50% ownership interest in SOC for $8.1 million. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $475.6 million in 2009. In 2009, Snap on issued $550 million of unsecured fixed rate, long term notes. Snap on is using the $545.9 million of net proceeds from the sale of these notes for general corporate purposes, including the funding of receivables contracts originated by SOC and the repayment of $150 million of floating rate debt on January 12, 2010. Cash dividends paid to shareholders totaled $69.0 million in 2009; the company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock in 2009. 2009 ANNUAL REPORT 27 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Results of Operations 2009 vs. 2008 Results of operations for 2009 and 2008 are as follows: (Amounts in millions) 2009 2008 Change Net sales $ 2,362.5 100.0% $ 2,853.3 100.0% $ (490.8) 17.2% Cost of goods sold (1,304.9) 55.2% (1,568.7) 55.0% 263.8 16.8% Gross profit 1,057.6 44.8% 1,284.6 45.0% (227.0) 17.7% Operating expenses (824.4) 34.9% (933.1) 32.7% 108.7 11.6% Operating earnings before financial services 233.2 9.9% 351.5 12.3% (118.3) 33.7% Financial services revenue 58.3 100.0% 81.4 100.0% (23.1) 28.4% Financial services expenses (40.8) 70.0% (44.1) 54.2% 3.3 7.5% Operating earnings from financial services 17.5 30.0% 37.3 45.8% (19.8) 53.1% Operating earnings 250.7 10.4% 388.8 13.2% (138.1) 35.5% Interest expense (47.7) 2.0% (33.8) 1.1% (13.9) 41.1% Other income (expense) net 2.3 0.1% 2.8 0.1% (0.5) 17.9% Earnings before income taxes and equity earnings 205.3 8.5% 357.8 12.2% (152.5) 42.6% Income tax expense (62.7) 2.6% (117.8) 4.0% 55.1 46.8% Earnings before equity earnings 142.6 5.9% 240.0 8.2% (97.4) 40.6% Equity earnings, net of tax 1.1 3.6 0.1% (2.5) 69.4% Net earnings 143.7 5.9% 243.6 8.3% (99.9) 41.0% Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (9.5) 0.4% (6.9) 0.2% (2.6) 37.7% Net earnings attributable to Snap on Inc. $ 134.2 5.5% $ 236.7 8.1% $ (102.5) 43.3% Percentage Disclosure: All income statement line item percentages below Operating earnings from financial services are calculated as a percentage of the sum of Net sales and Financial services revenue. Snap ons 2009 fiscal year contained 52 weeks of operating results; Snap ons 2008 fiscal year contained 53 weeks of operating results. The impact of the additional week in 2008, which occurred in the fourth quarter, was not material to Snap ons 2008 net sales or operating earnings. Net sales in 2009 of $2,362.5 million were down $490.8 million, or 17.2%, from 2008 levels. Excluding $98.5 million of unfavorable currency translation, organic sales in 2009 declined 14.2% from 2008 levels. Snap on has significant international operations and is subject to certain risks inherent with foreign operations, including currency translation fluctuations. The year over year sales comparison was significantly impacted by weakened consumer and business demand as customers curtailed spending in response to the global recession that continued throughout 2009. Sales in the Commercial & Industrial Group of $1,083.8 million declined $325.5 million, or 23.1%, from 2008 levels; excluding $63.9 million of unfavorable currency translation, year over year organic sales declined 19.4%. Sales in the Snap on Tools Group of $998.5 million were down $105.5 million, or 9.6%, from 2008 levels; excluding $23.7 million of unfavorable currency translation, year over year organic sales declined 7.6%. In the Diagnostics & Information Group, sales of $530.6 million were down $97.2 million, or 15.5%, from 2008 levels; excluding $15.6 million of unfavorable currency translation, year over year organic sales declined 13.3%. 28 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Table of Contents Gross profit in 2009 was $1,057.6 million as compared to $1,284.6 million in 2008. The $227.0 million decline in year over year gross profit is primarily due to the lower sales and costs to carry manufacturing capacity, mainly in the Commercial & Industrial Group, in light of lower demand and inventory reduction efforts. The decline in 2009 gross profit also included $54.0 million of unfavorable currency effects, $13.4 million of higher restructuring costs, primarily to improve the companys cost structure in Europe, and $5.7 million of higher software development costs. These declines were partially offset by $54.6 million of savings from ongoing RCI and other cost reduction initiatives, including benefits from restructuring, material cost reductions, and savings from cost containment actions in light of the weakened economy. Year over year last in, first out (LIFO) related inventory valuation benefits as a result of inventory reductions in 2009 were largely offset by the effects of increased inventory write offs and the liquidation of slow moving and excess inventories. As a result of these factors, gross profit margin of 44.8% in 2009 declined 20 basis points (100 basis points equals 1.0 percent) from 45.0% in 2008. Operating expenses in 2009 were $824.4 million as compared to $933.1 million in 2008. The $108.7 million reduction in year over year operating expenses primarily resulted from $66.0 million of benefits from ongoing RCI, restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives, including savings from cost containment actions in light of the weakened economy, $28.2 million of favorable currency translation, $20.1 million of lower performance based incentive compensation expense, and $6.3 million of lower restructuring costs. These declines were partially offset by $11.5 million of higher bad debt expense, including increased credit exposure at North American automotive dealerships. In addition, operating expenses in 2009 included $12.0 million of increased pension expense primarily as a result of declines in pension asset values. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses were 34.9% in 2009 as compared to 32.7% in 2008. Operating earnings from financial services was $17.5 million on $58.3 million of revenue in 2009, as compared with operating earnings of $37.3 million on $81.4 million of revenue in 2008. On July 16, 2009, Snap on terminated its financial services joint venture agreement with CIT and subsequently purchased CITs 50% ownership interest in SOC. Since July 16, 2009, Snap on is providing financing for the majority of new loans originated by SOC and SOC is recording the interest yield on the new on book receivables over the life of the contracts as financial services revenue. Previously, SOC sold new contract originations to CIT and recorded gains on the sale of the contracts as financial services revenue. The change from recognizing gains on contract sales to CIT, to recognizing the interest yield on the on book receivables, was a primary factor in the year over year declines in both revenues and operating earnings. See Notes 2 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Consolidated operating earnings in 2009 of $250.7 million declined $138.1 million, or 35.5%, from $388.8 million in 2008. In addition to the impact of the lower sales, the year over year decrease in operating earnings was due to $27.2 million of unfavorable currency effects, $19.8 million of lower operating earnings from financial services and $7.3 million of higher restructuring costs. Interest expense of $47.7 million in 2009 increased $13.9 million from the prior year primarily due to higher debt levels as a result of the issuance of $550 million of fixed rate, long term notes in 2009. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the companys debt and credit facilities. Other income (expense) net was income of $2.3 million in 2009 as compared to income of $2.8 million in 2008. Other income (expense) net primarily included interest income and hedging and currency exchange rate transaction gains and losses. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on other income (expense) net. Snap ons effective income tax rate on earnings attributable to Snap on was 32.0% in 2009 and 33.6% in 2008. The lower effective tax rate in 2009 is primarily due to higher realization of tax credits and a reduction of tax contingency reserves, partially offset by an unfavorable mix of foreign earnings. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on income taxes. On March 5, 2008, Snap on acquired a 60% interest in Zhejiang Wanda Tools Co., Ltd. (Wanda Snap on), a tool manufacturer in China, for a cash purchase price of $15.4 million (or $14.1 million, net of cash acquired), including $1.2 million of transaction costs. For segment reporting purposes, the results of operations and assets of Wanda Snap on are included in the Commercial & Industrial Group. Pro forma financial information has not been presented as the effects of the acquisition were not material to Snap ons results of operations or financial position. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Wanda Snap on acquisition. Net earnings attributable to Snap on in 2009 were $134.2 million, or $2.32 per diluted share, as compared to net earnings attributable to Snap on of $236.7 million, or $4.07 per diluted share, in 2008. 2009 ANNUAL REPORT 29 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Exit and Disposal Activities Snap on recorded costs of $22.0 million for exit and disposal activities in 2009 as compared to $14.7 million of such costs in 2008. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on Snap ons exit and disposal activities. Segment Results Snap ons business segments are based on the organization structure used by management for making operating and investment decisions and for assessing performance. Snap on has aggregated its 11 operating segments into four reportable business segments based on their similar economic, business and other characteristics. Snap ons reportable business segments include: (i) the Commercial & Industrial Group; (ii) the Snap on Tools Group; (iii) the Diagnostics & Information Group; and (iv) Financial Services. The Commercial & Industrial Group consists of the business operations providing tools and equipment products and equipment repair services to a broad range of industrial and commercial customers worldwide through direct, distributor and other non franchise distribution channels. The Snap on Tools Group consists of the business operations serving the worldwide franchise van channel. The Diagnostics & Information Group consists of the business operations providing diagnostics equipment, vehicle service information, business management systems, electronic parts catalogs, and other solutions for vehicle service to customers in the worldwide vehicle service and repair marketplace. Financial Services consists of the business operations of Snap ons wholly owned finance subsidiaries. Snap on evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on segment revenues and operating earnings. For the Commercial & Industrial, Snap on Tools and the Diagnostics & Information Groups, segment net sales include both external and intersegment net sales. Snap on accounts for intersegment sales and transfers based primarily on standard costs with reasonable mark ups established between the segments. Identifiable assets by segment are those assets used in the respective reportable segments operations. Corporate assets consist of cash and cash equivalents (excluding cash held at Financial Services), deferred income taxes, pension assets and certain other assets. All significant intersegment amounts are eliminated to arrive at Snap ons consolidated financial results. Commercial & Industrial Group (Amounts in millions) 2009 2008 Change External net sales $ 962.9 88.8% $ 1,260.5 89.4% $ (297.6) 23.6% Intersegment net sales 120.9 11.2% 148.8 10.6% (27.9) 18.8% Segment net sales 1,083.8 100.0% 1,409.3 100.0% (325.5) 23.1% Cost of goods sold (735.5) 67.9% (878.9) 62.4% 143.4 16.3% Gross profit 348.3 32.1% 530.4 37.6% (182.1) 34.3% Operating expenses (300.0) 27.6% (363.1) 25.7% 63.1 17.4% Segment operating earnings $ 48.3 4.5% $ 167.3 11.9% $ (119.0) 71.1% Segment net sales of $1,083.8 million in 2009 declined $325.5 million, or 23.1%, from 2008 levels. Excluding $63.9 million of unfavorable currency translation, organic sales declined 19.4% year over year primarily as a result of the economic downturn that particularly affected sales volumes in various European markets in 2009. Segment gross profit of $348.3 million in 2009 was down $182.1 million, or 34.3%, from 2008 levels. The $182.1 million decline in year over year gross profit is primarily due to the lower sales and costs to carry manufacturing capacity, mainly in Europe, in light of lower demand and inventory reduction efforts. The decline in 2009 gross profit also included $21.2 million of unfavorable currency effects and $5.3 million of inflationary cost increases. These declines were partially offset by benefits of $29.3 million from ongoing RCI, restructuring and other cost reduction and cost containment initiatives, including $11.7 million of material cost reductions. Operating expenses of $300.0 million in 2009 were down $63.1 million from 2008 levels primarily due to $23.0 million of savings from ongoing RCI, restructuring and other cost reduction and cost containment initiatives, $18.0 million of favorable currency translation, and lower volume related and other expenses. Restructuring costs in 2009 of $18.2 million increased $14.0 million from 2008 levels primarily due to increased actions to improve the segments cost structure in Europe. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings in 2009 declined $119.0 million from 2008 levels and, as a percentage of segment net sales, declined from 11.9% in 2008 to 4.5% in 2009. The $119.0 million decrease in year over year operating earnings included $3.2 million of unfavorable currency effects. 30 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Table of Contents Snap on Tools Group (Amounts in millions) 2009 2008 Change Segment net sales $ 998.5 100.0% $ 1,104.0 100.0% $ (105.5) 9.6% Cost of goods sold (561.7) 56.3% (636.5) 57.7% 74.8 11.8% Gross profit 436.8 43.7% 467.5 42.3% (30.7) 6.6% Operating expenses (326.0) 32.6% (349.8) 31.6% 23.8 6.8% Segment operating earnings $ 110.8 11.1% $ 117.7 10.7% $ (6.9) 5.9% Segment net sales of $998.5 million in 2009 declined $105.5 million, or 9.6%, from 2008 levels primarily due to the continued challenging sales environment in 2009. Excluding $23.7 million of unfavorable currency translation, organic sales declined 7.6% year over year. U.S. sales in the Snap on Tools Group declined 9.5% year over year, while organic sales in the companys international franchise operations were down slightly. At year end 2009, van count in the United States was up slightly compared to both October 3, 2009, and year end 2008 levels. Segment gross profit of $436.8 million in 2009 decreased $30.7 million, or 6.6%, from 2008 levels. As a percentage of sales, gross profit margin in 2009 improved to 43.7% as compared to 42.3% last year. In addition to the lower sales and costs to carry manufacturing capacity in light of lower demand and inventory reduction efforts, gross profit in 2009 was also affected by $26.0 million of unfavorable currency effects. These declines in gross profit were partially offset by $16.5 million of savings from material and other cost reduction initiatives, including savings from cost containment actions. Year over year LIFO related inventory valuation benefits of $14.6 million ($9.9 million of LIFO related benefits in 2009 and $4.7 million of LIFO related expense in 2008) as a result of inventory reductions in 2009 were largely offset by the effects of increased inventory write offs and the liquidation of slow moving and excess inventories. Operating expenses of $326.0 million in 2009 declined $23.8 million from prior year levels primarily due to $27.0 million of benefits from RCI and other cost reduction and cost containment initiatives, lower volume related and other expenses, and $5.1 million of favorable currency translation. Restructuring costs in 2009 totaled $1.5 million as compared to $7.3 million last year. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings in 2009 decreased $6.9 million from 2008 levels; however, as a percentage of segment net sales, operating earnings in 2009 improved from 10.7% in 2008 to 11.1% in 2009. The $6.9 million decrease in year over year operating earnings included $20.9 million of unfavorable currency effects.

Excluding $15.6 million of unfavorable currency translation, organic sales declined 13.3% year over year primarily due to lower essential tool and facilitation program sales to OEM dealerships. Segment gross profit of $272.5 million in 2009 decreased $14.2 million, or 5.0%, from 2008 levels; however, as a percentage of segment net sales, gross profit margin in 2009 improved to 51.4% as compared to 45.7% last year. The $14.2 million decrease in year over year gross profit primarily reflects the impacts of lower sales, $6.8 million of unfavorable currency effects and $6.2 million of higher software development costs. These declines in gross profit were partially offset by contributions from a more favorable sales mix of higher margin diagnostics and software products, and $8.8 million of savings from ongoing RCI and other cost reduction initiatives, including savings from cost containment actions. Operating expenses of $153.1 million were down $20.7 million from 2008 levels primarily due to $16.0 million of savings from RCI and other cost containment actions, lower volume related and other expenses, and $5.1 million of favorable currency translation. These declines in operating expenses were partially offset by $3.3 million of higher bad debt expense in 2009 primarily related to increased credit exposure at North American automotive dealerships. The year over year operating expense comparison was also impacted by the adjustment of a pre acquisition contingency acquired with Snap on Business Solutions that reduced 2008 operating expenses by $5.4 million. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings of $119.4 million in 2009 increased $6.5 million from 2008 levels and, as a percentage of segment net sales, improved from 18.0% in 2008 to 22.5% in 2009. The $6.5 million increase in year over year operating earnings included $1.7 million of unfavorable currency effects. 2009 ANNUAL REPORT 31 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Financial Services (Amounts in millions) 2009 2008 Change Financial services revenue $ 58.3 100.0% $ 81.4 100.0% $ (23.1) 28.4% Financial services expenses (40.8) 70.0% (44.1) 54.2% 3.3 7.5% Segment operating earnings $ 17.5 30.0% $ 37.3 45.8% $ (19.8) 53.1% Segment operating earnings were $17.5 million on $58.3 million of revenue in 2009, as compared with $37.3 million of operating earnings on $81.4 million of revenue in 2008. On July 16, 2009, Snap on terminated its financial services joint venture agreement with CIT and subsequently purchased CITs 50% ownership interest in SOC. Since July 16, 2009, Snap on is providing financing for the majority of new loans originated by SOC and SOC is recording the interest yield on the new on book receivables over the life of the contracts as financial services revenue. Previously, SOC sold new contract originations to CIT and recorded gains on the sale of the contracts as financial services revenue. The change from recognizing gains on contract sales to CIT, to recognizing the interest yield on the on book receivables, was a primary factor in the year over year declines in both revenues and operating earnings. Originations of $498.1 million in 2009 decreased $12.6 million, or 2.5%, from 2008 levels. The $19.8 million decrease in year over year financial services operating earnings included $1.4 million of unfavorable currency effects. See Notes 2 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Corporate Snap ons general corporate expenses totaled $45.3 million in 2009 as compared to $46.4 million in 2008. The $1.1 million decline in year over year corporate expenses is primarily due to lower performance based incentive compensation and other expenses, partially offset by $12.0 million of higher pension expense primarily due to declines in pension asset values.

Snap ons 2009 fiscal year contained 52 weeks of operating results; Snap ons 2008 fiscal year contained 53 weeks of operating results, with the extra week occurring in the fourth quarter. The impact of the additional week in 2008 was not material to Snap ons fourth quarter 2008 net sales or operating earnings. Net sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 of $618.1 million were down $49.7 million, or 7.4%, from 2008 levels. Excluding $27.2 million of favorable currency translation, organic sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 declined 11.1% from 2008 levels, primarily due to the challenging global economic environment that persisted throughout 2009. Sales in the Commercial & Industrial Group of $302.2 million were down $24.6 million, or 7.5%, from 2008 levels. Excluding $17.3 million of favorable currency translation, organic sales in the Commercial & Industrial Group declined 12.2% primarily due to the continued economic downturn, particularly as it has affected Europe. Sales in the Snap on Tools Group of $251.2 million declined $1.2 million, or 0.5%, from 2008 levels. Excluding $8.5 million of favorable currency translation, organic sales in the Snap on Tools Group declined 3.7%. In the Diagnostics & Information Group, sales of $129.1 million were down $23.8 million, or 15.6%, from 2008 levels. Excluding $1.9 million of favorable currency translation, organic sales in the Diagnostics & Information Group declined 16.6%. 36 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Table of Contents Gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2009 was $284.4 million as compared to $300.0 million in 2008; as a percentage of sales, gross margin improved 110 basis points from 44.9% last year to 46.0% this year. The $15.6 million decline in year over year gross profit is primarily due to the lower sales, costs to carry manufacturing capacity, mainly in the Commercial & Industrial Group, and $4.7 million of higher restructuring costs, primarily to improve the companys cost structure in Europe. These declines were partially offset by $17.5 million of savings from ongoing RCI and other cost reduction initiatives, including benefits from restructuring, material cost reductions and savings from cost containment actions in light of the weakened economy, and $7.0 million of favorable currency effects. Year over year LIFO related inventory valuation benefits as a result of inventory reductions in 2009 were more than offset by the effects of increased inventory write offs and the liquidation of slow moving and excess inventories. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2009 were $213.2 million as compared to $211.4 million in 2008. The $1.8 million increase in year over year operating expenses is primarily due to $7.4 million of unfavorable currency translation, $6.1 million of higher stock based (mark to market) compensation expense, $4.5 million of increased bad debt expense, and $3.0 million of higher pension expense primarily as a result of declines in pension asset values. These increases were partially offset by $19.2 million of benefits from ongoing RCI, restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives, including savings from cost containment actions in light of the weakened economy, $4.7 million of lower restructuring costs, and lower volume related expenses. The year over year operating expense comparison was also impacted by the adjustment of a pre acquisition contingency acquired with Snap on Business Solutions that reduced fourth quarter 2008 operating expenses by $5.4 million. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses were 34.5% in the fourth quarter of 2009 as compared to 31.7% in the fourth quarter of 2008. Operating loss from financial services was $3.8 million on $6.7 million of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009, as compared with $8.9 million of operating earnings on $19.7 million of revenue in 2008. Since the July 16, 2009 termination of the financial services joint venture agreement with CIT, Snap on is providing financing for the majority of new loans originated by SOC and SOC is recording the interest yield on the new on book receivables over the life of the contracts as financial services revenue. Previously, SOC sold new contract originations to CIT and recorded gains on the sale of the contracts as financial services revenue. The change from recognizing gains on contract sales to CIT, to recognizing the interest yield on the on book receivables, was a primary factor in the year over year declines in both revenues and operating earnings. Originations of $132.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 increased 7.4% from comparable prior year levels. See Notes 2 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Consolidated operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2009 of $67.4 million declined $30.1 million, or 30.9%, from the $97.5 million achieved in the fourth quarter of 2008. Interest expense of $14.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 increased $6.0 million from the prior year primarily due to higher debt levels as a result of the issuance of $550 million of fixed rate, long term notes in 2009. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the companys debt and credit facilities. Other income (expense) net was income of $1.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 as compared to expense of $0.5 million in 2008. Other income (expense) net primarily includes interest income and hedging and currency exchange rate transaction gains and losses. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on other income (expense) net. Snap ons effective income tax rate on earnings attributable to Snap on was 31.4% in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 32.6% in the fourth quarter of 2008. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on income taxes. Net earnings attributable to Snap on in the fourth quarter of 2009 were $36.6 million, or $0.63 per diluted share. Net earnings attributable to Snap on in the fourth quarter of 2008 were $58.6 million, or $1.01 per diluted share. 2009 ANNUAL REPORT 37 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Commercial & Industrial Group Fourth Quarter (Amounts in millions) 2009 2008 Change External net sales $ 268.4 88.8% $ 295.1 90.3% $ (26.7) 9.0% Intersegment net sales 33.8 11.2% 31.7 9.7% 2.1 6.6% Segment net sales 302.2 100.0% 326.8 100.0% (24.6) 7.5% Cost of goods sold (200.6) 66.4% (203.2) 62.2% 2.6 1.3% Gross profit 101.6 33.6% 123.6 37.8% (22.0) 17.8% Operating expenses (79.9) 26.4% (84.5) 25.8% 4.6 5.4% Segment operating earnings $ 21.7 7.2% $ 39.1 12.0% $ (17.4) 44.5% Segment net sales of $302.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 declined $24.6 million, or 7.5%, from 2008 levels. Excluding $17.3 million of favorable currency translation, organic sales declined $41.9 million, or 12.2%, primarily as a result of the continued economic downturn that has particularly impacted sales volumes in various European markets. The year over year sales decline was partially offset by continued higher sales in emerging growth markets and increased sales of equipment in North America. Segment gross profit of $101.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 was down $22.0 million, or 17.8%, from 2008 levels. As a percentage of segment net sales, gross profit margin of 33.6% declined 420 basis points from 37.8% last year. The $22.0 million decline in year over year gross profit is primarily due to the lower sales and costs to carry manufacturing capacity, primarily in Europe, in light of lower demand and inventory reduction efforts. Gross profit was also negatively impacted by $5.8 million of higher restructuring costs, primarily to improve the segments cost structure in Europe. These decreases in gross profit were partially offset by $9.9 million of savings from ongoing RCI, restructuring and other cost reduction and cost containment initiatives, including $2.3 million of material cost reductions, and $5.1 million of favorable currency effects. Operating expenses of $79.9 million in the quarter were down $4.6 million from 2008 levels primarily due to $6.5 million of savings from restructuring and other cost reduction and cost containment initiatives, lower volume related expenses, and $1.6 million of lower restructuring costs. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by $4.2 million of unfavorable currency translation and $2.6 million of other expense increases, including higher spending to support expansion in emerging growth markets. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings of $21.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 declined $17.4 million from 2008 levels, with the majority of the decline attributable to the segments European based tools business. As a percentage of segment net sales, operating earnings for the Commercial & Industrial Group declined from 12.0% in 2008 to 7.2% in 2009.

Excluding $8.5 million of favorable currency translation, organic sales declined 3.7% year over year. Sales in the companys U.S. franchise operations declined 3.8% year over year despite a slight increase in the number of vans in the quarter; organic sales in the companys international franchise operations were down slightly. As of 2009 year end, van levels in the United States were up slightly compared with both third quarter 2009 and year end 2008 levels. 38 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Table of Contents Segment gross profit of $114.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 increased $9.0 million, or 8.6%, from 2008 levels. As a percentage of sales, gross profit margin improved 380 basis points from 41.6% in 2008 to 45.4% in 2009. The $9.0 million increase in year over year gross profit includes $5.5 million of savings from material cost reductions, $4.2 million of favorable manufacturing utilization as a result of increasing U.S. production levels, $1.3 million of favorable currency effects and $1.1 million of lower restructuring costs. These increases in gross profit were partially offset by the lower level of organic sales in 2009. Year over year LIFO related inventory valuation benefits of $7.0 million ($6.7 million of LIFO related benefits in 2009 and $0.3 million of LIFO related expense in 2008) as a result of inventory reductions in 2009 were offset by the effects of increased inventory write offs and the liquidation of slow moving and excess inventories. Operating expenses of $80.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 declined $4.4 million from 2008 levels primarily due to $8.5 million of savings from RCI, restructuring and other cost reduction and cost containment initiatives, and $2.9 million of lower restructuring costs. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by $2.5 million of unfavorable currency translation. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2009 increased $13.4 million from 2008 levels and, as a percentage of segment net sales, improved from 7.8% in 2008 to 13.2% in 2009.

Excluding $1.9 million of favorable currency translation, organic sales declined 16.6% year over year primarily due to lower facilitation program, essential tools and electronic parts catalog sales to OEM dealerships. Segment gross profit of $68.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 decreased $2.7 million, or 3.8%, from 2008 levels primarily due to the lower sales and $2.0 million of higher software development costs. As a percentage of segment net sales, gross profit margin of 53.2% in the quarter improved 650 basis points from 46.7% last year primarily due to a more favorable sales mix of higher margin diagnostics and software products, and $2.1 million of savings from ongoing RCI and other cost reduction and cost containment initiatives. Operating expenses of $38.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 increased $1.6 million from prior year levels. In addition to $2.5 million of higher bad debt expense primarily related to increased credit exposure at North American automotive dealerships, the year over year operating expense comparison was also impacted by the adjustment of a pre acquisition contingency acquired with Snap on Business Solutions that reduced fourth quarter 2008 operating expenses by $5.4 million. These increases in year over year operating expenses were partially offset by $4.2 million of savings from RCI, restructuring and other cost reduction and cost containment initiatives, and by lower volume related expenses. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings of $30.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 decreased $4.3 million from $34.3 million in 2008, but improved as a percentage of segment net sales from 22.4% in 2008 to 23.2% in 2009.

Corporate Snap ons general corporate expenses of $13.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 increased $9.1 million from $4.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily due to $6.1 million of higher stock based (mark to market) incentive and other compensation expense ($3.5 million of expense in 2009 and $2.6 million of benefit in 2008) and $3.0 million of higher pension expense, primarily as a result of declines in pension asset values. 2008 vs. 2007 Results of operations for 2008 and 2007 are as follows: (Amounts in millions) 2008 2007 Change Net sales $ 2,853.3 100.0% $ 2,841.2 100.0% $ 12.1 0.4% Cost of goods sold (1,568.7) 55.0% (1,574.6) 55.4% 5.9 0.4% Gross profit 1,284.6 45.0% 1,266.6 44.6% 18.0 1.4% Operating expenses (933.1) 32.7% (964.2) 33.9% 31.1 3.2% Operating earnings before financial services 351.5 12.3% 302.4 10.7% 49.1 16.2% Financial services revenue 81.4 100.0% 63.0 100.0% 18.4 29.2% Financial services expenses (44.1) 54.2% (40.6) 64.4% (3.5) 8.6% Operating earnings from financial services 37.3 45.8% 22.4 35.6% 14.9 66.5% Operating earnings 388.8 13.2% 324.8 11.2% 64.0 19.7% Interest expense (33.8) 1.1% (46.1) 1.6% 12.3 26.7% Other income (expense) net 2.8 0.1% 5.5 0.2% (2.7) 49.1% Earnings before income taxes and equity earnings 357.8 12.2% 284.2 9.8% 73.6 25.9% Income tax expense (117.8) 4.0% (92.5) 3.2% (25.3) 27.4% Earnings before equity earnings 240.0 8.2% 191.7 6.6% 48.3 25.2% Equity earnings, net of tax 3.6 0.1% 2.4 0.1% 1.2 50.0% Net earnings from continuing operations 243.6 8.3% 194.1 6.7% 49.5 25.5% Discontinued operations, net of tax (8.0) 0.3% 8.0 100.0% Net earnings 243.6 8.3% 186.1 6.4% 57.5 30.9% Net earnings attributable tonon controlling interests (6.9) 0.2% (4.9) 0.2% (2.0) 40.8% Net earnings attributable to Snap on Inc. $ 236.7 8.1% $ 181.2 6.2% $ 55.5 30.6% Percentage Disclosure: All income statement line item percentages below Operating earnings from financial services are calculated as a percentage of the sum of Net sales and Financial services revenue. 40 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Table of Contents Snap ons 2008 fiscal year contained 53 weeks of operating results; Snap ons 2007 fiscal year contained 52 weeks of operating results. The impact of the additional week, which occurred in the fourth quarter, was not material to Snap ons fourth quarter 2008 net sales or operating earnings. Net sales in 2008 of $2,853.3 million increased $12.1 million, or 0.4%, from 2007 levels. Excluding $35.5 million of currency translation, net sales in 2008 declined $23.4 million, or 0.8%, from 2007 levels. The year over year sales comparison was significantly impacted by weakened consumer and business demand in 2008, particularly in the fourth quarter, as customers curtailed spending primarily for purchases of higher priced products in response to the worsening global recession. Sales in the Commercial & Industrial Group of $1,409.3 million increased $58.7 million, or 4.3%, from 2007 levels; excluding $37.0 million of currency translation, organic sales (net sales, excluding currency translation effects), increased 1.6% from 2007 levels. Sales in the Snap on Tools Group of $1,104.0 million declined $3.7 million, or 0.3%, from 2007 levels; excluding $1.2 million of favorable currency translation, organic sales declined $4.9 million, or 0.4%, from 2007 levels. In the Diagnostics & Information Group, sales of $627.8 million declined $22.8 million, or 3.5%, from 2007 levels; excluding $1.6 million of currency translation, organic sales declined $21.2 million, or 3.3%, from 2007 levels. Gross profit in 2008 was $1,284.6 million as compared to $1,266.6 million in 2007. The $18.0 million gross profit improvement was primarily driven by $23.4 million of savings from ongoing RCI initiatives, $16.6 million of lower restructuring costs and $9.8 million of currency translation, partially offset by $24.6 million of higher production, material and freight costs. Contributions from higher sales and pricing were more than offset by the mix impact of lower sales of higher margin products. In addition, gross profit in 2008 included $4.7 million of LIFO related inventory valuation expense; gross profit in 2007 included LIFO related inventory valuation benefits of $0.3 million. As a result of these factors, gross profit margin was 45.0% in 2008, up 40 basis points from 44.6% in 2007. Operating expenses in 2008 were $933.1 million as compared to $964.2 million in 2007. The $31.1 million, or 3.2%, improvement in operating expenses includes $28.8 million of contributions from RCI initiatives, $10.9 million of lower franchisee termination costs, $5.0 million of lower performance based incentive compensation and $4.3 million of lower stock based incentive compensation. Operating expenses in 2008 also benefited from a $5.4 million adjustment of a pre acquisition contingency acquired with the Snap on Business Solutions acquisition in 2006. These declines in operating expenses were partially offset by $10.3 million of currency translation, $5.0 million of higher restructuring costs and $2.4 million of increased spending to further expand the companys presence in emerging growth markets and lower cost regions. The year over year operating expense comparison is also impacted by the inclusion, in 2007, of $6.4 million of gains from the sale of facilities. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses in 2008 improved 120 basis points to 32.7%, as compared to 33.9% in 2007. Operating earnings from financial services was $37.3 million on revenue of $81.4 million in 2008, as compared with $22.4 million of operating earnings on revenue of $63.0 million in 2007. The $14.9 million increase in year over year operating earnings primarily reflects the impact of lower market discount rates in 2008. Consolidated operating earnings in 2008 were $388.8 million, an increase of $64.0 million, or 19.7%, from the $324.8 million achieved in 2007. The $64.0 million increase in year over year operating earnings includes $0.8 million of unfavorable currency translation. Interest expense of $33.8 million in 2008 declined $12.3 million from $46.1 million in 2007 primarily due to declining interest rates on our floating rate debt and lower average debt levels. Other income (expense) net was income of $2.8 million in 2008, as compared to income of $5.5 million in 2007. Other income (expense) net primarily includes interest income and hedging and currency exchange rate transaction gains and losses. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on other income (expense) net. Snap ons effective income tax rate on earnings attributable to Snap on was 33.6% in 2008 and 33.1% in 2007. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on income taxes. On March 5, 2008, Snap on acquired a 60% interest in Wanda Snap on, a tool manufacturer in China, for a cash purchase price of $15.4 million (or $14.1 million, net of cash acquired), including $1.2 million of transaction costs. For segment reporting purposes, the results of operations and assets of Wanda Snap on are included in the Commercial & Industrial Group. The net sales and operating earnings impact of Wanda Snap on were not material to Snap ons fourth quarter or full year 2008 Consolidated Financial Statements. 2009 ANNUAL REPORT 41 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) On June 29, 2007, Snap on sold its Sun Electric Systems (SES) business based in the Netherlands for a nominal cash purchase price. The sale of the SES business is reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings as Discontinued operations, net of tax. Snap on recorded an after tax loss of $8.0 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, in its 2007 results of operations related to the sale and results of operations of SES. For segment reporting purposes, the results of operations of SES were previously included in the Diagnostics & Information Group. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on SES. Net earnings attributable to Snap on in 2008 were $236.7 million, or $4.07 per diluted share. Net earnings attributable to Snap on in 2007 of $181.2 million, or $3.09 per diluted share, included an after tax loss of $8.0 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, for discontinued operations related to the sale of SES. Exit and Disposal Activities Snap on recorded costs of $14.7 million for exit and disposal activities in 2008 as compared to $26.3 million of such costs in 2007. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on Snap ons exit and disposal activities.

Excluding $37.0 million of currency translation, sales increased $21.7 million, or 1.6%, year over year primarily due to higher sales of tools, kits and tool storage products to industrial customers, increased sales of power tools and imaging alignment systems, and continued strong sales growth in emerging markets. Segment gross profit of $530.4 million in 2008 increased $46.9 million, or 9.7%, over 2007 levels. The $46.9 million increase in gross profit includes contributions from higher sales and pricing, $17.4 million of lower restructuring costs, $15.1 million of savings from RCI initiatives, and $10.7 million of currency translation. These increases in gross profit were partially offset by $9.9 million of higher production and material costs. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit of 37.6% improved 180 basis points over 35.8% in 2007. Operating expenses of $363.1 million increased $11.1 million from 2007 levels primarily due to $10.0 million of currency translation, $3.4 million of inflationary cost increases, and higher volume related and other expenses, including $2.4 million of costs to further expand the companys sales and manufacturing presence in emerging growth markets and lower cost regions. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by $10.1 million of savings from RCI initiatives. The year over year operating expense comparison is also impacted by the inclusion, in 2007, of $5.4 million of gains on the sale of facilities in Europe. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings of $167.3 million in 2008 increased $35.8 million, or 27.2%, from 2007 levels and, as a percentage of net sales, improved from 9.7% in 2007 to 11.9% in 2008. The $35.8 million increase in year over year operating earnings includes $0.7 million of favorable currency translation. Snap on Tools Group (Amounts in millions) 2008 2007 Change Segment net sales $ 1,104.0 100.0% $ 1,107.7 100.0% $ (3.7) 0.3% Cost of goods sold (636.5) 57.7% (618.2) 55.8% (18.3) 3.0% Gross profit 467.5 42.3% 489.5 44.2% (22.0) 4.5% Operating expenses (349.8) 31.6% (364.4) 32.9% 14.6 4.0% Segment operating earnings $ 117.7 10.7% $ 125.1 11.3% $ (7.4) 5.9% 42 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Table of Contents Segment net sales of $1,104.0 million in 2008 decreased $3.7 million, or 0.3%, from 2007 levels. Excluding $1.2 million of favorable currency translation, 2008 sales declined $4.9 million, or 0.4%, from 2007 levels, as continued higher sales in the companys international franchise operations were more than offset by lower U.S. franchise sales. Sales to U.S. franchisees declined 3.2% year over year primarily due to a more challenging economic environment for sales of higher priced products and hand tools, partially offset by increased sales of power tools and diagnostics products. At year end 2008, van count in the United States was up slightly compared to both September 27, 2008, and December 29, 2007, levels. Sales in the companys international franchise operations increased 6.6% year over year primarily due to strong growth in the United Kingdom, Japan and Australia. Segment gross profit of $467.5 million in 2008 declined $22.0 million, or 4.5%, from 2007 levels. The $22.0 million gross profit decline primarily reflects the impacts of lower U.S. sales, including a shift in product mix to higher sales of lower margin products, and $13.7 million of increased production and material costs. In addition, gross profit in 2008 included $4.7 million of LIFO related inventory valuation expense; gross profit in 2007 included $0.3 million of LIFO related inventory valuation benefits. These declines in gross profit were partially offset by contributions from higher pricing, $6.3 million of benefits from RCI initiatives, and $3.1 million of lower warranty expense. Operating expenses of $349.8 million in 2008 decreased $14.6 million, or 4.0%, from prior year levels largely due to $10.9 million of lower franchisee termination costs and $6.7 million of benefits from RCI initiatives. These decreases to operating expenses were partially offset by $4.1 million of higher restructuring costs. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings of $117.7 million in 2008 declined $7.4 million from $125.1 million in 2007 and, as a percentage of net sales, declined from 11.3% in 2007 to 10.7% in 2008. The $7.4 million decline in year over year operating earnings includes $0.8 million of unfavorable currency translation.

Higher sales of diagnostics and Mitchell1 information products were more than offset by approximately $40 million of lower OEM program sales and by lower sales at Snap on Business Solutions, including expected lower sales from the planned exit of certain non core product lines. The year over year decline in OEM program sales is primarily a consequence of the 2007 rollout of a major essential tool program in North America that was not repeated and the impact of the wind down of a facilitation program in Europe. Segment gross profit of $286.7 million in 2008 decreased $6.9 million, or 2.4%, from 2007 levels as the impacts of lower sales, $3.0 million of higher software development and other costs, $0.9 million of increased restructuring costs, and $0.8 million of currency translation were partially offset by gross profit contributions from a more favorable product mix and $2.0 million of benefits from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses of $173.8 million in 2008 declined $20.3 million from 2007 levels as $13.3 million of savings from RCI initiatives, lower volume related expenses, and $0.4 million of currency translation were partially offset by $0.9 million of higher restructuring costs. In addition, operating expenses in 2008 benefited from a $5.4 million adjustment of a pre acquisition contingency acquired with the Snap on Business Solutions acquisition in 2006. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings of $112.9 million in 2008 increased $13.4 million, or 13.5%, from $99.5 million in 2007 and, as a percentage of net sales, improved from 15.3% in 2007 to 18.0% in 2008.

The $14.9 million increase in year over year operating earnings primarily reflects the impact of lower market discount rates in 2008. Originations of $510.8 million in 2008 increased 1.0% from originations of $505.6 million in 2007. Corporate Snap ons general corporate expenses totaled $46.4 million in 2008, as compared to $53.7 million incurred in 2007. The $7.3 million decline in year over year corporate expenses primarily reflects lower performance based and stock based incentive compensation in 2008. Liquidity and Capital Resources Snap ons growth has historically been funded by a combination of cash provided by operating activities and debt financing. Snap on believes that its cash from operations, coupled with its sources of borrowings and available cash on hand, are sufficient to fund its currently anticipated requirements for working capital, loans originated by SOC, scheduled debt repayments, capital expenditures, restructuring activities, acquisitions, common stock repurchases and dividend payments. Due to Snap ons credit rating over the years, external funds have been available at a reasonable cost. As of the close of business on February 17, 2010, Snap ons long term debt and commercial paper was rated Baa1 and P 2 by Moodys Investors Service and A and A 2 by Standard & Poors. Snap on believes that its current credit arrangements are sound and that the strength of its balance sheet affords the company the financial flexibility to respond to both internal growth opportunities and those available through acquisitions. In light of the current state of the credit and financial markets and the companys borrowing levels, however, the company cannot provide any assurances of the availability of future financing or the terms on which it might be available, or that its debt ratings may not decrease. The following discussion focuses on information included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. At 2009 year end, working capital (current assets less current liabilities) of $936.2 million increased $343.0 million from $593.2 million at 2008 year end, including $583.6 million of higher levels of cash and cash equivalents. The following represents the companys working capital position at 2009 and 2008 year end: (Amounts in millions) 2009 2008 Cash and cash equivalents $ 699.4 $ 115.8 Trade and other accounts receivable net 414.4 462.2 Contract receivables net 32.9 22.8 Finance receivables net 122.3 37.1 Inventories net 274.7 359.2 Other current assets 132.4 143.6 Total current assets 1,676.1 1,140.7 Notes payable and current maturities of long term debt (164.7) (12.0) Accounts payable (119.8) (126.0) Other current liabilities (455.4) (409.5) Total current liabilities (739.9) (547.5) Total working capital $ 936.2 $ 593.2 Cash and cash equivalents at 2009 year end totaled $699.4 million as compared to $115.8 million at the end of 2008. The $583.6 million increase in cash and cash equivalents is primarily due to the companys issuance of $550 million of fixed rate, long term notes and increased cash flows from operating activities. Snap on is using the $545.9 million of proceeds from the sale of these notes, net of $4.1 million of transaction costs, for general corporate purposes, including the funding of receivables contracts originated by SOC and the January 2010 repayment of floating rate debt upon its maturity. 44 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Table of Contents Trade and other accounts receivable net at 2009 year end of $414.4 million declined $47.8 million from 2008 year end levels. Excluding $10.7 million of currency translation impacts, trade and other accounts receivable net declined $58.5 million from 2008 levels primarily due to lower sales. Days sales outstanding (year end trade and other accounts receivable net divided by full year sales, times 360 days) at 2009 year end was 63 days as compared to 58 days at 2008 year end; using 2009 exchange rates, the 2008 days sales outstanding would have been 62 days. The current portions of net contract and finance receivables at 2009 year end totaled $155.2 million as compared to $59.9 million last year. The long term portions of net contract and finance receivables at 2009 year end totaled $248.6 million as compared to $67.3 million last year. The combined $276.6 million increase in net current and long term contract and finance receivables over year end 2008 levels is primarily due to the growth of the companys on balance sheet finance portfolio following the July 16, 2009 termination of the financial services joint venture agreement with CIT. Since July 16, 2009, Snap on is providing financing for the majority of new contract and finance receivables originated by SOC and the related receivables are included on the companys balance sheet; previously, SOC sold most of its loan originations to CIT. Inventories of $274.7 million at 2009 year end declined $84.5 million from 2008 levels primarily due to reduced production levels as a result of lower customer demand and the companys efforts to reduce global inventory levels. Excluding currency translation impacts, inventories declined $98.4 million from 2008 year end levels. Inventory turns (trailing 12 months of cost of goods sold, divided by the average of the beginning and ending inventory balance for the trailing 12 months) were 4.1 turns and 4.6 turns at year end 2009 and 2008, respectively. Inventories accounted for using the first in, first out (FIFO) method as of 2009 and 2008 year end approximated 66% and 64% of total inventories, respectively. All other inventories are accounted for using the LIFO method. The companys LIFO reserve was $68.4 million at 2009 year end and $83.3 million at 2008 year end. Notes payable and current maturities of long term debt of $164.7 million at 2009 year end included $150 million of floating rate debt that matured on January 12, 2010, and $14.7 million of other notes. At 2008 year end, the $150 million note was included in Long term debt on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as its scheduled maturity was in excess of one year of the 2008 year end balance sheet date. The $150 million note was repaid on January 12, 2010, with available cash. Accounts payable at 2009 year end of $119.8 million declined $6.2 million from 2008 levels; excluding currency translation impacts, accounts payable declined $9.3 million from 2008 levels. Other accrued liabilities of $301.4 million at 2009 year end included $81.5 million withheld from payments made to CIT relating to ongoing business activities. On January 8, 2010, Snap on filed a notice of arbitration concerning a dispute with CIT relating to various underpayments made during the course of their financial services joint venture, in which Snap on has alleged damages of approximately $115 million. As a result of the dispute, Snap on has withheld certain amounts (totaling $81.5 million as of 2009 year end) from payments made to CIT relating to ongoing business activities. On January 29, 2010, CIT filed its response denying Snap ons claim and asserting certain claims against Snap on for other matters relating to the joint venture. CITs claims allege damages in excess of $110 million, the majority of which relates to returning the $81.5 million withheld by Snap on. At this early stage, no determination can be made as to the likely outcome of this dispute. See Item 3: Legal Proceedings and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Long term debt of $902.1 million at 2009 year end included (i) $200 million of unsecured 6.25% notes that mature in 2011; (ii) $100 million of unsecured 5.85% notes that mature in 2014; (iii) $150 million of unsecured 5.50% notes that mature in 2017; (iv) $200 million of unsecured 6.70% notes that mature in 2019; (v) $250 million of unsecured 6.125% notes that mature in 2021; and (vi) $2.1 million of other long term debt. Average commercial paper and notes payable outstanding were $15.2 million in 2009 and $68.1 million in 2008. The weighted average interest rate on these instruments was 6.94% in 2009 and 4.33% in 2008. At 2009 year end, the weighted average interest rate on outstanding notes payable was 5.34% as compared to 8.32% in 2008. Snap on has a five year, $500 million multi currency revolving credit facility that terminates on August 10, 2012; at 2009 year end, no amounts were outstanding under this revolving credit facility. The $500 million revolving credit facilitys financial covenant requires that Snap on maintain, as of each fiscal quarter end, either (i) a ratio of total debt to the sum of total debt plus shareholders equity of not greater than 0.60 to 1.00; or (ii) a ratio of total debt to the sum of net income plus interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and other non cash or extraordinary charges for the preceding four fiscal quarters then ended of not greater than 3.50 to 1.00. At 2009 year end, the companys actual ratios of 0.45 and 3.36, respectively, were both within the permitted ranges as set forth in this financial covenant. 2009 ANNUAL REPORT 45 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Snap on also had $20 million of unused available debt capacity under its committed bank lines of credit at 2009 year end. The committed bank lines consist of two $10 million lines of credit that expire on July 27, 2010, and August 29, 2010, respectively. In addition to the financial covenant required by the $500 million multi currency revolving credit facility, discussed above, Snap ons debt agreements and credit facilities also contain certain usual and customary borrowing, affirmative, negative and maintenance covenants. At 2009 year end, Snap on was in compliance with all covenants of its debt agreements and credit facilities. Snap on believes that it has sufficient available cash and committed and uncommitted lines of credit and liquidity facilities to cover its expected funding needs on both a short term and long term basis. Snap on manages its aggregate short term borrowings so as not to exceed its availability under its revolving credit facilities and committed lines of credit. If the need were to arise, Snap on believes that it could access short term debt markets, predominantly through commercial paper issuances and existing lines of credit, to fund its short term requirements and to ensure near term liquidity. Snap on regularly monitors the credit and financial markets and, in the future, may take advantage of what it believes are favorable market conditions to issue long term debt to further improve its liquidity and capital resources. Near term liquidity requirements for Snap on include the funding of new loans originated by SOC and the possible resolution of the related dispute with CIT, the repayment of $150 million of floating rate debt on January 12, 2010, the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in Wanda Snap on, capital expenditures and restructuring activities, payments of dividends and interest, and funding for share repurchases, if any. Snap on also expects to make contributions of $9.0 million to its foreign pension plans and $1.5 million to its domestic pension plans in 2010. Depending on market and other conditions, Snap on may elect to make discretionary cash contributions to its domestic pension plans in 2010. Snap ons long term financing strategy is to maintain continuous access to the debt markets to accommodate its liquidity needs. Since 1999, CIT had been the exclusive purchaser of the credit and installment financing contracts originated by SOC in the United States. On July 16, 2009, Snap on terminated its SOC financial services joint venture agreement with CIT and subsequently purchased CITs 50% ownership interest in SOC for $8.1 million. Since July 16, 2009, Snap on is providing financing for the majority of new loans originated by SOC. Snap on estimates the incremental cash requirements for SOC will approximate $300 million over the next 12 months. Snap on believes, based on current market conditions, that it has adequate financial resources to provide for the financing needs of SOC including available cash on hand, and cash flow provided from operating activities and available credit facilities, including access to public debt markets. The following discussion focuses on information included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $347.1 million in 2009, $220.4 million in 2008 and $235.5 million in 2007. The $126.7 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2009 resulted primarily from net changes in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by lower net earnings. The $126.7 million increase included $98.4 million from lower inventories, primarily due to reduced production levels as a result of lower customer demand and the companys efforts to reduce global inventory levels, and $20.9 million as a result of amounts withheld from CIT. At 2009 year end, Other accrued liabilities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets included $81.5 million withheld from payments made to CIT relating to ongoing business activities. At 2008 year end, other accrued liabilities included amounts payable to CIT of $9.4 million. The $72.1 million year over year increase in other accrued liabilities relating to CIT included $51.2 million associated with refinancings that are not included in net cash provided by operating activities. See Item 3: Legal Proceedings and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Depreciation expense was $49.9 million in 2009, $47.9 million in 2008 and $53.5 million in 2007. Amortization expense was $24.7 million in 2009, $24.1 million in 2008 and $22.2 million in 2007. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on acquired intangible assets. Following the July 16, 2009 acquisition of CITs ownership interest in SOC, Snap on began presenting Provisions for losses on finance receivables on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as part of Net cash provided by operating activities. The non cash provision for loan losses on finance receivables totaled $6.2 million in 2009. For financial statement periods prior to October 3, 2009, the provisions for loan losses on finance receivables, which primarily related to the companys international finance subsidiaries, are included in (Increase) decrease in contract receivables; prior period amounts were not restated as the amounts were not significant, individually or in the aggregate, to Snap ons Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 46 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Table of Contents Investing Activities Following the July 16, 2009 acquisition of CITs ownership interest in SOC, Snap on began presenting Additions to finance receivables and Collections of finance receivables on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as part of Net cash used by investing activities. Finance receivables are comprised of extended term installment loans to technicians (i.e. franchisees customers) to enable them to purchase tools, diagnostics and equipment on an extended term payment plan, generally with average payment terms of 32 months. In 2009, additions to finance receivables totaled $265.5 million and collections of finance receivables totaled $82.0 million. For financial statement periods prior to October 3, 2009, the net additions and collections of finance receivables, which primarily related to the companys international finance subsidiaries, are included in (Increase) decrease in contract receivables; prior period amounts were not restated as the amounts were not significant, individually or in the aggregate, to Snap ons Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Capital expenditures in 2009, 2008 and 2007 totaled $64.4 million, $73.9 million and $61.9 million, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2009 included continued spending to support strategic growth initiatives, including the accelerated expansion of manufacturing capabilities in emerging growth markets and lower cost regions. Capital expenditures in 2009 also included spending to complete the construction of a new headquarters and research and development facility for the companys automotive parts and service information business, which was completed in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures in all three years included higher levels of efficiency and cost reduction capital investments, including the installation of new production equipment and machine tooling to enhance manufacturing and distribution operations, as well as provide ongoing replacements of manufacturing and distribution equipment. Capital spending over the last three years also included spending for the replacement and enhancement of the companys existing global enterprise resource planning (ERP) management information systems, which will continue over the next several years. The higher level of spending in 2008 included increased spending to begin construction of the new headquarters and research and development facility discussed above. Snap on believes that its cash generated from operations, as well as its available cash on hand and funds available from its credit facilities will be sufficient to fund the companys capital expenditure requirements in 2010. On July 16, 2009, Snap on terminated its SOC financial services joint venture agreement with CIT and subsequently acquired CITs 50% ownership interest in SOC for a cash purchase price of $8.1 million. The $8.1 million purchase price represented the book value, and approximated the fair value, of CITs ownership interest in SOC as of the acquisition date. On March 5, 2008, Snap on acquired a 60% interest in Wanda Snap on, a tool manufacturer in China, for a cash purchase price of $15.4 million (or $14.1 million, net of cash acquired), including $1.2 million of transaction costs. On December 10, 2009, Snap on entered into an agreement to acquire the noncontrolling shareholders 40% interest in Wanda Snap on for a purchase price of 52.3 million Chinese yuan (approximately $7.7 million at 2009 year end exchange rates). The transaction is subject to local governmental approval and is expected to close during the first quarter of 2010. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Wanda Snap on acquisition. Financing Activities On February 24, 2009, Snap on sold $300 million of unsecured fixed rate notes consisting of $100 million of unsecured 5.85% notes that mature in 2014, and $200 million of unsecured 6.70% notes that mature in 2019; interest on these notes is being paid semi annually beginning on September 1, 2009. On August 14, 2009, Snap on sold $250 million of unsecured, 6.125% long term notes that mature in 2021; interest on these notes is to be paid semi annually beginning on March 1, 2010. Snap on is using the $545.9 million of net proceeds from the sale of these notes for general corporate purposes, including the funding of receivables contracts originated by SOC and the repayment of $150 million of floating rate debt on January 12, 2010. Snap on has undertaken stock repurchases from time to time to offset dilution created by shares issued for employee and dealer stock purchase plans, stock options and other corporate purposes. At 2009 year end, Snap on had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $130.1 million in common stock pursuant to Board authorizations; Snap on did not repurchase any shares of common stock in 2009. The purchase of Snap on common stock is at the companys discretion, subject to prevailing financial and market conditions. Snap on repurchased 1,230,000 shares of common stock for $69.8 million in 2008 and 1,860,000 shares of common stock for $94.4 million in 2007. Snap on believes that its cash generated from operations, available cash on hand, and funds available from its credit facilities will be sufficient to fund the companys share repurchases, if any, in 2010. 2009 ANNUAL REPORT 47 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Snap on has paid consecutive quarterly cash dividends, without interruption or reduction, since 1939. Cash dividends paid in 2009, 2008 and 2007 totaled $69.0 million, $69.7 million and $64.8 million, respectively. 2009 2008 2007 Cash dividends paid per common share $ 1.20 $ 1.20 $ 1.11 Cash dividends paid as a percent of prior year retained earnings 4.7% 5.4% 5.5% Snap on believes that its cash generated from operations, available cash on hand and funds available from its credit facilities will be sufficient to pay dividends in 2010. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Except as included below in the section labeled Contractual Obligations and Commitments and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the company had no off balance sheet arrangements at 2009 year end. Contractual Obligations and Commitments A summary of Snap ons future contractual obligations and commitments at 2009 year end are as follows: (Amounts in millions) Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 andthereafter Contractual obligations: Current maturities of long term debt $ 150.0 $ 150.0 $ $ $ Long term debt 902.1 201.9 100.1 600.1 Interest on fixed rate debt 404.2 55.3 93.4 80.7 174.8 Operating leases 93.8 25.7 32.2 17.5 18.4 Capital leases 28.2 2.2 4.4 3.9 17.7 Acquisitions 7.7 7.7 Purchase obligations 5.6 4.9 0.7 Total $ 1,591.6 $ 245.8 $ 332.6 $ 202.2 $ 811.0 The company has excluded payments related to its pension and postretirement benefit plans from the contractual obligation table above; see Notes 11 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the companys benefit plans and payments. The contractual obligation table above also does not include normal inventory related and service purchases or income tax liabilities recorded in accordance with U.S. GAAP; see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on income taxes. Environmental Matters Snap on is subject to various federal, state and local government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Snap ons policy is to comply with these requirements and the company believes that, as a general matter, its policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with its business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in some of Snap ons operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses. Snap on is and has been engaged in the handling, manufacture, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies. The company believes that, as a general matter, its handling, manufacture, use and disposal of these substances are in accordance with environmental laws and regulations. It is possible, however, that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could bring into question the companys handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these substances. 48 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Table of Contents New Accounting Standards See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on new accounting standards. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to managements discussion and analysis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are generally based on historical experience, current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources, as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The companys significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Snap on considers the following policies and estimates to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Revenue Recognition: Snap on recognizes revenue from the sale of tools, diagnostics and equipment solutions when contract terms are met, collectibility is reasonably assured and a product is shipped or risk of ownership has been transferred to and accepted by the customer. For sales contingent upon customer acceptance or product installation, revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations are fulfilled. Estimated product returns are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale based upon historical product return experience and gross profit margin adjusted for known trends. Provisions for customer volume rebates, discounts and allowances are also recorded as a reduction of reported revenues at the time of sale based on historical experience and known trends. Revenue related to maintenance and subscription agreements is recognized over the terms of the respective agreements. Snap on also recognizes revenue related to multiple element arrangements, including sales of software and software related services. When a sales arrangement contains multiple elements, such as hardware and software products and or services, Snap on uses vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value to allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value and, when necessary, uses the residual method to assign value to the delivered elements when VSOE only exists for the undelivered elements. Snap on limits the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services. The amount assigned to future delivery of products or services is recognized when the product is delivered and or when the services are performed. In instances where the product and or services are performed over an extended period, as is the case with subscription agreements or the providing of ongoing support, revenue is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable agreement, which generally ranges from 12 to 60 months. Franchise fee revenue, including nominal, non refundable initial and ongoing monthly fees (primarily for sales and business training and marketing and product promotion programs), is recognized as the fees are earned. Financial Services Revenue: Snap on also generates revenue from various financing programs that include (i) loans to franchisees; (ii) loans to franchisees customers; and (iii) loans to Snap ons industrial and other customers for the purchase of tools and equipment and diagnostics products on an extended term payment plan. These financing programs are offered through Snap ons wholly owned finance subsidiaries. Financial services revenue consists of installment contract revenue and franchisee loan receivable revenue. For periods prior to July 16, 2009, financial services revenue also included gains from SOCs sales of originated contracts to CIT. The decision to finance through Snap on or another financing entity is solely at the election of the customer. When assessing customers for potential financing, Snap on considers various factors regarding ability to pay including customers financial condition, collateral, debt servicing ability, past payment experience and credit bureau information. 2009 ANNUAL REPORT 49 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Prior to July 16, 2009, SOC substantially sold all of its loan originations to CIT on a limited recourse basis; SOC retained the right to service such loans for a contractual servicing fee. At the time the loan originations were sold to CIT, SOC recognized a servicing asset since the contractual servicing fee provided SOC with more than adequate compensation for the level of services provided. Contractual servicing fees were $8.3 million in 2009, $9.2 million in 2008 and $9.3 million in 2007. Snap ons international finance subsidiaries own the loans originated through their financing programs; loans retained by SOC prior to July 16, 2009, and loans originated by SOC subsequent to July 16, 2009, are also owned by Snap on. Revenue from interest income on the on book financing portfolio is recognized over the life of the contracts, with interest computed on the average daily balances of the underlying contracts. Impairment of Goodwill and Other Indefinite lived Intangible Assets: Goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. Annual impairment tests are performed by the company in the second quarter of each year. Snap on evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the businesses to which the goodwill relates. Estimated cash flows and related goodwill are grouped at the reporting unit level. The company has determined that its reporting units for testing goodwill impairment are its operating segments or components of an operating segment that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results. In conjunction with the evaluation completed in the second quarter of 2009 and in accordance with U.S. GAAP, Snap on combined two of its previous reporting units into one operating segment and one reporting unit as a result of recent management realignment and other operational changes. Management made this determination in a manner consistent with how the companys operating segments are managed. Based on this analysis, the company has identified 11 reporting units within its four reportable segments. Snap on evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows of the reporting units to which the goodwill relates. The future projections, which are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in the companys current and long range operating plans, are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. Significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on expected growth rates, price increases, capital expenditures, working capital levels, the benefits of recent acquisitions and expected synergies, and weighted average cost of capital that reflects the specific risk profile of the reporting unit being tested. The companys methodologies for valuing goodwill are applied consistently on a year over year basis; the assumptions used in performing the second quarter 2009 impairment calculations were evaluated in light of current market and business conditions. Snap on continues to believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the reporting units projections of future operating results and cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the companys reporting units in an orderly transaction. In the event the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, including goodwill, the company would then perform an additional assessment that would compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill. The determination of implied fair value of goodwill would require management to compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit; if necessary, the company may consult with valuation specialists to assist with the assessment of the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss would be recorded. Snap on also evaluates the recoverability of its indefinite lived trademarks by utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows of each of its trademarks. The future projections, which are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in the companys current and long range operating plans, are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. Significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on expected growth and royalty rates, expected synergies, and a weighted average cost of equity that reflects the specific risk profile of the trademark being tested. The companys methodologies for valuing trademarks are applied consistently on a year over year basis; the assumptions used in performing the second quarter 2009 impairment calculations were evaluated in light of current market and business conditions. Snap on continues to believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the trademarks projected future cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the companys trademarks in an orderly transaction. 50 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Table of Contents Snap on did not recognize any impairment on its goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets in 2009, 2008 or 2007. Inherent in fair value determinations are significant judgments and estimates, including material assumptions about future revenue, profitability and cash flows, the companys operational plans and its interpretation of current economic indicators. Should the operations of the businesses with which goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets are associated incur significant declines in profitability and cash flow due to significant adverse changes in business climate, adverse actions by regulators, unanticipated competition, loss of key customers, and or changes in technology or markets, some or all of the recorded goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets could be subject to impairment and could result in a material adverse effect on Snap ons financial position or results of operations. Snap on completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets in the second quarter of 2009, the results of which did not result in any impairment. Although the company consistently uses the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations, such estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results. In performing its annual impairment testing the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the material assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation models for each of its 11 reporting units. Based on the companys second quarter 2009 impairment testing and assuming a hypothetical 10% decrease in the estimated fair values of each of its 11 reporting units, the hypothetical fair value of each of the companys 11 reporting units would have been greater than its carrying value. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about goodwill and other intangible assets. Impairment of Long lived and Amortized Intangible Assets: Snap on performs impairment evaluations of its long lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives, whenever business conditions or events indicate that those assets may be impaired. When the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying value of the long lived assets, the assets are written down to fair market value and a charge is recorded to current operations. Significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate, adverse actions by regulators, unanticipated competition, loss of key customers and or changes in technology or markets, could require a provision for impairment in a future period. Allowances for Doubtful Accounts: Snap on maintains allowances for doubtful accounts to absorb probable loan losses inherent in its portfolio of receivables. Determination of the allowances requires management to exercise significant judgment about the timing, frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the provision for credit losses and, therefore, net income. Snap on evaluates the collectibility of its receivables based on a combination of various financial and qualitative factors that may affect customers ability to pay. These factors may include customers financial condition, collateral, debt servicing ability, past payment experience and credit bureau information. Snap on does not believe that accounts receivable represent significant concentrations of credit risk because of its diversified portfolio of individual customers and geographical areas. The allowances for doubtful accounts represent managements best estimate of the losses expected from the companys trade accounts, contract and finance receivable portfolios based on ongoing assessments and evaluations of collectibility and historical loss experience. The levels of the allowances are based on many quantitative and qualitative factors including historical loss experience by loan type, portfolio duration, delinquency trends, economic conditions and credit risk quality. Management regularly performs detailed reviews of its portfolios to determine if an impairment has occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowances based on historical and current trends as well as other factors affecting credit losses. Additions to the allowances for doubtful accounts are charged to current period earnings; amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged directly against the allowances, while amounts recovered on previously charged off accounts increase the allowances. If the financial condition of the companys customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional reserves would be required. Excess and Obsolete Inventory: Snap on records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions. Allowances for raw materials are largely based on an analysis of raw material age and actual physical inspection of raw material for fitness for use. As part of evaluating the adequacy of allowances for work in progress and finished goods, management reviews individual product stock keeping units (SKUs) by product category and product life cycle. Cost adjustments for each product category/product life cycle state are generally established and maintained based on a combination of historical experience, forecasted sales and promotions, technological obsolescence, inventory age and other actual known conditions and circumstances. Should actual product marketability and raw material fitness for use be affected by conditions that are different from management estimates, further adjustments to inventory allowances may be required. 2009 ANNUAL REPORT 51 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Pension Benefits: The pension benefit obligation and related pension expense are calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of Snap ons control and can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements. Snap on believes that the two most critical assumptions are (i) the expected return on plan assets; and (ii) the assumed discount rate. Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases. Lowering the expected rate of return assumption for Snap ons domestic pension plan assets by 50 basis points would have increased Snap ons 2009 domestic pension expense by approximately $3.4 million. Snap on uses a three year, market related value asset method of amortizing the difference between actual and expected returns on its U.S. plan assets. The objective of Snap ons discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. In making this determination, the company takes into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans. The methodology for selecting the discount rate as of 2009 year end was to match the plans cash flows to that of a theoretical bond portfolio yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zero coupon bonds with an AA rating or better for each maturity. The selection of the 5.9% weighted average discount rate for Snap ons domestic pension plans represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments. Lowering Snap ons domestic discount rate assumption by 50 basis points would have increased Snap ons 2009 domestic pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately $3.3 million and $45.3 million, respectively. At 2009 year end, Snap ons domestic projected benefit obligation comprised approximately 82% of Snap ons worldwide projected benefit obligation. The weighted average discount rate for Snap ons foreign pension plans of 5.6% represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments. Lowering Snap ons foreign discount rate assumption by 50 basis points would have increased Snap ons 2009 foreign pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately $1.1 million and $16.0 million, respectively. Actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or market related value of assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period of active participants. Prior service costs resulting from plan amendments are amortized in equal annual amounts over the average remaining service period of affected active participants or over the remaining life expectancy of affected retired participants. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on pension plans. Postretirement Benefits: Snap ons postretirement benefits obligation and related expense are calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions, including health care trend rates. An increase of one percentage point in health care costs would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $2.1 million and the combined annual service and interest cost by $0.1 million. A corresponding decrease of one percentage point would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit by $1.9 million and the combined annual service and interest cost by $0.1 million. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on postretirement plans. Income Taxes: Snap on records deferred income tax assets and liabilities for differences between the book basis and tax basis of the related net assets. Snap on records a valuation allowance, when appropriate, to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. While the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. In addition, the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on income taxes. Outlook Snap on believes that it will realize further benefits in 2010 from its RCI, sourcing and other cost reduction initiatives, including approximately $25 million of year over year savings from its 2009 restructuring activities. Snap on also anticipates continuing with its planned strategic investments, including expansion in emerging growth markets. Snap on currently expects to incur approximately $18 million to $22 million of restructuring costs in 2010 primarily to improve the companys cost structure in Europe. In 2010, Snap on expects to incur $5 million per quarter of higher pension expense largely due to the amortization of prior year investment losses related to the companys U.S. pension plan assets. Capital expenditures in 2010 are anticipated to be in a range of $55 million to $60 million. For 2010, Snap on anticipates that its effective income tax rate will approximate 33.5%. In 2010, Snap on intends to continue aggressively managing the balance between investing and capturing growth opportunities with the need for cost reduction actions beyond those already implemented or planned; the challenges of the current global economy make it difficult to presently predict this balance. 52 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Table of Contents Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market, Credit and Economic Risks Market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments. Snap on is exposed to market risk from changes in both foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Snap on monitors its exposure to these risks and attempts to manage the underlying economic exposures through the use of financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts, interest rate swap agreements and treasury lock agreements. Snap on does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Snap ons broad based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole. Snap ons management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. Foreign Currency Risk Management Snap on has significant international operations and is subject to certain risks inherent with foreign operations that include currency fluctuations and restrictions on movement of funds. Foreign exchange risk exists to the extent that Snap on has payment obligations or receipts denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. To manage these exposures, Snap on identifies naturally offsetting positions and then purchases hedging instruments to protect the residual net exposures. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on foreign currency risk management. Interest Rate Risk Management Snap ons interest rate risk management policies are designed to reduce the potential volatility of earnings that could arise from changes in interest rates. Through the use of interest rate swaps, Snap on aims to stabilize funding costs by managing the exposure created by the differing maturities and interest rate structures of Snap ons assets and liabilities. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on interest rate risk management. Snap on utilizes a Value at Risk (VAR) model to determine the potential one day loss in the fair value of its interest rate and foreign exchange sensitive financial instruments from adverse changes in market factors. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. Snap ons computations are based on the inter relationships among movements in various currencies and interest rates (variance/co variance technique). These inter relationships were determined by observing interest rate and foreign currency market changes over the preceding quarter. The estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value, calculated using the VAR model, at 2009 year end was $3.9 million on interest rate sensitive financial instruments and $0.4 million on foreign currency sensitive financial instruments. The VAR model is a risk management tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by Snap on, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors. Credit Risk Credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. Prior to granting credit, each customer is evaluated, taking into consideration the borrowers financial condition, collateral, debt servicing capacity, past payment experience, credit bureau information, and other financial and qualitative factors that may affect the borrowers ability to repay. Specific credit reviews and standard industry credit scoring models are used in performing this evaluation. Loans that have been granted are typically monitored through an asset quality review process that closely monitors past due accounts and initiates collection actions when appropriate. In addition to its direct credit risk exposure, Snap on also has credit risk exposure for certain SOC originated contracts with recourse provisions related to franchisee van loans sold by SOC; at 2009 year end, $17.6 million of franchisee van loans contain a recourse provision to Snap on if the loans become more than 90 days past due. Counterparty Risk Snap on is exposed to credit losses in the event of non performance by the counterparties to various financial agreements, including its foreign exchange, interest rate swap and treasury lock agreements. Snap on does not obtain collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk, but monitors the credit standing of the counterparties and enters into agreements only with financial institution counterparties with a credit rating of A or better. Snap on does not anticipate non performance by its counterparties, but cannot provide assurances. 2009 ANNUAL REPORT 53 Table of Contents Economic Risk Economic risk is the possibility of loss resulting from economic instability in certain areas of the world. Snap on continually monitors its exposure in these markets. As a result of the above market, credit and economic risks, net income and revenues in any particular period may not be representative of full year results and may vary significantly from year to year. Inflation has not had a significant impact on the company. Commodity Risk The company is a purchaser of certain commodities such as steel, natural gas and electricity. The company is also a purchaser of components and parts that are integrated into the companys end products, as well as the purchaser of certain finished goods, all of which may contain various commodities including steel, aluminum and others. Snap ons supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers. The principal raw material used in the manufacture of our products is steel, which we purchase in competitive, price sensitive markets. To meet Snap ons high quality standards, our steel needs range from specialized alloys, which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers, to commodity types of alloys. These raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality. Some of these materials have been, and in the future may be, in short supply. As some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures, we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice. Additionally, unexpected price increases could result in higher prices to our customers or an erosion of the margins on our products. We believe our ability to sell our products is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road, the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles. These factors affect the frequency, type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians, and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians, the prosperity of the technicians and, subsequently, the demand the technicians have for our tools, other products and services, and the value they place on those products and services. To the extent that gasoline prices increase, consumers may turn to other, non gasoline based, methods of transportation, including more frequent use of public transportation. A decrease in the use of gasoline consuming vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for our products. To the extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm pricing agreements with its suppliers, the company may experience margin declines to the extent that it is not able to increase the selling prices of its products.
