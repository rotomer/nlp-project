Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management Overview Unless otherwise indicated, references in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to fiscal 2010 or 2010 refer to the fiscal year ended January 1, 2011; references to fiscal 2009 or 2009 refer to the fiscal year ended January 2, 2010; and references to fiscal 2008 or 2008 refer to the fiscal year ended January 3, 2009. References to 2010, 2009 and 2008 year end refer to January 1, 2011, January 2, 2010, and January 3, 2009, respectively. We believe our 2010 operating performance evidences stabilization in the overall business environment, significant progress on our strategic priorities and continued benefits from our Snap on Value Creation Processes. Considerable progress was made as we continued investing in our strategic growth initiatives aimed at strengthening our business models, pursuing geographic and customer diversification and expanding our presence in emerging markets. In 2010, we maintained a balance between a disciplined operational approach and continued focus on our most important strategic growth initiatives aimed at enhancing the franchisee network, expanding in the vehicle repair garage, extending in critical industries and building in emerging markets. Our global financial services operations serve a significant strategic role in providing financing options for our franchisees customers, our franchisees and customers in other parts of our business. Fiscal 2010 marked the first full year since our U.S. financial services operation, Snap on Credit LLC (SOC), transitioned from a financial services joint venture with CIT Group Inc. (CIT) to a wholly owned subsidiary. Following the July 16, 2009 termination of the financial services operating agreement with CIT, we have been steadily growing our on book finance portfolio and providing financing for the majority of new loans originated by SOC. Going forward, we expect that our financial services businesses, including both SOC and our wholly owned international finance subsidiaries, will be meaningful contributors to our operating earnings. We expect that operating earnings from financial services, which is before interest expense, will continue to improve as the on book finance portfolio grows. We believe that continued advancement of our strategic initiatives will enable us to capitalize on our defined runways for growth and be decisive in creating long term value for our shareholders. Specific opportunities for growth in 2011 include the areas of vehicle repair, critical industries and emerging markets. In vehicle repair, we intend to enhance our mobile tool distribution network by reaching out to more vehicle repair technicians. Similarly, we seek to further penetrate another key customer group within vehicle repair shop owners and managers through direct and distributor channels within our Repair Systems & Information Group. We also expect to continue rolling the Snap on brand out of the garage, providing professional technicians in critical industries, including power generation, oil and gas, aerospace, military, mining, natural resources, alternative energy and education, with a broad range of productivity solutions suited to their unique needs. We also intend to continue investing in emerging markets, including the further expansion of our manufacturing capacity and product offerings in China, India and Eastern Europe. Global market conditions in 2011, including the depth and breadth of the economic recovery, may impact the level and timing of resources deployed in pursuit of these initiatives. Net sales in 2010 of $2,619.2 million increased $256.7 million, or 10.9%, from 2009 levels, with favorable foreign currency translation contributing $14.9 million of the increase. Operating earnings of $331.4 million in 2010 increased $80.7 million from 2009 levels primarily due to higher sales, contributions from ongoing efficiency and productivity (collectively Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI) initiatives and benefits from restructuring actions. Net earnings in 2010 of $186.5 million, or $3.19 per diluted share, increased 39.0% from the $134.2 million, or $2.32 per diluted share, earned in 2009. In the second quarter of 2010, as previously disclosed, we realigned our management organization and, as a result, our reportable business segments. This organizational change reflects our efforts to better support the product and service needs of our primary customer segments, which include: (i) commercial and industrial customers, including professionals in critical industries and emerging markets; (ii) professional technicians who purchase products through our worldwide mobile tool distribution network; and (iii) other professional customers related to vehicle repair, including owners and managers of independent and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) dealership service and repair shops. In addition, our Financial Services customer segment offers financing options that include (i) loans to franchisees customers and our industrial and other customers for the purchase or lease of tools, equipment and diagnostics products on an extended term payment plan; and (ii) business loans and vehicle leases to franchisees. 2010 ANNUAL REPORT 25 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) The primary organizational changes in 2010 included the realignment of our equipment products and equipment repair services operations from the Commercial & Industrial Group to the newly created Repair Systems & Information Group in order to better serve customers in the worldwide vehicle service and repair marketplace, including owners and managers of independent and OEM dealership service and repair shops. In addition to equipment products and equipment repair services, the Repair Systems & Information Group includes the business operations of our former Diagnostics & Information Group, consisting of those operations providing diagnostics, vehicle service information, business management systems, electronic parts catalogs and other solutions for vehicle service to customers in the worldwide vehicle and repair marketplace. The organizational changes also included the realignment of our sales operations in Japan from the Snap on Tools Group to the Commercial & Industrial Group to assist in further penetrating the customer base, particularly industrial buyers, in that region. We also reallocated certain costs between the operating units as a result of these organizational changes, reflecting value added activities and contributions related to the particular customer base being served. Prior year segment financial data was restated to reflect these reportable business segment realignments. As a result of the organizational changes in 2010, our reportable business segments are: (i) the Commercial & Industrial Group; (ii) the Snap on Tools Group; (iii) the Repair Systems & Information Group; and (iv) Financial Services. The Commercial & Industrial Group consists of business operations serving a broad range of industrial and commercial customers worldwide, primarily through direct and distributor channels. The Snap on Tools Group consists of business operations primarily serving automotive service technicians through our worldwide mobile tool distribution channel. The Repair Systems & Information Group consists of business operations serving other professional vehicle repair customers, primarily owners and managers of independent repair shops and OEM dealership service and repair shops, through direct and distributor channels. Financial Services consists of the business operations of our wholly owned finance subsidiaries. In the Commercial & Industrial Group, segment net sales of $1,048.2 million in 2010 increased $150.6 million, or 16.8%, from 2009 levels. Excluding $3.0 million of favorable foreign currency translation, organic (excluding foreign currency translation effects) sales in 2010 increased $147.6 million, or 16.4%, year over year, primarily reflecting higher sales to customers in critical industries and emerging markets. Sales in our European based hand tools business also improved in 2010 from depressed 2009 levels. Operating earnings of $116.9 million in 2010 increased $68.7 million from 2009 levels primarily due to higher sales and favorable manufacturing utilization, lower restructuring costs and $19.7 million of savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives. The Commercial & Industrial Group incurred $5.2 million of restructuring costs in 2010 primarily to improve the segments cost structure in Europe. The Commercial & Industrial Group intends to build on the following strategic priorities in 2011: Continuing to invest in emerging market growth initiatives, including China, India and Eastern Europe; Increasing market share in key industrial market segments by reaching new customers, expanding our business with existing customers, and continually expanding value added product content; Continuing to invest in innovation that delivers productivity enhancing solutions that utilize the latest technology; and Continuing to rationalize the operating footprint and reduce structural costs. In the Snap on Tools Group, segment net sales of $1,039.9 million in 2010 increased $99.8 million, or 10.6%, from 2009 levels; excluding $14.0 million of favorable foreign currency translation, organic sales in 2010 increased $85.8 million, or 9.0%, year over year primarily due to higher sales in the companys U.S. franchise operations. Operating earnings in 2010 of $114.0 million increased $5.8 million from 2009 levels as earnings contributions from higher sales, favorable foreign currency effects and savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives were partially offset by higher year over year last in, first out (LIFO) related inventory valuation expense and higher restructuring costs. The Snap on Tools Group incurred $5.3 million of restructuring costs in 2010 primarily for the mid 2011 consolidation of its North American tool storage manufacturing and distribution operations into its existing tool storage facility in Algona, Iowa. In 2010, the Snap on Tools Group continued to make progress on its fundamental, strategic initiatives to strengthen the group and enhance franchisee profitability and satisfaction. In 2011, the Snap on Tools Group intends to continue building on the progress made in 2010, with specific initiatives focused on the following: Continuing to improve franchisee profitability and satisfaction; Developing new programs to expand market coverage; Continuing to invest in new product innovation and development; and Increasing operational flexibility in back office support functions, manufacturing and the supply chain through RCI initiatives and investment. 26 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Table of Contents By executing in these areas, we believe that we, as well as our franchisees, will continue to serve more customers better and more profitably. In the Repair Systems & Information Group, segment net sales of $847.2 million in 2010 increased $68.4 million, or 8.8%, from 2009 levels; excluding $2.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales in 2010 increased $70.9 million, or 9.1%. The year over year sales increase primarily reflects higher equipment and diagnostics sales to owners and managers of independent repair shops and increased activity with automotive OEM dealerships. Sales in 2010 benefited from the further development and launch of new diagnostics and information products, and the continued expansion of product functionality, content and product integration. These sales increases were partially offset by anticipated lower year over year sales of electronic parts catalogs to OEMs and their franchised dealer networks primarily due to the consolidation of North American automotive dealerships in 2009 and 2010. Operating earnings in 2010 of $164.4 million increased $42.3 million, or 34.6%, from 2009 levels, primarily due to higher sales, $11.4 million of savings from ongoing RCI and other cost reduction initiatives, including savings from cost containment actions, and $4.4 million of lower restructuring costs. The Repair Systems & Information Group intends to focus on the following strategic priorities in 2011: Continuing software and hardware upgrades; Expanding product range with new products and services; Increasing penetration in geographic markets; Leveraging integration of software solutions; Continuing productivity advancements through RCI initiatives and leveraging of resources; and Continuing investment in emerging markets. Financial Services revenue was $62.3 million in 2010 and $58.3 million in 2009; in 2010, originations of $538.2 million increased $40.1 million, or 8.1%, from 2009 levels. Following the July 16, 2009 termination of the financial services operating agreement with CIT, we have been steadily growing our on book finance portfolio and providing financing for the majority of new loans originated by SOC. SOC records the interest yield on the new on book finance portfolio over the life of the contracts as financial services revenue; prior to July 16, 2009, SOC sold substantially all new contract originations to CIT and recorded gains on the sale of the contracts as financial services revenue. At the time of the July 16, 2009 transition, SOC had minimal on book, interest earning assets to offset its infrastructure operating costs. By mid 2010, SOCs on book finance portfolio was generating positive operating earnings. For full year 2010, operating earnings from financial services were $14.4 million, as compared to $17.5 million last year. We expect that operating earnings from financial services, which is before interest expense, will continue to improve as our on book finance portfolio grows. Financial Services intends to focus on the following strategic priorities in 2011: Delivering financial products and services that attract and sustain profitable franchisees; Delivering financial products and services that foster lifetime customer loyalty; Delivering high quality in all of our financial products and processes through the use of RCI initiatives; Delivering additional financial products and services in the United Kingdom and Australia; and Improving overall portfolio performance. Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $140.4 million in 2010 as compared to $347.1 million in 2009. The lower net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 was primarily due to net changes in operating assets and liabilities as a result of higher sales and increased customer demand, including $116.6 million of higher trade, contract and other receivables and $55.2 million of increased inventories. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 also included a fourth quarter 2010 discretionary cash contribution of $48.0 million to the companys domestic pension plans. Net cash used by investing activities of $303.0 million in 2010 included additions to, and collections of, finance receivables of $497.6 million and $245.2 million, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2010 of $51.1 million included continued spending to support the companys strategic growth initiatives, including the expansion of manufacturing capabilities in lower cost regions and emerging growth markets. Capital expenditures in 2010 also included higher levels of efficiency and cost reduction capital investments, including the installation of new production and machine tooling to enhance manufacturing and distribution operations, and increased spending to enhance the companys corporate headquarters and research and development facilities in Kenosha, Wisconsin. 2010 ANNUAL REPORT 27 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $34.8 million in 2010. In December 2010, Snap on issued $250 million of 4.25% unsecured long term notes at a discount; Snap on is using the $247.7 million of proceeds from the sale of these notes, net of $1.6 million of transaction costs, for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, capital expenditures, repayment of all or a portion of the companys $200 million 6.25% unsecured notes maturing on August 15, 2011, the financing of finance and contract receivables related to SOC, and possible acquisitions. In January 2010, Snap on repaid $150 million of floating rate debt upon its maturity with available cash. Cash proceeds received from stock purchase and option plans totaled $23.7 million in 2010; dividends paid to shareholders totaled $71.3 million in 2010. Results of Operations In the second quarter of 2010, as previously disclosed, Snap on realigned its management organization and, as a result, its reportable business segments. This organizational change reflects the companys efforts to better support the product and service needs of the companys primary customer segments. As a result of this realignment, Snap ons reportable business segments are: (i) the Commercial & Industrial Group; (ii) the Snap on Tools Group; (iii) the Repair Systems & Information Group; and (iv) Financial Services. Prior year segment financial data was restated to reflect these reportable business segment realignments. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Segment Results in this Managements Discussion and Analysis for further information on the companys reportable business segments. 2010 vs. 2009 Results of operations for 2010 and 2009 are as follows: (Amounts in millions) 2010 2009 Change Net sales $ 2,619.2 100.0% $ 2,362.5 100.0% $ 256.7 10.9% Cost of goods sold (1,408.1) 53.8% (1,304.9) 55.2% (103.2) 7.9% Gross profit 1,211.1 46.2% 1,057.6 44.8% 153.5 14.5% Operating expenses (894.1) 34.1% (824.4) 34.9% (69.7) 8.5% Operating earnings before financial services 317.0 12.1% 233.2 9.9% 83.8 35.9% Financial services revenue 62.3 100.0% 58.3 100.0% 4.0 6.9% Financial services expenses (47.9) 76.9% (40.8) 70.0% (7.1) 17.4% Operating earnings from financial services 14.4 23.1% 17.5 30.0% (3.1) 17.7% Operating earnings 331.4 12.4% 250.7 10.4% 80.7 32.2% Interest expense (54.8) 2.0% (47.7) 2.0% (7.1) 14.9% Other income (expense) net 0.8 2.3 0.1% (1.5) 65.2% Earnings before income taxes and equity earnings 277.4 10.4% 205.3 8.5% 72.1 35.1% Income tax expense (87.6) 3.3% (62.7) 2.6% (24.9) 39.7% Earnings before equity earnings 189.8 7.1% 142.6 5.9% 47.2 33.1% Equity earnings, net of tax 3.2 0.1% 1.1 2.1 NM Net earnings 193.0 7.2% 143.7 5.9% 49.3 34.3% Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (6.5) 0.2% (9.5) 0.4% 3.0 31.6% Net earnings attributable to Snap on Inc. $ 186.5 7.0% $ 134.2 5.5% $ 52.3 39.0% NM: Not meaningful Percentage Disclosure: All income statement line item percentages below Operating earnings from financial services are calculated as a percentage of the sum of Net sales and Financial services revenue. Net sales in 2010 of $2,619.2 million were up $256.7 million, or 10.9%, from 2009 levels; excluding $14.9 million of favorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased $241.8 million, or 10.2%, from 2009 levels. Snap on has significant international operations and is subject to certain risks inherent with foreign operations, including foreign currency translation fluctuations. 28 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Table of Contents Gross profit in 2010 was $1,211.1 million as compared to $1,057.6 million in 2009. The $153.5 million, or 14.5%, gross profit increase is primarily due to higher sales, $21.6 million of savings from ongoing RCI initiatives, including benefits from restructuring and cost containment actions, $17.5 million of favorable foreign currency effects and $4.7 million of lower restructuring costs. The year over year gross profit comparison also benefited from favorable manufacturing utilization as a result of increased production levels; in 2009, the company incurred costs to carry excess manufacturing capacity, primarily in Europe, as a result of lower demand and inventory reduction efforts. These gross profit increases were partially offset by $10.9 million of lower year over year LIFO related inventory valuation benefits ($1.0 million of LIFO related expense in 2010 and $9.9 million of LIFO related benefits in 2009). The LIFO related inventory benefits in 2009 resulted from inventory reductions, including as a result of increased liquidations and disposals of slow moving and excess inventories, as the company adjusted its production and inventory levels in response to weakened consumer and business demand during the continued global economic downturn. As a result of these factors, gross margin of 46.2% in 2010 increased 140 basis points (100 basis points equals 1.0 percent) from 44.8% in 2009. Operating expenses in 2010 were $894.1 million as compared to $824.4 million in 2009. In addition to higher volume related and other expenses, the $69.7 million increase in year over year operating expenses includes $19.3 million of higher performance based incentive compensation expense, $16.3 million of increased pension expense, largely due to the amortization of investment losses incurred in 2008 related to the companys domestic pension plan assets, $7.5 million of higher stock based, including mark to market, expense and $3.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects. These increases were partially offset by $12.6 million of benefits from ongoing RCI and other cost reduction activities, including benefits from restructuring and cost containment actions, $7.5 million of lower bad debt expense and $2.9 million of lower restructuring costs. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses in 2010 of 34.1% compared to 34.9% in 2009. Operating earnings from Financial Services was $14.4 million on revenue of $62.3 million in 2010, as compared with $17.5 million of operating earnings on revenue of $58.3 million in 2009; the $3.1 million decrease in year over year operating earnings from Financial Services included $0.7 million of favorable foreign currency translation effects. Prior to the July 16, 2009 termination of the financial services operating agreement with CIT, SOC sold substantially all new contract originations to CIT and recorded gains on the sale of the contracts as financial services revenue. Since July 16, 2009, Snap on has been providing financing for the majority of new loans originated by SOC and SOC is recording the interest yield on the new on book finance portfolio over the life of the contracts as financial services revenue. See Notes 1, 2 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on SOC. Consolidated operating earnings in 2010 of $331.4 million increased $80.7 million, or 32.2%, from $250.7 million in 2009, including $14.3 million of favorable foreign currency effects. As a percentage of revenues (net sales plus financial services revenue), operating earnings in 2010 improved 200 basis points to 12.4% as compared to 10.4% in 2009. Interest expense of $54.8 million in 2010 increased $7.1 million from 2009 levels primarily due to higher average debt levels and interest rates. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on Snap ons debt and credit facilities. Other income (expense) net was income of $0.8 million in 2010 as compared to income of $2.3 million in 2009. Other income (expense) net primarily includes interest income as well as hedging and currency exchange rate transaction gains and losses. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on other income (expense) net. Snap ons effective income tax rate on earnings attributable to Snap on was 32.3% in 2010 and 32.0% in 2009. The 2010 effective income tax rate reflects the favorable settlement of certain tax audits. The effective income tax rate in 2009 reflects the favorable resolution of certain tax matters and the impact of increased earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests that are not taxable to Snap on. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on income taxes. 2010 ANNUAL REPORT 29 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Snap on acquired the remaining 40% interest in Wanda Snap on (Zhejiang) Co., Ltd. (Wanda Snap on), the companys tool manufacturing operation in Xiaoshan, China, on April 6, 2010. Snap on acquired the initial 60% interest in Wanda Snap on on March 5, 2008. On July 1, 2010, Wanda Snap on was renamed Snap on Asia Manufacturing (Zhejiang) Co., Ltd. (Xiaoshan). For segment reporting purposes, the results of operations and assets of Xiaoshan, which have been included in Snap ons consolidated financial statements since the March 5, 2008 acquisition date, are included in the Commercial & Industrial Group. The Xiaoshan acquisition is part of the companys ongoing strategic initiatives to further expand its manufacturing presence in emerging growth markets and lower cost regions. Pro forma financial information is not presented as the net effects of the Xiaoshan acquisition were not material to Snap ons results of operations or financial position. Net earnings attributable to Snap on were $186.5 million, or $3.19 per diluted share, in 2010 as compared with $134.2 million, or $2.32 per diluted share, in 2009. Exit and Disposal Activities Snap on recorded costs of $14.2 million for exit and disposal activities in 2010 as compared to $22.0 million of such costs in 2009. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on Snap ons exit and disposal activities. Segment Results Snap ons business segments are based on the organization structure used by management for making operating and investment decisions and for assessing performance. In the second quarter of 2010, Snap on realigned its management organization and, as a result, its reportable business segments. As a result of the organizational changes discussed in Note 17 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, Snap ons reportable business segments are: (i) the Commercial & Industrial Group; (ii) the Snap on Tools Group; (iii) the Repair Systems & Information Group; and (iv) Financial Services. The Commercial & Industrial Group consists of business operations serving a broad range of industrial and commercial customers worldwide, primarily through direct and distributor channels. The Snap on Tools Group consists of business operations primarily serving automotive service technicians through the companys worldwide mobile tool distribution channel. The Repair Systems & Information Group consists of business operations serving other professional vehicle repair customers, primarily owners and managers of independent repair shops and OEM dealership service and repair shops, through direct and distributor channels. Financial Services consists of the business operations of Snap ons wholly owned finance subsidiaries. Snap on evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment revenues, including both external and intersegment net sales, and segment operating earnings. Snap on accounts for intersegment sales and transfers based primarily on standard costs with reasonable mark ups established between the segments. Identifiable assets by segment are those assets used in the respective reportable segments operations. Corporate assets consist of cash and cash equivalents (excluding cash held at Financial Services), deferred income taxes, pension assets and certain other assets. All significant intersegment amounts are eliminated to arrive at Snap ons consolidated financial results. Commercial & Industrial Group (Amounts in millions) 2010 2009 Change External net sales $ 891.3 85.0% $ 789.9 88.0% $ 101.4 12.8% Intersegment net sales 156.9 15.0% 107.7 12.0% 49.2 45.7% Segment net sales 1,048.2 100.0% 897.6 100.0% 150.6 16.8% Cost of goods sold (662.7) 63.2% (592.9) 66.1% (69.8) 11.8% Gross profit 385.5 36.8% 304.7 33.9% 80.8 26.5% Operating expenses (268.6) 25.6% (256.5) 28.5% (12.1) 4.7% Segment operating earnings $ 116.9 11.2% $ 48.2 5.4% $ 68.7 142.5% Segment net sales of $1,048.2 million in 2010 increased $150.6 million, or 16.8%, from 2009 levels. Excluding $3.0 million of favorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased $147.6 million, or 16.4%, reflecting higher sales to customers in critical industries (including natural resources, power generation, oil and gas, aerospace and military) and emerging growth markets, increased sales in the segments European based hand tools business, and higher sales of power and specialty tools. 30 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Table of Contents Segment gross profit of $385.5 million in 2010 was up $80.8 million, or 26.5%, from 2009 levels. The $80.8 million gross profit increase is primarily due to higher sales and favorable manufacturing utilization as a result of increased production levels; in 2009, the segment incurred costs to carry excess manufacturing capacity, primarily in Europe, as a result of lower production and inventory reduction efforts. The year over year gross profit comparison also benefited from $15.3 million of savings from ongoing RCI and other cost reduction activities, including benefits from restructuring and cost containment actions, $6.3 million of lower restructuring costs and $2.8 million of favorable foreign currency effects. As a result of these factors, gross margin of 36.8% in 2010 improved 290 basis points from 33.9% last year. Operating expenses of $268.6 million in 2010 increased $12.1 million from 2009 levels primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses and $1.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects. These operating expense increases were partially offset by $4.4 million of savings from ongoing restructuring and other cost reduction and cost containment initiatives, and $1.0 million of lower restructuring costs. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses in 2010 improved 290 basis points to 25.6% from 28.5% last year. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings of $116.9 million in 2010 increased $68.7 million from 2009 levels, including $1.3 million from favorable foreign currency effects. As a percentage of segment net sales, operating earnings for the Commercial & Industrial Group increased 580 basis points from 5.4% in 2009 to 11.2% in 2010. Snap on Tools Group (Amounts in millions) 2010 2009 Change Segment net sales $ 1,039.9 100.0% $ 940.1 100.0% $ 99.8 10.6% Cost of goods sold (604.3) 58.1% (532.7) 56.7% (71.6) 13.4% Gross profit 435.6 41.9% 407.4 43.3% 28.2 6.9% Operating expenses (321.6) 30.9% (299.2) 31.8% (22.4) 7.5% Segment operating earnings $ 114.0 11.0% $ 108.2 11.5% $ 5.8 5.4% Segment net sales of $1,039.9 million in 2010 increased $99.8 million, or 10.6%, from 2009 levels. Excluding $14.0 million of favorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased $85.8 million, or 9.0%, year over year, including a 10.4% sales increase in the United States and a 5.3% increase in the companys international franchise operations. Segment gross profit of $435.6 million in 2010 increased $28.2 million, or 6.9%, from 2009 levels. The $28.2 million gross profit increase is primarily due to higher sales and favorable manufacturing utilization as a result of increased production levels, $15.0 million of favorable foreign currency effects and $1.7 million of savings from ongoing restructuring initiatives. These increases were partially offset by $10.9 million of lower year over year LIFO related inventory valuation benefits ($1.0 million of LIFO related expense in 2010 and $9.9 million of LIFO related benefits in 2009) and $4.7 million of higher restructuring costs. The LIFO related inventory benefits in 2009 resulted from inventory reductions, including as a result of increased liquidations and disposals of slow moving and excess inventories, as the segment adjusted its production and inventory levels in response to weakened consumer and business demand during the continued global economic downturn. The $4.7 million of higher restructuring costs primarily reflects initial costs for the expected mid 2011 closure of Snap ons Newmarket, Canada, tool storage manufacturing facility. Snap on expects to phase out production at the Newmarket facility and consolidate its North American tool storage manufacturing and distribution operations into its existing tool storage facility in Algona, Iowa. The year over year gross profit comparison was also impacted by $2.4 million of lower warranty expense in 2009 due to favorable historic warranty trend rates. As a percentage of sales, gross margin was 41.9% in 2010 as compared to 43.3% last year. Operating expenses of $321.6 million in 2010 increased $22.4 million from 2009 levels primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses, including higher costs as a result of increased participation at the annual Snap on Franchisee Conference and higher costs associated with the development of a new and expanded product catalog that was deferred from 2009 into 2010. The year over year operating expense increase also includes $3.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and $1.3 million of higher stock based expense related to the franchisee stock purchase plan. These operating expense increases were partially offset by $1.4 million of savings from ongoing cost reduction and cost containment initiatives, $1.4 million of lower bad debt expense and $0.6 million of lower restructuring costs. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses in 2010 improved 90 basis points to 30.9% from 31.8% last year. 2010 ANNUAL REPORT 31 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap on Tools Group of $114.0 million in 2010 increased $5.8 million from 2009 levels, including $11.7 million from favorable foreign currency effects. As a percentage of segment net sales, operating earnings for the Snap on Tools Group of 11.0% in 2010 declined 50 basis points from 11.5% in 2009.

Excluding $2.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased $70.9 million, or 9.1%, year over year primarily due to higher worldwide sales of equipment, increased essential tool and facilitation program activity with automotive OEM dealerships, and higher sales of diagnostics and Mitchell1 information products. These sales increases were partially offset by anticipated lower year over year sales of electronic parts catalogs to OEMs and their franchised dealer networks primarily due to the consolidation of North American automotive dealerships in 2009 and 2010. Segment gross profit of $390.0 million in 2010 increased $44.5 million, or 12.9%, from 2009 levels. As a percentage of sales, gross margin improved 160 basis points from 44.4% in 2009 to 46.0% in 2010. The $44.5 million gross profit increase primarily reflects higher sales, $4.6 million of benefits from ongoing RCI, restructuring and other cost reduction and cost containment initiatives, $3.6 million of savings from material cost reductions and $3.1 million of lower restructuring costs. The gross profit comparison also benefited from favorable year over year manufacturing utilization as a result of increased production levels. Operating expenses of $225.6 million in 2010 increased $2.2 million from 2009 levels as higher volume related, product development and other expenses were partially offset by $6.8 million of savings from ongoing RCI, restructuring and other cost reduction and cost containment initiatives, $1.3 million of lower restructuring costs and $0.9 million of favorable foreign currency effects. The operating expense comparison also benefited from $5.4 million of lower year over year bad debt expense; in 2009, the segment incurred higher bad debt expense primarily related to increased credit exposure at North American automotive dealerships. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses in 2010 improved 210 basis points to 26.6% from 28.7% last year. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings of $164.4 million in 2010 increased $42.3 million, or 34.6%, from 2009 levels, including $0.6 million from favorable foreign currency effects. As a percentage of segment net sales, operating earnings for the Repair Systems & Information Group increased 370 basis points from 15.7% in 2009 to 19.4% in 2010.

Originations of $538.2 million in 2010 increased $40.1 million, or 8.1%, from 2009 levels. Since the July 16, 2009 termination of the financial services operating agreement with CIT, Snap on has been providing financing for the majority of new loans originated by SOC and SOC is recording the interest yield on the new on book receivables over the life of the contracts as financial services revenue. Prior to July 16, 2009, SOC sold substantially all new contract originations to CIT and recorded gains on the sale of the contracts as financial services revenue. The $3.1 million decrease in year over year operating earnings from Financial Services included $0.7 million of favorable foreign currency effects. See Notes 1, 2 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on SOC. 32 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Table of Contents Corporate Snap ons general corporate expenses of $78.3 million in 2010 increased $33.0 million from $45.3 million in 2009 primarily due to $17.3 million of increased performance based incentive compensation expense, $16.3 million of higher pension expense, largely due to the amortization of investment losses incurred in 2008 related to the companys domestic pension plan assets, and $6.2 million of higher stock based, including mark to market, expense. These year over year expense increases were partially offset by $8.0 million of savings primarily from ongoing cost containment and other actions.

line item percentages below Operating earnings from financial services are calculated as a percentage of the sum of Net sales and Financial services revenue. Net sales in the fourth quarter of 2010 of $696.9 million were up $78.8 million, or 12.7%, from 2009 levels; excluding $4.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales in the quarter increased $83.3 million, or 13.6%, from 2009 levels. Snap on has significant international operations and is subject to certain risks inherent with foreign operations, including foreign currency translation fluctuations. Gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2010 was $318.5 million as compared to $284.4 million in 2009. The $34.1 million gross profit increase is primarily due to higher sales, favorable manufacturing utilization as a result of increased production levels and $3.6 million of savings from ongoing RCI and other cost reduction activities, including benefits from restructuring actions. These gross profit increases were partially offset by $6.5 million of lower year over year LIFO related inventory valuation benefits ($0.2 million of LIFO related benefits in 2010 and $6.7 million of LIFO related benefits in 2009) and $1.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects. The higher LIFO related inventory benefits in 2009 resulted from inventory reductions, including as a result of increased liquidations and disposals of slow moving and excess inventories, as the company adjusted its production and inventory levels in response to weakened consumer and business demand during the continued global economic downturn. In the fourth quarter of 2010, restructuring costs included in gross profit totaled $4.4 million as compared to $5.2 million last year. As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 45.7% in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to 46.0% in 2009. 2010 ANNUAL REPORT 37 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2010 were $231.0 million as compared to $213.2 million in 2009. The $17.8 million increase in year over year operating expenses is primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses, $4.1 million of higher pension expense, largely due to the amortization of investment losses incurred in 2008 related to the companys domestic pension plan assets, $3.8 million of increased performance based incentive compensation expense and $1.7 million of higher stock based (mark to market) expense. These operating expense increases were partially offset by $4.9 million of lower bad debt expense, $2.5 million of benefits from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives and $1.6 million of favorable foreign currency effects. In the fourth quarter, restructuring costs included in operating expenses totaled $1.4 million as compared to $1.5 million last year. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2010 improved 140 basis points to 33.1% as compared to 34.5% in 2009. Operating earnings from Financial Services was $9.4 million on revenue of $21.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, as compared with an operating loss of $3.8 million on revenue of $6.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The year over year increase in both revenue and operating earnings primarily reflects the growth in SOCs on book finance portfolio following the July 16, 2009 termination of the financial services operating agreement with CIT. See Notes 1, 2 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on SOC. Consolidated operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2010 of $96.9 million increased $29.5 million, or 43.8%, from $67.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, including $13.2 million of higher year over year operating earnings from financial services and $0.3 million from favorable foreign currency effects. As a percentage of revenues (net sales plus financial services revenue), operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2010 improved 270 basis points to 13.5% as compared to 10.8% last year. Interest expense of $14.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 decreased $0.6 million from the comparable prior year period primarily due to lower average debt levels, partially offset by higher average interest rates. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on Snap ons debt and credit facilities. Other income (expense) net was income of $0.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 as compared to income of $1.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Other income (expense) net primarily includes interest income and hedging and currency exchange rate transaction gains and losses. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on other income (expense) net. Snap ons effective income tax rate on earnings attributable to Snap on was 30.1% in the fourth quarter of 2010 and 31.4% in the fourth quarter of 2009. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on income taxes. Net earnings attributable to Snap on in the fourth quarter of 2010 were $57.9 million, or $0.99 per diluted share, as compared with $36.6 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2009.

Excluding $1.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased 15.4%. 38 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Table of Contents Segment gross profit of $108.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 was up $23.9 million, or 28.4%, from 2009 levels. The $23.9 million gross profit increase is primarily due to higher sales, $4.8 million of lower restructuring costs and $3.1 million of savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives. The year over year gross profit comparison also benefited from favorable manufacturing utilization as a result of increased production levels; in the fourth quarter of 2009, the segment incurred costs to carry excess manufacturing capacity, primarily in Europe, as a result of lower production and inventory reduction efforts. As a result of these factors, gross margin of 38.4% for the fourth quarter of 2010 increased 420 basis points from 34.2% in the fourth quarter of 2009. Operating expenses of $72.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 were up $5.3 million from 2009 levels primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses, partially offset by $0.6 million of favorable foreign currency effects. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2010 improved 160 basis points to 25.8% from 27.4% last year. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings of $35.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 increased $18.6 million from 2009 levels, including $0.4 million from favorable foreign currency effects. As a percentage of segment net sales, operating earnings for the Commercial & Industrial Group increased 580 basis points from 6.8% in the fourth quarter of 2009 to 12.6% in the fourth quarter of 2010.

Excluding $0.7 million of favorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased $30.5 million, or 12.8%, year over year, including a 15.2% sales increase in the United States and a 6.7% sales increase in the companys international franchise operations. Segment gross profit of $107.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to $107.4 million last year. Gross profit contributions from higher sales in 2010 were more than offset by $6.5 million of lower year over year LIFO related inventory valuation benefits ($0.2 million of LIFO related benefits in 2010 and $6.7 million of LIFO related benefits in 2009) and $4.6 million of higher restructuring costs. The higher LIFO related inventory benefits in 2009 resulted from inventory reductions, including as a result of increased liquidations and disposals of slow moving and excess inventories, as the segment adjusted its production and inventory levels in response to weakened consumer and business demand during the continued global economic downturn. The $4.6 million of higher restructuring costs primarily reflects initial costs for the expected mid 2011 closure of Snap ons Newmarket, Canada, tool storage manufacturing facility. Snap on expects to phase out production at the Newmarket facility and consolidate its North American tool storage manufacturing and distribution operations into its existing tool storage facility in Algona, Iowa. As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 40.0% in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to 45.3% in the fourth quarter of 2009. Operating expenses of $81.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 increased $7.1 million from 2009 levels primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses, partially offset by $0.7 million of lower bad debt expense and $0.1 million of lower restructuring costs. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2010 improved 90 basis points to 30.4% from 31.3% last year. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap on Tools Group of $25.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 declined $7.3 million from 2009 levels, including $0.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects. As a percentage of segment net sales, operating earnings for the Snap on Tools Group of 9.6% in the fourth quarter of 2010 declined from 14.0% in the fourth quarter of 2009. 2010 ANNUAL REPORT 39 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Repair Systems & Information Group Fourth Quarter (Amounts in millions) 2010 2009 Change External net sales $ 190.6 82.2% $ 165.7 82.1% $ 24.9 15.0% Intersegment net sales 41.2 17.8% 36.1 17.9% 5.1 14.1% Segment net sales 231.8 100.0% 201.8 100.0% 30.0 14.9% Cost of goods sold (128.5) 55.4% (108.9) 54.0% (19.6) 18.0% Gross profit 103.3 44.6% 92.9 46.0% 10.4 11.2% Operating expenses (57.6) 24.9% (57.9) 28.7% 0.3 0.5% Segment operating earnings $ 45.7 19.7% $ 35.0 17.3% $ 10.7 30.6% Segment net sales of $231.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 increased $30.0 million, or 14.9%, from 2009 levels. Excluding $3.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased $33.3 million, or 16.8%, year over year, reflecting increased sales to repair shop owners and managers, including higher sales of undercar equipment, diagnostics and Mitchell1 information products, as well as increased facilitation program activity with automotive OEM dealerships. Segment gross profit of $103.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 increased $10.4 million, or 11.2%, from 2009 levels. As a percentage of sales, gross margin decreased 140 basis points from 46.0% in the fourth quarter of 2009 to 44.6% in the fourth quarter of 2010 primarily due to a shift in sales mix that included higher sales of lower margin essential tool and facilitation program sales to OEM dealerships. The $10.4 million gross profit increase primarily reflects higher sales, contributions from favorable manufacturing utilization as a result of increased production levels, $0.6 million of lower restructuring costs and $0.5 million of benefits from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives. These year over year gross profit increases were partially offset by $1.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses of $57.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 decreased $0.3 million from 2009 levels as higher volume related, product development and other expenses were more than offset by $2.2 million of savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives and $1.1 million of favorable foreign currency effects. The operating expense comparison also benefited from $3.6 million of lower year over year bad debt expense; in 2009, the segment incurred higher bad debt expense primarily related to increased credit exposure at North American automotive dealerships. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2010 improved 380 basis points to 24.9% from 28.7% last year. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings of $45.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 increased $10.7 million from 2009 levels. As a percentage of segment net sales, operating earnings for the Repair Systems & Information Group increased 240 basis points from 17.3% in the fourth quarter of 2009 to 19.7% in the fourth quarter of 2010.

The year over year increase in both revenue and operating earnings primarily reflects the growth in SOCs on book finance portfolio following the July 16, 2009 termination of the financial services operating agreement with CIT. Originations of $141.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 increased 7.5% from comparable prior year levels. The $13.2 million increase in year over year operating earnings from Financial Services included $0.1 million of favorable foreign currency effects. See Notes 1, 2 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on SOC. 40 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Table of Contents Corporate Snap ons general corporate expenses of $19.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 increased $5.7 million from $13.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily due to $4.5 million of increased performance based incentive compensation expense, $4.1 million of higher pension expense, largely due to the amortization of investment losses incurred in 2008 related to the companys domestic pension plan assets, and $1.7 million of higher stock based, including mark to market, expense. These year over year expense increases were partially offset by $4.6 million of savings primarily from ongoing cost containment and other actions. 2009 vs. 2008 Results of operations for 2009 and 2008 are as follows: (Amounts in millions) 2009 2008 Change Net sales $ 2,362.5 100.0% $ 2,853.3 100.0% $ (490.8) 17.2% Cost of goods sold (1,304.9) 55.2% (1,568.7) 55.0% 263.8 16.8% Gross profit 1,057.6 44.8% 1,284.6 45.0% (227.0) 17.7% Operating expenses (824.4) 34.9% (933.1) 32.7% 108.7 11.6% Operating earnings before financial services 233.2 9.9% 351.5 12.3% (118.3) 33.7% Financial services revenue 58.3 100.0% 81.4 100.0% (23.1) 28.4% Financial services expenses (40.8) 70.0% (44.1) 54.2% 3.3 7.5% Operating earnings from financial services 17.5 30.0% 37.3 45.8% (19.8) 53.1% Operating earnings 250.7 10.4% 388.8 13.2% (138.1) 35.5% Interest expense (47.7) 2.0% (33.8) 1.1% (13.9) 41.1% Other income (expense) net 2.3 0.1% 2.8 0.1% (0.5) 17.9% Earnings before income taxes and equity earnings 205.3 8.5% 357.8 12.2% (152.5) 42.6% Income tax expense (62.7) 2.6% (117.8) 4.0% 55.1 46.8% Earnings before equity earnings 142.6 5.9% 240.0 8.2% (97.4) 40.6% Equity earnings, net of tax 1.1 3.6 0.1% (2.5) 69.4% Net earnings 143.7 5.9% 243.6 8.3% (99.9) 41.0% Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (9.5) 0.4% (6.9) 0.2% (2.6) 37.7% Net earnings attributable to Snap on Inc. $ 134.2 5.5% $ 236.7 8.1% $ (102.5) 43.3% Percentage Disclosure: All income statement line item percentages below Operating earnings from financial services are calculated as a percentage of the sum of Net sales and Financial services revenue. Snap ons 2009 fiscal year contained 52 weeks of operating results; Snap ons 2008 fiscal year contained 53 weeks of operating results. The impact of the additional week in 2008, which occurred in the fourth quarter, was not material to Snap ons 2008 net sales or operating earnings. Net sales in 2009 of $2,362.5 million were down $490.8 million, or 17.2%, from 2008 levels. Excluding $98.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales in 2009 declined 14.2% from 2008 levels. Snap on has significant international operations and is subject to certain risks inherent with foreign operations, including foreign currency translation fluctuations. The year over year sales comparison was significantly impacted by weakened consumer and business demand as customers curtailed spending in response to the global recession that continued throughout 2009. 2010 ANNUAL REPORT 41 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Gross profit in 2009 was $1,057.6 million as compared to $1,284.6 million in 2008. The $227.0 million decline in year over year gross profit is primarily due to the lower sales and costs to carry manufacturing capacity, mainly in Europe, in light of lower demand and inventory reduction efforts. The decline in 2009 gross profit also included $54.0 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, $13.4 million of higher restructuring costs, primarily to improve the companys cost structure in Europe, and $5.7 million of higher software development costs. These declines were partially offset by $54.6 million of savings from ongoing RCI and other cost reduction initiatives, including benefits from restructuring, material cost reductions, and savings from cost containment actions in light of the weakened economy. Year over year LIFO related inventory valuation benefits as a result of inventory reductions in 2009 were largely offset by the effects of increased liquidations and disposals of slow moving and excess inventories. As a result of these factors, gross profit margin of 44.8% in 2009 declined 20 basis points from 45.0% in 2008. Operating expenses in 2009 were $824.4 million as compared to $933.1 million in 2008. The $108.7 million reduction in year over year operating expenses primarily resulted from $66.0 million of benefits from ongoing RCI, restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives, including savings from cost containment actions in light of the weakened economy, $28.2 million of favorable foreign currency effects, $20.1 million of lower performance based incentive compensation expense and $6.3 million of lower restructuring costs. These declines were partially offset by $11.5 million of higher bad debt expense, including as a result of increased credit exposure at North American automotive dealerships. In addition, operating expenses in 2009 included $12.0 million of increased pension expense primarily due to the amortization of investment losses incurred in 2008 related to the companys domestic pension plan assets. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses were 34.9% in 2009 as compared to 32.7% in 2008. Operating earnings from financial services was $17.5 million on $58.3 million of revenue in 2009, as compared with operating earnings of $37.3 million on $81.4 million of revenue in 2008. On July 16, 2009, Snap on terminated its financial services operating agreement with CIT and subsequently purchased CITs 50% ownership interest in SOC. Since July 16, 2009, Snap on has been providing financing for the majority of new loans originated by SOC and SOC is recording the interest yield on the new on book receivables over the life of the contracts as financial services revenue. Previously, SOC sold new contract originations to CIT and recorded gains on the sale of the contracts as financial services revenue. The change from recognizing gains on contract sales to CIT, to recognizing the interest yield on the on book receivables, was a primary factor in the year over year declines in both revenues and operating earnings. See Notes 1, 2 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Consolidated operating earnings in 2009 of $250.7 million declined $138.1 million, or 35.5%, from $388.8 million in 2008. In addition to the impact from lower sales, the year over year decrease in operating earnings was primarily due to $27.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, $19.8 million of lower operating earnings from financial services and $7.3 million of higher restructuring costs. As a percentage of revenues (net sales plus financial services revenue), operating earnings in 2009 of 10.4% compared to 13.2% in 2008. Interest expense of $47.7 million in 2009 increased $13.9 million from the prior year primarily due to higher debt levels as a result of the issuance of $550 million of fixed rate, long term notes in 2009. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on Snap ons debt and credit facilities. Other income (expense) net was income of $2.3 million in 2009 as compared to income of $2.8 million in 2008. Other income (expense) net primarily included interest income and hedging and currency exchange rate transaction gains and losses. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on other income (expense) net. Snap ons effective income tax rate on earnings attributable to Snap on was 32.0% in 2009 and 33.6% in 2008. The lower effective tax rate in 2009 is primarily due to higher realization of tax credits and a reduction of tax contingency reserves, partially offset by an unfavorable mix of foreign earnings. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on income taxes. Net earnings attributable to Snap on in 2009 were $134.2 million, or $2.32 per diluted share, as compared to net earnings attributable to Snap on of $236.7 million, or $4.07 per diluted share, in 2008. Exit and Disposal Activities Snap on recorded costs of $22.0 million for exit and disposal activities in 2009 as compared to $14.7 million of such costs in 2008. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on Snap ons exit and disposal activities. 42 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Table of Contents Segment Results The following discussion reflects the 2010 realignment of the companys segments, as discussed above.

Excluding $43.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales declined 19.3% year over year primarily as a result of the economic downturn that particularly affected sales volumes in various European markets in 2009. Segment gross profit of $304.7 million in 2009 was down $157.0 million, or 34.0%, from 2008 levels. The $157.0 million decline in year over year gross profit is primarily due to the lower sales and costs to carry manufacturing capacity, mainly in Europe, in light of lower demand and inventory reduction efforts. The decline in 2009 gross profit also included $13.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, $11.7 million of higher restructuring costs primarily to improve the segments cost structure in Europe, and $4.1 million of inflationary cost increases. These declines were partially offset by benefits of $20.7 million from ongoing RCI, restructuring and other cost reduction and cost containment initiatives, including $5.2 million of material cost reductions. Operating expenses of $256.5 million in 2009 were down $54.3 million from 2008 levels primarily due to $18.1 million of savings from ongoing RCI, restructuring and other cost reduction and cost containment initiatives, lower volume related and other expenses, and $12.8 million of favorable foreign currency effects. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses in 2009 of 28.5% compared to 26.8% in 2008. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings for the Commercial & Industrial Group of $48.2 million in 2009 declined $102.7 million from 2008 levels and, as a percentage of segment net sales, declined from 13.1% in 2008 to 5.4% in 2009. The $102.7 million decrease in year over year operating earnings included $0.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects.

Excluding $29.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales declined 7.5% year over year. U.S. sales in the Snap on Tools Group declined 9.5% year over year, while organic sales in the companys international franchise operations were down slightly. As of 2009 year end, van count in the United States was up slightly compared to both October 3, 2009, and year end 2008 levels. 2010 ANNUAL REPORT 43 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Segment gross profit of $407.4 million in 2009 decreased $31.0 million, or 7.1%, from 2008 levels. As a percentage of sales, gross profit margin in 2009 improved to 43.3% as compared to 41.9% last year. In addition to the lower sales and costs to carry manufacturing capacity in light of lower demand and inventory reduction efforts, gross profit in 2009 was also affected by $28.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects. These declines in gross profit were partially offset by $16.5 million of savings from material and other cost reduction initiatives, including savings from cost containment actions, and $1.1 million of lower restructuring costs. Year over year LIFO related inventory valuation benefits of $14.6 million ($9.9 million of LIFO related benefits in 2009 and $4.7 million of LIFO related expense in 2008) as a result of inventory reductions in 2009 were largely offset by the effects of increased liquidations and disposals of slow moving and excess inventories. Operating expenses of $299.2 million in 2009 declined $24.2 million from prior year levels primarily due to $27.0 million of benefits from RCI and other cost reduction and cost containment initiatives, lower volume related and other expenses, $7.0 million of favorable foreign currency effects and $4.6 million of lower restructuring costs. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses in 2009 of 31.8% compared to 30.9% in 2008. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings for the Snap on Tools Group of $108.2 million in 2009 decreased $6.8 million from 2008 levels; however, as a percentage of segment net sales, operating earnings in 2009 improved from 11.0% in 2008 to 11.5% in 2009. The $6.8 million decrease in year over year operating earnings included $21.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects.

Excluding $30.0 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales declined 15.1% year over year primarily due to lower essential tool and facilitation program sales to OEM dealerships and lower equipment sales. Segment gross profit of $345.5 million in 2009 decreased $39.0 million, or 10.1%, from 2008 levels; however, as a percentage of segment net sales, gross profit margin in 2009 improved to 44.4% as compared to 40.6% in 2008. The $39.0 million decrease in year over year gross profit primarily reflects the impacts of lower sales and costs to carry manufacturing capacity, mainly in Europe, in light of lower demand and inventory reduction efforts, $12.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and $6.2 million of higher software development costs. These declines in gross profit were partially offset by contributions from a more favorable sales mix of higher margin diagnostics and software products, and $17.4 million of savings from ongoing RCI and other cost reduction initiatives, including savings from cost containment actions. Operating expenses of $223.4 million were down $29.1 million from 2008 levels primarily due to $20.9 million of savings from RCI and other cost containment actions, $8.4 million of favorable foreign currency effects, and lower volume related and other expenses. These declines in operating expenses were partially offset by $4.6 million of higher bad debt expense in 2009 primarily related to increased credit exposure at North American automotive dealerships. The year over year operating expense comparison was also impacted by the adjustment of a pre acquisition contingency acquired with Snap on Business Solutions that reduced 2008 operating expenses by $5.4 million. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses in 2009 of 28.7% compared to 26.7% in 2008. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings for the Repair Systems & Information Group of $122.1 million in 2009 decreased $9.9 million from 2008 levels. As a percentage of segment net sales, operating earnings improved from 13.9% in 2008 to 15.7% in 2009. The $9.9 million decrease in year over year operating earnings included $3.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects. 44 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Table of Contents Financial Services (Amounts in millions) 2009 2008 Change Financial services revenue $ 58.3 100.0% $ 81.4 100.0% $ (23.1) 28.4% Financial services expenses (40.8) 70.0% (44.1) 54.2% 3.3 7.5% Segment operating earnings $ 17.5 30.0% $ 37.3 45.8% $ (19.8) 53.1% Segment operating earnings were $17.5 million on $58.3 million of revenue in 2009, as compared with $37.3 million of operating earnings on $81.4 million of revenue in 2008.

Snap on believes that its cash from operations, coupled with its sources of borrowings and available cash on hand, are sufficient to fund its currently anticipated requirements for scheduled debt repayments, loans originated by SOC, working capital, capital expenditures, restructuring activities, acquisitions, the funding of pension plans, common stock repurchases and dividend payments. Due to Snap ons credit rating over the years, external funds have been available at a reasonable cost. As of the close of business on February 11, 2011, Snap ons long term debt and commercial paper was rated Baa1 and P 2 by Moodys Investors Service and A and A 2 by Standard & Poors. Snap on believes that its current credit arrangements are sound and that the strength of its balance sheet affords the company the financial flexibility to respond to both internal growth opportunities and those available through acquisitions. Snap on cannot provide any assurances of the availability of future financing or the terms on which it might be available, or that its debt ratings may not decrease. The following discussion focuses on information included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of 2010 year end, working capital (current assets less current liabilities) of $884.4 million decreased $51.8 million from $936.2 million at 2009 year end. The following represents the companys working capital position as of 2010 and 2009 year end: (Amounts in millions) 2010 2009 Cash and cash equivalents $ 572.2 $ 699.4 Trade and other accounts receivable net 443.3 414.4 Finance receivables net 215.3 122.3 Contract receivables net 45.6 32.9 Inventories net 329.4 274.7 Other current assets 159.7 132.4 Total current assets 1,765.5 1,676.1 Notes payable and current maturities of long term debt (216.0) (164.7) Accounts payable (146.1) (119.8) Other current liabilities (519.0) (455.4) Total current liabilities (881.1) (739.9) Total working capital $ 884.4 $ 936.2 Cash and cash equivalents as of 2010 year end totaled $572.2 million as compared to $699.4 million at the end of 2009. The $127.2 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents is primarily due to the funding of new loans originated by SOC, the January 2010 repayment of $150 million of floating rate debt upon its maturity and the fourth quarter 2010 funding of a $48.0 million discretionary cash contribution to the companys domestic pension plans. These decreases to cash and cash equivalents were partially offset by $247.7 million of proceeds, net of $1.6 million of transaction costs, from the December 2010 issuance of $250 million of unsecured 4.25% long term notes at a discount; Snap on is using the proceeds from the sale of these notes for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, capital expenditures, repayment of all or a portion of the companys $200 million of 6.25% unsecured notes maturing on August 15, 2011, the financing of finance and contract receivables related to SOC, and possible acquisitions. Trade and other accounts receivable net as of 2010 year end of $443.3 million increased $28.9 million from 2009 year end levels. Excluding $6.5 million of foreign currency translation impacts, trade and other accounts receivable net increased $35.4 million from 2009 levels primarily due to higher sales. Days sales outstanding (year end trade and other accounts receivable net divided by full year sales, times 360 days) at 2010 year end was 61 days as compared to 63 days at 2009 year end. 2010 ANNUAL REPORT 47 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) The current portions of net finance and contract receivables as of 2010 year end totaled $260.9 million as compared to $155.2 million last year. The long term portions of net finance and contract receivables as of 2010 year end totaled $465.0 million as compared to $248.6 million last year. The combined $322.1 million increase in net current and long term finance and contract receivables over year end 2009 levels is primarily due to the growth of the companys on balance sheet finance portfolio following the July 16, 2009 termination of the financial services joint venture agreement with CIT. Since July 16, 2009, Snap on has been providing financing for the majority of new finance and contract receivables originated by SOC and the related receivables are included on the companys balance sheet; prior to July 16, 2009, SOC sold most of its loan originations to CIT. Inventories of $329.4 million as of 2010 year end increased $54.7 million from 2009 levels; excluding foreign currency translation impacts, inventories increased $55.6 million from 2009 year end levels primarily due to increased production to support higher customer demand. Inventory turns (trailing 12 months of cost of goods sold, divided by the average of the beginning and ending inventory balance for the trailing 12 months) were 4.7 turns and 4.1 turns as of 2010 and 2009 year end, respectively. Inventories accounted for using the first in, first out (FIFO) method as of 2010 and 2009 year end approximated 64% and 66% of total inventories, respectively. All other inventories are accounted for using the LIFO method. The companys LIFO reserve was $68.4 million at both 2010 and 2009 year end. Notes payable and current maturities of long term debt of $216.0 million as of 2010 year end included $200 million of unsecured 6.25% notes that mature on August 15, 2011, and $16.0 million of other notes. Notes payable and current maturities of long term debt of $164.7 million as of 2009 year end included $150 million of unsecured floating rate debt that matured, and was repaid with available cash, on January 12, 2010, and $14.7 million of other notes. As of 2009 year end, the $200 million of unsecured notes that mature on August 15, 2011, were included in Long term debt on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as their scheduled maturity was in excess of one year of the 2009 year end balance sheet date. Accounts payable as of 2010 year end of $146.1 million increased $26.3 million from 2009 levels; excluding foreign currency translation impacts, accounts payable increased $27.8 million from 2009 levels primarily due to higher levels of inventory to support increased customer demand. Other accrued liabilities of $346.9 million and $301.4 million as of 2010 and 2009 year end, respectively, included $107.8 million and $81.5 million, respectively, of amounts withheld from CIT. Snap on filed a notice of arbitration on January 8, 2010, concerning a dispute with CIT relating to various underpayments made during the course of their financial services joint venture, in which Snap on alleged damages of approximately $115 million. As a result of the dispute, Snap on has withheld certain amounts (totaling $107.8 million as of 2010 year end and $81.5 million as of 2009 year end) from payments made to CIT relating to SOCs ongoing business activities. CIT filed its response denying Snap ons claim and asserting certain claims against Snap on for other matters relating to the joint venture on January 29, 2010. CITs claims allege damages in excess of $110 million, the majority of which relates to returning the amounts withheld by Snap on. Discovery in the CIT matter is ongoing, with arbitration scheduled for the second quarter of 2011. At this time, no determination can be made as to the likely outcome of this dispute. See Part I, Item 3: Legal Proceedings and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Long term debt of $954.8 million at 2010 year end included: (i) $100 million of unsecured 5.85% notes that mature in 2014; (ii) $150 million of unsecured 5.50% notes that mature in 2017; (iii) $250 million of unsecured 4.25% notes that mature in 2018; (iv) $200 million of unsecured 6.70% notes that mature in 2019; (v) $250 million of unsecured 6.125% notes that mature in 2021; and (vi) $4.8 million of other long term debt. Average commercial paper and notes payable outstanding were $15.1 million in 2010 and $15.2 million in 2009. The weighted average interest rate on these instruments was 5.27% in 2010 and 6.94% in 2009. As of 2010 year end, the weighted average interest rate on outstanding notes payable was 5.54% as compared to 5.34% as of 2009 year end. Snap on has a five year, $500 million multi currency revolving credit facility that terminates on August 10, 2012; as of 2010 year end, no amounts were outstanding under this revolving credit facility. The $500 million revolving credit facilitys financial covenant requires that Snap on maintain, as of each fiscal quarter end, either (i) a ratio of total debt to the sum of total debt plus shareholders equity of not greater than 0.60 to 1.00; or (ii) a ratio of total debt to the sum of net income plus interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and other non cash or extraordinary charges for the preceding four fiscal quarters then ended of not greater than 3.50 to 1.00. As of 2010 year end, the companys actual ratios of 0.46 and 2.80, respectively, were both within the permitted ranges as set forth in this financial covenant. 48 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Table of Contents Snap on also had $20 million of unused available debt capacity under its committed bank lines of credit as of 2010 year end, including a $10 million line of credit that expires on July 26, 2011, and a $10 million line of credit that expires on August 28, 2011. On December 14, 2010, Snap on sold $250 million of fixed rate unsecured long term notes at a discount. Interest on the notes, which mature in their entirety on January 15, 2018, accrues at a rate of 4.25% per year and is payable semi annually beginning on July 15, 2011. Snap on anticipates using the $247.7 million of proceeds from the sale of these notes, net of $1.6 million of transaction costs, for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, capital expenditures, repayment of all or a portion of the companys $200 million of 6.25% unsecured notes maturing on August 15, 2011, the financing of finance and contract receivables related to SOC, and possible acquisitions. On October 1, 2010, Snap on entered into a loan and servicing agreement that provides for aggregate revolving credit commitments in the principal amount of up to $100 million (subject to borrowing base requirements). The loan and servicing agreement, which supplements the companys previously existing available credit facilities, allows Snap on to secure borrowings of up to $100 million through the pledging of finance receivables under a third party sponsored asset backed commercial paper conduit facility. As of 2010 year end, no amounts were outstanding under this agreement. The agreement is currently scheduled to expire on September 30, 2011; however, the agreement may be renewed once each year for an additional 364 day term upon request by Snap on and subsequent concurrence by the lenders. In addition to the financial covenant required by the $500 million multi currency revolving credit facility discussed above, Snap ons debt agreements and credit facilities, including the October 1, 2010 loan and servicing agreement, also contain certain usual and customary borrowing, affirmative, negative and maintenance covenants. As of 2010 year end, Snap on was in compliance with all covenants of its debt agreements and credit facilities. Snap on believes that it has sufficient available cash and committed and uncommitted lines of credit and liquidity facilities to cover its expected funding needs on both a short term and long term basis. Snap on manages its aggregate short term borrowings so as not to exceed its availability under its revolving credit facilities and committed lines of credit. If the need were to arise, Snap on believes that it could access short term debt markets, predominantly through commercial paper issuances, existing lines of credit and securitizations (including its 2010 loan and servicing agreement discussed above), to fund its short term requirements and to ensure near term liquidity. Snap on regularly monitors the credit and financial markets and, in the future, may take advantage of what it believes are favorable market conditions to issue long term debt to further improve its liquidity and capital resources. Near term liquidity requirements for Snap on include the August 15, 2011 repayment of $200 million of fixed rate debt upon its maturity, funding of new loans originated by SOC, the possible resolution of the dispute with CIT discussed above, funding for capital expenditures and restructuring activities, payments of dividends and interest, and funding for share repurchases, if any. Snap on also expects to make contributions of $10.2 million to its foreign pension plans and $1.4 million to its domestic pension plans in 2011. Depending on market and other conditions, Snap on may elect to make discretionary cash contributions to its domestic pension plans in 2011. Snap ons long term financing strategy is to maintain continuous access to the debt markets to accommodate its liquidity needs, including the potential use of commercial paper, securitizations and or additional fixed term debt. The following discussion focuses on information included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $140.4 million in 2010, $347.1 million in 2009 and $220.4 million in 2008. The lower net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 was primarily due to net changes in operating assets and liabilities as a result of higher sales and increased customer demand, including $116.6 million of higher trade, contract and other receivables and $55.2 million of increased inventories. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 also included a fourth quarter 2010 discretionary cash contribution of $48.0 million to the companys domestic pension plans. Depreciation expense was $48.7 million in 2010, $49.9 million in 2009 and $47.9 million in 2008. Amortization expense was $24.0 million in 2010, $24.7 million in 2009 and $24.1 million in 2008. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on acquired intangible assets. 2010 ANNUAL REPORT 49 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Following the July 16, 2009 acquisition of CITs ownership interest in SOC, Snap on began presenting Provisions for losses on finance receivables on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow as part of Net cash provided by operating activities. The non cash provision for loan losses on finance receivables totaled $13.9 million in 2010; for the period from July 16, 2009, to fiscal 2009 year end, the non cash provision for loan losses on finance receivables totaled $6.2 million. Prior to July 16, 2009, the non cash provisions for loan losses on finance receivables, which primarily related to the companys international finance subsidiaries, are included in (Increase) decrease in contract receivables; prior period amounts were not restated as the amounts were not significant, individually or in the aggregate, to Snap ons Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow also reflect, beginning in 2010, the Provision for losses on non finance receivables. The non cash provision for losses on non finance receivables totaled $20.5 million in 2010. Prior to 2010, the provisions for losses on non finance receivables are included in (Increase) decrease in trade and other accounts receivable and (Increase) decrease in contract receivables as part of Net cash provided by operating activities; prior year amounts were not restated as the amounts were not significant, individually or in the aggregate, to Snap ons Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on receivables. Investing Activities Net cash used by investing activities of $303.0 million in 2010 included additions to, and collections of, finance receivables of $497.6 million and $245.2 million, respectively. Following the termination of CITs ownership interest in SOC on July 16, 2009, Snap on began presenting Additions to finance receivables and Collections of finance receivables on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow as part of Net cash used by investing activities. Finance receivables are comprised of extended term installment loans to technicians (i.e. franchisees customers) to enable them to purchase tools, diagnostics and equipment on an extended term payment plan, generally with average payment terms of 32 months. For financial statement periods prior to July 16, 2009, the net additions and collections of finance receivables, which primarily related to the companys international finance subsidiaries, are included in (Increase) decrease in contract receivables; prior period amounts were not restated as the amounts were not significant, individually or in the aggregate, to Snap ons Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. Capital expenditures in 2010, 2009 and 2008 totaled $51.1 million, $64.4 million and $73.9 million, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2010 included continued spending to support the companys strategic growth initiatives, including the expansion of manufacturing capabilities in lower cost regions and emerging growth markets. Capital spending in 2010 also included spending to enhance the companys corporate headquarters and research and development facilities in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Capital expenditures in all three years included higher levels of efficiency and cost reduction capital investments, including the installation of new production equipment and machine tooling to enhance manufacturing and distribution operations, as well as provide ongoing replacements of manufacturing and distribution equipment. Capital spending over the last three years also included spending for the replacement and enhancement of the companys existing global enterprise resource planning (ERP) management information systems. Capital expenditures in 2009 also included the accelerated expansion of manufacturing capabilities in lower cost regions and emerging growth markets. Capital expenditures in 2009 and 2008 included spending for the construction of a new headquarters and research and development facility for the companys automotive parts and service information business in Richfield, Ohio. Snap on believes that its cash generated from operations, as well as its available cash on hand and funds available from its credit facilities will be sufficient to fund the companys capital expenditure requirements in 2011. Snap on acquired the remaining 40% interest in Wanda Snap on, the companys tool manufacturing operation in Xiaoshan, China, on April 6, 2010, for a purchase price of $7.7 million and $0.1 million of transaction costs. Snap on acquired the initial 60% interest in Wanda Snap on for a cash purchase price of $15.4 million (or $14.1 million, net of cash acquired), including $1.2 million of transaction costs, on March 5, 2008. The acquisition of Wanda Snap on is part of the companys ongoing strategic initiatives to further expand its manufacturing presence in emerging growth markets and lower cost regions. On July 1, 2010, Wanda Snap on was renamed Snap on Asia Manufacturing (Zhejiang) Co., Ltd. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Snap on terminated its SOC financial services operating agreement with CIT on July 16, 2009, and subsequently purchased, pursuant to the terms of the joint venture agreement, CITs 50% ownership interest in SOC for a cash purchase price of $8.1 million. The $8.1 million purchase price represented the book value, and approximated the fair value, of CITs ownership interest in SOC as of the acquisition date. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 50 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Table of Contents Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $34.8 million in 2010. On December 14, 2010, Snap on sold $250 million of unsecured 4.25% long term notes at a discount; Snap on is using the $247.7 million of proceeds from the sale of these notes, net of $1.6 million of transaction costs, for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, capital expenditures, repayment of all or a portion of the companys $200 million 6.25% unsecured notes maturing on August 15, 2011, the financing of finance and contract receivables related to SOC, and possible acquisitions. On January 12, 2010, Snap on repaid $150 million of unsecured floating rate debt upon its maturity with available cash. On February 24, 2009, Snap on sold $300 million of unsecured fixed rate notes consisting of $100 million of unsecured 5.85% notes that mature in 2014, and $200 million of unsecured 6.70% notes that mature in 2019. On August 14, 2009, Snap on sold $250 million of unsecured 6.125% long term notes that mature in 2021. Snap on is using, and has used, the $545.9 million of proceeds from the sale of these notes, net of $4.1 million of transaction costs, for general corporate purposes, including the funding of receivables contracts originated by SOC and the January 12, 2010 repayment of $150 million of floating rate debt. Proceeds from stock purchase plans and stock option exercises totaled $23.7 million in 2010. Snap on has undertaken stock repurchases from time to time to offset dilution created by shares issued for employee and dealer stock purchase plans, stock options and other corporate purposes. In 2010, Snap on repurchased 152,000 shares of its common stock for $8.7 million under its previously announced share repurchase programs. As of 2010 year end, Snap on had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $159.4 million in common stock pursuant to its Board of Directors (Board) authorizations. The purchase of Snap on common stock is at the companys discretion, subject to prevailing financial and market conditions. Snap on did not repurchase any shares of its common stock in 2009; Snap on repurchased 1,230,000 shares of its common stock for $69.8 million in 2008. Snap on believes that its cash generated from operations, available cash on hand, and funds available from its credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund the companys share repurchases, if any, in 2011. Snap on has paid consecutive quarterly cash dividends, without interruption or reduction, since 1939. Cash dividends paid in 2010, 2009 and 2008 totaled $71.3 million, $69.0 million and $69.7 million, respectively. On November 4, 2010, the company announced that its Board increased the quarterly cash dividend by 6.7% to $0.32 per share ($1.28 per share per year). Quarterly dividends declared in 2010 were $0.32 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.30 per share in the first three quarters ($1.22 per share for the year). Quarterly dividends in 2009 and 2008 were $0.30 per share ($1.20 per share for each year). 2010 2009 2008 Cash dividends paid per common share $ 1.22 $ 1.20 $ 1.20 Cash dividends paid as a percent of prior year retained earnings 4.7% 4.7% 5.4% Snap on believes that its cash generated from operations, available cash on hand and funds available from its credit facilities will be sufficient to pay dividends in 2011. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Except as included below in the section labeled Contractual Obligations and Commitments and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the company had no off balance sheet arrangements as of 2010 year end. 2010 ANNUAL REPORT 51 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments A summary of Snap ons future contractual obligations and commitments as of 2010 year end are as follows: (Amounts in millions) Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 andthereafter Contractual obligations: Notes payable and current maturities of long term debt $ 216.0 $ 216.0 $ $ $ Long term debt 954.8 100.0 854.8 Interest on fixed rate debt 423.6 61.2 106.9 96.1 159.4 Operating leases 92.4 26.1 35.5 16.8 14.0 Capital leases 28.4 2.4 4.7 3.8 17.5 Purchase obligations 2.3 1.8 0.5 Total $ 1,717.5 $ 307.5 $ 147.6 $ 216.7 $ 1,045.7 The company has excluded payments related to its pension and postretirement benefit plans from the contractual obligation table above; see Notes 11 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the companys benefit plans and payments. The contractual obligation table above also does not include normal inventory related and service purchases or income tax liabilities recorded in accordance with U.S. GAAP; see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on income taxes. Environmental Matters Snap on is subject to various federal, state and local government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Snap ons policy is to comply with these requirements and the company believes that, as a general matter, its policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with its business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in some of Snap ons operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses. Snap on is and has been engaged in the handling, manufacture, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies. Snap on believes that, as a general matter, its handling, manufacture, use and disposal of these substances are in accordance with environmental laws and regulations. It is possible, however, that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could bring into question the companys handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these substances. New Accounting Standards See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on new accounting standards. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to managements discussion and analysis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are generally based on historical experience, current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources, as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The companys significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 52 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Table of Contents Snap on considers the following policies and estimates to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Revenue Recognition: Snap on recognizes revenue from the sale of tools, diagnostics and equipment solutions when contract terms are met, collectability is reasonably assured and a product is shipped or risk of ownership has been transferred to and accepted by the customer. For sales contingent upon customer acceptance or product installation, revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations are fulfilled. Estimated product returns are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale based upon historical product return experience and gross profit margin adjusted for known trends. Provisions for customer volume rebates, discounts and allowances are also recorded as a reduction of reported revenues at the time of sale based on historical experience and known trends. Revenue related to maintenance and subscription agreements is recognized over the terms of the respective agreements. Snap on also recognizes revenue related to multiple element arrangements, including sales of software and software related services. When a sales arrangement contains multiple elements, such as hardware and software products and or services, Snap on uses estimates of fair value for hardware elements and vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value for software elements to allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value and, when necessary, uses the residual method to assign value to the delivered elements when VSOE only exists for the undelivered elements. The amount assigned to future delivery of products or services is recognized when the product is delivered and or when the services are performed. In instances where the product and or services are performed over an extended period, as is the case with subscription agreements or the providing of ongoing support, revenue is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable agreement, which generally ranges from 12 to 60 months. Franchise fee revenue, including nominal, non refundable initial and ongoing monthly fees (primarily for sales and business training and marketing and product promotion programs), is recognized as the fees are earned. Financial Services Revenue: Snap on also generates revenue from various financing programs that include (i) loans to franchisees customers and Snap ons industrial and other customers for the purchase or lease of tools, equipment and diagnostics products on an extended term payment plan; and (ii) business loans and vehicle leases to franchisees. These financing programs are offered through Snap ons wholly owned finance subsidiaries. Financial services revenue consists of installment contract revenue and franchisee loan receivable revenue. For periods prior to July 16, 2009, financial services revenue also included gains from SOCs sales of originated contracts to CIT. The decision to finance through Snap on or another financing entity is solely at the election of the customer. When assessing customers for potential financing, Snap on considers various factors regarding ability to pay including customers financial condition, collateral, debt servicing ability, past payment experience and credit bureau information. For finance and contract receivables, Snap on assesses these factors through the use of credit quality indicators consisting of consumer credit risk scores combined with internal credit risk grades, collection experience and other internal metrics. Prior to July 16, 2009, SOC substantially sold all of its loan originations to CIT on a limited recourse basis; SOC retained the right to service such loans for a contractual servicing fee. Contractual servicing fees were $4.9 million in 2010, $8.3 million in 2009 and $9.2 million in 2008. Snap ons international finance subsidiaries own the loans originated through their financing programs; loans originated by SOC subsequent to July 16, 2009, and loans retained by SOC prior to July 16, 2009, are also owned by Snap on. Revenue from interest income on the on book financing portfolio is recognized over the life of the contracts, with interest computed on the average daily balances of the underlying contracts. Impairment of Goodwill and Other Indefinite lived Intangible Assets: Goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. Annual impairment tests are performed by the company in the second quarter of each year. Snap on evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the businesses to which the goodwill relates. Estimated cash flows and related goodwill are grouped at the reporting unit level. The company has determined that its reporting units for testing goodwill impairment are its operating segments or components of an operating segment that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results. Within its four reportable operating segments, the company has identified 11 reporting units. 2010 ANNUAL REPORT 53 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Snap on evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows of the reporting units to which the goodwill relates. The future projections, which are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in the companys current and long range operating plans, are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. Significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on expected growth rates, price increases, capital expenditures, working capital levels, the benefits of recent acquisitions and expected synergies, and a weighted average cost of capital that reflects the specific risk profile of the reporting unit being tested. The companys methodologies for valuing goodwill are applied consistently on a year over year basis; the assumptions used in performing the second quarter 2010 impairment calculations were evaluated in light of current market and business conditions. Snap on continues to believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the reporting units projections of future operating results and cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the companys reporting units in an orderly transaction. In the event the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, including goodwill, the company would then perform an additional assessment that would compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill. The determination of implied fair value of goodwill would require management to compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit; if necessary, the company may consult with valuation specialists to assist with the assessment of the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss would be recorded. Snap on also evaluates the recoverability of its indefinite lived trademarks by utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows of each of its trademarks. The future projections, which are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in the companys current and long range operating plans, are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. Significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on expected growth and royalty rates, expected synergies, and a weighted average cost of equity that reflects the specific risk profile of the trademark being tested. The companys methodologies for valuing trademarks are applied consistently on a year over year basis; the assumptions used in performing the second quarter 2010 impairment calculations were evaluated in light of current market and business conditions. Snap on continues to believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the trademarks projected future cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the companys trademarks in an orderly transaction. Snap on did not recognize any impairment on its goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets in 2010, 2009 or 2008. Inherent in fair value determinations are significant judgments and estimates, including material assumptions about future revenue, profitability and cash flows, the companys operational plans and its interpretation of current economic indicators. Should the operations of the businesses with which goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets are associated incur significant declines in profitability and cash flow due to significant adverse changes in business climate, adverse actions by regulators, unanticipated competition, loss of key customers, and or changes in technology or markets, some or all of the recorded goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets could be subject to impairment and could result in a material adverse effect on Snap ons financial position or results of operations. Snap on completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets in the second quarter of 2010, the results of which did not result in any impairment. Although the company consistently uses the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations, such estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results. In performing its annual impairment testing the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the material assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation models for each of its 11 reporting units. Based on the companys second quarter 2010 impairment testing and assuming a hypothetical 10% decrease in the estimated fair values of each of its 11 reporting units, the hypothetical fair value of each of the companys 11 reporting units would have been greater than its carrying value. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about goodwill and other intangible assets. Impairment of Long lived and Amortized Intangible Assets: Snap on performs impairment evaluations of its long lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives, whenever business conditions or events indicate that those assets may be impaired. When the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying value of the long lived assets, the assets are written down to fair market value and a charge is recorded to current operations. 54 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Table of Contents Significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate, adverse actions by regulators, unanticipated competition, loss of key customers and or changes in technology or markets, could require a provision for impairment in a future period. Allowances for Doubtful Accounts: Snap on maintains allowances for doubtful accounts to absorb probable losses inherent in its portfolio of receivables. The allowances for doubtful accounts represent managements estimate of the losses inherent in the companys receivables portfolio based on ongoing assessments and evaluations of collectability and historical loss experience. In estimating losses inherent in each of its receivable portfolios (trade, finance and contract receivables), Snap on uses historical loss experience rates by portfolio and applies them to a related aging analysis. Determination of the proper level of allowances by portfolio requires management to exercise significant judgment about the timing, frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the provision for credit losses and, therefore, net income. The allowances for doubtful accounts takes into consideration numerous quantitative and qualitative factors, by loan type, including historical loss experience, portfolio duration, collection experience, delinquency trends, economic conditions and credit risk quality as follows: Snap on evaluates the collectability of receivables based on a combination of various financial and qualitative factors that may affect the customers ability to pay. These factors may include customers financial condition, collateral, debt servicing ability, past payment experience and credit bureau information. For finance and contract receivables, Snap on assesses quantitative and qualitative factors through the use of credit quality indicators consisting primarily of customer credit risk scores combined with internal credit risk grades, collection experience and other internal metrics as follows: Credit risk Personal credit risk is monitored regularly on an account by account basis through customer credit scores obtained from major credit bureaus as well as through the use of internal proprietary, custom scoring models used to evaluate each transaction at the time of the application for credit and by periodically updating those credit scores for ongoing monitoring purposes. In addition, Snap on evaluates credit quality through the use of a loan risk grading measurement system that provides a framework to analyze the finance and contract receivables on the basis of risk factors of the individual obligor as well as transaction specific risk. Collection experience Snap on conducts monthly reviews of credit and collection performance for each of its finance and contract receivable portfolios focusing on data such as delinquency trends, non performing assets, charge off and recovery activity. These reviews allow for the formulation of collection strategies and potential collection policy modifications in response to changing risk profiles in the finance and contract receivable portfolios. Other internal metrics Snap on maintains a system that aggregates credit exposure by customer, industry, risk classification and geographical area, among other factors, to further monitor changing risk profiles. Management performs detailed reviews of its receivables on a monthly and or quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowances based on historical and current trends and other factors affecting credit losses and to determine if any impairment has occurred. A receivable is impaired when it is probable that all amounts related to the receivable will not be collected according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. In circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations, a specific reserve is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected. Additions to the allowances for doubtful accounts are maintained through adjustments to the provision for credit losses, which are charged to current period earnings; amounts determined to be uncollectable are charged directly against the allowances, while amounts recovered on previously charged off accounts increase the allowances. Net charge offs include the principal amount of losses charged off as well as charged off interest and fees. Recovered interest and fees previously charged off are recorded through the allowances for doubtful accounts. Finance receivables are assessed for charge off when an account becomes 120 days past due and are charged off typically within 60 days of asset repossession. Contract receivables related to equipment leases are generally charged off when an account becomes 150 days past due while contract receivables related to franchise finance and van leases are generally charged off up to 180 days past the asset return. For finance and contract receivables, customer bankruptcies are generally charged off upon notification that the associated debt is not being reaffirmed, or, in any event, no later than 180 days past due. 2010 ANNUAL REPORT 55 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Snap on does not believe that trade accounts, finance or contract receivables represent significant concentrations of credit risk because of the diversified portfolio of individual customers and geographical areas. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on allowances for doubtful accounts. Excess and Obsolete Inventory: Snap on records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions. Allowances for raw materials are largely based on an analysis of raw material age and actual physical inspection of raw material for fitness for use. As part of evaluating the adequacy of allowances for work in progress and finished goods, management reviews individual product stock keeping units (SKUs) by product category and product life cycle. Cost adjustments for each product category/product life cycle state are generally established and maintained based on a combination of historical experience, forecasted sales and promotions, technological obsolescence, inventory age and other actual known conditions and circumstances. Should actual product marketability and raw material fitness for use be affected by conditions that are different from management estimates, further adjustments to inventory allowances may be required. Pension Benefits: The pension benefit obligation and related pension expense are calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of Snap ons control and can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements. Snap on believes that the two most critical assumptions are (i) the expected return on plan assets; and (ii) the assumed discount rate. Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases. Lowering the expected rate of return assumption for Snap ons domestic pension plan assets by 50 basis points would have increased Snap ons 2010 domestic pension expense by approximately $3.2 million. Snap on uses a three year, market related value asset method of amortizing the difference between actual and expected returns on its domestic plan assets. The objective of Snap ons discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. In making this determination, the company takes into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans. The methodology for selecting the discount rate as of 2010 year end was to match the plans cash flows to that of a theoretical bond portfolio yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zero coupon bonds with an AA rating or better for each maturity. The selection of the 5.3% weighted average discount rate for Snap ons domestic pension plans represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments. Lowering Snap ons domestic discount rate assumption by 50 basis points would have increased Snap ons 2010 domestic pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately $4.8 million and $49.2 million, respectively. At 2010 year end, Snap ons domestic projected benefit obligation comprised approximately 82% of Snap ons worldwide projected benefit obligation. The weighted average discount rate for Snap ons foreign pension plans of 5.3% represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments. Lowering Snap ons foreign discount rate assumption by 50 basis points would have increased Snap ons 2010 foreign pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately $1.6 million and $16.8 million, respectively. Actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or market related value of assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period of active participants. Prior service costs resulting from plan amendments are amortized in equal annual amounts over the average remaining service period of affected active participants or over the remaining life expectancy of affected retired participants. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on pension plans. Postretirement Benefits: Snap ons postretirement benefits obligation and related expense are calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions, including health care trend rates. An increase of one percentage point in health care costs would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $2.3 million and the combined annual service and interest cost by $0.1 million. A corresponding decrease of one percentage point would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit by $2.0 million and the combined annual service and interest cost by $0.1 million. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on postretirement plans. Income Taxes: Snap on records deferred income tax assets and liabilities for differences between the book basis and tax basis of the related net assets. Snap on records a valuation allowance, when appropriate, to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. While the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. 56 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Table of Contents In addition, the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on income taxes. Outlook Snap on anticipates continuing with its planned strategic investments in 2011, including further expansion in emerging growth markets. As a result, capital expenditures are anticipated to be in a range of $55 million to $65 million. Snap on also expects to incur $11 million of higher year over year pension expense in 2011 largely due to the amortization of investment losses incurred in 2008 related to its domestic pension plan assets. Interest expense on the $250 million of senior notes issued in December 2010 will approximate $2.7 million per quarter in 2011. Snap on anticipates that its full year 2011 effective income tax rate will approximate 33.0%. 2010 ANNUAL REPORT 57 Table of Contents Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market, Credit and Economic Risks Market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments. Snap on is exposed to market risk from changes in both foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Snap on monitors its exposure to these risks and attempts to manage the underlying economic exposures through the use of financial instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swap agreements and treasury lock agreements. Snap on does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Snap ons broad based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole. Snap ons management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. Foreign Currency Risk Management Snap on has significant international operations and is subject to certain risks inherent with foreign operations that include currency fluctuations and restrictions on movement of funds. Foreign exchange risk exists to the extent that Snap on has payment obligations or receipts denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. To manage these exposures, Snap on identifies naturally offsetting positions and then purchases hedging instruments to protect the residual net exposures. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on foreign currency risk management. Interest Rate Risk Management Snap on aims to control funding costs by managing the exposure created by the differing maturities and interest rate structures of Snap ons assets and liabilities through the use of interest rate swap agreements. Treasury lock agreements are used to manage potential changes in interest rates in anticipation of the issuance or sale of certain financial instruments. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on interest rate risk management. Snap on utilizes a Value at Risk (VAR) model to determine the potential one day loss in the fair value of its interest rate and foreign exchange sensitive financial instruments from adverse changes in market factors. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. Snap ons computations are based on the inter relationships among movements in various currencies and interest rates (variance/co variance technique). These inter relationships were determined by observing interest rate and foreign currency market changes over the preceding quarter. The estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value, calculated using the VAR model, as of 2010 year end was $5.4 million on interest rate sensitive financial instruments and $0.4 million on foreign currency sensitive financial instruments. The VAR model is a risk management tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by Snap on, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors. Credit Risk Credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. Prior to granting credit, each customer is evaluated, taking into consideration the borrowers financial condition, collateral, debt servicing capacity, past payment experience, credit bureau information, and other financial and qualitative factors that may affect the borrowers ability to repay. Credit risk is also monitored regularly through the use of internal proprietary, custom scoring models used to evaluate each transaction at the time of the application for credit and by periodically updating those credit scores for ongoing monitoring purposes. Snap on evaluates credit quality through the use of an internal proprietary measuring system that provides a framework to analyze finance and contract receivables on the basis of risk factors of the individual obligor as well as transaction specific risk. Loans that have been granted are typically monitored through an asset quality review process that closely monitors past due accounts and initiates a progressive collection action process when appropriate. In addition to its direct credit risk exposure, Snap on also has credit risk exposure for certain SOC originated contracts with recourse provisions related to franchisee van loans sold by SOC; as of 2010 year end, $15.9 million of franchisee van loans contain a recourse provision to Snap on if the loans become more than 90 days past due. 58 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Table of Contents Counterparty Risk Snap on is exposed to credit losses in the event of non performance by the counterparties to various financial agreements, including its foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swap agreements and treasury lock agreements. Snap on does not obtain collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk, but monitors the credit standing of the counterparties and enters into agreements only with financial institution counterparties with a credit rating of A or better. Snap on does not anticipate non performance by its counterparties, but cannot provide assurances. Economic Risk Economic risk is the possibility of loss resulting from economic instability in certain areas of the world. Snap on continually monitors its exposure in these markets. As a result of the above market, credit and economic risks, net income and revenues in any particular period may not be representative of full year results and may vary significantly from year to year. Inflation has not had a significant impact on the company. Commodity Risk Snap on is a purchaser of certain commodities such as steel, natural gas and electricity. The company is also a purchaser of components and parts that are integrated into the companys end products, as well as the purchaser of certain finished goods, all of which may contain various commodities including steel, aluminum and others. Snap ons supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers. The principal raw material used in the manufacture of the companys products is steel, which the companys purchases in competitive, price sensitive markets. To meet Snap ons high quality standards, the companys steel needs range from specialized alloys, which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers, to commodity types of alloys. These raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality. Some of these materials have been, and in the future may be, in short supply. As some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures, Snap on could experience inventory shortages if it were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice. Additionally, unexpected price increases could result in higher prices to Snap ons customers or an erosion of the margins on its products. Snap on believes its ability to sell product is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road, the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles. These factors affect the frequency, type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians, and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians, the prosperity of the technicians and, subsequently, the demand the technicians have for the companys tools, other products and services, and the value they place on those products and services. To the extent that the prices of gasoline and other petroleum based fuels increase, consumers may turn to other methods of transportation, including more frequent use of public transportation. A decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for the companys products. To the extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm pricing agreements with its suppliers, the company may experience margin declines to the extent that it is not able to increase the selling prices of its products.
