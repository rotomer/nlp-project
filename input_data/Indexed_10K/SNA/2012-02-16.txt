We believe our 2011 operating performance evidences significant and continued progress on our strategic priorities and ongoing benefits from our Snap on Value Creation Processes a set of strategic principles and processes designed to create value and employed in the areas of (i) safety; (ii) quality; (iii) customer connection; (iv) innovation; and (v) rapid continuous improvement. Considerable progress was made in 2011 in strengthening our business model, pursuing geographic and customer diversification and expanding our presence in emerging markets and critical industries. In 2011, we continued to invest in our most important strategic growth initiatives aimed at enhancing the franchisee network, expanding in the vehicle repair garage, extending in critical industries and building in emerging markets. Leveraging capabilities already demonstrated in the automotive repair arena, our coherent growth strategy focuses on developing and expanding our professional customer base in both adjacent markets, additional geographies and other areas, including in critical industries, where the cost and penalties for failure can be high. Our global financial services operations continue to serve a significant strategic role in providing financing options for our franchisees, their customers, and customers in other parts of our business. Following the July 2009 termination of the financial services operating agreement with CIT Group Inc. (CIT), we have been steadily growing our on book finance portfolio and providing financing for the majority of new loans originated by Snap on Credit LLC (SOC). We expect that our financial services businesses, including both SOC and our other wholly owned international finance subsidiaries, will continue to be meaningful contributors to our operating earnings. For additional information on SOC and CIT, see Notes 1, 2, 3 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Net sales of $2,854.2 million in 2011 increased $235.0 million, or 9.0%, from 2010 levels, with favorable foreign currency translation contributing $57.2 million of the increase. Operating earnings of $475.1 million in 2011 were up $143.7 million, or 43.4%, from 2010 levels, reflecting contributions from higher sales and improved operating margins, including as a result of ongoing efficiency and productivity (collectively, Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI) initiatives and benefits from restructuring actions. The $143.7 million year over year operating earnings improvement also includes $76.5 million of higher earnings from financial services, including a previously disclosed $18.0 million arbitration settlement gain from the resolution of a dispute with CIT (discussed below). Net earnings attributable to Snap on Incorporated in 2011 of $276.3 million, or $4.71 per diluted share, included $11.1 million after tax, or $0.19 per diluted share, associated with the $18.0 million arbitration settlement gain.

In the Commercial & Industrial Group, segment net sales of $1,125.8 million in 2011 increased $77.6 million, or 7.4%, from 2010 levels. Excluding $30.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation, organic (excluding foreign currency translation effects) sales in 2011 increased $47.0 million, or 4.4%, as continued higher sales to a wide range of customers in emerging markets and critical industries were partially offset by expected lower sales to the military and ongoing weakness in Europe, particularly in the southern regions. Operating earnings of $123.4 million in 2011 increased $6.5 million, or 5.6%, from 2010 levels primarily due to higher sales and continued savings from RCI and restructuring initiatives. In 2011 and 2010, the Commercial & Industrial Group incurred $5.6 million and $5.2 million, respectively, of restructuring costs, primarily intended to improve the segments cost structure in Europe. The Commercial & Industrial Group intends to build on the following strategic priorities in 2012: Continuing to invest in emerging market growth initiatives, including in China, India and Eastern Europe; Increasing market share by expanding our business with existing customers and by reaching new customers in critical industries and other market segments; Continuing to invest in innovation that delivers an ongoing stream of productivity enhancing solutions; and Continuing to reduce structural and operating costs through RCI and restructuring initiatives. In the Snap on Tools Group, segment net sales of $1,153.4 million in 2011 increased $113.5 million, or 10.9%, from 2010 levels; excluding $16.0 million of favorable foreign currency translation, organic sales in 2011 increased $97.5 24 SNAP ON INCORPORATED million, or 9.2%, primarily due to continued higher sales in the companys U.S. franchise operations. Operating earnings of $158.5 million in 2011 increased $44.5 million, or 39.0%, from 2010 levels primarily as a result of higher sales, benefits from sales volume leverage and savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives, including contributions from the 2011 consolidation of the companys North American tool storage operations. The Snap on Tools Group made considerable progress in 2011 on its fundamental, strategic initiatives to strengthen the group and enhance franchisee profitability. In 2012, the Snap on Tools Group intends to continue building on the progress made in 2011, with specific initiatives focused on the following: Continuing to improve franchisee profitability, satisfaction and commercial health; Developing new programs and products to expand market coverage and penetration; Continuing to invest in new product innovation and development; and Increasing operational flexibility in back office support functions, manufacturing and the supply chain through RCI initiatives and investment.

In the Repair Systems & Information Group, segment net sales of $920.6 million in 2011 increased $73.4 million, or 8.7%, from 2010 levels; excluding $13.3 million of favorable foreign currency translation, organic sales in 2011 increased $60.1 million, or 7.0%. The year over year sales increase is primarily due to higher essential tool and facilitation program sales to Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) dealerships and increased sales of equipment and diagnostics products to repair shop owners and managers in both the independent and OEM markets. Sales in 2011 also benefited from the further development and launch of new and enhanced diagnostics and information products, and the continued expansion of product functionality, content and product integration. Operating earnings of $184.7 million in 2011 increased $20.3 million, or 12.3%, from 2010 levels, primarily due to higher sales, benefits from sales volume leverage and savings from ongoing RCI initiatives.

In 2011, continued higher sales to a wide range of customers in emerging markets and in critical industries were partially offset by expected lower sales to the military and weakness in Europe, particularly in the southern regions. Segment gross profit of $415.2 million in 2011 increased $29.7 million from 2010 levels. As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 36.9% in 2011 improved 10 basis points from 36.8% last year as contributions from higher sales volumes and savings from RCI initiatives more than offset inflationary and other cost increases. Segment operating expenses of $291.8 million in 2011 increased $23.2 million from 2010 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 25.9% in 2011 increased 30 basis points from 25.6% last year primarily due to higher restructuring and other costs. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings of $123.4 million in 2011 increased $6.5 million, or 5.6%, from 2010 levels, including $1.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects.

As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 43.9% in 2011 improved 200 basis points from 41.9% last year primarily due to savings from RCI initiatives, contributions from higher sales, including benefits from favorable manufacturing utilization as a result of increased production levels, and favorable foreign currency effects due to the relatively weaker U.S. dollar. These year over year gross margin improvements were partially offset by inflationary and other cost increases. Restructuring costs included in gross profit totaled $3.7 million in 2011 as compared to $4.9 million last year. Restructuring costs incurred in both years primarily related to the 2011 closure of Snap ons Newmarket, Canada, tool storage manufacturing facility.

As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 45.2% in 2011 declined 80 basis points from 46.0% last year as benefits from RCI initiatives were more than offset by a shift in sales mix that included higher volumes of lower margin essential tool and facilitation products.

Contributions in 2011 from ongoing RCI initiatives, pricing, $2.8 million of favorable foreign currency effects and lower year over year restructuring costs were more than offset by inflationary and other cost increases. Restructuring costs included in gross profit totaled $3.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 as compared to $4.4 million last year. Fourth quarter operating expenses of $232.0 million in 2011 increased $1.0 million, or 0.4%, as compared to $231.0 million in 2010.

These improvements were partially offset by higher performance based incentive compensation expense and $2.6 million of expected higher pension expense (largely due to the ongoing amortization of investment losses incurred in 2008 and the impact of declining discount rates). Restructuring costs in operating expenses totaled $0.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 as compared to $1.4 million last year. 32 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Operating earnings before financial services of $103.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 increased $16.3 million, or 18.6%, as compared to $87.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.

As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 36.0% in the quarter decreased 240 basis points from 38.4% last year. Contributions in the fourth quarter of 2011 from ongoing RCI initiatives and pricing were more than offset by margin pressure in Europe and $2.9 million of higher restructuring costs, primarily to improve the segments cost structure in Europe. Segment operating expenses of $73.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 increased $0.8 million from 2010 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 24.8% in 2011 improved 100 basis points from 25.8% last year primarily due to savings from RCI initiatives and benefits from sales volume leverage. 2011 ANNUAL REPORT 33 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings of $33.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 decreased $2.4 million, or 6.8%, from 2010 levels.

Net sales of $2,619.2 million in 2010 increased $256.7 million, or 10.9%, from 2009 levels; excluding $14.9 million of favorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased $241.8 million, or 10.2%, from 2009 levels. Snap on has significant international operations and is subject to certain risks inherent with foreign operations, including foreign currency translation fluctuations. Gross profit of $1,211.1 million in 2010 increased $153.5 million, or 14.5%, as compared to $1,057.6 million in 2009. As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 46.2% in 2010 improved 140 basis points from 44.8% in 2009 primarily due to $21.6 million of savings from ongoing RCI initiatives, $17.5 million of favorable foreign currency effects and $4.7 million of lower restructuring costs. The 2010 gross margin also benefited from favorable manufacturing utilization as a result of increased production levels; in 2009, the company incurred costs to carry excess manufacturing capacity, primarily in Europe, as a result of lower demand and inventory reduction efforts. These improvements in year over year gross margin were partially offset by $10.9 million of lower year over year last in, first out (LIFO) related inventory valuation benefits ($1.0 million of LIFO related expense in 2010 and $9.9 million of LIFO related benefits in 2009). The LIFO related inventory benefits in 2009 resulted from inventory reductions, including as a result of increased liquidations and disposals of slow moving and excess inventories, as the company adjusted its production and inventory levels in response to weakened consumer and business demand during the continued global economic downturn. Restructuring costs included in gross profit totaled $10.8 million in 2010 as compared to $15.5 million in 2009. 36 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Operating expenses of $894.1 million in 2010 increased $69.7 million, or 8.5%, as compared to $824.4 million in 2009.

These year over year improvements were partially offset by $19.3 million of higher performance based incentive compensation expense, $16.3 million of increased pension expense (largely due to the ongoing amortization of investment losses incurred in 2008 related to the companys domestic pension plan assets) and $7.5 million of higher stock based (mark to market) compensation expense. Restructuring costs included in operating expenses totaled $3.4 million in 2010 as compared to $6.3 million in 2009. Operating earnings before financial services of $317.0 million in 2010 increased $83.8 million, or 35.9%, as compared to $233.2 million in 2009.

As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 41.9% in 2010 declined 140 basis points from 43.3% in 2009 primarily due to $10.9 million of lower year over year LIFO related inventory valuation benefits ($1.0 million of LIFO related expense in 2010 and $9.9 million of LIFO related benefits in 2009) and $4.7 million of higher restructuring costs. The year over year gross margin comparison was also impacted by $2.4 million of lower warranty expense in 2009 due to favorable historic warranty trend rates. The LIFO related inventory benefits in 2009 resulted from inventory reductions, including as a result of increased liquidations 38 SNAP ON INCORPORATED and disposals of slow moving and excess inventories, as the segment adjusted its production and inventory levels in response to weakened consumer and business demand during the continued global economic downturn. The year over year decline in gross margin was partially offset by contributions from favorable manufacturing utilization as a result of increased production levels, $15.0 million of favorable foreign currency effects and $1.7 million of savings from ongoing RCI initiatives. Restructuring costs included in gross profit totaled $4.9 million in 2010 as compared to $0.2 million in 2009. The $4.9 million of restructuring costs in 2010 primarily reflects initial costs for the mid 2011 closure of Snap ons Newmarket, Canada, tool storage manufacturing facility. Segment operating expenses of $321.6 million in 2010 increased $22.4 million, or 7.5%, from 2009 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 30.9% in 2010 improved 90 basis points from 31.8% in 2009 primarily due to improved sales volume leverage, $1.4 million of savings from RCI initiatives, $1.4 million of lower bad debt expense and $0.6 million of lower restructuring costs. These year over year improvements were partially offset by higher costs, including costs associated with increased participation at the annual Snap on Franchisee Conference and costs associated with the development of a new and expanded product catalog (deferred from 2009 into 2010), $3.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and $1.3 million of increased stock based expense related to the franchisee stock purchase plan. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings of $114.0 million in 2010 increased $5.8 million, or 5.4%, from 2009 levels, including $11.7 million of favorable foreign currency effects. As a percentage of segment net sales, operating earnings for the Snap on Tools Group of 11.0% in 2010 declined 50 basis points from 11.5% in 2009.

Excluding $2.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased $70.9 million, or 9.1%, primarily due to higher worldwide sales of equipment, increased essential tool and facilitation program activity with automotive OEM dealerships, and higher sales of diagnostics and Mitchell 1 information products. These sales increases were partially offset by anticipated lower year over year sales of electronic parts catalogs to OEMs and their franchised dealer networks primarily due to the consolidation of North American automotive dealerships in 2009 and 2010. Segment gross profit of $390.0 million in 2010 increased $44.5 million, or 12.9%, from 2009 levels. As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 46.0% in 2010 improved 160 basis points from 44.4% in 2009 primarily due to $4.6 million of benefits from ongoing RCI initiatives, $3.6 million of savings from material cost reductions and $3.1 million of lower restructuring costs. The year over year gross margin comparison also benefited from favorable manufacturing utilization as a result of increased production levels in 2010. Segment operating expenses of $225.6 million in 2010 increased $2.2 million, or 1.0%, from 2009 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 26.6% in 2010 improved 210 basis points from 28.7% in 2009 primarily due to $6.8 million of savings from ongoing RCI initiatives, $1.3 million of lower restructuring costs and $0.9 million of favorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses in 2010 also benefited from $5.4 million of lower year over year bad debt expense; in 2009, the segment incurred higher bad debt expense primarily related to increased credit exposure at North American automotive dealerships. These year over year improvements were partially offset by higher product development and other expenses. Restructuring costs included in operating expenses totaled $1.9 million in 2010 as compared to $3.2 million in 2009. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings of $164.4 million in 2010 increased $42.3 million, or 34.6%, from 2009 levels, including $0.6 million from favorable foreign currency effects. As a percentage of segment net sales, operating earnings for the Repair Systems & Information Group of 19.4% in 2010 increased 370 basis points from 15.7% in 2009. 2011 ANNUAL REPORT 39 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Financial Services (Amounts in millions) 2010 2009 Change Financial services revenue $ 62.3 100.0% $ 58.3 100.0% $ 4.0 6.9% Financial services expenses (47.9) 76.9% (40.8) 70.0% (7.1) 17.4% Segment operating earnings $ 14.4 23.1% $ 17.5 30.0% $ (3.1) 17.7% Operating earnings from financial services was $14.4 million on $62.3 million of revenue in 2010, as compared with operating earnings of $17.5 million on revenue of $58.3 million in 2009. Originations of $538.2 million in 2010 increased $40.1 million, or 8.1%, from 2009 levels. Since the July 16, 2009 termination of the financial services operating agreement with CIT, Snap on has been providing financing for the majority of new loans originated by SOC and SOC is recording the interest yield on the new on book receivables over the life of the contracts as financial services revenue. Prior to July 16, 2009, SOC sold substantially all new contract originations to CIT and recorded gains on the sale of the contracts as financial services revenue. The $3.1 million decrease in year over year operating earnings from financial services included $0.7 million of favorable foreign currency effects. See Notes 1, 2, 3 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on SOC. Corporate Snap ons general corporate expenses of $78.3 million in 2010 increased $33.0 million from $45.3 million in 2009 primarily due to $17.3 million of increased performance based incentive compensation expense, $16.3 million of higher pension expense (largely due to the ongoing amortization of investment losses incurred in 2008 related to the companys domestic pension plan assets) and $6.2 million of higher stock based (mark to market) expense. These year over year increases were partially offset by $8.0 million of savings primarily from ongoing cost containment and other actions.

Snap on believes that its cash from operations, coupled with its sources of borrowings and available cash on hand, are sufficient to fund its currently anticipated requirements for new loans originated by SOC, working capital, capital expenditures, restructuring activities, the funding of pension plans, payment of dividends and interest, and funding for additional share repurchases and acquisitions, if any. Due to Snap ons credit rating over the years, external funds have been available at a reasonable cost. As of the close of business on February 11, 2012, Snap ons long term debt and commercial paper was rated, respectively, Baa1 and P 2 by Moodys Investors Service; A and A 2 by Standard & Poors; and A and F2 by Fitch Ratings. Snap on believes that its current credit arrangements are sound and that the strength of its balance sheet affords the company the financial flexibility to respond to both internal growth opportunities and those available through acquisitions. Snap on cannot provide any assurances of the availability of future financing or the terms on which it might be available, or that its debt ratings may not decrease. The following discussion focuses on information included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of 2011 year end, working capital (current assets less current liabilities) of $946.9 million increased $62.5 million from $884.4 million at 2010 year end. The following represents the companys working capital position as of 2011 and 2010 year end: (Amounts in millions) 2011 2010 Cash and cash equivalents $ 185.6 $ 572.2 Trade and other accounts receivable net 463.5 443.3 Finance receivables net 277.2 215.3 Contract receivables net 49.7 45.6 Inventories net 386.4 329.4 Other current assets 168.3 159.7 Total current assets 1,530.7 1,765.5 Notes payable and current maturities of long term debt (16.2) (216.0) Accounts payable (124.6) (146.1) Other current liabilities (443.0) (519.0) Total current liabilities (583.8) (881.1) Total working capital $ 946.9 $ 884.4 Cash and cash equivalents as of 2011 year end totaled $185.6 million as compared to $572.2 million at the end of 2010. The $386.6 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents is primarily due to (i) the August 15, 2011 repayment of $200 million of unsecured notes upon maturity; (ii) the funding of new loans originated by SOC; (iii) the return of $89.8 million of cash previously withheld from CIT (as discussed below); (iv) the fourth quarter 2011 funding of a $48.0 million discretionary cash contribution to the companys domestic pension plans; and (v) the deployment of increased inventory levels. On May 5, 2011, Snap on and CIT reached an amicable settlement of their dispute related to their former SOC joint venture and, in the second quarter of 2011, Snap on recorded an $18.0 million pretax arbitration settlement gain and paid $89.8 million of cash to CIT, representing $107.8 million of cash previously withheld net of the $18.0 million settlement. See Notes 1 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the dispute and resulting settlement with CIT. Trade and other accounts receivable net of $463.5 million as of 2011 year end increased $20.2 million from 2010 year end levels; excluding $4.6 million of unfavorable currency translation impacts, trade and other accounts receivable increased $24.8 million. Days sales outstanding (year end trade and other accounts receivable net divided by full year sales, times 360 days) at 2011 year end improved to 58 days as compared to 61 days at 2010 year end. 44 SNAP ON INCORPORATED The current portions of net finance and contract receivables as of 2011 year end totaled $326.9 million as compared to $260.9 million last year. The long term portions of net finance and contract receivables as of 2011 year end totaled $596.9 million as compared to $465.0 million last year. The combined $197.9 million increase in net current and long term finance and contract receivables over year end 2010 levels is primarily due to continued growth of the companys on balance sheet finance portfolio. Inventories of $386.4 million as of 2011 year end increased $57.0 million from 2010 levels primarily to support higher demand, mitigate potential supply chain disruption and improve customer service levels; excluding $3.9 million of unfavorable currency translation impacts, inventories increased $60.9 million. Inventory turns (trailing 12 months of cost of goods sold, divided by the average of the beginning and ending inventory balance for the trailing 12 months) were 4.2 turns and 4.7 turns as of 2011 and 2010 year end, respectively. Inventories accounted for using the first in, first out (FIFO) method as of 2011 and 2010 year end approximated 62% and 64% of total inventories, respectively. All other inventories are accounted for using the LIFO method. The companys LIFO reserve was $70.1 million as of 2011 year end and $68.4 million at 2010 year end. Notes payable and current maturities of long term debt of $16.2 million as of 2011 year end decreased $199.8 million from 2010 year end levels primarily due to the August 15, 2011 repayment of $200 million of unsecured 6.25% notes upon maturity. Accounts payable of $124.6 million as of 2011 year end decreased $21.5 million from 2010 levels; excluding foreign currency translation impacts, accounts payable decreased $21.6 million, primarily due to the timing of payments. Other accrued liabilities of $255.9 million as of 2011 year end compared to $346.9 million as of 2010 year end. The $91.0 million decrease from year end 2010 levels is largely due to the reversal of a $107.8 million accrued liability as a consequence of the arbitration settlement with CIT (discussed above). Snap on paid $89.8 million of cash to CIT in the second quarter of 2011, representing $107.8 million of cash previously withheld net of the $18.0 million settlement gain. Long term debt of $967.9 million at 2011 year end included: (i) $100 million of unsecured 5.85% notes that mature in 2014; (ii) $150 million of unsecured 5.50% notes that mature in 2017; (iii) $250 million of unsecured 4.25% notes that mature in 2018; (iv) $200 million of unsecured 6.70% notes that mature in 2019; (v) $250 million of unsecured 6.125% notes that mature in 2021; and (vi) $17.9 million of other long term debt, including fair value adjustments related to interest rate swaps. Average commercial paper and notes payable outstanding were $15.8 million in 2011 and $15.1 million in 2010. The weighted average interest rate on these instruments was 6.14% in 2011 and 5.27% in 2010. As of 2011 and 2010 year end, the weighted average interest rate on outstanding notes payable was 6.57 and 5.54%, respectively. No commercial paper was outstanding as of 2011 or 2010 year end. On December 8, 2011, Snap on entered into a five year, $500 million multi currency revolving credit facility that terminates on December 8, 2016. This facility replaced Snap ons previous $500 million multi currency revolving credit facility that was set to terminate on August 10, 2012; as of 2011 year end, no amounts were outstanding under this facility. The $500 million revolving credit facilitys financial covenant requires that Snap on maintain, as of each fiscal quarter end, either (i) a ratio of total debt to the sum of total debt plus shareholders equity (including noncontrolling interests) of not greater than 0.60 to 1.00; or (ii) a ratio of total debt to the sum of net income plus interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and other non cash or extraordinary charges for the preceding four fiscal quarters then ended of not greater than 3.50 to 1.00. As of 2011 year end, the companys actual ratios of 0.39 and 1.71, respectively, were both within the permitted ranges as set forth in this financial covenant. Snap on also has a 364 day loan and servicing agreement, which expires on September 28, 2012, that allows Snap on to borrow up to $200 million (subject to borrowing base requirements) through the pledging of finance receivables under an asset backed commercial paper conduit facility. On September 30, 2011, the previous loan and servicing agreement, which allowed Snap on to secure borrowings of up to $100 million (subject to base borrowing requirements), was amended to, among other things, (i) increase the aggregate revolving credit commitments under the agreement to a principal amount of up to $200 million (subject to base borrowing requirements); (ii) extend the expiration date of the agreement from September 30, 2011 to September 28, 2012 (unless earlier terminated or subsequently extended pursuant to the terms of the agreement); (iii) provide that any amounts remaining outstanding under the agreement as of September 30, 2014, or such earlier date as may be prescribed pursuant to the terms of the agreement, will become due and payable on such date; and (iv) change certain pricing terms. As of 2011 and 2010 year end, no amounts were outstanding under the loan and servicing agreement. 2011 ANNUAL REPORT 45 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Snap on previously had $20 million of additional available debt capacity under committed bank lines of credit that expired in the third quarter of 2011 and were not renewed. In addition to the financial covenant required by the $500 million multi currency revolving credit facility discussed above, Snap ons debt agreements and credit facilities, including the $200 million loan and servicing agreement, also contain certain usual and customary borrowing, affirmative, negative and maintenance covenants. As of 2011 year end, Snap on was in compliance with all covenants of its debt agreements and credit facilities. Snap on believes that it has sufficient available cash and uncommitted lines of credit and liquidity facilities to cover its expected funding needs on both a short term and long term basis. Snap on manages its aggregate short term borrowings so as not to exceed its availability under its revolving credit facilities. If the need were to arise, Snap on believes that it could access short term debt markets, predominantly through commercial paper issuances, securitizations (including its $200 million loan and servicing agreement discussed above) and existing lines of credit to fund its short term requirements and to ensure near term liquidity. Snap on regularly monitors the credit and financial markets and, in the future, may take advantage of what it believes are favorable market conditions to issue long term debt to further improve its liquidity and capital resources. Near term liquidity requirements for Snap on include funding to support new loans originated by SOC, working capital, capital expenditures, restructuring activities, the funding of pension plans, payment of dividends and interest, and funding for additional share repurchases and acquisitions, if any. Snap on also intends to make contributions of $12.6 million to its foreign pension plans and $18.3 million to its domestic pension plans in 2012, as required by law. Depending on market and other conditions, Snap on may elect to make discretionary cash contributions to its domestic pension plans in 2012. Snap ons long term financing strategy is to maintain continuous access to the debt markets to accommodate its liquidity needs, including the potential use of commercial paper, securitizations and or additional fixed term debt. The following discussion focuses on information included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $128.5 million in 2011, $140.4 million in 2010 and $347.1 million in 2009. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2011 reflects the return of $89.8 million of cash previously withheld from CIT (as discussed above) and net changes in operating assets and liabilities as a result of higher sales and increased customer demand, including $88.3 million of higher trade, contract and other receivables and $60.9 million of increased inventories, partially offset by higher 2011 net earnings. In each of the fourth quarters of 2011 and 2010, Snap on made discretionary cash contributions of $48.0 million to the companys domestic pension plans. Depreciation expense was $49.3 million in 2011, $48.7 million in 2010 and $49.9 million in 2009. Amortization expense was $25.3 million in 2011, $24.0 million in 2010 and $24.7 million in 2009. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on acquired intangible assets. Following the July 2009 acquisition of CITs ownership interest in SOC, Snap on began presenting Provisions for losses on finance receivables on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow as part of Net cash provided by operating activities. The non cash provision for loan losses on finance receivables totaled $13.3 million in 2011 and $13.9 million in 2010; for the period from July 2009 to fiscal 2009 year end, the non cash provision for loan losses on finance receivables totaled $6.2 million. Prior to July 2009, the non cash provisions for loan losses on finance receivables, which primarily related to the companys international finance subsidiaries, are included in (Increase) decrease in contract receivables; prior period amounts were not restated as the amounts were not significant, individually or in the aggregate, to Snap ons Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow also reflect, beginning in 2010, the Provision for losses on non finance receivables. The non cash provision for losses on non finance receivables totaled $12.9 million in 2011 and $20.5 million in 2010. Prior to 2010, the provisions for losses on non finance receivables are included in (Increase) decrease in trade and other accounts receivable and (Increase) decrease in contract receivables as part of Net cash provided by operating activities; prior year amounts were not restated as the amounts were not significant, individually or in the aggregate, to Snap ons Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on receivables. 46 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Investing Activities Net cash used by investing activities of $219.6 million in 2011 included additions to, and collections of, finance receivables of $519.1 million and $356.9 million, respectively. Net cash used by investing activities of $303.0 million in 2010 included additions to, and collections of, finance receivables of $497.6 million and $245.2 million, respectively. Following the termination of CITs ownership interest in SOC in July 2009, Snap on began presenting Additions to finance receivables and Collections of finance receivables on its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow as part of Net cash used by investing activities. Finance receivables are comprised of extended term installment loans to technicians (i.e. franchisees customers) to enable them to purchase tools, diagnostics and equipment on an extended term payment plan, generally with average payment terms of 32 months. For financial statement periods prior to July 2009, the net additions and collections of finance receivables, which primarily related to the companys international finance subsidiaries, are included in (Increase) decrease in contract receivables; prior period amounts were not restated as the amounts were not significant, individually or in the aggregate, to Snap ons Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. Capital expenditures in 2011, 2010 and 2009 totaled $61.2 million, $51.1 million and $64.4 million, respectively. Capital expenditures over the last three years included spending to support the companys strategic growth initiatives, including the expansion of manufacturing capabilities in lower cost regions and emerging growth markets. In 2011, capital expenditures also included the construction of a new engineering and research and development facility in Kunshan, China. Capital expenditures in all three years included investments, particularly in the United States, in new product, efficiency, safety and cost reduction initiatives, as well as investments in new production and machine tooling to enhance manufacturing operations, and ongoing replacements of manufacturing and distribution equipment. Capital spending in 2011 and 2010 included spending to enhance the companys corporate headquarters and research and development facilities in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Capital spending in all three years also included spending for the replacement and enhancement of the companys existing global enterprise resource planning (ERP) management information systems. Capital expenditures in 2009 included spending for the construction of a new headquarters and research and development facility for the companys automotive parts and service information business in Richfield, Ohio. Snap on believes that its cash generated from operations, as well as its available cash on hand and funds available from its credit facilities will be sufficient to fund the companys capital expenditure requirements in 2012. Snap on acquired the remaining 40% interest in Snap on Asia Manufacturing (Zhejiang) Co., Ltd., the companys tool manufacturing operation in Xiaoshan, China, in April 2010 for a purchase price of $7.7 million and $0.1 million of transaction costs. Snap on acquired the initial 60% interest in 2008 for a cash purchase price of $15.4 million (or $14.1 million, net of cash acquired), including $1.2 million of transaction costs. This acquisition is part of the companys ongoing strategic initiatives to further expand its manufacturing presence in emerging growth markets and lower cost regions. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Snap on terminated its SOC financial services operating agreement with CIT in July 2009 and subsequently purchased, pursuant to the terms of the joint venture agreement, CITs 50% ownership interest in SOC for a cash purchase price of $8.1 million. The $8.1 million purchase price represented the book value, and approximated the fair value, of CITs ownership interest in SOC as of the acquisition date. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Financing Activities Net cash used by financing activities of $293.7 million in 2011 included the August 15, 2011 repayment of $200 million of unsecured 6.25% notes upon maturity with available cash. In December 2010, Snap on sold $250 million of unsecured 4.25% long term notes at a discount; Snap on is using, and has used, the $247.7 million of proceeds from the sale of these notes, net of $1.6 million of transaction costs, for general corporate purposes, which included working capital, capital expenditures, repayment of all or a portion of the companys $200 million 6.25% unsecured notes that matured on August 15, 2011, and the financing of finance and contract receivables related to SOC. In January 2010, Snap on repaid $150 million of unsecured floating rate debt upon its maturity with available cash. In February 2009, Snap on sold $300 million of unsecured fixed rate notes consisting of $100 million of unsecured 5.85% notes that mature in 2014, and $200 million of unsecured 6.70% notes that mature in 2019. In August 2009, Snap on sold $250 million of unsecured 6.125% long term notes that mature in 2021. Snap on is using, and has used, the $545.9 million of proceeds from the sale of these notes, net of $4.1 million of transaction costs, for general corporate purposes, 2011 ANNUAL REPORT 47 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) including the funding of receivables contracts originated by SOC and the January 2010 repayment of $150 million of floating rate debt. Proceeds from stock purchase plans and stock option exercises totaled $25.7 million in 2011. Snap on has undertaken stock repurchases from time to time to offset dilution created by shares issued for employee and dealer stock purchase plans, stock options and other corporate purposes. In 2011, Snap on repurchased 628,000 shares of its common stock for $37.4 million under its previously announced share repurchase programs. As of 2011 year end, Snap on had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $157.1 million in common stock pursuant to its Board of Directors (Board) authorizations. The purchase of Snap on common stock is at the companys discretion, subject to prevailing financial and market conditions. Snap on repurchased 152,000 shares of its common stock for $8.7 million in 2010; Snap on did not repurchase any shares of its common stock in 2009. Snap on believes that its cash generated from operations, available cash on hand, and funds available from its credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund the companys share repurchases, if any, in 2012. Snap on has paid consecutive quarterly cash dividends, without interruption or reduction, since 1939. Cash dividends paid in 2011, 2010 and 2009 totaled $76.7 million, $71.3 million and $69.0 million, respectively. On November 4, 2011, the company announced that its Board increased the quarterly cash dividend by 6.3% to $0.34 per share ($1.36 per share per year). Quarterly dividends declared in 2011 were $0.34 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.32 per share in the first three quarters ($1.30 per share for the year). Quarterly dividends in 2010 were $0.32 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.30 per share in the first three quarters ($1.22 per share for the year). Quarterly dividends in 2009 were $0.30 per share ($1.20 per share for the year). 2011 2010 2009 Cash dividends paid per common share $ 1.30 $ 1.22 $ 1.20 Cash dividends paid as a percent of prior year retained earnings 4.7% 4.7% 4.7% Snap on believes that its cash generated from operations, available cash on hand and funds available from its credit facilities will be sufficient to pay dividends in 2012. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Except as included below in the section labeled Contractual Obligations and Commitments and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the company had no off balance sheet arrangements as of 2011 year end. Contractual Obligations and Commitments A summary of Snap ons future contractual obligations and commitments as of 2011 year end are as follows: (Amounts in millions) Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 andthereafter Contractual obligations: Notes payable and current maturities of long term debt $ 16.2 $ 16.2 $ $ $ Long term debt 967.9 100.0 867.9 Interest on fixed rate debt 362.4 53.4 102.0 95.2 111.8 Operating leases 90.0 25.9 34.2 15.0 14.9 Capital leases 27.4 2.5 4.4 4.0 16.5 Purchase obligations 6.4 5.7 0.7 Total $ 1,470.3 $ 103.7 $ 241.3 $ 114.2 $ 1,011.1 Snap on intends to make contributions of $12.6 million to its foreign pension plans and $18.3 million to its domestic pension plans in 2012, as required by law. Depending on market and other conditions, Snap on may elect to make discretionary cash contributions to its domestic pension plans in 2012. Snap on has not presented estimated pension and postretirement funding contributions in the table above as the funding can vary from year to year based upon changes in the fair value of the plan assets and actuarial assumptions; see Notes 11 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the companys benefit plans and payments. 48 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Due to the uncertainty of the timing of settlement with taxing authorities, Snap on is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of unrecognized tax benefits for its remaining uncertain tax liabilities. As a result, $11.0 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the table above; see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on income taxes. Environmental Matters Snap on is subject to various federal, state and local government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Snap ons policy is to comply with these requirements and the company believes that, as a general matter, its policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with its business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in some of Snap ons operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses. Snap on is and has been engaged in the handling, manufacture, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies. Snap on believes that, as a general matter, its handling, manufacture, use and disposal of these substances are in accordance with environmental laws and regulations. It is possible, however, that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could bring into question the companys handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these substances. New Accounting Standards See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on new accounting standards. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to managements discussion and analysis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are generally based on historical experience, current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources, as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The companys significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Snap on considers the following policies and estimates to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Revenue Recognition: Snap on recognizes revenue from the sale of tools, diagnostics and equipment solutions when contract terms are met, the price is fixed or determinable, collectability is reasonably assured and a product is shipped or risk of ownership has been transferred to and accepted by the customer. For sales contingent upon customer acceptance, revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations are fulfilled. Estimated product returns are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale based upon historical product return experience and gross profit margin adjusted for known trends. Provisions for customer volume rebates, discounts and allowances are also recorded as a reduction of reported revenues at the time of sale based on historical experience and known trends. Revenue related to maintenance and subscription agreements is recognized over the terms of the respective agreements. Snap on also recognizes revenue related to multiple element arrangements, including sales of hardware, software and software related services. When a sales arrangement contains multiple elements, such as hardware and software products and or services, Snap on uses the relative selling price method for hardware and related software elements that are essential to the hardwares functionality. For software elements that are not essential to the hardwares functionality and related software post contract customer support, vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value is used to allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value and, when necessary, uses the residual method to assign value to the delivered elements when VSOE only exists for the undelivered elements. The amount assigned to future 2011 ANNUAL REPORT 49 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) delivery of products or services is recognized when the product is delivered and or when the services are performed. In instances where the product and or services are performed over an extended period, as is the case with subscription agreements or the providing of ongoing support, revenue is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement, which generally ranges from 12 to 60 months. Franchise fee revenue, including nominal, non refundable initial and ongoing monthly fees (primarily for sales and business training and marketing and product promotion programs), is recognized as the fees are earned. Financial Services Revenue: Snap on also generates revenue from various financing programs that include (i) loans to franchisees customers and Snap ons industrial and other customers for the purchase or lease of tools, equipment and diagnostics products on an extended term payment plan; and (ii) business loans and vehicle leases to franchisees. These financing programs are offered through Snap ons wholly owned finance subsidiaries. Financial services revenue consists of finance loan receivable revenue, installment contract revenue and servicing fee income received from CIT. For periods prior to July 16, 2009, financial services revenue also included gains from SOCs sales of originated contracts to CIT. The decision to finance through Snap on or another financing entity is solely at the election of the customer. When assessing customers for potential financing, Snap on considers various factors regarding ability to pay including customers financial condition, collateral, debt servicing ability, past payment experience and credit bureau information. For finance and contract receivables, Snap on assesses these factors through the use of credit quality indicators consisting primarily of consumer credit risk scores combined with internal credit risk grades, collection experience and other internal metrics. Prior to July 2009, SOC substantially sold all of its loan originations to CIT on a limited recourse basis; SOC retained the right to service such loans for a contractual servicing fee. Contractual servicing fees were $2.3 million in 2011, $4.9 million in 2010 and $8.3 million in 2009. Snap ons international finance subsidiaries own the loans originated through their financing programs; loans originated by SOC subsequent to July 2009, and loans retained by SOC prior to July 2009, are also owned by Snap on. Revenue from interest income on the on book financing portfolio is recognized over the life of the contracts, with interest computed on the average daily balances of the underlying contracts. Impairment of Goodwill and Other Indefinite lived Intangible Assets: Goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. Annual impairment tests are performed by the company in the second quarter of each year. Snap on evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the businesses to which the goodwill relates. Estimated cash flows and related goodwill are grouped at the reporting unit level. The company has determined that its reporting units for testing goodwill impairment are its operating segments or components of an operating segment that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results. Within its four reportable operating segments, the company has identified 11 reporting units. Snap on evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows of the reporting units to which the goodwill relates. The future projections, which are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in the companys operating plans, are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. This approach reflects managements internal outlook for the reporting units, which management believes provides the best determination of value due to managements insight and experience with the reporting unit. Significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on expected growth rates, price increases, working capital levels, expected RCI benefits, and a weighted average cost of capital that reflects the specific risk profile of the reporting unit being tested. The companys methodologies for valuing goodwill are applied consistently on a year over year basis; the assumptions used in performing the second quarter 2011 impairment calculations were evaluated in light of current market and business conditions. Snap on continues to believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the reporting units projections of future operating results and cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the companys reporting units in an orderly transaction. 50 SNAP ON INCORPORATED In the event the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, including goodwill, the company would then perform an additional assessment that would compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill. The determination of implied fair value of goodwill would require management to compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit; if necessary, the company may consult with valuation specialists to assist with the assessment of the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss would be recorded. Snap on also evaluates the recoverability of its indefinite lived trademarks by utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows of each of its trademarks. The future projections, which are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in the companys operating plans, are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. Significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on expected growth and royalty rates, expected synergies, and a weighted average cost of equity that reflects the specific risk profile of the trademark being tested. The companys methodologies for valuing trademarks are applied consistently on a year over year basis; the assumptions used in performing the second quarter 2011 impairment calculations were evaluated in light of current market and business conditions. Snap on continues to believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the trademarks projected future cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the companys trademarks in an orderly transaction. Snap on did not recognize any impairment on its goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets in 2011, 2010 or 2009. Inherent in fair value determinations are significant judgments and estimates, including material assumptions about future revenue, profitability and cash flows, the companys operational plans and its interpretation of current economic indicators. Should the operations of the businesses with which goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets are associated incur significant declines in profitability and cash flow due to significant and long term adverse changes in business climate, including in Europe, adverse actions by regulators, unanticipated competition, loss of key customers, and or changes in technology or markets, some or all of the recorded goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets could be subject to impairment and could result in a material adverse effect on Snap ons financial position or results of operations. Snap on completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets in the second quarter of 2011, the results of which did not result in any impairment. Although the company consistently uses the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations, such estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results. In performing its annual impairment testing the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the material assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation models for each of its 11 reporting units. Based on the companys second quarter 2011 impairment testing and assuming a hypothetical 10% decrease in the estimated fair values of each of its 11 reporting units, the hypothetical fair value of each of the companys 11 reporting units would have been greater than its carrying value. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about goodwill and other intangible assets. Impairment of Long lived and Amortized Intangible Assets: Snap on performs impairment evaluations of its long lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives, whenever business conditions or events indicate that those assets may be impaired. When the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying value of the long lived assets, the assets are written down to fair market value and a charge is recorded to current operations. Significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances, such as significant and long term adverse changes in business climate, including in Europe, adverse actions by regulators, unanticipated competition, loss of key customers and or changes in technology or markets, could require a provision for impairment in a future period. 2011 ANNUAL REPORT 51 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Allowances for Doubtful Accounts: Snap on maintains allowances for doubtful accounts to absorb probable losses inherent in its portfolio of receivables. The allowances for doubtful accounts represent managements estimate of the losses inherent in the companys receivables portfolio based on ongoing assessments and evaluations of collectability and historical loss experience. In estimating losses inherent in each of its receivable portfolios (trade, finance and contract receivables), Snap on uses historical loss experience rates by portfolio and applies them to a related aging analysis. Determination of the proper level of allowances by portfolio requires management to exercise significant judgment about the timing, frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the provision for credit losses and, therefore, net income. The allowances for doubtful accounts takes into consideration numerous quantitative and qualitative factors, by loan type, including historical loss experience, portfolio duration, collection experience, delinquency trends, economic conditions and credit risk quality as follows: Snap on evaluates the collectability of receivables based on a combination of various financial and qualitative factors that may affect the customers ability to pay. These factors may include customers financial condition, collateral, debt servicing ability, past payment experience and credit bureau information. For finance and contract receivables, Snap on assesses quantitative and qualitative factors through the use of credit quality indicators consisting primarily of customer credit risk scores combined with internal credit risk grades, collection experience and other internal metrics as follows: Credit risk Personal credit risk is monitored regularly on an account by account basis through customer credit scores obtained from major credit bureaus as well as through the use of internal proprietary, custom scoring models used to evaluate each transaction at the time of the application for credit and by periodically updating those credit scores for ongoing monitoring purposes. In addition, Snap on evaluates credit quality through the use of a loan risk grading measurement system that provides a framework to analyze the finance and contract receivables on the basis of risk factors of the individual obligor as well as transaction specific risk. Collection experience Snap on conducts monthly reviews of credit and collection performance for each of its finance and contract receivable portfolios focusing on data such as delinquency trends, non performing assets, charge off and recovery activity. These reviews allow for the formulation of collection strategies and potential collection policy modifications in response to changing risk profiles in the finance and contract receivable portfolios. Other internal metrics Snap on maintains a system that aggregates credit exposure by customer, industry, risk classification and geographical area, among other factors, to further monitor changing risk profiles. Management performs detailed reviews of its receivables on a monthly and or quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowances based on historical and current trends and other factors affecting credit losses and to determine if any impairment has occurred. A receivable is impaired when it is probable that all amounts related to the receivable will not be collected according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. In circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations, a specific reserve is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected. Additions to the allowances for doubtful accounts are maintained through adjustments to the provision for credit losses, which are charged to current period earnings; amounts determined to be uncollectable are charged directly against the allowances, while amounts recovered on previously charged off accounts increase the allowances. Net charge offs include the principal amount of losses charged off as well as charged off interest and fees. Recovered interest and fees previously charged off are recorded through the allowances for doubtful accounts. Finance receivables are assessed for charge off when an account becomes 120 days past due and are charged off typically within 60 days of asset repossession. Contract receivables related to equipment leases are generally charged off when an account becomes 150 days past due while contract receivables related to franchise finance and van leases are generally charged off up to 180 days past the asset return. For finance and contract receivables, customer bankruptcies are generally charged off upon notification that the associated debt is not being reaffirmed or, in any event, no later than 180 days past due. Snap on does not believe that trade accounts, finance or contract receivables represent significant concentrations of credit risk because of the diversified portfolio of individual customers and geographical areas. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on allowances for doubtful accounts. 52 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Excess and Obsolete Inventory: Snap on records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions. Allowances for raw materials are largely based on an analysis of raw material age and actual physical inspection of raw material for fitness for use. As part of evaluating the adequacy of allowances for work in progress and finished goods, management reviews individual product stock keeping units (SKUs) by product category and product life cycle. Cost adjustments for each product category/product life cycle state are generally established and maintained based on a combination of historical experience, forecasted sales and promotions, technological obsolescence, inventory age and other actual known conditions and circumstances. Should actual product marketability and raw material fitness for use be affected by conditions that are different from management estimates, further adjustments to inventory allowances may be required. Pension Benefits: The pension benefit obligation and related pension expense are calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of Snap ons control and can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements. Snap on believes that the two most critical assumptions are (i) the expected return on plan assets; and (ii) the assumed discount rate. Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases. Lowering the expected rate of return assumption for Snap ons domestic pension plan assets by 50 basis points would have increased Snap ons 2011 domestic pension expense by approximately $3.2 million. Snap on uses a three year, market related value asset method of amortizing the difference between actual and expected returns on its domestic plan assets. The objective of Snap ons discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. In making this determination, the company takes into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans. The methodology for selecting the discount rate as of 2011 and 2010 year end was to match the plans cash flows to that of a theoretical bond portfolio yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zero coupon bonds with an AA rating or better for each maturity. The selection of the 4.5% weighted average discount rate for Snap ons domestic pension plans represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments. Lowering Snap ons domestic discount rate assumption by 50 basis points would have increased Snap ons 2011 domestic pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately $5.2 million and $57.4 million, respectively. At 2011 year end, Snap ons domestic projected benefit obligation comprised approximately 83% of Snap ons worldwide projected benefit obligation. The weighted average discount rate for Snap ons foreign pension plans of 4.7% represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments. Lowering Snap ons foreign discount rate assumption by 50 basis points would have increased Snap ons 2011 foreign pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately $1.7 million and $18.4 million, respectively. Actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or market related value of assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period of active participants. Prior service costs resulting from plan amendments are amortized in equal annual amounts over the average remaining service period of affected active participants or over the remaining life expectancy of affected retired participants. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on pension plans. Postretirement Benefits: Snap ons postretirement benefits obligation and related expense are calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions, including health care trend rates. As of 2011 year end, an increase of one percentage point in health care costs would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $1.7 million and the combined annual service and interest cost by $0.1 million. A corresponding decrease of one percentage point would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit by $1.5 million and the combined annual service and interest cost by $0.1 million. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on postretirement plans. Income Taxes: Snap on records deferred income tax assets and liabilities for differences between the book basis and tax basis of the related net assets. Snap on records a valuation allowance, when appropriate, to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. While the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. 2011 ANNUAL REPORT 53 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) In addition, the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on income taxes. Outlook Snap on believes that continued advancement of its strategic framework will provide the opportunity to further capitalize on its defined runways for coherent growth and create long term value for its shareholders. Specific opportunities for growth in 2012 include the areas of vehicle repair, critical industries and emerging markets. In vehicle repair, the company intends to continue to enhance its mobile tool distribution network by reaching more vehicle repair technicians. Similarly, Snap on seeks to further penetrate another key customer group within vehicle repair shop owners and managers through direct and distributor channels within its Repair Systems & Information Group. The company also expects, as part of its coherent growth strategy, to continue rolling the Snap on&reg; brand out of the garage, providing professional technicians in a diverse cross section of critical industries with a broad range of productivity solutions suited to their unique needs. In addition, Snap on intends to continue investing in emerging markets, including the further expansion of its manufacturing capacity and product offerings in this arena. However, global market and economic conditions in 2012 may impact the level and timing of resources deployed in pursuit of these strategic initiatives, and Snap ons ability to achieve growth will depend on these as well as other factors that impact the companys actual results. In pursuit of these strategic initiatives, Snap on anticipates that capital expenditures in 2012 will be in a range of $60 million to $70 million. Restructuring expenses in 2012 will include an estimated $6 million to $8 million charge in the second quarter of 2012 associated with the settlement of a pension plan related to the 2011 closure of the Newmarket, Canada, facility; pension expense in 2012, exclusive of this charge, is expected to be comparable with 2011 levels. Snap on anticipates that its full year 2012 effective income tax rate will approximate 33.5%. 54 SNAP ON INCORPORATED Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market, Credit and Economic Risks Market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments. Snap on is exposed to market risk from changes in both foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Snap on monitors its exposure to these risks and attempts to manage the underlying economic exposures through the use of financial instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swap agreements and treasury lock agreements. Snap on does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Snap ons broad based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole. Snap ons management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. Foreign Currency Risk Management Snap on has significant international operations and is subject to certain risks inherent with foreign operations that include currency fluctuations and restrictions on movement of funds. Foreign exchange risk exists to the extent that Snap on has payment obligations or receipts denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. To manage these exposures, Snap on identifies naturally offsetting positions and then purchases hedging instruments to protect the residual net exposures. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on foreign currency risk management. Interest Rate Risk Management Snap on aims to control funding costs by managing the exposure created by the differing maturities and interest rate structures of Snap ons assets and liabilities through the use of interest rate swap agreements. Treasury lock agreements are used to manage potential changes in interest rates in anticipation of the issuance or sale of certain financial instruments. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on interest rate risk management. Snap on utilizes a Value at Risk (VAR) model to determine the potential one day loss in the fair value of its interest rate and foreign exchange sensitive financial instruments from adverse changes in market factors. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. Snap ons computations are based on the inter relationships among movements in various currencies and interest rates (variance/co variance technique). These inter relationships were determined by observing interest rate and foreign currency market changes over the preceding quarter. The estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value, calculated using the VAR model, as of 2011 year end was $2.3 million on interest rate sensitive financial instruments and $0.6 million on foreign currency sensitive financial instruments. The VAR model is a risk management tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by Snap on, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors. Credit Risk Credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customers failure to make payments according to contract terms. Prior to granting credit, each customer is evaluated, taking into consideration the borrowers financial condition, collateral, debt servicing capacity, past payment experience, credit bureau information, and other financial and qualitative factors that may affect the borrowers ability to repay. Credit risk is also monitored regularly through the use of internal proprietary, custom scoring models used to evaluate each transaction at the time of the application for credit and by periodically updating those credit scores for ongoing monitoring purposes. Snap on evaluates credit quality through the use of an internal proprietary measuring system that provides a framework to analyze finance and contract receivables on the basis of risk factors of the individual obligor as well as transaction specific risk. Loans that have been granted are typically monitored through an asset quality review process that closely monitors past due accounts and initiates a progressive collection action process when appropriate. In addition to its direct credit risk exposure, Snap on also has credit risk exposure for certain SOC originated contracts with recourse provisions related to franchisee van loans sold by SOC; as of 2011 year end, $13.9 million of franchisee van loans contain a recourse provision to Snap on if the loans become more than 90 days past due. 2011 ANNUAL REPORT 55 Counterparty Risk Snap on is exposed to credit losses in the event of non performance by the counterparties to various financial agreements, including its foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swap agreements and treasury lock agreements. Snap on does not obtain collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk, but monitors the credit standing of the counterparties and enters into agreements only with financial institution counterparties with a credit rating of A or better. Snap on does not anticipate non performance by its counterparties, but cannot provide assurances. Economic Risk Economic risk is the possibility of loss resulting from economic instability in certain areas of the world. Snap on continually monitors its exposure in these markets. As a result of the above market, credit and economic risks, net income and revenues in any particular period may not be representative of full year results and may vary significantly from year to year. Inflation has not had a significant impact on the company. Commodity Risk Snap on is a purchaser of certain commodities such as steel, natural gas and electricity. The company is also a purchaser of components and parts that are integrated into the companys end products, as well as the purchaser of certain finished goods, all of which may contain various commodities including steel, aluminum and others. Snap ons supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers. The principal raw material used in the manufacture of the companys products is steel, which the company purchases in competitive, price sensitive markets. To meet Snap ons high quality standards, the companys steel needs range from specialized alloys, which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers, to commodity types of alloys. These raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality. Some of these materials have been, and in the future may be, in short supply. As some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures, Snap on could experience inventory shortages if it were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice. Additionally, unexpected price increases could result in higher prices to Snap ons customers or an erosion of the margins on its products. Snap on believes its ability to sell product is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road, the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles. These factors affect the frequency, type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians, and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians, the prosperity of the technicians and, subsequently, the demand the technicians have for the companys tools, other products and services, and the value they place on those products and services. To the extent that the prices of gasoline and other petroleum based fuels increase, as they have at times in recent years, consumers may turn to other methods of transportation, including more frequent use of public transportation, which could result in a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles. A decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for the companys products. To the extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm pricing agreements with its suppliers, the company may experience margin declines to the extent that it is not able to increase the selling prices of its products.
