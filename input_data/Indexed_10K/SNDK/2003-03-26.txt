These statements may contain words such as expects, anticipates, intends, plans, believes, estimates, or other wording indicating future results or expectations. Forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in these forward looking statements. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Factors That May Affect Future Results below, and elsewhere in this report. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially affected by any of these factors. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward looking statements to reflect any event or circumstance that may arise after the date of this report. Overview SanDisk was founded in 1988 to develop and market flash data storage systems. We sell our products to the consumer electronics and industrial/ communications markets. In fiscal 2002, approximately 87% of our product sales were attributable to the consumer electronics market, particularly sales of CompactFlash, or CF card, Secure Digital, or SD card, Memory Stick and SmartMedia card products for use in digital camera applications. Our CF card products have lower average selling prices and gross margins than our higher capacity FlashDisk and FlashDrive products. In addition, a substantial portion of our products are sold into the retail channel, which usually has shorter customer order lead times than our other channels. A majority of our sales to the retail channel are turns business, with orders received and fulfilled in the same quarter, thereby decreasing our ability to accurately forecast future production needs and sales levels. We believe sales to the consumer market will continue to represent a substantial majority of our sales, and may increase as a percentage of sales in future years, as the popularity of consumer applications with flash memory, including digital cameras, mobile phones and mobile phones that incorporate digital cameras and PDAs, increases. Our operating results are affected by a number of factors including the volume of product sales, competitive pricing pressures, availability of foundry capacity, variations in manufacturing cycle times, fluctuations in manufacturing yields and manufacturing capacity utilization, the timing of significant orders, our ability to match supply with demand, changes in product and customer mix, market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our products, changes in the channels through which our products are distributed, timing of new product announcements and introductions by us and our competitors, the timing of license and royalty revenues, fluctuations in product costs, increased research and development expenses, and exchange rate fluctuations. We have experienced seasonality in the past. As the proportion of our products sold for use in consumer electronics applications increases, our revenues may become increasingly subject to seasonal increases in the fourth quarter of each year and declines in the first quarter of the following year. See Factors That May Affect Future Results Risks Related to Our Business Our operating results may fluctuate significantly. . . . and Risks Related to Sales of Our Products There is seasonality in our business . . . . Beginning in late 1995, we adopted a strategy of licensing our flash technology, including our patent portfolio, to third party manufacturers of flash products. To date, we have entered into patent cross license agreements with several companies, and intend to pursue opportunities to enter into additional licenses. Under our current license agreements, licensees pay license fees, royalties, or a combination thereof. In some cases, the compensation to us may be partially in the form of guaranteed access to flash memory manufacturing capacity from the licensee company. The timing and amount of royalty payments and the recognition of license fees can vary substantially from quarter to quarter depending on the terms of each agreement and, in some cases, the timing of sales of products by the other parties. As a result, license and royalty revenues have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future. Given the relatively high gross margins associated with license and royalty revenues, gross margins and net income are likely to fluctuate more with changes in license and royalty revenues than with changes in product revenues. We market our products using a direct sales organization, distributors, manufacturers representatives, private label partners, OEMs and retailers. In 2002, 2001 and 2000, retail sales accounted for 64%, 54% and 21 Table of Contents 28% of total product revenues, respectively. We expect that sales through the retail channel will comprise an increasing share of our product revenues in the future, and that a substantial portion of our sales into the retail channel will be made to customers that will have the right to return unsold products. Our policy is to defer recognition of revenues from these sales until the products are sold to the end customers. In 2002, sales to the OEM and Industrial channels accounted for 36% of total product revenues, compared to 46% in 2001 and 72% in 2000. However, total revenue dollars from our OEM and Industrial channels increased 20% in 2002, compared to 2001. Historically, a majority of our sales have been to a limited number of customers. Sales to our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 48% 49%, and 48%, of our product revenues for 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. In 2002, 2001 and 2000, no single customer accounted for greater than 10% of our total revenues. We expect that sales of our products to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our product revenues for the foreseeable future. We have also experienced significant changes in the composition of our customer base from year to year and expect this pattern to continue as market demand for our customers products fluctuates. The loss of, or a significant reduction in purchases by any of our major customers, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Factors That May Affect Future Results Risks Related to Sales of Our Products Sales to a small number of customers represent a significant portion of our revenues . . . . All of our flash memory products require silicon wafers, a substantial majority of which is currently manufactured for us by Toshiba Corporations, or Toshiba, wafer facility in Yokkaichi, Japan, under our joint venture agreement. Additionally, in August 2002, we entered into a seven year supply agreement with Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., or Samsung, which allows us to purchase NAND flash memory products from Samsungs fabrication facilities in South Korea. Industry wide demand for semiconductors decreased significantly in 2001, due to decreased demand in the cellular phone markets and the broad, general economic downturn leading to a U.S. recession. Semiconductor manufacturers, including some of our suppliers and competitors, added new advanced wafer fabrication capacity prior to the downturn. This additional capacity, along with slowing economic conditions, resulted in excess supply and led to intense pricing pressure. Due to the oversupply of flash memory foundry capacity throughout 2001 and the economic slowdown in 2001, the decline in our average selling price per megabyte of 50% in 2001 compared to 2000 was much more severe than the 22% decrease we experienced in 2000 compared to 1999. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the average sales price per megabyte we sold decreased by 68% compared to the fourth quarter of 2000. This decline in 2001 far exceeded our ability to reduce our cost per megabyte. Consequently we saw a dramatic reduction in our product gross margins, which resulted in substantial operating losses in 2001. In 2002, due to competitive pricing pressures, our average selling price per megabyte declined by approximately 50% when compared to 2001. In the fourth quarter of 2002, the average sales price per megabyte we sold decreased by 31%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2001. If industry wide demand for our products for prolonged periods is below the industry wide available supply, our product prices could decrease faster than our ability to reduce costs resulting in operating losses in the future. Under our wafer supply agreements with Toshiba, FlashVision, Samsung, Tower Semiconductor Ltd., or Tower, and UMC, we are obligated to provide a six month rolling forecast of anticipated purchase orders. Generally, the estimates for the first three months of each rolling forecast are binding commitments. The estimates for the remaining three months of the forecast may only be changed by a certain percentage from the previous months forecast. In addition, we are obligated to purchase 50% of all of FlashVisions wafer production. This limits our ability to react to significant fluctuations in demand for our products. If customer demand falls below our forecast and we are unable to reschedule or cancel our orders, we may end up with excess inventories, which could result in higher operating expenses and reduced gross margins. Conversely, if customer demand exceeds our forecasts, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of wafers and flash memory products to fill customer orders, which could result in lost sales and lower revenues. If we are unable to obtain scheduled quantities of wafers or flash memory products with acceptable prices and or yields from any foundry, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. We have from time to time taken write downs for excess or obsolete inventories and lower of cost or market price adjustments. In 2001 for example, such write downs and lower of cost or market adjustments 22 Table of Contents were approximately $85.0 million. We may be forced to take additional write downs for excess or obsolete inventory in future quarters if market demand for our products deteriorates and our inventory levels exceed customer orders. In addition, we may record additional lower of cost or market price adjustments to our inventories if pricing pressure results in a net realizable value that is lower than our cost. Although we continuously try to align our inventory quantities with the current level of business, we are obligated to honor existing purchase orders, which we have placed with our suppliers. In the case of FlashVision, both we and Toshiba are obligated to purchase our half of the production output, which makes it more difficult for us to reduce our inventory during an industry downturn. Excess inventory not only ties up our cash, but also can result in substantial losses if such inventory, or large portions thereof, has to be written down due to lower market pricing or product obsolescence. These inventory adjustments decrease gross margins and in 2001 resulted in, and could in the future result in, fluctuations in gross margins and net earnings in the quarter in which they occur. See Factors That May Affect Future Results Risks Related to Our Business Our operating results may fluctuate significantly . . . . Export sales are an important part of our business, representing 51%, 55%, and 57% of our total revenues in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. Our sales may be impacted by changes in economic conditions in our international markets. Economic conditions in our international markets, including Japan, Asia and the European Union, may adversely affect our revenues to the extent that demand for our products in these regions declines. While most of our sales are denominated in U.S. Dollars, we invoice certain Japanese customers in Japanese Yen and are subject to exchange rate fluctuations on these transactions, which could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Factors That May Affect Future Results Risks Related to Our International Operations, Threats of War, and Changes in Securities Laws and Regulations Because of our international operations, we must comply with numerous laws and regulations . . . . For the foreseeable future, we expect to realize a significant portion of our revenues from recently introduced and new products. Typically, new products initially have lower gross margins than more mature products because the manufacturing yields are lower at the start of manufacturing each successive product generation. In addition, manufacturing yields are generally lower at the start of manufacturing any product at a new foundry. In 2001 and 2002, we experienced start up costs of approximately $22.0 million and $6.5 million, respectively, associated with ramping up NAND wafer production at FlashVision. During the start up phase, the fabrication equipment and operating expenses are applied to a relatively small output of production wafers, making this output very expensive. In the next two to three years, we expect to make substantial new investments in additional fabrication capacity at FlashVision. We expect to fund up to approximately $33.0 million for the initial fabrication capacity expansion in 2003. Such increases in fabrication capacity are expected to cause us to periodically experience startup costs of a material nature. To remain competitive, we are focusing on a number of programs to lower manufacturing costs, including development of future generations of NAND flash memory. There can be no assurance that we will successfully develop such products or processes or that development of such processes will lower manufacturing costs. If the current industry wide and worldwide economic slowdown continues throughout fiscal 2003, we may be unable to efficiently utilize the NAND flash wafer production from FlashVision, which would force us to amortize the fixed costs of the fabrication facility over a reduced wafer output, making these wafers significantly more expensive. See Factors That May Affect Future Results Risks Related to Vendors and Subcontractors We and our manufacturing partners must achieve acceptable manufacturing yields . . . . Critical Accounting Policies & Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those 23 Table of Contents related to customer programs and incentives, product returns, bad debts, inventories, investments, income taxes, warranty obligations, restructuring, and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Revenue Recognition, Sales Returns and Allowances and Sales Incentive Programs. We recognize net revenues when the earnings process is complete, as evidenced by an agreement with the customer, transfer of title and acceptance, if applicable, fixed pricing and reasonable assurance of collectibility. Because of frequent sales price reductions and rapid technology obsolescence in the industry, sales made to distributors and retailers under agreements allowing price protection and or right of return are deferred until the retailers or distributors sell the merchandise to the end customer, or the rights of return expire. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, deferred income, net of related costs, from sales to distributors and retailers was $34.8 million and $6.2 million, respectively. Estimated product returns are provided for and were not material for any period presented in the consolidated financial statements. We earn patent license and royalty revenue under patent cross license agreements with several companies including Hitachi Ltd., or Hitachi, Lexar Media, Inc., or Lexar, Samsung, Sharp Electronics Corporation, or Sharp, Silicon Storage Technology, Inc., or SST, SmartDisk Corporation, Sony Corporation, or Sony, and TDK. Our current license agreements provide for the payment of license fees, royalties, or a combination thereof, to us. The timing and amount of these payments can vary substantially from quarter to quarter, depending on the terms of each agreement and, in some cases, the timing of sales of products by the other parties. Patent license and royalty revenue is recognized when earned. In 2002, 2001 and 2000, we received payments under these cross license agreements, portions of which were recognized as revenue and portions of which are deferred revenue. We receive royalty revenue reports from certain of our licensees and record all revenues one quarter in arrears. Our cross license arrangements, that include a guaranteed access to flash memory supply, were recorded based upon the cash received for the arrangement as we do not have vendor specific objective evidence for the fair value of the intellectual property exchanged or supply guarantees received. Under these arrangements we have recorded the cash received as the total value of goods received and are amortizing the amounts over the life of the agreement, which corresponds to the life of the supply arrangement as well. Recognition of deferred revenue is expected to occur in future periods over the life of the agreements, as we meet certain obligations as provided in the various agreements. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, deferred revenue from patent license agreements was $32.1 million and $9.6 million, respectively. The cost of revenues associated with patent license and royalty revenues are insignificant. We record reductions to revenue and trade accounts receivable for customer programs and incentive offerings including promotions and other volume based incentives when revenue is recorded. Marketing development programs, when granted, are either recorded as a reduction to revenue or as an addition to marketing expense depending on the contractual nature of the program and whether the conditions of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00 25, Vendor Income Statement Characterization Paid to a Reseller of the Vendors Products, have been met. These incentives generally apply only to our retail customers, which represented 64%, 54% and 28% of our product revenues in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. If market conditions were to decline, we may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings to our retail customers, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. In circumstances where we are aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations to us (e.g., bankruptcy filings, substantial down grading of credit ratings), we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. For all other customers, we recognize reserves for bad debts based on the length of time the receivables are past due based on our historical experience. If circumstances change (i.e., 24 Table of Contents higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customers ability to meet its financial obligations to us), our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount. Warranty Costs. Our products are warrantied for one to seven years. A provision for the estimated future cost related to warranty expense is recorded and included in the cost of revenue when revenue is recognized. While we engage in product quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and repair or replacement costs incurred in correcting a product failure. Should actual product failure rates, or repair or replacement costs differ from our estimates, increases to our warranty liability would be required. Valuation of Financial Instruments. Our short term investments include investments in marketable equity and debt securities. We also have equity investments in, UMC of $113.0 million and Tower of $21.3 million, as of December 31, 2002. In determining if and when a decline in market value below amortized cost of these investments is other than temporary, we evaluate the market conditions, offering prices, trends of earnings, price multiples, and other key measures for our investments in marketable equity securities and debt instruments. When such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, we recognize an impairment loss in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline. In 2002, the market value of our investment in Tower declined significantly therefore, we recognized losses totaling $11.6 million related to the other than temporary decline of our equity investment, and an adjustment to the fair value of warrants purchased during 2002 of $0.7 million as determined using a Black Scholes option pricing model. In 2001, the market value of our investment in UMC and Tower declined. The declines were deemed to be other than temporary and losses totaling $302.3 million were recognized. If the fair value of the Tower and UMC investments decline further, it may be necessary to record additional losses. See Note 8 in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Inventories and Inventory Valuation. We write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions, including assumptions about changes in average selling prices. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required. Deferred Tax Assets. Based on the weight of available evidence, we provided a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance was based on our assessment of our historical earnings patterns that make it uncertain that we will have sufficient income in the appropriate jurisdictions to realize the full value of the assets. We will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. The valuation allowance increased by $30.3 million and $36.1 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. We had no valuation allowance at December 31, 2000. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets includes approximately $5.2 million attributable to stock option deductions, the benefit of which will be credited to stockholders equity upon realization. Results of Operations We operate in one business segment, flash memory products. Our products are sold throughout the world. In the United States and foreign countries our products are sold through direct, OEM, reseller, and distributor channels. Our chief decision maker, our President and Chief Executive Officer, evaluates our performance based on total results. Revenue is evaluated based on geographic region and product category. Separate financial information is not available by product category in regards to asset allocation, expense allocation, or profitability. Product Revenues. In 2002, our product revenues were $492.9 million, up $176.0 million or 56% from $316.9 million in 2001. The increase in product revenues was primarily due to a 65% increase in unit sales, partially offset by a 6% decrease in average selling prices per unit. In fiscal 2002, the largest unit volume and revenue increases came from our CF card, SD card, Memory Stick, and FlashDisk products, compared to the prior year. In 2002, total flash memory units sold increased approximately 73% compared to 2001. In 2002, due to competitive pricing pressures, our average selling price per megabyte declined by approximately 50% 25 Table of Contents when compared to 2001. In the fourth quarter of 2002, compared to the fourth quarter of 2001, our average selling prices per megabyte declined 31%. In 2001, our product revenues were $316.9 million, a decrease of 40% from $526.4 million in 2000. The decrease was primarily due to the downturn in the worldwide economy, industry wide excess supply of flash memory, and reduced demand from OEM customers who were liquidating existing inventories throughout most of 2001. All of these factors reduced the demand for our products and resulted in intense pricing pressures causing the average selling price of our products to decline significantly. In 2001, the largest decline in revenues came from MultiMediaCards, due to the slowdown in the market for digital music players and CompactFlash, due to the decline in average selling price. In 2001, our flash memory product unit sales declined 19% and our average selling price per megabyte of flash memory shipped declined 50% compared to 2000. Due to the oversupply of flash memory foundry capacity throughout 2001 and the economic slow down in 2001, the decline in our average selling price per megabyte of 50% was much more severe than the 22% decrease we experienced in 2000. Our backlog as of December 31, 2002 was $31.7 million, compared to $19.5 million in 2001. This increase in backlog was primarily due to higher bookings in the consumer, OEM and industrial markets. As of December 31, 2002, backlog associated with our retail channel increased by 56%, compared to the same period in 2001. Backlog in our OEM channel increased by 65% as of December 31, 2002, as compared to 2001, due to higher demand than that experienced in 2001. Since orders constituting our current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules or cancellations, backlog is not necessarily an indication of future revenue. See Factors That May Affect Future Results Risks Related to Our Business Our operating results may fluctuate significantly . . . . and Risks Related to Sales of Our Products There is seasonality in our business . . . . In 2002, OEM sales represented 26% of our product revenues, compared to 34% of our product revenues in 2001 and 57% in 2000. Retail revenues, which are typically booked and shipped in the same quarter, increased to 64% of our product revenues from 54% in 2001 and 28% in 2000. We expect sales to the retail channel to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues in 2003. License and Royalty Revenues. We currently earn patent license fees and royalties under several cross license agreements, including agreements with Hitachi, Lexar, Sharp, Samsung, Sony, SST, and TDK. License and royalty revenues from patent cross license agreements were $48.4 million in 2002 compared to $49.4 million in 2001 and $75.5 million in 2000. The decrease in license and royalty revenues between 2000 and 2001 were primarily due to lower patent royalties from lower royalty bearing sales by some of our licensees resulting in decreased patent license revenues recognized. The higher license and royalty revenues in 2000 compared to 2001 were primarily due to increased sales by certain of our licensees in 2000, and $4.7 million of revenue recognized in conjunction with the settlement of the Lexar litigation in 2000. Revenues from licenses and royalties were 9% of total revenues in 2002, and 13% in both 2001 and 2000. Our income from patent licenses and royalties can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. A substantial portion of this income comes from royalties based on the actual sales by our licensees. Gross Profits (Losses). In fiscal 2002, gross profits were $188.8 million, or 35% of total revenues compared to negative $26.0 million, or negative 7% of total revenues in 2001 and positive $244.8 million, or 41% of total revenues in 2000. Product gross margins were 29% in 2002 compared to a negative 24% in 2001, and positive 32% in 2000. The increase in product gross margin and gross profits in 2002 was due to a combination of factors, including more stable pricing conditions in 2002 than in 2001, lower production costs due to a higher mix of more cost effective multi level cell, or MLC, chips, significantly lower overhead expenses due to our restructuring activities in 2001 and improved economies of scale due to the growth in unit volumes across our major product lines. In addition, we sold approximately $11.9 million worth of NOR inventory that had been fully written off as excess or obsolete in previous years. The decline in gross margins in 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to lower sales volume, severely reduced average selling prices, inventory write downs of approximately $85.0 million and start up costs associated with our FlashVision foundry joint venture of approximately $22.0 million. 26 Table of Contents Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and payroll related expenses for design and development engineers, prototype supplies and contract services. Research and development expenses increased to $63.2 million in 2002 from $58.9 million in 2001, and $46.1 million in 2000. As a percentage of revenues, research and development expenses were 12% in 2002, 16% in 2001 and 8% in 2000. In 2002, the absolute dollar increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to a $2.7 million increase in salaries and payroll related expenses associated with increased personnel. In 2001, the increase was primarily due to an increase of $13.3 million in project related expenses. The additional project expenses in 2001 were to support the development of new generations of NAND flash data storage products. We expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods to support the development and introduction of new generations of flash data storage products, including our development efforts at our joint venture with Toshiba, our co development agreement with Sony and our continual development of advanced controller chips. Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses include salaries, sales commissions, benefits and travel expenses for our sales, marketing, customer service and applications engineering personnel. These expenses also include other selling and marketing expenses such as independent manufacturers representative commissions, advertising and tradeshow expenses. Sales and marketing expenses decreased to $40.4 million in 2002 from $42.6 million in 2001 and $49.3 million in 2000. In 2002, the decrease was due primarily to decreased co op advertising expenses of $7.0 million, which as of the beginning of fiscal 2002 are offset against revenue per applicable accounting literature, partially offset by an increase in commissions of $4.3 million related to higher product revenues. If we had been required to retroactively apply the same accounting treatment of recording these co op advertising expenses as offsets to revenue per new accounting literature prior to our fiscal year 2002, we estimate that selling and marketing expenses would have been reduced by approximately $5.2 million and $5.7 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively. The decrease in 2001 was primarily due to a decrease of $5.6 million in commission expenses due to lower product revenues, a decrease in marketing expenses of $1.1 million and a reduction of $0.7 million in travel expenses. Sales and marketing expenses represented 7% of total revenues in 2002 compared to 12% in 2001 and 8% in 2000. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as sales of our products grow and as we continue to develop the retail channel and brand awareness for our products. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses include the cost of our finance, information systems, human resources, shareholder relations, legal and other administrative functions. General and administrative expenses were $27.1 million in 2002 compared to $17.0 million in 2001 and $24.8 million in 2000. The increase in 2002 was due primarily to an increase in legal fees of $6.6 million, increased payroll related expenses of $5.0 million and an increase of $1.3 million in allowance for doubtful accounts associated with higher trade accounts receivable balances from increased revenues. The decrease in 2001 was primarily due to a decrease of $3.2 million in legal fees, a reduction of $3.2 million in the allowance for doubtful accounts related to lower accounts receivable balances and a decrease of $0.7 million in salaries and related expenses associated with reduced headcount. General and administrative expenses represented 5% of total revenues in 2002 and 2001 compared to 4% in 2000. General and administrative expenses could increase in the future if we pursue litigation to defend our patent portfolio and grow our infrastructure to support our growth. See Factors That May Affect Future Results Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property We may be unable to license intellectual property to or from third parties .. . . . Restructuring Charges. In the third quarter of 2001, we adopted a plan to transfer all of our card assembly and test manufacturing operations from our Sunnyvale location to offshore subcontractors. As a result we recorded a restructuring charge of $8.5 million in the third quarter of 2001. The charge included $1.4 million of severance and employee related costs for a reduction in workforce of approximately 193 personnel, equipment write off charges of $6.0 million and lease commitments of $1.1 million on a vacated warehouse facility. As a part of our plan to transfer all card assembly and test manufacturing operations to offshore subcontractors, we abandoned excess equipment and recorded a charge of $6.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2001. As of January 2003, we have subleased a portion of our warehouse building in San Jose, California. Given the current real estate market conditions in the San Jose area, we do not expect to be able to sublease the 27 Table of Contents remainder of this building before the end of 2003. Any sublease income will be offset against the balance of the lease commitment restructuring charge recorded in the third quarter of 2001. Of the $8.5 million restructuring charge, cash payments of $0.8 million and $1.1 million were paid in 2001 and 2002 respectively. After writing off certain non cash charges related to abandoned excess equipment, accruals of $0.6 million remain as of December 31, 2002, related to amounts to be paid out for excess facility lease charges, net of facility sub lease income, over the respective lease terms. The following table summarizes our restructuring activities from the inception of our plan through the end of 2002: Workforce Lease Equipment Reduction Commitments Total (In thousands) Restructuring Charge $ 6,383 $ 1,094 $ 1,033 $ 8,510 Non cash charges (6,027 ) (6,027 ) Cash payments (805 ) (805 ) Accrual balance, December 31, 2001 $ 356 $ 289 $ 1,033 $ 1,678 Non cash charges (17 ) (17 ) Adjustments (339 ) 321 18 Cash payments (610 ) (471 ) (1,081 ) Accrual balance, December 31, 2002 $ $ $ 580 $ 580 Equity in Income of Joint Venture. In 2002 and 2001, equity in income of joint ventures of $0.9 million and $2.1 million included our share of net income from our FlashVision joint venture and losses from our Digital Portal Inc., or DPI, joint venture. Under the equity method of accounting, our share of losses were deducted from our DPI investment account and therefore, as of December 31, 2002 there is no value related to DPI on our consolidated balance sheet. In September 2002, we agreed to sell a significant portion of our DPI shares to a nominee of Photo Me International, PLC., or PMI, to reduce our ownership percentage below 20%, and we gave up our seat on DPIs board of directors. Under the agreement, we discontinued our kiosk related activities, are no longer required to make additional equity investments in DPI, guarantee DPIs equipment leases or otherwise pay any of DPIs expenses and DPI will no longer use the SanDisk brand name. In future periods, we will account for our remaining investment in DPI on a cost basis. Interest Income/ Expense. Interest income was $8.7 million in 2002 compared to $12.4 million in 2001 and $22.8 million in 2000. The decrease in interest income in 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily due to reductions in market interest rates. The decrease in interest income in 2001 compared to 2000 was also due to reductions in interest rates and as well as the funding of our strategic investments in Tower and FlashVision. Interest expense was $6.7 million in 2002 on our convertible subordinated notes, or notes, issued in late 2001 and early 2002. In 2003, we expect interest expense to be consistent and interest income to remain flat with an increase in cash balances offset by the additional impact of lower interest rates on our portfolio as existing securities mature and lower yielding securities are purchased. Loss on investment in foundries. The market value of our investment in Tower and related wafer credits has declined significantly over 2002 and 2001 due to the continuing semiconductor industry downturn. As of December 31, 2002, we had invested $68.0 million in Tower and obtained 6,100,959 ordinary Tower shares, $6.0 million of prepaid wafer credits, and a warrant to purchase 360,313 ordinary Tower shares at an exercise price of $7.50 per share. This warrant expires on October 31, 2006. At December 31, 2002, the value of our Tower investment and wafer credits had declined to $27.3 million. Losses totaling $15.2 million, or $9.4 million net of tax, were recorded in 2002, comprised of a $11.6 million related to the other than temporary decline of our equity investment, a $0.7 million adjustment to the fair value of warrants purchased during 2002 as determined using a Black Scholes option pricing model, and a $2.8 million write down in the value of wafer credits. At December 31, 2001, the value of our Tower investment and wafer credits had declined to $16.6 million. Therefore, we recorded a loss of $20.6 million, which included the write off of wafer 28 Table of Contents credits received in 2001. In addition, we recorded a loss of $5.5 million on our exchange of 75% of our Tower wafer credits for 1,284,007 ordinary Tower shares at $12.75 per share. These losses totaled $26.1 million, or $15.8 million net of tax benefit in 2001. In both 2002 and 2001, Tower losses were recorded in loss on investment in foundry. If the fair value of our Tower investment declines further, it may be necessary to record additional losses. We periodically assess the value of the prepaid wafer credits for recoverability and write down the value as necessary. In 2001, we determined that our investment in UMC had sustained a substantial decline in its value as defined by generally accepted accounting principles The value of our investment in UMC had declined to $194.9 million at December 31, 2001. We recorded a loss of $275.8 million on our UMC investment in 2001, or $166.9 million net of taxes. At December 31, 2002, the market value of the available for sale portion of our UMC investment had declined $6.6 million, before tax, below its adjusted cost of $112.0 million, and this unrealized loss of approximately $6.6 million is included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on our consolidated balance sheet as this unrealized loss was deemed to be temporary. If the fair value of our UMC investment declines further, it may be necessary to record additional losses. In addition, in future periods, if our UMC shares are sold, there may be a gain or loss, due to fluctuations in the market value of UMCs stock. Gain (Loss) on Equity Investment. In 2002 we recognized an impairment charge on the decline in the value of our investment in Divio, Inc., or Divio of $2.7 million, or $1.7 million net of tax, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115. At December 31, 2002, the value of our Divio investment had declined to $4.5 million. Divio is currently unprofitable, and will require additional funding from external sources to complete the development and commercialization of its products. Given the current depressed conditions for financing private, venture capital backed startup companies, we cannot assure you that Divio will be able to successfully finance its activities or continue its operations. If they cannot do so, our investment in Divio will be written down further or may even become worthless. Other Income (Loss), Net. Other Income (Loss), net was a loss of $3.1 million in 2002 compared to a loss of $1.0 million in 2001 and income of $572,000 in 2000. The losses in 2002 and 2001 were primarily due to foreign currency transaction losses on our Yen denominated assets. Other income in 2000 came primarily from foreign currency transaction gains. Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes. Our 2002 effective tax provision rate was approximately 9%, while our 2001 and 2000 effective tax rates were approximately (33%) and 39%, respectively. Our 2002 tax rate is significantly lower than the statutory rate due to utilization of previously unbenefited net operating losses and a reduction of the valuation allowance due to the increase in the unrealized gain on our investment in UMC. Our assessment of the amount of valuation allowance required will be influenced by the amount of unrealized tax gains on investments. Any increase in the mark to market value of the investments may result in the recognition of some portion of the valuation allowance. This may cause the interim tax rate to fluctuate significantly. Due to our lack of visibility over the likelihood of generating future taxable income, we have not recognized a deferred tax asset in excess of the amount that will be available to offset our deferred tax liability. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows At December 31, 2002, we had working capital of $584.4 million, which included $266.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $189.9 million in unrestricted short term investments, excluding our investments in UMC and Tower. Operating activities for 2002 provided $105.6 million of cash, primarily due to net income of $36.2 million; a $26.9 million decrease in income tax refund receivable, plus non cash charges, primarily depreciation of $21.3 million, a decrease of $8.1 million in our investment in FlashVision, a $9.4 million decrease in accounts 29 Table of Contents payable, a $51.1 million increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors and retailers and deferred revenue, and a $3.8 million decrease in income taxes payable. These were partially offset by increases of $37.6 million in accounts receivable, $33.3 million in inventory, and $7.7 million in deferred taxes. Cash used by operations was $72.1 million in 2001, and cash provided by operations was $84.9 million 2000. Net cash used in investing activities was $58.4 million in 2002. Purchases net of proceeds from short term investments of $84.1 million, $16.6 million of capital equipment purchases and $26.0 million invested in Tower during fiscal 2002 were partially offset by a $4.2 million return of capital received in the first quarter of, 2002 from FlashVision L.L.C. Net cash provided in investing activities was $25.1 million in 2001 and net cash used of $137.9 million in 2000. Net cash provided by financing activities was $29.9 million 2002, which included the $24.3 million net proceeds from the issuance of long term convertible subordinated notes in the first quarter of 2002, and $5.5 million from the sale of common stock through our stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Financing activities provided cash of $130.2 million in 2001 and $13.2 million in 2000. Depending on the demand for our products, we may decide to make additional investments, which could be substantial, in assembly and test manufacturing equipment or wafer fabrication foundry capacity to support our business in the future. We may also invest in or acquire other companies product lines or assets. Our operating expenses may increase as a result of the need to hire additional personnel to support our sales and marketing efforts and research and development activities, including our collaboration with Toshiba for the joint development of 90 nanometer and 70 nanometer NAND flash memory. We plan to fund our short term operations from our current cash and short term investment balances and cash generated from operations. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. However, if our average product selling prices decline significantly, as they did in 2001 and 2002, or demand for our products declines and we are required to purchase more wafers than we need due to our FlashVison joint venture commitments, we may not be able to generate enough cash from our operations and will have to rely solely on our current cash and short term investment balances to fund our operating activities. Convertible Subordinated Notes On December 24, 2001, we completed a private placement of $125.0 million of 4 1/2% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006, or Notes, and on January 10, 2002, the initial purchasers completed the exercise of their option to purchase an additional $25.0 million of Notes, for which we received net proceeds of approximately $145.9 million. Based on the aggregate principal amount at maturity of $150.0 million, the Notes provide for semi annual interest payments of $3.4 million each on May 15 and November 15. The Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at any time prior to the close of business on the maturity date, unless previously redeemed or repurchased, at a conversion rate of 54.2535 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, subject to adjustment in certain events. At anytime on or after November 17, 2004, we may redeem the notes in whole or in part at a specified percentage of the principal amount plus accrued interest. The debt issuance costs are being amortized over the term of the Notes using the interest method. We intend to fulfill our debt service obligations from cash generated by our operations, if any, and from our existing cash and investments. If necessary, among other alternatives, we may add lease lines of credit to finance capital expenditures and obtain other long term debt and lines of credit. We may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our debt service obligations, including our obligations under the Notes. Investment in UMC In January 2000, the USIC foundry was merged into the UMC parent company. In exchange for our USIC shares, we received 111 million UMC shares. These shares were valued at approximately $396 million at the time of the merger, resulting in a pretax gain of $344.2 million ($203.9 million after tax) in the first quarter of 2000. All of the UMC shares we received as a result of the merger in 2000 were subject to trading restrictions imposed by UMC and the Taiwan Stock Exchange. As of December 31, 2002, the trading 30 Table of Contents restrictions had expired on 77.8 million shares. The remaining 33.3 million shares will become available for sale through January 2004. We also received 23.0 million, 20.0 million and 22.2 million shares as stock dividends from UMC in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Due to the decline in UMC stock price from the weakness in the semiconductor industry, the value of our investment in UMC had declined to $194.9 million at December 31, 2001. Therefore in 2001, it was determined that the decline in the market value of the investment was other than temporary, as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and a loss of $275.8 million, or $166.9 million net of taxes was recorded in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Number 115. The loss was included in loss on investment in foundry. The UMC shares received as stock dividends for the three years ending December 31, 2002 are included in the 165 million shares classified as available for sale in accordance with SFAS No. 115, are reported at a market value of $105.4 million and included in current assets on our consolidated balance sheet. We also have 11 million shares that contain trading restrictions that extend beyond one year, which are valued at their adjusted cost of $7.5 million and included in non current assets. UMCs share price declined to NT$22.20 at December 31, 2002 from a stock dividend adjusted price of NT$42.87 at December 31, 2001 resulting in a $81.8 million reduction in our previously recorded unrealized gain on the portion of our investment that is classified as available for sale. At December 31, 2002, the market value of the available for sale portion of our UMC investment had declined $6.6 million, before tax, below its adjusted cost of $112.0 million, and this unrealized loss of approximately $6.6 million is included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on our consolidated balance sheet as this decline was deemed to temporary. If the fair value of the UMC investment declines further, it may be necessary to record additional losses. In addition, in future periods, there may be a gain or loss due to fluctuations in the market value of UMC stock or if UMC shares are sold. Investment in FlashVision Joint Venture On June 30, 2000, we closed a transaction with Toshiba providing for the joint development and manufacture of 512 megabit and 1 gigabit flash memory chips and Secure Digital Card controllers. As part of this transaction, we and Toshiba formed FlashVision, a joint venture, to equip and operate a silicon wafer manufacturing line at Toshibas Dominion Semiconductor facility in Manassas, Virginia. In January 2001, we invested the final $15.0 million of our $150.0 million cash commitment in FlashVision L.L.C. In April 2002, we and Toshiba entered into a series of agreements under which we restructured our FlashVision joint venture by consolidating FlashVisions advanced NAND wafer fabrication manufacturing operations at Toshibas memory fabrication facility in Yokkaichi, Japan. Under the terms of the agreements, Toshiba transferred the FlashVision owned and leased NAND production tool set from Dominion to Yokkaichi and undertook full responsibility for the equipment transfer and production set up. The FlashVision operation at Yokkaichi continues the joint venture on essentially the same terms as the parties had at Toshibas facility in Virginia. In March 2002, FlashVision exercised its right of early termination under its lease facility with ABN AMRO Bank, N.V. and in April 2002 repaid all amounts outstanding. FlashVision secured a new equipment lease arrangement of approximately 37.9 billion Japanese Yen (or approximately $305 million based on the exchange rate in effect on the date the agreement was executed) in May 2002 with Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., or Mizuho, and certain other financial institutions. Under the terms of the new lease, Toshiba is required to provide a guarantee to these financial institutions on behalf of FlashVision. We have agreed to indemnify Toshiba in certain circumstances for certain liabilities Toshiba incurs as a result of Toshibas guarantee of the FlashVision equipment lease arrangement. If FlashVision fails to meet its lease commitments and Toshiba fulfills these commitments under the terms of Toshibas guarantee, then we will be obligated to reimburse Toshiba for 49.9% of any claims under the lease, unless such claims result from Toshibas failure to meet its obligations to FlashVision or its covenants to the lenders. Because FlashVisions new equipment lease arrangement is denominated in Japanese Yen, the maximum amount of our contingent indemnification obligation on a given date when converted to U.S. Dollars will fluctuate based on the exchange rate in effect on that date. As of December 31, 2002, the maximum amount of our contingent indemnification obligation, which reflects payments and any lease adjustments, was approximately $142.4 million. In the next two to three years, we expect to make substantial new investments in additional fabrication capacity at FlashVision. We expect to fund up to approximately $33.0 million for the initial fabrication capacity expansion in 2003. 31 Table of Contents Investment in Tower In July 2000, we entered into a share purchase agreement to make a $75.0 million investment in Tower, for its new wafer foundry facility, Fab 2. During 2001, Tower satisfied the closing conditions of the share purchase agreement and completed the first two milestones. Under the terms of the agreement, we invested $42.5 million to purchase 1,599,931 ordinary Tower shares and obtained wafer credits of $21.4 million. In September 2001, we agreed to convert 75% of our wafer credits to equity at a price of $12.75 per share and received an additional 1,284,007 ordinary Tower shares. Due to the continued weakness in the semiconductor industry, the value of our Tower investment and remaining wafer credits had declined to $16.6 million at December 31, 2001. It was determined that this decline was other than temporary, as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and a loss of $20.6 million was recorded in the second half of 2001. In addition we recognized a loss of $5.5 million on the exchange of 75% of our Tower wafer credits for 1,284,007 ordinary shares at $12.75 per share. These losses totaling $26.1 million, or $15.8 million net of tax benefit, were recorded in loss on foundry investment in 2001. In March 2002, we amended our foundry investment agreements with Tower by agreeing to advance the payments for the third and fourth milestones. The payment for the third milestone of $11.0 million was made on April 5, 2002. In exchange for this payment we received 1,071,497 ordinary shares and prepaid wafer credits of $4.4 million. The payment of $11.0 million for the fourth milestone was paid on September 30, 2002. In exchange for this payment we received 1,344,829 ordinary shares of Tower and $4.4 million in prepaid wafer credits. As of December 31, 2002, we had invested $68.0 million in Tower and obtained 6,100,959 ordinary shares, $6.0 million of prepaid wafer credits, and warrants to purchase 360,313 ordinary shares at an exercise price of $7.50 per share. The investment in the ordinary shares represents an approximate 14% equity ownership position in Tower as of December 31, 2002. The wafer credits were applied to our pre paid wafer account and are to be applied against orders placed with Towers new wafer fabrication facility, Fab 2, when and if completed; provided, however, that until July 1, 2005, the amounts added to the pre paid wafer account may only be applied towards a maximum of 7.5% of our wafer purchases. We periodically assess the value of our prepaid wafer credits considering the timing and quantity of our planned annual wafer purchases, the status of the foundry construction and general economic conditions. If we determine that the value of these wafer credits is not recoverable, additional write downs will be recorded. In 2002, we recognized losses of $15.2 million on the other than temporary decline in the value of our Tower investment and the impairment in value on our prepaid wafer credits and approximately $0.7 million unrealized losses related to the fair value of the warrants purchased in October of 2002. Our investment in Tower was valued at $21.3 million as of December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2002, our Tower prepaid wafer credits were valued at $6.0 million, net of $2.8 million in write downs recorded in fiscal 2002, related to the recoverability of these prepaid wafer credits. In addition to our commitment under the share purchase agreement, we invested in Towers rights offering in October 2002. Tower issued one right for each 4.94 shares owned by record holders as of the record date. In exercising our rights to participate, we paid approximately $4.0 million in exchange for 800,695 ordinary Tower shares and a warrant to purchase 360,312 ordinary shares at $7.50 per share. This warrant expires on October 31, 2006. During the fourth quarter of 2002 and in accordance with SFAS 133, we recorded a write down in the fair value of these Tower warrants of approximately $0.7 million, as determined using a Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of these warrants will continue to fluctuate and additional adjustments to the warrants fair value will be recorded in future periods. In February 2003, we agreed to further amend our foundry investment agreements with Tower by agreeing to advance the payment for the fifth and final milestone. This amendment is subject to approval by all required parties, including Towers shareholders. If approved, the terms of the amendment require the payment of $11.0 million for the advanced fifth milestone and this payment will be made in two installments. The first installment of approximately $6.6 million will be due five business days after the amendment is approved by all required parties, including Towers shareholders; the second installment of approximately $4.4 million will be due five business days after Tower has raised additional funds equal to approximately 32 Table of Contents $22.0 million, referred to as the Minimum Financing. Tower must complete the Minimum Financing prior to December 31, 2003, or we will not be obligated to pay the second installment. Each of the first and second installments will be paid provided Tower meets these conditions, whether or not Tower actually achieves its original fifth milestone obligation. Immediately following the advancement of the first installment, we will be issued fully paid and non assessable ordinary shares of Tower equivalent to the first installment divided by the average trading price for ordinary shares of Tower during the thirty (30) consecutive trading days preceding the date the amendment was approved by Towers board of directors. Immediately following the advancement of the second installment, if it occurs, we will be issued fully paid and non assessable ordinary shares of Tower equivalent to the second installment divided by the price per ordinary share of Tower paid in connection with the Minimum Financing, or the Minimum Financing Price; provided, however, that if the Minimum Financing Price cannot reasonably be calculated from the documents evidencing the Minimum Financing, then the Minimum Financing Price shall be deemed to be the average trading price for the ordinary shares of Tower during the thirty (30) consecutive trading days preceding the date the second installment is paid. In addition, we will have the option to convert all or a portion of our unused pre paid wafers credits associated with the September 2002 fourth milestone payment into fully paid and non assessable ordinary shares of Tower based on the average closing price of ordinary shares of Tower during the thirty consecutive trading days preceding December 31, 2005. Towers completion of Fab 2 is dependent on its ability to obtain additional financing for the foundry construction from equity and other sources and the release of grants and approvals for changes in grant programs from the Israeli governments Investment Center. If Tower is unable to obtain additional financing, complete foundry construction in a timely manner or successfully complete the development and transfer of advanced CMOS process technologies, ramp up of production, and secure foundry customers sufficient to defray its fixed operating costs, the value of our investment in Tower and wafer credits will decline significantly or possibly become worthless. We would be unable to take advantage of our prepaid wafer credits and we may be unable to obtain a sufficient supply of wafers to manufacture our products, which would harm our business. In addition, the value of our investment in Tower may be adversely affected by a further deterioration of conditions in the market for foundry manufacturing services and the market for semiconductor products generally. If the fair value of our Tower investment declines further, it may be necessary to record additional losses, which potentially could amount to the remaining recorded value of our Tower investment. Moreover, if Tower is unable to satisfy certain financial covenants and comply with certain conditions as required by its credit facility agreement, and therefore is not able to obtain additional bank financing, or its current bank obligations are accelerated, such failure could jeopardize the completion of Fab 2 and Towers ability to continue operations. Other Equity Investments On August 9, 2000, we entered into a joint venture, DPI, with PMI for the manufacture, installation, marketing, and maintenance of self service, digital photo printing labs, or kiosks, bearing the SanDisk brand name in locations in the U.S. and Canada. Under the agreement, we invested $2.0 million. In an agreement effective September 30, 2002, we and PMI agreed that we would scale down our kiosk activities and PMI would assume responsibility to finance and direct the future growth of DPI. Under the agreement, we converted approximately $400,000 in receivables due from DPI to equity in DPI, reduced our ownership percentage below 20% and gave up our seat on the DPI board of directors. Under the new agreement, we discontinued our kiosk related activities, are no longer required to make additional equity investments in DPI, guarantee DPIs equipment leases or otherwise pay any of DPIs expenses, and furthermore, DPI will no longer use the SanDisk brand name. We have accounted for this investment under the equity method, and in 2002 we recorded a $1.1 million loss as our share of DPIs losses which was deducted from the investment account and therefore, as of December 31, 2002, there is no value related to DPI on our consolidated balance sheet. On November 2, 2000, we made a strategic investment of $7.2 million in Divio, Inc., or Divio. Divio is a privately held manufacturer of digital imaging compression technology and products for future digital camcorders that will be capable of using our flash memory cards to store home video movies, replacing the 33 Table of Contents magnetic tape currently used in these systems. Under the agreement, we own approximately 10% of Divio and are entitled to one board seat. A number of companies are developing compression chip products that may be superior to, or may be offered at a lower cost than the Divio chips. These competing products may render Divios products uncompetitive and thereby significantly reduce the value of our investment in Divio. In 2002, we accounted for this investment under the cost method, and we recorded a decline in the fair value of the investment of $2.7 million. At December 31, 2002, the value of our Divio investment had declined to $4.5 million. Divio is currently unprofitable, and will require additional funding from external sources to complete the development and commercialization of its products. Given the current depressed conditions for financing private, venture capital backed startup companies, we cannot assure you that Divio will be able to successfully finance its activities or continue its operations. If they cannot do so, our investment in Divio will be written down further or may even become worthless. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following summarizes our contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2002, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow over the next five years (in thousands). Less Than Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS: Convertible subordinated notes payable (See Note 4.) $ 150,000 (1) $ $ 150,000 $ Interest payable on convertible subordinated notes 27,000 6,750 13,500 6,750 Operating leases 9,285 3,184 5,071 1,030 Investment in Tower 11,000 11,000 FlashVision Common research and development 68,000 12,000 24,000 32,000 FlashVision Direct research and development 54,000 7,000 23,000 24,000 FlashVision fabrication capacity expansion 33,000 33,000 Purchase commitments for flash memory wafers 23,873 (2) 23,873 Total contractual cash obligations $ 376,158 $ 96,807 $ 215,571 $ 63,780 Less Than Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years CONTRACTUAL SUBLEASE INCOME: Non cancelable operating sublease $ 549 $ 213 $ 336 $ Total contractual cash income $ 549 $ 213 $ 336 $ (1) On January 10, 2002, the initial purchasers completed the exercise of their option to purchase an additional $25.0 million of the Notes. (2) FlashVision binding three month purchase commitments for flash memory wafers are denominated in Japanese Yen, and are subject to fluctuation in exchange rates prior to payment. As of December 31, 2002 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS: Indemnification of FlashVision foundry equipment lease $ 142,351 Impact of Currency Exchange Rates A portion of our revenues is denominated in Japanese Yen. We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2002, there were no 34 Table of Contents forward contracts outstanding. Future exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards In July 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections, and SFAS No. 146, Obligations Associated with Disposal Activities. SFAS 145 rescinds SFAS 4 Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt, an amendment of APB Opinion 30, and SFAS 44 Accounting for Intangible Assets of Motor Carriers, and SFAS 64 Extinguishment of Debt Made to Satisfy Sinking Fund Requirements, and amends SFAS 13 Accounting for Leases. SFAS 145 requires that gains or losses on extinguishment of debt that were classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods which do not meet the criteria in APB 30 for classification as an extraordinary item should be reclassified. In addition, lease modifications having the economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions should be accounted for in the same manner as sale leaseback transactions. The provisions of this statement are effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early application encouraged. We are evaluating the impact of the adoption of SFAS 145 on our results of operations and financial position. SFAS 146 nullifies EITF Issue No. 94 3 Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in Restructuring) and substantially nullifies EITF Issue No. 88 10 Costs Associated with Lease Modification or Termination. SFAS 146 establishes an accounting model for changes in the recognition of and timing of such costs. The liability for costs associated with exit or disposal activities should be measured at fair value and in the period in which those costs are incurred. The provisions of SFAS 146 apply to exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. We will adopt SFAS 146 effective January 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 146 is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position in 2003. On December 31, 2002 the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. SFAS 148 amends SFAS 123 Accounting of Stock Based Compensation and APB Opinion No. 28 Interim Financial Reporting. SFAS 148 provides alternative transition methods for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation, and requires disclosure in both the interim and annual financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and its effect on reported net income and earnings per share. The recognition provisions of SFAS 148 are applied as of the beginning of a companys fiscal year for financial statement periods and interim periods within those fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002, and SFAS 148s amendment of disclosure requirements of APB No. 28 is effective for financial statements ending after December 15, 2002. We have elected not to adopt the recognition provisions of SFAS 148. However, We elected to follow APB 25, and related interpretations, in accounting for our employee stock options. Under APB 25, if the exercise price of the Companys stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized. The disclosure requirements of SFAS 148 for pro forma information regarding reported net income and earnings per share has been adopted for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2002 and will be applied to interim periods in 2003. The adoption of the disclosure provisions of SFAS 148 did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position in 2002, nor is it expected to have a material impact in 2003. In July 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, or FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others an interpretation of SFAS No 5 Accounting for Contingencies, SFAS No. 57 Related Party Disclosures, SFAS No. 107 Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, and rescission of FIN 34 Disclosure of Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 provides disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. FIN 45 establishes recognition and measurement provisions of a liability to be recognized at the inception of a guarantee for fair value based on agreements which contingently requires the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying contingent liability related to the guaranteed party. The disclosure 35 Table of Contents provisions of FIN 45 are effective for financial statement periods and interim periods within those fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002, and the requirement for recognition and measurement provisions are effective for guarantees issued or modified on a prospective basis after December 31, 2002. We have adopted the disclosure provisions for fiscal year ending December 31, 2002 and are evaluating the future impact of the adoption of FIN 45 recognition and measurement provisions on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, or FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FIN 46 requires an investor with a majority of the variable interests in a variable interest entity to consolidate the entity and also requires majority and significant variable interest investors to provide certain disclosures. A variable interest entity is an entity in which the equity investors do not have a controlling interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entitys activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from the other parties. We are currently reviewing our investment portfolio to determine whether any of our equity investments are considered variable interest entities. We do not expect to identify any variable interest entities that must be consolidated, but may be required to make additional disclosures. The maximum exposure of any investment that may be determined to be in a variable interest entity is limited to the amount invested. In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Emerging Issues Task Force (referred to as EITF) Issue No. 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF Issue No. 00 21 addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a company for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities. EITF Issue No. 00 21 addresses when and how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting. EITF Issue No. 00 21 provides guidance with respect to the effect of certain customer rights due to company nonperformance on the recognition of revenue allocated to delivered units of accounting. EITF Issue No. 00 21 also addresses the impact on the measurement and or allocation of arrangement consideration of customer cancellation provisions and consideration that varies as a result of future actions of the customer or the company. Finally, EITF Issue No. 00 21 provides guidance with respect to the recognition of the cost of certain deliverables that are excluded from the revenue accounting for an arrangement. The provisions of EITF Issue No. 00 21 will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. We are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of EITF Issue No. 00 21 will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Factors That May Affect Future Results Risks Related to Our Business Our operating results may fluctuate significantly, which may adversely affect our operating results and our stock price. Our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future. This fluctuation is a result of a variety of factors, including the following: unpredictable or declining demand for our products; decline in the average selling prices of our products due to competitive pricing pressures; seasonality in sales of our products; natural disasters affecting the countries in which we conduct our business, particularly Japan, where our principal source of NAND flash memory wafer capacity is located and Taiwan, South Korea, China and the United States; excess capacity of flash memory from our competitors and our own flash wafer capacity, which may cause a decline in our average selling prices; 36 Table of Contents difficulty of forecasting and managing inventory levels; particularly, building a large inventory of unsold product due to non cancelable contractual obligations to purchase materials such as flash wafers, controllers, printed circuit boards and discrete components; expenses related to obsolescence or devaluation of unsold inventory; writedowns of our equity investments and prepaid wafer credits, adverse changes in product and customer mix; slower than anticipated market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our products, such as the recently announced miniSD card targeted at advanced mobile phones; increased sales by our competitors; competing flash memory card standards, which displace the standards used in our products, such as the new xD Picture card format which is replacing our SmartMedia card in new digital camera models from Olympus and Fuji; changes in our distribution channels; fluctuations in our license and royalty revenue; fluctuations in product costs, particularly due to fluctuations in manufacturing yields and utilization; availability of sufficient silicon wafer foundry capacity to meet customer demand; shortages of components such as capacitors and printed circuit boards required for the manufacturing of our products; significant yield losses, which could affect our ability to fulfill customer orders and could increase our costs; manufacturing flaws affecting the reliability, functionality or performance of our products, which could increase our product costs, reduce demand for our products or require product recalls; increased research and development expenses; exchange rate fluctuations, particularly the U.S. Dollar to Japanese Yen exchange rate; changes in general economic conditions, particularly in Japan and the European Union; and reduced sales to our retail customers if consumer confidence worsens due to declining economic conditions, war in Iraq, the conflict in the Korean Peninsula or elsewhere, or due to terrorist acts. Difficulty of estimating future silicon wafer needs may cause us to overestimate our needs and build excess inventories, or underestimate our needs and have a shortage of silicon wafers, either of which will harm our financial results. Under the terms of our wafer supply agreements with FlashVision, Hitachi, Samsung, Toshiba and UMC, we are obligated to provide a six month rolling forecast of anticipated purchase orders. Generally, the estimates for the first three months of each rolling forecast are binding commitments. The estimates for the remaining months of the forecast may only be changed by a certain percentage from the previous months forecast. In addition, we are obligated to purchase 50% of FlashVisions wafer production. This limits our ability to react to fluctuations in demand for our products. For example, if customer demand falls below our forecast and we are unable to reschedule or cancel our orders, we may end up with excess inventories, which could result in higher operating expenses and reduced gross margins. Conversely, if customer demand exceeds our forecasts, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of wafers and flash memory products to fill customer orders, which could result in dissatisfied customers, lost sales and lower revenues. If we are unable to obtain scheduled quantities of wafers or flash memory products with acceptable price and or yields from any foundry, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. Because the majority of our CF card, SD card, Memory Stick, SmartMedia card, and MultiMediaCard products are sold into 37 Table of Contents emerging consumer markets, it has been difficult to accurately forecast future sales. In addition, bookings visibility remains low due to the current economic uncertainty in our markets. A substantial majority of our quarterly sales are currently, and have historically been, from orders received and fulfilled in the same quarter, which makes accurate forecasting very difficult. Our product order backlog may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter. Variability of expense levels and significant fixed costs will harm our business if our revenues do not exceed our operating expenses. We may need to hire additional personnel in certain business areas or otherwise increase our operating expenses in the future to support our sales and marketing efforts, research and development, and general and administrative activities. We have significant fixed costs and we cannot readily reduce these expenses over the short term. If our revenues do not increase proportionately to our operating expenses, or if revenues decrease or do not meet expectations for a particular period, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed. License fees and royalties from our patent cross license agreements are variable and fluctuate from period to period making it difficult to predict our royalty revenues. Our intellectual property strategy consists of cross licensing our patents to other manufacturers of flash products. Under these arrangements, we earn license fees and royalties on individually negotiated terms. Our income from patent licenses and royalties can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. A substantial portion of this income comes from royalties based on the actual sales by our licensees. The timing of revenue recognition from these payments is dependent on the terms of each contract and on the timing of product shipments by the third parties. We align actual reported royalty revenues when reports are received during the second and fourth quarters of each fiscal year. The timing and amount of royalty payments and the recognition of license fees can vary substantially from quarter to quarter depending on the terms of each agreement and, in some cases, the timing of sales of products by the other parties. As a result, our license and royalty revenues have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future. Given the relatively high gross margins associated with license and royalty revenues, gross margins and net income are likely to fluctuate more with changes in license and royalty revenues than with changes in product revenues. Our license and royalty revenues may decline in the future as certain of our existing license agreements expire or our licensees reach their royalty payment caps. We may be unable to maintain market share, which would reduce our potential revenues and benefit our competitors. During periods of excess supply in the market for our flash memory products, such as we experienced in 2001 and the first quarter of 2002, we may lose market share to competitors who aggressively lower their prices. Conversely, under conditions of tight flash memory supply, we may be unable to increase our production volumes at a sufficiently rapid rate so as to maintain our market share. Ultimately, our future growth rate depends on our ability to obtain sufficient flash memory wafers and other components to meet demand. If we are unable to do so in a timely manner, we may lose market share to our competitors. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, severe price competition for our products, which adversely impacts our product gross margins and overall profitability. In competing for market share we face large corporations that have well established brand identity and commanding strengths in our sales channels. For example, Sony is a competitor for the Memory Stick card, Matsushita Panasonic is a competitor for the SD card, and Kodak and Fuji are competitors for the CF and SmartMedia cards. Future rapid growth may strain our operations. Despite actions we took in 2001 to align expense levels with decreased revenues, we must continue to hire, train, motivate and manage our employees to achieve future growth. In the past, we have experienced difficulty hiring the necessary engineering, sales and marketing personnel to support our growth. In addition, we must make a significant investment in our existing internal information management systems to support 38 Table of Contents increased manufacturing, as well as accounting and other management related functions. Our systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support rapid growth in the future, which could in turn harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our success depends on key personnel, including our executive officers, the loss of whom could disrupt our business. Our success greatly depends on the continued contributions of our senior management and other key research and development, sales, marketing and operations personnel, including Dr. Eli Harari, our founder, President and Chief Executive Officer. Our success will also depend on our ability to recruit additional highly skilled personnel. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in hiring or retaining such key personnel, or that any of our key personnel will remain employed with us. Risks Related to the Development of New Products In transitioning to new processes and products, we face production and market acceptance risks which have caused, and may in the future cause, significant product delays that could harm our business. Successive generations of our products have incorporated semiconductor devices with greater memory capacity per chip. Two important factors have enabled us to decrease the cost per megabyte of our flash data storage products: the development of higher capacity semiconductor devices and the implementation of smaller geometry manufacturing processes. A number of challenges exist in achieving a lower cost per megabyte, including: lower yields often experienced in the early production of new semiconductor devices; manufacturing flaws with new processes including manufacturing processes at our subcontractors which may be extremely complex; problems with design and manufacturing of products that will incorporate these devices, which may result in delays or product recalls; and production delays. Because our products are complex, we periodically experience significant delays in the development and volume production ramp up of our products. Similar delays could occur in the future and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that we along with our strategic wafer partner will successfully develop and bring into full production with acceptable yields and reliability these new products or the underlying technology, or that any development or production ramp will be completed in a timely or cost effective manner. If we are not successful or if our cost structure is not competitive, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer. New products based on NAND MLC flash technology may encounter production delays and problems impacting production reliability and yields, which may cause our revenues and gross margins to decline. We have developed new products based on NAND MLC flash technology, a flash architecture designed to store two bits in each flash memory cell. High density flash memory, such as NAND MLC flash, is a complex technology that requires strict manufacturing controls and effective test screens. Problems encountered in the shift to volume production for new flash products could impact both reliability and yields, and result in increased manufacturing costs and reduced product availability. We may not be able to manufacture future generations of NAND MLC products with yields sufficient to result in lower costs per megabyte. If we are unable to bring future generations of high density flash memory into full production as quickly as planned or if we experience unplanned yield or reliability problems, our revenues and gross margins will decline. 39 Table of Contents We continually seek to develop new products and standards, which may not be widely adopted by consumers or, if adopted, may reduce demand by consumers for our older products, which if not offset by increased demand for the new products could harm our results of operations. We continually seek to develop new products and standards and enhance existing products and standards developed solely by us, as well as jointly with our strategic partners such as Toshiba, Matsushita and Sony. For example, in March 2003, our joint development efforts with Toshiba and Matsushita, together with contribution by the SD Association, resulted in the introduction of the miniSD card, a smaller version of the SD card. In addition, we and Sony have co developed and co own the specifications for the next generation Memory Stick, the Memory Stick Pro, which each of us has the right to manufacture and sell. As we introduce new standards and new products, such as the miniSD card and the Memory Stick Pro, it will take time for these new standards and products to be adopted, for consumers to accept and transition to these new products and for significant sales to be generated therefrom, if this happens at all. Moreover, broad acceptance of new standards or products by consumers may reduce demand for our older products. If this decreased demand is not offset by increased demand for our new products, our results of operations could be harmed. We cannot assure you that any new products or standards we develop will achieve commercial success. See The success of our business depends on emerging markets and new products. The success of our business depends on emerging markets and new products. In order for demand for our products to grow, the markets for new devices that use our flash memory products, such as digital cameras, portable digital music players and cellular phones must develop and grow. If sales of these products do not grow, our revenues and profit margins could be adversely impacted. The success of our new product strategy will depend upon, among other things, the following: our ability to successfully develop new products with higher memory capacities and enhanced features at a lower cost per megabyte; the development of new applications or markets for our flash data storage products; the extent to which prospective customers design our products into their products and successfully introduce their products; the extent to which our products or technologies become obsolete or noncompetitive due to products or technologies developed by others; and the adoption by the major content providers of the copy protection features offered by our SD card products. Risks Related to Our FlashVision Joint Venture Our FlashVision joint venture with Toshiba makes us vulnerable to certain risks, including potential inventory write offs, disruptions or shortages of supply, limited ability to react to fluctuations in product demand, direct competition with Toshiba, and significant guarantee obligations, any of which could substantially harm our business and financial condition. We and Toshiba have restructured our FlashVision business and transferred certain assets to Toshibas Yokkaichi fabrication facility in Japan, which may cause production delays and reduce NAND wafer supply available to us, which could adversely impact our operating results. On June 30, 2000, we, along with Toshiba, formed FlashVision for the joint development and manufacture of several NAND flash memory products, including 512 megabit, 1 gigabit and other advanced flash memory products. We and Toshiba will each separately market and sell these products. Accordingly, we will compete directly with Toshiba for sales of products incorporating these jointly developed and manufactured products. In April 2002, we and Toshiba entered into a series of agreements that restructured our FlashVision business and provided for the transfer of its operations to Toshibas Yokkaichi fabrication facility in Japan. Pursuant to the terms of the agreements, Toshiba completed transfer of all required equipment from 40 Table of Contents Dominion to Yokkaichi in 2002 and bore substantially all of the costs associated with the equipment transfers. It is possible that production may not continue at Yokkaichi as planned, thereby reducing the total NAND production capacity available to us. In addition, we incurred substantial start up expenses related to the hiring and training of manufacturing personnel, and installing the clean room facilities and equipment at the Dominion fabrication facility. Although as part of our agreement with Toshiba to restructure our FlashVision business we have recaptured, substantially all of the Dominion start up expenses incurred by us, we have incurred similar start up expenses in connection with the new Yokkaichi fabrication facility. We will incur start up costs and pay our share of ongoing operating activities even if we do not utilize our full share of the new Yokkaichi output. Each time that we and Toshiba add substantial new wafer fabrication capacity, we will experience startup costs as a result of the one to two quarters of delay between the time of the investment and the time qualified products manufactured on the new wafer fabrication capacity are sold. We expect to fund up to approximately $33.0 million for the initial fabrication capacity expansion in 2003. We face challenges and possible delays relating to the expected shift in a portion of our production at Yokkaichi to 0.13 micron NAND, which could adversely affect our operating results. We were using the production capacity at Toshibas Yokkaichi fabrication facility to manufacture NAND flash memory wafers with minimum lithographic feature size of 0.16 micron. Late in 2002, we began shifting a portion of our production output at Yokkaichi to 0.13 micron NAND and expect to shift the majority of our production output at Yokkaichi to 0.13 micron NAND in the second half of 2003. Such minimum feature sizes are considered today to be among the most advanced for mass production of silicon wafers. Therefore, it is difficult to predict how long it will take to achieve adequate yields, reliable operation, and economically attractive product costs based on our new designs. We currently rely and will continue to rely on Toshiba to address these challenges. With our investments in the FlashVision joint venture at Toshibas Yokkaichi facility, we are now and will continue to be exposed to the adverse financial impact of any delays or manufacturing problems associated with wafer production lines. Any problems or delays in volume production at the Yokkaichi fabrication facility could adversely impact our operating results in 2003 and beyond. Toshibas Yokkaichi facilities are a significant source of supply of NAND flash memory wafers and any disruption in this supply will reduce our revenues, earnings and gross margins. Although we buy flash memory from the FlashVision joint venture, we also rely on Toshibas Yokkaichi fabrication facility to supply on a foundry basis a portion of our NAND flash memory wafers. Even if FlashVision successfully produces quantities at planned levels, the Yokkaichi fabrication foundry facilities may not produce satisfactory quantities of wafers with acceptable prices, reliability and yields. Any failure in this regard may curtail our business, financial condition and results of operations, as our right to purchase NAND flash memory products from Samsung is limited and may not be sufficient to replace any shortfall in production at the Yokkaichi facilities. In addition, any disruption in supply from the Yokkaichi fabrication facility due to natural disaster, power failure, labor unrest or other causes could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, we have no experience in operating a wafer manufacturing line and we intend to rely on the existing manufacturing organizations at the Yokkaichi fabrication facilities. If Toshiba and FlashVision are uncompetitive or are unable to satisfy our wafer supply requirements, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed. Our obligations under our wafer supply agreements with Toshiba and FlashVision, or decreased demand for our products, may result in excess inventories and lead to inventory write offs, and any technical difficulties or manufacturing problems may result in shortages in supply, either of which would adversely affect our business. Under the terms of our wafer supply agreements with Toshiba, we are obligated to purchase half of FlashVisions NAND wafer production output and we will also purchase NAND wafers from Toshibas current Yokkaichi fabrication facility on a foundry relationship basis. If we are unable for any reason to 41 Table of Contents achieve customer acceptance of our card products built with these NAND flash chips or if demand decreases, we will experience a significant increase in our inventory, which may result in inventory write offs and harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Apart from our commitment to purchase wafer output from FlashVision, under our foundry relationship with Toshiba, we order NAND wafers under purchase orders that cannot be cancelled. If we place purchase orders with Toshiba and our business condition deteriorates, we may end up with excess inventories of NAND wafers, which could harm our business and financial condition. Should customer demand for NAND flash products be less than our available supply, we may suffer from reduced revenues and increased expenses, and increased inventory of unsold NAND flash wafers, which could adversely affect our operating results. Under the terms of our foundry relationship with Toshiba and wafer supply agreements with FlashVision, we are obligated to provide a six month rolling forecast of anticipated purchase orders, which are difficult to estimate. Generally, the estimates for the first three months of each rolling forecast are binding commitments. The estimates for the remaining months of the forecast may only be changed by a certain percentage from the previous months forecast. This limits our ability to react to fluctuations in demand for our products. In addition, in order for us to sell NAND based CF cards, SD cards and MultiMediaCards, we have been developing new controllers, printed circuit boards and test algorithms. Any technical difficulties or delays in the development of these elements could prevent us from taking advantage of the available NAND output and could adversely affect our results of operations. See Risks Related to Our FlashVision Joint Venture. We have contingent indemnification obligations for certain liabilities Toshiba incurs as a result of Toshibas guarantee of the FlashVision equipment lease arrangement. FlashVision secured a new equipment lease arrangement of approximately 37.9 billion Japanese Yen (or approximately $305 million based on the exchange rate in effect on the date the agreement was executed) in May 2002 with Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., or Mizuho, and certain other financial institutions. Under the terms of the new lease, Toshiba is required to provide a guarantee to these financial institutions on behalf of FlashVision. We have agreed to indemnify Toshiba in certain circumstances for certain liabilities Toshiba incurs as a result of Toshibas guarantee of the FlashVision equipment lease arrangement. If FlashVision fails to meet its lease commitments, and Toshiba fulfills these commitments under the terms of Toshibas guarantee, then we will be obligated to reimburse Toshiba for 49.9% of any claims under the lease, unless such claims result from Toshibas failure to meet its obligations to FlashVision or its covenants to the lenders. Because FlashVisions new equipment lease arrangement is denominated in Japanese Yen, the maximum amount of our contingent indemnification obligation on a given date when converted to U.S. Dollars will fluctuate based on the exchange rate in effect on that date. As of December 31, 2002, the maximum amount of our contingent indemnification obligation, which reflects payments and any lease adjustments, was approximately $142.4 million. Risks Related to Our Investment in Tower Semiconductor Ltd. Our investments in Tower Semiconductor Ltd. are subject to certain inherent risks, including those associated with certain Israeli regulatory requirements, political unrest and financing difficulties, which could harm our business and financial condition. In July 2000, we entered into a share purchase agreement to make a $75.0 million investment in Tower for its new wafer foundry facility, Fab 2. As of December 31, 2002, we had invested $68.0 million in Tower and obtained 6,100,959 ordinary shares, $14.3 million of prepaid wafer credits, and a warrant to purchase 360,313 ordinary Tower shares at an exercise price of $7.50 per share. This warrant expires on October 31, 2006. The investment in the ordinary shares represents an approximate 14% current equity ownership position in Tower as of December 31, 2002. In 2002 and 2001, we recognized losses of $14.4 million and $26.1 million, respectively, on the other than temporary decline in the value of our Tower investment and the impairment in value on our prepaid wafer credits and approximately $0.7 million in unrealized losses related to the fair value of the warrants purchased in October of 2002. Our investment in Tower was valued at $21.3 million as of December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2002, our prepaid wafer credits were valued at $6.0 million, which is net 42 Table of Contents of $2.8 million in write downs recorded in fiscal 2002, related to the recoverability of these prepaid wafer credits. In March 2002, we amended our foundry investment agreements with Tower by agreeing to advance the payments for the third and fourth milestones. The payment for the third milestone of $11.0 million was made on April 5, 2002. In exchange for this payment we received 1,071,497 ordinary shares and prepaid wafer credits of $4.4 million. The payment of $11.0 million for the fourth milestone was paid on September 30, 2002. In exchange for this payment we received 1,344,829 ordinary shares of Tower and $4.4 million in prepaid wafer credits. These wafer credits were credited to our pre paid wafer account and are to be applied against orders placed with Fab 2, when completed; provided, however, that until July 1, 2005, the amounts added to the pre paid wafer account may only be applied towards a maximum of 7.5% of our wafer purchases. We periodically assess the value of our prepaid wafer credits considering the timing and quantity of our planned annual wafer purchases, the status of the foundry construction and general economic conditions. If we determine that the value of these wafer credits is not recoverable, an additional write down will be recorded. In addition to our commitment under the share purchase agreement, we invested in Towers stock rights offering in October 2002. Tower issued one right for each 4.94 shares owned by record holders as of the record date. In exercising our rights to participate, we paid approximately $4.0 million in exchange for 800,695 ordinary Tower shares and a warrant to purchase 360,312 ordinary shares at $7.50 per share. This warrant expires on October 31, 2006. During the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded a write down in the fair value of these Tower warrants of approximately $0.7 million. The fair value of these warrants will continue to fluctuate and additional adjustments to the warrants fair value will be recorded in future periods. In February 2003, we agreed to further amend our foundry investment agreements with Tower, by agreeing to advance the payment for the fifth and final milestone. This amendment is subject to approval by all required parties, including Towers shareholders. If approved, the terms of the amendment require the payment of $11.0 million for the advanced fifth milestone and this payment will be made in two installments. The first installment of approximately $6.6 million will be due five business days after the amendment is approved by all required parties, including Towers shareholders; the second installment of approximately $4.4 million will be due five business days after Tower has raised additional funds equal to approximately $22.0 million, referred to as the Minimum Financing. Tower must complete the Minimum Financing prior to December 31, 2003, or we will not be obligated to pay the second installment. Each of the first and second installments will be paid provided Tower meets these conditions, whether or not Tower actually achieves its original fifth milestone obligation. Immediately following the advancement of the first installment, we will be issued fully paid and non assessable ordinary shares of Tower equivalent to the first installment divided by the average trading price for ordinary shares of Tower during the thirty (30) consecutive trading days preceding the date the amendment was approved by Towers board of directors. Immediately following the advancement of the second installment, if it occurs, we will be issued fully paid and non assessable ordinary shares of Tower equivalent to the second installment divided by the price per ordinary share of Tower paid in connection with the Minimum Financing, or the Minimum Financing Price; provided, however, that if the Minimum Financing Price cannot reasonably be calculated from the documents evidencing the Minimum Financing, then the Minimum Financing Price shall be deemed to be the average trading price for the ordinary shares of Tower during the thirty (30) consecutive trading days preceding the date the second installment is paid. In addition, we have the option to convert all or a portion of our unused pre paid wafer credits associated with the September 2002 fourth milestone payment into fully paid and non assessable ordinary shares of Tower based on the average closing price of ordinary shares of Tower during the thirty (30) consecutive trading days preceding December 31, 2005. Completion of Towers wafer foundry facility, Fab 2, is dependent on several factors and may never occur, which may harm our business and results of operations. Towers completion of Fab 2 is dependent on its ability to obtain additional financing for the foundry construction from equity and other sources and the release of grants and approvals for changes in grant programs from the Israeli governments Investment Center. The current political uncertainty and security situation in the region may adversely impact Towers business prospects and may discourage investments in 43 Table of Contents Tower from outside sources. If Tower is unable to obtain additional financing, complete foundry construction in a timely manner or is unable to successfully complete the development and transfer of advanced CMOS process technologies and ramp up of production, the value of our equity investment in Tower and wafer credits will decline significantly or possibly become worthless. In addition, we may be unable to obtain sufficient supply of wafers to manufacture our products, which would harm our business. The value of our equity investment in Tower may also be adversely affected by further deterioration of conditions in the market for foundry manufacturing services and the market for semiconductor products generally. If the fair value of our Tower investment declines further, we may record additional losses, which potentially could amount to the remaining recorded value of our Tower investment. Moreover, if Tower is unable to satisfy certain financial covenants and comply with certain conditions as required by its credit facility agreement, and therefore is not able to obtain additional bank financing, or its current bank obligations are accelerated, or it fails to secure customers for its foundry capacity to help offset its fixed costs, such failure could jeopardize the completion of Fab 2 and Towers ability to continue operations. We cannot assure you that the Tower facility will be completed or will begin production as scheduled, or that the processes needed to fabricate our wafers will be qualified at the new facility. Moreover, we cannot assure you that this new facility will be able to achieve acceptable yields or deliver sufficient quantities of wafers on a timely basis at a competitive price. Furthermore, if the depressed business conditions for semiconductor wafers persists throughout 2003 and beyond, Tower may be unable to operate Fab 2 at an optimum capacity utilization, which would cause them to operate at a loss or to discontinue operations. The current political unrest and violence in Israel may hinder Towers ability to obtain investment in and complete its fabrication facility, which would harm our business. Although we do not believe the current political unrest and continuing escalation of violence in Israel represent a major security problem for Tower since Migdal Haemek, Israel is in a relatively secure geographic location, the unrest may expand and even if it remains at current levels, could cause scheduling delays, as well as economic uncertainty, which could cause potential investors and foundry customers to avoid Tower. Moreover, if U.S. military actions in Iraq, or elsewhere, result in retaliation against Israel, Towers fabrication facility may be adversely impacted causing a decline in the value of our investment. Risks Related to Our Investment in UMC Fluctuations in the market value of our UMC foundry investment affect our financial results and in fiscal 2001 we recorded a loss on investment in foundry of $275.8 million on our UMC investment and we may record additional losses in the future. In 1997, we invested $51.2 million in United Silicon, Inc., or USIC, a semiconductor manufacturing subsidiary of United Microelectronics Corporation, or UMC, which was merged into the UMC parent company on January 3, 2000. In exchange for our USIC shares, we received 111 million UMC shares. In 2000, 2001 and 2002, we received additional shares as stock dividends totaling approximately 22 million, 20 million and 23 million shares, respectively. Our equity investment in UMC was valued at $113.0 million at December 31, 2002 and included an unrealized loss of $6.6 million, which was included in other comprehensive income. In fiscal 2001, we recorded a loss of $275.8 million, or $166.9 million net of taxes, on the other than temporary decline in the value of our UMC investment. If the fair value of our UMC investment declines in future periods, we may record additional losses for those periods. In addition, in future periods, we may recognize a gain or loss upon the sale of our UMC shares, which will impact our financial results. Risks Related to Vendors and Subcontractors We depend on our suppliers and third party subcontractors for several of the critical components and our products and our business could be harmed if we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of these components on a timely basis. We rely on our vendors, some of which are sole source suppliers, for several of our critical components. We do not have long term supply agreements with some of these vendors. Our business, financial condition 44 Table of Contents and operating results could be significantly harmed by delays or reductions in shipments if we are unable to develop alternative sources or obtain sufficient quantities of these components. We also rely on third party subcontractors for our wafer testing, packaged memory final testing, card assembly and card testing, including Silicon Precision Industries Co., Ltd. and United Test Center, Inc. in Taiwan and Celestica, Inc. and Flextronics in China. In addition to our existing subcontract suppliers, we are qualifying other subcontract suppliers for wafer testing, packaged memory final testing, card assembly and card testing services. We have no long term contracts with existing subcontractors nor do we expect to have long term contracts with new subcontract suppliers. As such, we cannot and will not be able to directly control product delivery schedules. Any significant problems that occur at our subcontractor suppliers, or their failure to perform at the level we expect could lead to product shortages or quality assurance problems, which could increase the manufacturing costs of our products and have adverse effects on our operating results. Furthermore, we are manufacturing on a turnkey basis with some of our existing subcontract suppliers as well as with our anticipated newly qualified subcontract suppliers, which may reduce our visibility and control of their inventories of purchased parts necessary to build our products. We depend on third party foundries for silicon wafers and any shortage or disruption in our supply from these sources will reduce our revenues, earnings and gross margins. All of our flash memory card products require silicon wafers, a substantial majority of which are currently supplied by Toshibas wafer facility at Yokkaichi, Japan, as well as UMC in Taiwan and to a lesser extent by Hitachi and Samsung. Our NAND flash memory products are substantially supplied by Toshibas Yokkaichi wafer fabrication facilities and, to a lesser extent, by Samsung. If Toshiba, FlashVision, Samsung and UMC are uncompetitive or are unable to satisfy these requirements, our business, financial condition and operating results may suffer. Any disruption in supply from these sources due to natural disaster, power failure, labor unrest or other causes could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our obligation to provide a six month rolling forecast of anticipated purchase orders under the terms of our wafer supply agreements with Toshiba, FlashVision, Samsung and UMC, limits our ability to react to fluctuations in demand for our products which may lead to excess wafer inventories and could result in higher operating expenses and reduced gross margins. Under the terms of our supply agreements with FlashVision, Hitachi, Samsung, Toshiba, Tower and UMC, we are obligated to provide a six month rolling forecast of anticipated purchase orders, Generally, the estimates for the first three months of each rolling forecast are binding commitments. The estimates for the remaining months of the forecast may only be changed by a certain percentage from the previous months forecast. In addition, we are obligated to purchase 50% of all of FlashVisions wafer production. This limits our ability to react to fluctuations in demand for our products. For example, if customer demand falls below our forecast and we are unable to reschedule or cancel our orders, we may end up with excess inventories, which could result in higher operating expenses and reduced gross margins. Conversely, if customer demand exceeds our forecasts, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of wafers and flash memory products to fill customer orders, which could result in dissatisfied customers, lost sales and lower revenues. If we are unable to obtain scheduled quantities of wafers or flash memory products with acceptable price and or yields from any foundry, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. We and our manufacturing partners must achieve acceptable wafer manufacturing yields or our costs will increase and production output will decrease, which could negatively impact our business. The fabrication of our products requires wafers to be produced in a highly controlled and ultra clean environment. Semiconductor companies that supply our wafers sometimes have experienced problems achieving acceptable wafer manufacturing yields. Semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function of both our design technology and the foundrys manufacturing process technology. Low yields may result from design errors or manufacturing failures. Yield problems may not be determined or improved until an actual product is made and can be tested. As a result, yield problems may not be identified until the wafers are well into the production process. The risks associated with yields are even greater because we rely exclusively on 45 Table of Contents independent offshore foundries for our wafers which increases the effort and time required to identify, communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems. If the foundries cannot achieve planned yields, we will experience higher costs and reduced product availability, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to Competition We face competition from flash memory manufacturers and memory card assemblers and if we cannot compete effectively, our business will be harmed. We compete in an industry characterized by intense competition, rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, declining average selling prices and rapid product obsolescence. Our competitors include many large domestic and international companies that have greater access to advanced wafer foundry capacity, substantially greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers. Our primary competitors include companies that develop and manufacture storage flash chips, such as Hitachi, Samsung and Toshiba. In addition, we compete with companies that manufacture other forms of flash memory and companies that purchase flash memory components and assemble memory cards. Companies that manufacture socket flash, linear flash and components include Advanced Micro Devices, Atmel, Fujitsu, Intel, Macronix, Mitsubishi, Sharp Electronics and ST Microelectronics. Companies that combine controllers and flash memory chips developed by others into flash storage cards, or that resell flash cards under their brand name include Dane Elec Manufacturing, Delkin Devices, Inc., Fuji, Hagiwara, Hama, I/ O Data, Infineon, Jessops, Kingston Technology, Kodak, Lexar Media, M Systems, Matsushita Battery, Matsushita Panasonic, Memorex, Micron Technology, PNY, PQI, Pretec, Silicon Storage Technology, Silicon Tek, Simple Technology, Sony, TDK, Toshiba and Viking Components and several other resellers primarily located in Taiwan. We have entered into agreements with, and face direct competition from, Toshiba, Samsung and other competitors. In 2000, we along with Matsushita and Toshiba, formed the Secure Digital Association, or SD Association, to jointly develop and promote the Secure Digital card. Under this arrangement, royalty bearing Secure Digital card licenses will be available to other flash memory card manufacturers, resulting in increased competition for our Secure Digital card and other products. In addition, Matsushita and Toshiba sell Secure Digital cards that compete directly with our products. While other flash card manufacturers are required to pay license fees and royalties, which will be shared among Matsushita, Toshiba and us, there are no royalties or license fees payable among the three companies for their respective sales of the Secure Digital card. Thus, we forfeit potential royalty income from Secure Digital card sales by Matsushita and Toshiba. To date we have not received any meaningful royalties from any SD licensees. In addition, we and Toshiba each separately market and sell NAND flash memory products developed and manufactured by our joint venture, FlashVision. Accordingly, we compete directly with Toshiba for sales of these products. Moreover, we rely principally on Toshiba, and to a lesser extent Samsung, for our NAND flash memory supply. We have entered into patent cross license agreements with several of our leading competitors including Hitachi, Intel, Matsushita, SST, Samsung, Sharp, Sony, Toshiba and TDK. Under these agreements, each party may manufacture and sell products that incorporate technology covered by the other partys patent or patents related to flash memory devices. As we continue to license our patents to certain of our competitors, competition will increase and may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Currently, we are engaged in licensing discussions with several of our competitors. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in concluding licensing agreements under terms which are favorable to us, or at all. 46 Table of Contents Our products compete against new products that promote different industry standards from ours, and if these new industry standards gain market acceptance, our business will be harmed. Competing products have been introduced that promote industry standards that are different from our products including, M Systems DiskOnKey, a USB based memory device, the Secure MultiMediaCard from Hitachi and Infineon. In addition, in 2002, Fuji and Olympus introduced the xD Picture card format, which could lead to decreased revenues, as well as, write downs for obsolete inventory, of our Smart Media card products in 2003. Each competing standard may not be mechanically and electronically compatible with our products. If a manufacturer of digital cameras or other consumer electronic devices designs in one of these alternative competing standards, our products will be eliminated from use in that product. In addition, other companies, such as Sanyo and Matrix Semiconductor have announced products or technologies that may potentially compete with our products. The Microdrive, which Hitachi recently acquired from IBM, is a rotating disk drive in a Type II CF format, which competes directly with our larger capacity CF memory cards. M Systems DiskOnChip 2000 Millennium product competes against our NAND Flash Components in embedded storage applications such as set top boxes and networking appliances. Sony has licensed its proprietary Memory Stick to us and other companies and Sony has agreed to supply us a portion of its Memory Stick output for resale under our brand name. In addition, we and Sony have co developed and co own the specifications for the next generation Memory Stick, known as the MemoryStick Pro. If consumer electronics products using the Memory Stick Pro achieve widespread use, sales of our MultiMediaCard, SD card, SmartMedia card and CF card products may decline. Our MultiMediaCard products also have faced significant competition from Toshibas SmartMedia flash cards. We face competition from products based on alternative flash technologies and if we cannot compete effectively, our business will be harmed. We also face competition from products based on MLC flash technology from Intel and Hitachi. These products currently compete with our NAND MLC products. MLC flash is a technological innovation that allows each flash memory cell to store two bits of information instead of the traditional single bit stored by conventional flash technology. In addition, Infineon has recently formed a separate business unit, called Infineon Flash, that was formed to develop and commercialize a new flash technology called NROM, which offers 2 bits per cell and is claimed to match the density of our NAND MLC. Infineon has also stated its intention to utilize this NROM flash memory technology, once it reaches production, in a line of flash cards that will compete with our cards, including our MultiMediaCard and SD card. Moreover, each of Micron Technology, Inc., Hynix Semiconductor Inc., and ST Microelectronics, have stated their intention to compete with NAND flash memory with their own flash products. If any of these competitors is successful, this new competition could adversely impact our future sales. Furthermore, we expect to face competition both from existing competitors and from other companies that may enter our existing or future markets that have similar or alternative data storage solutions, which may be less costly or provide additional features. Price is an important competitive factor in the market for consumer products. Increased price competition could lower gross margins if our average selling prices decrease faster than our costs and could also result in lost sales. Risks Related to Sales of Our Products Sales to a small number of customers represent a significant portion of our revenues and if we were to lose one of our major customers or experience any material reduction in orders from any of these customers, our revenues and operating results would suffer. Approximately one half of our revenues come from a small number of customers. For example, sales to our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 50% of our product revenues in 2002, 2001 and 2000. If we were to lose one of our major customers or experience any material reduction in orders from any of these customers, our revenues and operating results would suffer. Our sales are generally made by standard purchase 47 Table of Contents orders rather than long term contracts. In addition, the composition of our major customer base changes from year to year as the market demand for our customers products changes. Variability of average selling prices and gross margins resulting from changes in our product mix and price reductions for certain of our products may cause our gross margins and net profitability to suffer. Our product mix varies quarterly, which affects our overall average selling prices and gross margins. Our CF card, SD card, SmartMedia card, and MultiMediaCard products, which currently represent the majority of our product revenues, have lower average selling prices and gross margins than our higher capacity FlashDisk and FlashDrive products. We believe that sales of CF card, SD card, SmartMedia card, and MultiMediaCard card products will continue to represent the majority of our product revenues as consumer applications, such as digital cameras and digital music players, become more popular. Flash data storage markets are intensely competitive, and price reductions for our products are necessary to meet consumer price points. In 2002, due to competitive pricing pressures, our average selling price per megabyte declined by approximately 50% compared to 2001. Due to the oversupply of flash memory foundry capacity and the economic slow down in 2001, our average selling price per megabyte declined 50% compared to 2000 was much more severe than the 22% decrease we experienced in 2000. Price declines for our products could continue to be significant. If we cannot reduce our product manufacturing costs in future periods to offset further price reductions, our gross margins and net profitability will suffer. Our selling prices may decline due to excess capacity in the market for flash memory products and if we cannot reduce our manufacturing costs to offset these price declines, our gross margins and net profitability will be harmed. Throughout 2001, worldwide flash memory supply exceeded customer demand, causing excess supply in the markets for our products and significant declines in average selling prices. If this situation were to occur again in 2003, price declines for our products could be significant. If we are unable to reduce our product manufacturing costs to offset these reduced prices, our gross margins and net profitability would be adversely impacted. Our business depends significantly upon sales of products in the highly competitive consumer market, a significant portion of which are made to retailers and through distributors, and if our distributors and retailers are not successful in this market, we could experience substantial product returns, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In 2001 and 2002, we continued to receive more product revenue and ship more units of products for consumer electronics applications, including digital cameras and PDAs, compared to other applications. The consumer market is intensely competitive and is more price sensitive than our other target markets. In addition, we must spend more on marketing and promotion in consumer markets to establish brand name recognition and drive demand. A significant portion of our sales to the consumer electronics market are made to retailers and through distributors. Sales through these channels typically include rights to return unsold inventory. As a result, we do not recognize revenue until after the product has been sold through to the end user. If our distributors and retailers are not successful in this market, there could be substantial product returns, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Sales of our products through our retail distribution channel include the use of third party fulfillment facilities that hold our manufacturing components and finished goods on a consignment basis, and if these fulfillment facilities were to experience a loss with respect to our inventory, we may not be able to recoup the full cost of the inventory, which would harm our business. Our retail distribution channel utilizes third party fulfillment facilities, such as Modus Media International, Inc. These fulfillment houses hold our manufacturing components and finished goods on a consignment basis, providing packout services for our retail business, which include labeling and packaging our raw cards, 48 Table of Contents as well as shipping the finished product directly to our customers. While our third party fulfillment houses bear the risk of loss with respect to our inventory, the amount we are reimbursed by them or their insurers may be less than our original cost to produce the inventory, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. There is seasonality in our business, which may impact our product sales, particularly in the fourth and first quarters of the fiscal year. Sales of our products in the consumer electronics market may be subject to seasonality. As a result, product sales may be impacted by seasonal purchasing patterns with higher sales generally occurring in the fourth quarter of each year followed by declines in the first quarter of the following year. In addition, in the past we have experienced a decrease in orders in the first quarter from our Japanese OEM customers primarily because most customers in Japan operate on a fiscal year ending in March and prefer to delay purchases until the beginning of their next fiscal year. We may not be successful selling our products on the Internet and these sales may undercut our traditional sales channels. Web based sales of our products today represent a small but growing portion of our overall sales. Sales on the Internet tend to undercut traditional distribution channels and may dramatically change the way our consumer products are purchased in future years. We cannot assure you that we will successfully develop the Internet sales channel or successfully manage the inherent conflict between the Internet and our traditional sales channels. Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property We may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights. In the past, we have been involved in significant disputes regarding our intellectual property rights and claims that we may be infringing third parties intellectual property rights. We expect that we may be involved in similar disputes in the future. We cannot assure you that: any of our existing patents will not be invalidated; patents will be issued for any of our pending applications; any claims allowed from existing or pending patents will have sufficient scope or strength; our patents will be issued in the primary countries where our products are sold in order to protect our rights and potential commercial advantage; or any of our products do not infringe on the patents of other companies. In addition, our competitors may be able to design their products around our patents. We intend to vigorously enforce our patents but we cannot be sure that our efforts will be successful. If we were to have an adverse result in any litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages, cease the manufacture, use and sale of infringing products, expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology, discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain licenses to the infringing technology. Any litigation is likely to result in significant expense to us, as well as divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. 49 Table of Contents We may be unable to license intellectual property to or from third parties as needed, or renew existing licenses, and we have agreed to indemnify various suppliers and customers for alleged patent infringement, which could expose us to liability for damages, increase our costs or limit or prohibit us from selling certain products. If we decide to incorporate third party technology into our products or if we are found to infringe on others intellectual property, we could be required to license intellectual property from a third party. We may also need to license some of our intellectual property to others in order to enable us to obtain cross licenses to third party patents. Currently, we have patent cross license agreements with several companies, including Hitachi, Intel, Matsushita, SST, Samsung, Sharp, Smartdisk, Sony, TDK and Toshiba and we are in discussions with other companies regarding potential cross license agreements. We cannot be certain that licenses will be offered when we need them, or that the terms offered will be acceptable. If we do obtain licenses from third parties, we may be required to pay license fees or royalty payments. In addition, if we are unable to obtain a license that is necessary to the manufacture of our products, we could be required to suspend the manufacture of products or stop our wafer suppliers from using processes that may infringe the rights of third parties. We cannot assure you that we would be successful in redesigning our products or that the necessary licenses will be available under reasonable terms, or that our existing licensees will renew their licenses upon expiration, or that we will be successful in signing new licensees in the future. We have historically agreed to indemnify various suppliers and customers for alleged patent infringement. The scope of such indemnity varies, but may, in some instances, include indemnification for damages and expenses, including attorneys fees. We may periodically engage in litigation as a result of these indemnification obligations. We are not currently engaged in any such indemnification proceedings. Our insurance policies exclude coverage for third party claims for patent infringement. Any future obligation to indemnify our customers or suppliers could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may be involved in litigation regarding our intellectual property rights or those of third parties, which would be costly and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. Litigation is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Factors that could cause litigation results to differ include, but are not limited to, the discovery of previously unknown facts, changes in the law or in the interpretation of laws, and uncertainties associated with the judicial decision making process. Furthermore, parties that we have sued and that we may sue for patent infringement may counter sue us for infringing their patents. On or about August 3, 2001, the Lemelson Medical, Education & Research Foundation, or Lemelson Foundation, filed a complaint for patent infringement against us and four other defendants. The suit, captioned Lemelson Medical, Education, & Research Foundation, Limited Partnership vs. Broadcom Corporation, et al., Civil Case No. CIV01 1440PHX HRH, was filed in the United States District Court, District of Arizona. On November 13, 2001, the Lemelson Foundation filed an Amended Complaint, which made the same substantive allegations against us but named more than twenty five additional defendants. The Amended Complaint alleges that we, and the other defendants, have infringed certain patents held by the Lemelson Foundation pertaining to bar code scanning technology. By its complaint, the Lemelson Foundation requests that we be enjoined from our allegedly infringing activities and seeks unspecified damages. On February 4, 2002, we filed an answer to the amended complaint, wherein we alleged that we do not infringe the asserted patents, and further contend that the patents are not valid or enforceable. On October 15, 2001, we filed a complaint for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Micron Technology, Inc., or Micron. In the suit, captioned SanDisk Corp. v. Micron Technology, Inc., Civil No. CV 01 3855 CW, the complaint sought damages and an injunction against Micron for making, selling, importing or using flash memory cards that infringed our U.S. Patent No. 6,149,316. On February 15, 2002, Micron answered the complaint, denied liability, and counterclaimed seeking a declaration that the patent in suit was not infringed, was invalid, and was unenforceable. On May 31, 2002, based on allegations of infringement leveled by Micron against us, we filed a complaint for declaratory judgment, seeking a declaration that we did not and had not infringed five patents 50 Table of Contents (or, in the alternative, that the patents were invalid). The patents in question were U.S. Patent No. 4,468,308; U.S. Patent No. 5,286,344; U.S. Patent No. 5,320,981; U.S. Patent No. 6,015,760; and U.S. Patent No. 6,287,978 B1. The suit was captioned SanDisk Corp. v. Micron Technology, Inc., Civil No. CV 02 2627 VRW. On June 4, 2002, Micron answered and counterclaimed alleging that we did infringe the five listed patents. On October 29, 2002, we filed a motion for summary adjudication against Micron to eliminate some of Microns claims. On December 23, 2002, the parties reached a settlement and dismissed all pending litigation between them. The terms of the settlement are confidential. On October 31, 2001, we filed a complaint for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Memorex Products, Inc., Pretec Electronics Corporation, Ritek Corporation and Power Quotient International Co., Ltd. In the suit, captioned SanDisk Corp. v. Memorex Products, Inc., et al., Civil No. CV 01 4063 VRW, we seek damages and injunctions against these companies from making, selling, importing or using flash memory cards that infringe our U.S. patent No. 5,602,987 or the 987 Patent. Defendants have filed answers denying the allegations. We filed a motion for a preliminary injunction in the suit to enjoin Memorex, Pretec and Ritek from making, selling, importing or using flash memory cards that infringe our 987 Patent prior to the trial on the merits. On May 17, 2002, the Court denied our motion. Discovery has commenced. A hearing on claim construction and Riteks motion for summary judgment of non infringement is scheduled for May 2, 2003. On November 30, 2001, we filed a complaint for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Power Quotient International USA Inc, or PQI USA. In the suit, captioned SanDisk Corp. v. Power Quotient International USA Inc., Civil No. C 01 21111, we sought damages and an injunction against PQI USA from making, selling, importing or using flash memory cards that infringe our U.S. patent No. 5,602,987. The PQI USA complaint and litigation are related to the October 31, 2001 litigation referred to above. On October 16, 2002, Power Quotient International Co., Ltd. and Power Quotient International USA entered into a Consent Judgment of Infringement and Validity and Injunction and settlement agreement with us, in which both PQI companies stipulated that the CompactFlashTM and PC ATA cards sold by them infringe our 987 patent and that the 987 Patent is valid and enforceable. In addition, both PQI companies are enjoined from using in the United States, making in the United States . . . selling in the United States . . . or importing into the United States for sale, CompactFlashTM and PC ATA cards. In addition, the PQI companies will pay us an undisclosed amount for past damages and the parties agreed to dismiss all claims between SanDisk and the PQI companies in both lawsuits described above without prejudice. The Consent Judgment of Infringement and Validity and Injunction is subject to court approval, which is currently pending. On August 8, 2002, we filed an amended complaint to join Mr. Flash USA and Mark C. Lee as defendants in the PQI USA matter. On December 5, 2002, we entered into a settlement agreement with Mr. Lee, doing business as Mr. Flash USA. On December 12, 2002, the parties filed a Stipulated Dismissal Without Prejudice and Consent Injunction, in which Mr. Lee is enjoined from directly or indirectly making in the United States . . . selling in the United States . . . or importing into the United States for sale, CompactFlashTM and PC ATA cards that are manufactured by Power Quotient International Co., Ltd. On January 28, 2003, the Court entered the Stipulated Dismissal Without Prejudice and Consent injunction. On or about March 5, 2002, Samsung filed a patent infringement lawsuit against us in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Civil Action No. 9:02CV58. The lawsuit alleged that we infringed four Samsung United States patents, Nos. 5,473,563; 5,514,889; 5,546,341 and 5,642,309, and sought a preliminary and permanent injunction against certain of our products, as well as damages, attorneys fees and costs of the lawsuit. On March 28, 2002, we filed an answer and counterclaims denying infringement and asserting that the Samsung patents are invalid and or unenforceable. Our counterclaims asserted that Samsung breached a 1997 agreement between SanDisk and Samsung. In August 2002, we and Samsung settled all pending litigation between us and entered into a new patent cross license agreement and a flash memory purchase agreement. On November 26, 2002, the parties filed a Stipulated Dismissal Without Prejudice, which was entered by the Court on December 4, 2002. 51 Table of Contents Risks Related to Our International Operations, War in Iraq and Threats of War Elsewhere, and Changes in Securities Laws and Regulations Because of our international operations, we must comply with numerous international laws and regulations and we are vulnerable to political instability and currency fluctuations. Political risks. Currently, the majority of our flash memory and controller wafers are produced by Toshiba in Japan and UMC in Taiwan. After the restructuring of our FlashVision business and the signing of our new flash memory purchase agreement with Samsung, all of our flash memory and controller wafers and flash memory products are now produced overseas by Toshiba, UMC and Samsung. We also use third party subcontractors in Taiwan, China and Japan for the assembly and testing of some of our card and component products. We may therefore be affected by the political, economic and military conditions in these countries. Taiwan is currently engaged in various political disputes with China and in the past both countries have conducted military exercises in or near the others territorial waters and airspace. The Taiwanese and Chinese governments may escalate these disputes, resulting in an economic embargo, a disruption in shipping routes or even military hostilities. This could harm our business by interrupting or delaying the production or shipment of flash memory wafers or card products by our Taiwanese or Japanese foundries and subcontractors. Under its current leadership, the Chinese government has been pursuing economic reform policies, including the encouragement of foreign trade and investment and greater economic decentralization. The Chinese government may not continue to pursue these policies and, even if it does continue, these policies may not be successful. The Chinese government may also significantly alter these policies from time to time. In addition, China does not currently have a comprehensive and highly developed legal system, particularly with respect to the protection of intellectual property rights. As a result, enforcement of existing and future laws and contracts is uncertain, and the implementation and interpretation of such laws may be inconsistent. Such inconsistency could lead to piracy and degradation of our intellectual property protection. Although we do not believe the current political unrest and continuing escalation of violence in Israel represent a major security problem for Tower since Migdal Haemek, Israel is in a relatively secure geographic location, the unrest may expand and even if it remains at current levels, could cause scheduling delays, as well as economic uncertainty, which could cause potential foundry customers to go elsewhere for their foundry business. Moreover, if U.S. military actions in Afghanistan, Iraq or elsewhere, or current Israeli military actions, result in retaliation against Israel, Towers fabrication facility and our engineering design center in Israel may be adversely impacted. In addition, while the political unrest has not yet posed a direct security risk to our engineering design center in Israel, it may cause unforeseen delays in the development of our products and may in the future pose such a direct security risk. Economic risks. We price our products primarily in U.S. Dollars. If the Euro, Yen and other currencies weaken relative to the U.S. Dollar, our products may be relatively more expensive in these regions, which could result in a decrease in our sales. While most of our sales are denominated in U.S. Dollars, we invoice certain Japanese customers in Japanese Yen and are subject to exchange rate fluctuations on these transactions, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. General risks. Our international business activities could also be limited or disrupted by any of the following factors: the need to comply with foreign government regulation; general geopolitical risks such as political and economic instability, potential hostilities and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships; natural disasters affecting the countries in which we conduct our business, particularly Japan, such as the earthquakes experienced in Taiwan in 1999 and in Japan and China in previous years; imposition of regulatory requirements, tariffs, import and export restrictions and other barriers and restrictions; 52 Table of Contents longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection, particularly as we increase our sales through the retail distribution channel, and general business conditions deteriorate; adverse tax rules and regulations; weak protection of our intellectual property rights; and delays in product shipments due to local customs restrictions. Terrorist attacks and threats, and government responses thereto, may negatively impact all aspects of our operations, revenues, costs and stock price. The terrorist attacks in the United States, the U.S. retaliation for these attacks, the War in Iraq and threats of war elsewhere and the related decline in consumer confidence and continued economic weakness have had a substantial adverse impact on our retail sales. Any escalation in these events or similar future events may disrupt our operations or those of our customers and suppliers and may affect the availability of materials needed to manufacture our products or the means to transport those materials to manufacturing facilities and finished products to customers. In addition, these events have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the U.S. and world economy in general and consumer confidence and spending in particular, which could harm our sales. In addition, recent consumer reports indicate that consumer confidence has reached its lowest level since 1993. If consumer confidence continues to decline or does not recover, our revenues and results of operations may be adversely impacted throughout 2003 and beyond. Any of these events could increase volatility in the U.S. and world financial markets, which could harm our stock price and may limit the capital resources available to us and our customers or suppliers. This could have a significant impact on our operating results, revenues and costs and may result in increased volatility in the market price of our common stock. Recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs. The Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 that became law in July 2002 requires changes in our corporate governance, public disclosure and compliance practices. The Act also requires the SEC to promulgate new rules on a variety of subjects. In addition to final rules and rule proposals already made, Nasdaq has proposed revisions to its requirements for companies, such as us, that are Nasdaq listed. We expect these developments to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, and to make some activities more difficult, such as stockholder approval of new option plans. We expect these developments to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These developments could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and qualified executive officers. We are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result. Risks Related to Our Charter Documents, Stockholder Rights Plan, Our Stock Price and Our Debt Rating Anti takeover provisions in our charter documents, stockholder rights plan and in Delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control and, as a result, negatively impact our stockholders. We have taken a number of actions that could have the effect of discouraging a takeover attempt. For example, we have adopted a stockholder rights plan that would cause substantial dilution to a stockholder, and substantially increase the cost paid by a stockholder, who attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors. This could prevent us from being acquired. In addition, our certificate of incorporation grants the board of directors the authority to fix the rights, preferences and privileges of and issue up to 4,000,000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder action. Although we have no present intention to issue shares of preferred stock, such an issuance could have the effect of making it more difficult and less attractive for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. Preferred stock may also have other rights, including economic rights senior to our common stock that could have a material adverse effect on the 53 Table of Contents market value of our common stock. In addition, we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. This section provides that except in certain limited circumstances a corporation shall not engage in any business combination with any interested stockholder during the three year period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of SanDisk. Our stock price has been, and may continue to be, volatile, which could result in investors losing all or part of their investments. The market price of our stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to continue to fluctuate in the future. For example, in the 12 months ending December 31, 2002, our stock price fluctuated significantly from a low of $9.60 to a high of $29.20. We believe that such fluctuations will continue as a result of future announcements concerning us, our competitors or principal customers regarding technological innovations, new product introductions, governmental regulations, litigation or changes in earnings estimates by analysts. In addition, in recent years the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of the securities of high technology and semiconductor companies have been especially volatile, often for reasons outside the control of the particular companies. These fluctuations as well as general economic, political and market conditions may have an adverse affect on the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, the market price for the notes may be adversely affected by declines in the market price of our common stock or deterioration of our financial performance, declines in the overall market for similar securities and the actual or perceived performance or prospects for companies in our industry. The ratings assigned to us and our notes may fluctuate, which could harm the market price of the notes and our common stock. We and our notes have been rated by Standard & Poors Ratings Services, and may be rated by other rating agencies in the future. Standard & Poors Ratings Services assigned its B corporate credit rating to us and its CCC+ subordinated debt rating to our notes. If our current ratings are lowered or if other rating agencies assign us or the notes ratings lower than expected by investors, the market price of the notes and our common stock would be significantly harmed. Risks Related to Our Indebtedness We have increased our indebtedness through our convertible subordinated notes offering, which may restrict our cash flow, make it difficult for us to obtain future financing, divert our resources from other uses, limit our ability to react to changes in the industry, and place us at a competitive disadvantage. As a result of the sale and issuance of our 4 1/2% convertible subordinated notes in December 2001 and January 2002, we incurred $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of additional indebtedness, substantially increasing our ratio of debt to total capitalization. While the notes are outstanding, we will have debt service obligations on the notes of approximately $6.8 million per year in interest payments. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash to meet these obligations and must instead use our existing cash or investments, we may have to reduce, curtail or terminate other activities of our business. We intend to fulfill our debt service obligations from cash generated by our operations, if any, and from our existing cash and investments. If necessary, among other alternatives, we may add lease lines of credit to finance capital expenditures and obtain other long term debt and lines of credit. We may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The level of our indebtedness, among other things, could: require the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from our operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes; make it difficult for us to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes; 54 Table of Contents cause us to use a significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents or possibly liquidate other assets to repay the total principal amount due under the notes and our other indebtedness if we were to default under the notes or our other indebtedness; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in, our business and the industries in which we complete; place us at a possible competitive disadvantage with respect to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources; and make us more vulnerable in the event of a further downturn in our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our debt service obligations, including our obligations under the notes. In 2000, we entered into a joint venture agreement with Toshiba, under which we formed FlashVision. In May 2002, FlashVision secured a new equipment lease arrangement of approximately 37.9 billion Japanese Yen (or approximately $305 million based on the exchange rate in effect on the date the agreement was executed) with Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., or Mizuho, and certain other financial institutions. Under the terms of the new lease, Toshiba is required to provide a guarantee to these financial institutions on behalf of FlashVision. We have agreed to indemnify Toshiba in certain circumstances for certain liabilities Toshiba incurs as a result of Toshibas guarantee of the FlashVision equipment lease arrangement. If FlashVision fails to meet its lease commitments, and Toshiba fulfills these commitments under the term of Toshibas guarantee, we will be obligated to reimburse Toshiba for 49.9% of any claims under the lease, unless such claims result from Toshibas failure to meet its obligations to FlashVision or its covenants to the lenders. Because FlashVisions new equipment lease arrangement is denominated in Japanese Yen, the maximum amount of our contingent indemnification obligation on a given date when converted to U.S. Dollars will fluctuate based on the exchange rate in effect on that date. As of December 31, 2002, the maximum amount of our contingent indemnification obligation, which reflects payments and any lease adjustments, was approximately $142.4 million. This contingent indemnification obligation might constitute senior indebtedness under the notes and we may use a portion of the proceeds from the notes to repay the obligation. This would result in the diversion of resources from other important areas of our business and could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to satisfy a fundamental change offer under the indenture governing the notes. The indenture governing the notes contains provisions that apply to a fundamental change. A fundamental change as defined in the indenture would occur if we were to be acquired for consideration other than cash or securities traded on a major U.S. securities market. If someone triggers a fundamental change, we may be required to offer to purchase the notes with cash. This would result in the diversion of resources from other important areas of our business and could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we have to make a fundamental change offer, we cannot be sure that we will have enough funds to pay for all the notes that the holders could tender. Our failure to redeem tendered notes upon a fundamental change would constitute a default under the indenture and might constitute a default under the terms of our other indebtedness, which would significantly harm our business and financial condition. We may not be able to pay our debt and other obligations, which would cause us to be in default under the terms of our indebtedness, which would result in harm to our business and financial condition. If our cash flow is inadequate to meet our obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on the notes or our other indebtedness, we would be in default under the terms thereof, which would permit the holders of the notes to accelerate the maturity of the notes and also could cause defaults under our other 55 Table of Contents indebtedness. Any such default would harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. In addition, we cannot assure you that we would be able to repay amounts due in respect of the notes if payment of the notes were to be accelerated following the occurrence of any other event of default as defined in the indenture governing the notes. Moreover, we cannot assure that we will have sufficient funds or will be able to arrange for financing to pay the principal amount due on the notes at maturity. We may need additional financing, which could be difficult to obtain, and which if not obtained in satisfactory amounts may prevent us from developing or enhancing our products, taking advantage of future opportunities, growing our business or responding to competitive pressures or unanticipated industry changes, any of which could harm our business. We currently expect that our existing cash and investment balances, including the proceeds of the notes, and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements to fund operations and expected capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months. However, in the event we need to raise additional funds during that time period or in future periods, we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if at all. From time to time, we may decide to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings to fund our activities. If we issue additional equity securities, our stockholders will experience additional dilution and the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock or debt securities. In addition, if we raise funds through debt financing, we will have to pay interest and may be subject to restrictive covenants, which could harm our business. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, if and when needed, we may not be able to develop or enhance our products, take advantage of future opportunities, grow our business or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated industry changes, any of which could have a negative impact on our business. The notes and other indebtedness have rights senior to those of our current stockholders such that in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization or upon acceleration of the notes due to an event of default under the indenture and in certain other events, our assets will be available for distribution to our current stockholders only after all senior indebtedness is repaid. In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization or upon acceleration of the notes due to an event of default under the indenture and in certain other events, our assets will be available for distribution to our current stockholders only after all senior indebtedness, including our contingent indemnification obligations to Toshiba and obligations under the notes, have been paid in full. As a result, there may not be sufficient assets remaining to make any distributions to our stockholders. The notes are also effectively subordinated to the liabilities of any of our subsidiaries (including trade payables, which as of December 31, 2002 were $722,000). Neither we, nor our subsidiaries are limited from incurring debt, including senior indebtedness, under the indenture. If we, or our subsidiaries were to incur additional debt or liabilities, our ability to pay our obligations on the notes could be adversely affected. We anticipate that from time to time we will incur additional debt, including senior indebtedness. Our subsidiaries are also likely to incur liabilities in the future. 56 Table of Contents Item 7a. Qualitative and quantitative disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. To mitigate some of these risks, we utilize currency forward contracts. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. At December 31, 2002, we had a warrant to purchase ordinary shares of Tower at a fair value of approximately $537,000. Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. This is accomplished by investing in widely diversified short term investments, consisting primarily of investment grade securities, substantially all of which either mature within the next twelve months or have characteristics of short term investments. A hypothetical 50 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $706,100 decline (less than 0.5%) in the fair value of our available for sale debt securities. Foreign Currency Risk. A substantial majority of our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activity are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, we do enter into transactions in other currencies, primarily the Japanese Yen. To protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign exchange rates, we have established a hedging program. Currency forward contracts are utilized in this hedging program. Our hedging program reduces, but does not always entirely eliminate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. An adverse change of 10% in exchange rates would result in a decline in income before taxes in 2002 of approximately $0.2 million. Market Risk. We also hold available for sale equity securities in our short term investment portfolio and equity investments in semiconductor wafer manufacturing companies. A reduction in prices of 10% of these marketable equity securities would result in a decrease in the fair value of our investments in marketable equity securities of approximately $10.6 million. As of December 31, 2002, we had net unrealized losses on short term equity securities totaling $5.5 million, which were included in other comprehensive income. These unrealized gains include an unrealized loss of $6.6 million on the decline in value of our investment in UMC. The market value of our investment in UMC has fluctuated significantly in the past and may decline in the future due to downturns in the semiconductor industry, declines in demand for UMCs products or unfavorable economic conditions. If we sell UMC shares in future periods, we may recognize a gain or loss due to fluctuations in the market value of our UMC stock. In 2002 and 2001, we recognized losses of $15.2 million and $26.1 million, respectively, on the other than temporary decline in the value of our Tower investment, the impairment in value on our prepaid wafer credits and approximately $0.7 million of losses related to the fair value of the warrants purchased in October of 2002. If the fair value of our Tower investment declines further or the wafer credits are deemed to have little or no value, it may be necessary to record additional losses. All of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial position at December 31, 2002. Actual results may differ materially. 57 Table of Contents
