Our flash data storage devices are marketed and sold primarily in the consumer electronics market. We expect that as we reduce the price of our flash cards, consumers will demand an increasing number of megabytes of memory. In order to profitably capitalize on price elasticity in the market for flash data storage cards, we must reduce our cost per megabyte at a rate similar to the change in selling price per megabyte to the consumer. Our operating results are affected by a number of factors including, among others, the unit volume of product sales, the flash memory density of the products sold, competitive pricing pressures, availability of foundry capacity from both captive and non captive sources, the timing and volume of sell through by our distributors and retail customers to their customers, variations in manufacturing cycle times, fluctuations in manufacturing yields and manufacturing capacity utilization, the timing of significant orders, our ability to accurately forecast demand and obtain sufficient supply, changes in product and customer mix, market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our products, changes in the channels through which our products are distributed, timing of new product announcements and introductions by us and our competitors, the timing of license and royalty revenues, fluctuations in product costs, increased research and development expenses and exchange rate fluctuations. See Item 1A, Risk Factors. We operate in one business segment, flash memory products. Our chief decision maker, our President and Chief Executive Officer, evaluates our performance based on company wide, consolidated results. Revenue is evaluated based on geographic region and by product category. Memory Sourcing. NAND memory is the largest component of the cost of our products. The majority of our NAND memory is purchased from captive sources of supply and our ventures with Toshiba and our Toshiba foundry arrangement. We also purchase flash memory products from non captive sources, to supplement our captive supply, allowing us to flexibly capture more market share. This non captive supply enabled us to generate additional sales and profits even though the gross margin on our non captive supply is significantly lower than the gross margin on our captive supply. However, our captive supply requires us to invest in capital assets, research and development and start up and other production costs. We expect to continue sourcing both captive and non captive flash memory. 32 Table of Contents Licensing and Royalties. The timing and amount of royalty revenues and the recognition of license fees can vary substantially from quarter to quarter depending on the terms of our license agreements and the timing and volume of sales of products by our licensees. Gross margins and operating income fluctuate more with changes in license and royalty revenues than with changes in product revenues since license and royalty revenues have immaterial variable costs of sale. Retail Sales. Our arrangements with retailers often involve complex terms. These terms include providing the retailer with a right to return unsold product, market development funds, cooperative advertising funds, price protection, volume incentive rebates and other promotions. In some cases, we consign inventory to our customers. These consignment activities involve administrative costs to track and account for our inventory. We defer recognition of revenue on sales to retailers and distributors until they sell through the product they have purchased from us to their customers. Our retail business is seasonal, with the fourth quarter being the strongest due to holiday sales in North America. Memory Market Dynamics. Semiconductor memory markets have generally been characterized by cycles of undersupply and oversupply. In an oversupply environment, price reductions occur and the value of our inventory may decrease resulting in a lower of cost or market price adjustment if pricing pressure results in a net realizable value that is lower than our cost. In 2001, for example, we recorded approximately $85.0 million of charges related to inventory revaluation. We may be forced to reduce the carrying value of our inventory if market demand for our products deteriorates and our inventory levels exceed customer orders. Our business is characterized by constant focus on cost reduction. NAND flash memory cost reduction is achieved by transitioning to new generations of technology, by producing larger wafer sizes and by improving yields. Manufacturing yields are lower at the start of manufacturing each successive product generation. During the start up phase, the fabrication equipment and operating expenses are applied to a relatively small output of production wafers, making this output very expensive. In the next two to three years, we expect to make substantial new investments in additional fabrication capacity in the ventures with Toshiba. Matrix Acquisition. On January 13, 2006, we acquired Matrix Semiconductor, Inc. Matrix is a pioneer in the design and development of three dimensional (3 D) integrated circuits. Matrix 3 D memory is used for one time programmable storage applications where low cost is the paramount consideration, such as video games, music and archiving. Critical Accounting Policies & Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including, among others, those related to customer programs and incentives, product returns, bad debts, inventories and related reserves, investments, income taxes, warranty obligations, stock compensation, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities when those values are not readily apparent from other sources. Estimates have historically approximated actual results. However, future results will differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. Revenue Recognition, Sales Returns and Allowances and Sales Incentive Programs. We recognize net revenues when the earnings process is complete, as evidenced by an agreement with the customer, transfer of title and acceptance, if applicable, fixed pricing and reasonable assurance of realization. Sales made to distributors and retailers are generally under agreements allowing price protection and or right of return and, therefore, the sales and related costs of these transactions are deferred until the retailers or distributors sell the merchandise to their end customer, or the rights of return expire. At January 1, 2006 and January 2, 2005, deferred income, from sales to distributors and retailers was $139.9 million and $82.0 million, respectively. Estimated sales returns are provided for as a reduction to product revenue and deferred revenue and were not material for any period presented in our consolidated financial statements. 33 Table of Contents We record estimated reductions to revenue or to deferred revenue for customer and distributor incentive programs and offerings, including price protection, promotions, co op advertising, and other volume based incentives and expected returns. Additionally, we have incentive programs that require us to estimate, based on historical experience, the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. All sales incentive programs are recorded as an offset to product revenues, deferred revenues or a charge to marketing expenses. In the past, actual returns and rebates have not been significantly different from our estimates. However, actual returns and rebates in any future period could differ from our estimates, which could impact the net revenue we report. Inventories and Inventory Valuation. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out) or market. Market value is based upon an estimated average selling price reduced by estimated costs of disposal. The determination of market value involves numerous judgments including estimating average selling prices based upon recent sales volumes, industry trends, existing customer orders, current contract prices, industry analysis of supply and demand and seasonal factors. Should actual market conditions differ from our estimates, our future results of operations could be materially affected. The valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory. The determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products within specific time horizons, generally six to twelve months. To the extent our demand forecast for specific products is less than our product on hand and our noncancelable orders, we could be required to record additional inventory reserves, which would have a negative impact on our gross margin. Accounting for Investments. We evaluate whether entities that we have invested in are variable interest entities within the definition of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46, Accounting for Variable Interest Entities. If those entities are variable interest entities, then we determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of that entity by reference to our contractual and business arrangements with respect to residual gains and residual losses on liquidation of that entity. With respect to all equity investments, we review the degree of control that our investment and other arrangements give us over the entity we have invested in and our business to confirm that these conclusions are correct. Generally, after considering all factors, if we hold equity interests representing less than 20% of the outstanding voting interests of an entity we invested in, we use the cost method of accounting. If we hold at least 20% but less than a majority of the outstanding voting interests of an entity we invested in, we use the equity method of accounting. We have the financial capability and the intent to hold our loans to the ventures with Toshiba until maturity and accordingly those loans are carried at cost and their value in our financial statements is not adjusted to market value. Deferred Tax Assets. We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. We consider historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We carried a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets of $14.9 million and $12.3 million at January 1, 2006 and January 2, 2005, respectively, based on our view that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to take tax a benefit for unrealized capital losses on our investments in foundries. 34 Table of Contents Results of Operations Product Revenues. Percent Percent FY 2005 Change FY 2004 Change FY 2003 (In millions, except percentages) Retail $ 1,621.0 31 % $ 1,236.0 96 % $ 632.1 OEM 445.6 21 % 366.8 5 % 350.2 Product revenues $ 2,066.6 29 % $ 1,602.8 63 % $ 982.3 The increase in our 2005 product revenues was comprised of a 166% increase in the number of megabytes sold and partially offset by a 52% reduction in our average selling price per megabyte. The markets that we sell to have been price elastic. In 2005, as the price per megabyte came down, the average memory density of our products sold increased by 215%. Our unit sales also increased by 23% with the growth in our unit sales primarily attributable to growth in the markets for mobile cards for camera phones and music centric phones, USB flash drives and flash based digital audio players. We expect to continue to reduce our price per megabyte, including price reductions already initiated in 2006, as technology advances allow us to further reduce our cost per megabyte. Partially offsetting the 2005 growth in revenues was the fact that fiscal 2005 consisted of 52 weeks as compared to 53 weeks in the prior year. The increase in our 2004 product revenues was comprised of a 167% increase in the number of megabytes sold and partially offset by a 38% reduction in our average selling price per megabyte. Our 2004 unit sales increased by 53% compared to 2003, with the increase primarily attributable to growth in the markets for digital still cameras, USB flash drives and feature phones with card slots and the introduction, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, of SanDisk flash based digital audio players. In addition, our fiscal 2004 consisted of 53 weeks as compared to 52 weeks in the prior fiscal year. Geographical Product Revenues.

In 2004, the increase in North America and EMEA revenue reflects increased retail demand due to the growth in consumer based products requiring additional flash memory. License and Royalty Revenues. Percent Percent FY 2005 Change FY 2004 Change FY 2003 (In millions, except percentages) License and royalty revenues $ 239.5 37 % $ 174.2 79 % $ 97.5 The increase in our 2005 and 2004 license and royalty revenue was primarily due to increased royalty bearing sales by our licensees in each of those fiscal years. 35 Table of Contents Gross Margins. Percent Percent FY 2005 Change FY 2004 Change FY 2003 (In millions, except percentages) Product gross margins $ 733.3 43 % $ 511.5 50 % $ 341.2 Product gross margins (as a percent of product revenue) 35.5 % 31.9 % 34.7 % Total gross margins (as a percent of total revenue) 42.2 % 38.6 % 40.6 % The largest driver of the 2005 increase in product gross margins was the reduction in our cost per megabyte due to the transition to 90 nanometer technology partially offset by decreases in our average selling price per megabyte. Fiscal 2005 gross margins were also benefited due to more production supply coming from captive sources which have lower costs. The largest driver of the 2004 decline in product gross margins was an increased reliance on non captive memory sources. We earn significantly lower gross margins on non captive memory than on captive memory supply, and non captive memory accounted for approximately 35% and 24% of our memory sourcing in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Our captive gross margin improved by approximately two percentage points as our cost reductions were greater than the decline in average selling price per megabyte. This partially offset the impact of our higher non captive mix. Research and Development. Percent Percent FY 2005 Change FY 2004 Change FY 2003 (In millions, except percentages) Research and development $ 194.8 56 % $ 125.0 48 % $ 84.2 Percent of revenue 8.4 % 7.0 % 7.8 % Our 2005 research and development expense growth was primarily due to higher vendor engineering costs and costs associated with the initial design and development of manufacturing process technology related to Flash Partners 300 millimeter production line of $42.4 million, and payroll and payroll related expenses of $15.6 million associated with headcount increases related to developing new products. Our 2004 research and development expense growth was primarily due to increased payroll and payroll related expenses associated with higher headcount in support of our broadening product portfolio, higher vendor engineering costs and costs associated with the initial design and development of manufacturing process technology related to Flash Partners 300 millimeter production line. We grew our research and development headcount to 340 at the end of 2004 from 272 at the end of 2003. Sales and Marketing.

In 2006, we plan to capitalize on the growing consumer awareness of the SanDisk brand by increasing our investments in building and promoting the SanDisk brand globally. Our 2004 sales and marketing expenses were primarily related to increased tradeshow, advertising and branding, and payroll and payroll related expenses, all in support of our higher revenue base. In 2004, advertising and branding activities included television advertising in the United States, increased North American and Asia 36 Table of Contents Pacific print media spending and advertising and merchandising for such product lines as USB drives, wireless mobile and Shoot & Store.

Our 2005 general and administrative expenses also included significant consulting expenses associated with establishing new legal entities and modifying our corporate organization to reflect our global business. Our 2004 general and administrative expenses increases were primarily relates to increased legal expenses related in part to higher litigation expenses to defend our intellectual property, increased staffing and consulting expenses to support our expanded business and compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act, as well as provisions for doubtful accounts due to the growth in accounts receivable balances.

Our 2003 tax rate differs from the statutory rate due to state tax expense, a reversal of the tax benefit we recognized in 2001 and 2002 related to the unrealized gain on the disposition of our UMC shares and to the benefit provided by the reversal of $47 million in valuation allowance carried on the net deferred tax assets at the end of fiscal 2002 which could be taken principally because our net operating loss carryforwards have been fully realized. Our future tax rate may be impacted by state taxes, our ability to realize tax benefits from capital losses and the geographic mix of our earnings. 37 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows. Operating activities generated $480.9 million of cash during the year ended January 1, 2006. Significant contributors to the generation of cash from operations were net income of $386.4 million, non cash adjustments to income for depreciation and amortization of $65.8 million, loss on investment in Tower Semiconductor of $10.1 million, foreign currency revaluation of FlashVision notes receivable of $7.7 million, amortization/accretion related to original premium/discount on short term investments of $2.6 million, decreases in income tax receivable of $64.2 million, increases in accounts payable of $148.2 million, increases in related party liabilities of $24.7 million, accrued payroll and related expenses of $13.8 million, deferred income of $57.2 million and current and non current other accrued liabilities of $6.9 million. These were partially offset by increases in the inventory balance of $135.2 million, accounts receivable of $134.2 million, other current and non current assets of $31.1 million, wafer cost adjustments of $2.3 million and deferred taxes of $1.5 million. Operating activities generated $227.6 million of cash during the year ended January 2, 2005. Significant contributors to the generation of cash from operations were net income of $266.6 million, non cash adjustments to income for depreciation and amortization of $38.9 million, allowances for doubtful accounts of $4.6 million, amortization/accretion related to original premium/discount on short term investments of $3.2 million and amortization of bond issuance costs of $2.6 million; decreases in deposits and other assets of $13.3 million, increases in accrued payroll and related expenses of $13.5 million and both current and non current other accrued liabilities of $15.2 million. These were partially offset by increases in the inventory balance of $79.5 million, accounts receivable of $14.9 million and decreases in deferred income on shipments to distributors and retailers and deferred revenue of $15.4 million, and decreases in accounts payable, income taxes payable and other current liabilities to related parties of $6.2 million. We used $299.5 million for investing activities during the year ended January 1, 2006. We increased our short term investment balance by $81.0 million, loaned $34.2 million to FlashVision, invested $21.8 million in Flash Partners, loaned $20.0 million to Matrix Semiconductor, Inc., purchased $39.1 million of semiconductor wafer manufacturing equipment to be used at Toshibas Yokkaichi Operations, purchased $95.4 million of test equipment and $3.5 million of investment in foundries and acquired a technology license for $4.5 million. For year ended January 2, 2005, we used $523.0 million for investing activities. We increased our short term investment balance by $337.0 million, loaned $33.6 million to FlashVision, invested $23.1 million in Flash Partners, purchased $63.4 million of 200 millimeter semiconductor wafer manufacturing equipment to be used at Toshibas Yokkaichi Operations and purchased $62.4 million of test equipment and other capital items. We generated $115.4 million and $24.6 million of cash from exercises of stock options and sales under our employee stock purchase plan during the years ended January 1, 2006 and January 2, 2005, respectively. Liquid Assets. At January 1, 2006, we had cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $1.7 billion. As of that date, the cost basis of our investment in 24.5 million UMC shares was $13.4 million and its market value was $13.9 million. As of January 1, 2006, we held 10.2 million Tower shares whose carrying value and market value was $12.9 million and $14.8 million, respectively. As of January 1, 2006, we have agreed not to sell 7.2 million of our 10.2 million Tower shares. This restriction is no longer in effect in fiscal 2006. However, we do remain subject to certain restrictions on the transfer of our Tower ordinary shares including certain rights of first refusal, and through January 2008, have agreed to maintain minimum shareholdings. Short Term Liquidity. As of January 1, 2006, our working capital balance was $2.0 billion. We do not expect any liquidity constraints in the next twelve months. In 2006, we currently expect to loan or make investments in Flash Partners of approximately $500 million, and additionally to guarantee future operating leases of Flash Partners or procure other financing of approximately $500 million. We also expect to spend approximately $200 million on property and equipment, which includes assembly and test equipment as well as engineering equipment, and spending related to facilities and information systems. Long Term Requirements. Depending on the demand for our products, we may decide to make additional investments, which could be substantial, in wafer fabrication foundry capacity and assembly and test manufacturing equipment to support our business in the future. We may also make equity investments in other companies or engage in merger or acquisition transactions. These additional investments may require us to raise additional financing, 38 Table of Contents which could be difficult to obtain, and which if not obtained in satisfactory amounts may prevent us from funding the ventures with Toshiba, increasing our wafer supply, developing or enhancing our products, taking advantage of future opportunities, growing our business or responding to competitive pressures or unanticipated industry changes, any of which could harm our business. Contingent Obligations. We agreed to reimburse Toshiba for 49.9% of losses it sustains under its guarantee of FlashVisions operating lease with Mizuho Leasing. As of January 1, 2006, the maximum exposure for both us and Toshiba under that guarantee was 17.7 billion Japanese yen, or approximately $150 million based upon the exchange rate at January 1, 2006, and our maximum exposure was 8.8 billion Japanese yen, or approximately $75 million based upon the exchange rate at January 1, 2006. See Item 1, Business Ventures With Toshiba FlashVision. Toshiba Ventures. We are a 49.9% percent owner in two ventures, FlashVision and Flash Partners. Toshiba owns 50.1% of each of these ventures. We account for our investments under the equity method and do not consolidate. FlashVision and Flash Partners are variable interest entities and we are not the primary beneficiary of either venture because we are entitled to less than a majority of any residual gains and are obligated with respect to less than a majority of residual losses with respect to both ventures. Both FlashVision and Flash Partners purchase wafers from Toshiba and then resell those wafers to Toshiba and us at cost plus a markup. The cost of the wafers we purchase from FlashVision and Flash Partners is recorded in inventory and ultimately cost of sales. Our share of the net income or loss of FlashVision and Flash Partners is included in our Consolidated Statement of Income as Equity in income/(loss) of business ventures. FlashVision and Flash Partners each own or lease separately semiconductor manufacturing equipment that is placed inside Toshibas Yokkaichi, Japan operations. The capital equipment owned by FlashVision and Flash Partners is funded through investments in or loans to the ventures from us and Toshiba. For semiconductor fixed assets that are leased by FlashVision or Flash Partners, we guarantee a portion of the outstanding lease payments under those leases through various methods. This obligation is denominated in Japanese yen and is noncancelable. We are contractually obligated to purchase half of FlashVision and Flash Partners NAND wafer supply. The cost of the wafer supply includes all amounts to reimburse FlashVision and Flash Partners for their costs to produce the NAND wafers. We cannot estimate the total amount of the wafer purchase commitment as of January 1, 2006 because our price is determined by reference to the future cost to produce the semiconductor wafers. In addition to the semiconductor assets owned by FlashVision and Flash Partners, we purchase and directly own semiconductor manufacturing equipment in Toshibas Yokkaichi operations for which we receive 100% of the output from this equipment. From time to time, we and Toshiba mutually approve increases in wafer supply capacity of FlashVision and Flash Partners that may contractually obligate us to increased capital funding. We and Toshiba each pay the cost of our own design teams and 50% of the wafer processing and similar costs associated with this direct design and development of flash memory. See Note 5 and Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. As part of the FlashVision and Flash Partners agreements, we agreed to share in Toshibas costs associated with NAND product development and its common semiconductor research and development activities. As of January 1, 2006, we had accrued liabilities related to those expenses of $4.2 million. Our common research and development obligation related to FlashVision and Flash Partners is variable but capped at increasing fixed quarterly amounts through 2008 and is not subject to any payment caps thereafter. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. Our direct research and development contribution is determined based on a variable computation. The common R&D participation agreement and the product development agreement are exhibits to this report and should be read carefully in their entirety for a more complete understanding of these arrangements. We have guaranteed on an unsecured and several basis 50% of Flash Partners lease obligation under a master lease agreement entered into in December 2004. Our total lease obligation guarantee, net of lease payments as of January 1, 2006, was 24.0 billion Japanese yen, or approximately $203 million based upon the exchange rate at January 1, 2006. In December 2005, Flash Partners secured an additional equipment lease facility of 35.0 billion Japanese yen, or approximately $297 million based upon the exchange rate at January 1, 2006, from a consortium of financial institutions. We agreed to guarantee on an unsecured and several basis 50% of the draw downs under this facility. As of January 1, 2006, no draw downs had been made, however the entire amount was drawn down in January 2006. Our maximum exposure under the guarantee is 17.5 billion Japanese yen, or approximately 39 Table of Contents $148 million based upon the exchange rate at January 1, 2006. See Item 1, Business Ventures With Toshiba Flash Partners. The terms of the Flash Partners venture contractually obligate us and Toshiba to expand Flash Partners capacity. As of February 2006, we and Toshiba have committed to expand Flash Partners capacity to 70,000 wafer starts per month. We currently estimate the remaining total equipment funding obligation for the 70,000 wafer starts per month level to be approximately 365.0 billion Japanese yen, or approximately $3.1 billion based upon the exchange rate at January 1, 2006. Of this amount, we are obligated to fund 182.5 billion Japanese yen, or approximately $1.5 billion based upon the exchange rate at January 1, 2006, of which 42.5 billion Japanese yen, or approximately $361 million based upon the exchange rate at January 1, 2006, is being financed through Flash Partners operating lease facilities. Our remaining funding obligation at January 1, 2006 is approximately $1.0 billion. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Our contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements at January 1, 2006, and the effect those contractual obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow over the next five years is presented in textual and tabular format in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. Impact of Currency Exchange Rates Future exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and result of operations. In 2005, we used foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate transaction gains and losses generated by these monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies than the U.S. dollar, currently only the Japanese yen. We did not use foreign currency forward contracts in 2004 and 2003. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. Our derivative instruments are recorded at fair value with changes recorded in other income (expense). See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. For a discussion of foreign operating risks and foreign currency risks, see Item 1A, Risk Factors. Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards The Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, adopted a revised Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, or FAS 123R, Share Based Payments, with an effective date of June 15, 2005. In April 2005, the SEC amended the effective date of FAS 123R, and we will now be required to adopt this standard for our first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. We adopted FAS 123R in January 2006 and currently do not expect to restate prior periods to conform to the new accounting standard as we will use the modified prospective method. FAS 123R requires us to recognize an expense based on the fair value of all share based payments to employees, including grants of options to buy shares of our common stock. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for information related to the pro forma effect on reported net income and net earnings per share of applying the fair value provisions of the FAS 123. Adoption of FAS 123R is expected to increase our operating expenses. In anticipation of expensing equity instruments, we have reduced overall stock option grants and reduced the percentage of incentive stock options to total stock options granted. In May 2005, the FASB issued Financial Accounting Standards No. 154, or FAS 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. FAS 154 replaced Accounting Pronouncement Board Opinion No. 20, or APB 20, Accounting Changes, and Financial Accounting Standards No. 3, or FAS 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements. FAS 154 requires that a voluntary change in accounting principle be applied retrospectively with all 40 Table of Contents prior period financial statements presented based on the application of the new accounting principle. The statement will require the retrospective application of the impact of the direct effect of changes in accounting principles unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. FAS 154 carries forward without change the guidance contained in APB 20 for reporting the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements and changes in accounting estimates. FAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005 and require prospective application. We will adopt this standard on January 2, 2006 and currently do not anticipate that it will have a material effect on its financial statements or disclosures. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. This is accomplished by investing in widely diversified short term investments, consisting primarily of investment grade securities, substantially all of which either mature within the next twelve months or have characteristics of short term investments. As of January 1, 2006, a hypothetical 50 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $2.6 million decline (less than 0.25%) in the fair value of our available for sale debt securities. Foreign Currency Risk. A substantial majority of our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activity is transacted in U.S. dollars. However, we do enter into transactions in other currencies, primarily the Japanese yen. Movements in currency exchange rates, especially the Japanese yen, could cause variability in our revenues, expenses or other income (expense), net. We had forward exchange contracts in place with a notional amount of 3.95 billion Japanese yen, or approximately $34 million based upon the exchange rate at January 1, 2006 and zero as of January 2, 2005. The effect of an immediate 10% adverse change in exchange rates on forward exchange contracts would result in an approximate $3.0 million loss. However, as we utilize foreign currency instruments, for mitigating anticipated balance sheet exposures, a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying exposure. See Item 1A, Risk Factors. and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. Market Risk. We also hold available for sale equity securities in semiconductor wafer manufacturing companies. As of January 1, 2006, a reduction in prices of 10% of these marketable equity securities would result in a decrease in the fair value of our investments in marketable equity securities of approximately $2.7 million. All of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial position at January 1, 2006. Actual results may differ materially.
