Our mission is to provide simple, reliable and affordable storage for consumer use in portable devices. We sell SanDisk branded products for consumer electronics through broad global retail and original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, distribution channels. We design, develop and manufacture products and solutions in a variety of form factors using our flash memory, controller and firmware technologies. We source the vast majority of our flash memory supply through our significant venture relationships with Toshiba Corporation, or Toshiba, which provide us with leading edge low cost memory wafers. Our cards are used in a wide range of consumer electronics devices such as mobile phones, digital cameras, gaming devices and laptop computers. We also produce Universal Serial Bus, or USB, drives, MP3 players and other flash storage products that are embedded in a variety of systems for the enterprise, industrial, military and other markets. Our results are primarily driven by worldwide demand for flash storage devices, which in turn depends on end user demand for electronic products. We believe the market for flash storage is price elastic. Accordingly, we expect that as we reduce the price of our flash devices, consumers will demand an increasing number of megabytes and or units of memory and that over time, new markets will emerge. In order to profitably capitalize on price elasticity of demand in the market for flash storage products, we must reduce our cost per megabyte at a rate similar to the 37 Table of Contents change in selling price per megabyte to the consumer and the average capacity of our products must grow enough to offset price declines. We seek to achieve these cost reductions through technology improvements primarily by increasing the amount of memory stored in a given area of silicon. We adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Interpretation No. 48, or FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, at the beginning of fiscal year 2007. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. Adoption of FIN 48 did not have a significant impact on our financial position and result of operations. For further discussion on adoption of FIN 48, please refer to Note 10, Income Taxes, to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. Critical Accounting Policies Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. Use of Estimates. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including, among others, those related to customer programs and incentives, product returns, bad debts, inventories and related reserves, investments, income taxes, warranty obligations, stock compensation, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities when those values are not readily apparent from other sources. Estimates have historically approximated actual results. However, future results will differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. Revenue Recognition, Sales Returns and Allowances and Sales Incentive Programs. We recognize revenues when the earnings process is complete, as evidenced by an agreement with the customer, transfer of title and acceptance, if applicable, fixed pricing and reasonable assurance of realization. Sales made to distributors and retailers are generally under agreements allowing price protection and or right of return and, therefore, the sales and related costs of these transactions are deferred until the retailers or distributors sell the merchandise to their end customer, or the rights of return expire. At December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, deferred income from sales to distributors and retailers was $167.3 million and $169.9 million, respectively. Estimated sales returns are provided for as a reduction to product revenue and deferred revenue and were not material for any period presented in our consolidated financial statements. We record estimated reductions to revenue or to deferred revenue for customer and distributor incentive programs and offerings, including price protection, promotions, co op advertising, and other volume based incentives and expected returns. Additionally, we have incentive programs that require us to estimate, based on historical experience, the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. All sales incentive programs are recorded as an offset to product revenues or deferred revenues. In calculating the value of sales incentive programs, actual and estimated activity is used based upon reported weekly sell through data from our customers. The timing and resolution of these claims could materially impact product revenues or deferred revenues. However, actual returns and rebates in any future period could differ from our estimates, which could impact the revenue we report. Inventories and Inventory Valuation. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out) or market. Market value is based upon an estimated average selling price reduced by estimated costs of disposal. The determination of market value involves numerous judgments including estimating average selling prices based upon recent sales volumes, industry trends, existing customer orders, current contract prices, industry analysis of supply and demand and seasonal factors. Should actual market conditions differ from our estimates, our future results of operations could be materially affected. The valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory. The determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for 38 Table of Contents our products within specific time horizons, generally six to twelve months. To the extent our demand forecast for specific products is less than our product on hand and our noncancelable orders, we could be required to record additional inventory reserves, which would have a negative impact on our gross margin. Accounting for Variable Interest Entities. We evaluate whether entities in which we have invested are variable interest entities within the definition of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Interpretation No. 46R, or FIN 46R, Accounting for Variable Interest Entities. If those entities are variable interest entities, or VIEs, we then determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of that entity by reference to our contractual and business arrangements with respect to expected gains and losses. The assessment of the primary beneficiary includes an analysis of the forecast and contractual stipulations of the VIE. Determining whether we would consolidate or apply the equity method to a particular VIE requires review of the VIEs forecast, which involves analysis of company specific data, industry data, known trends and uncertainties, which are inherently subjective. Consolidating a VIE under FIN 46R rather than using the equity method can materially impact revenue, gross margin and operating income trends. Deferred Tax Assets. We must make certain estimates in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. In determining the need for and amount of our valuation allowance, we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets using historical levels of income, estimates of future income and tax planning strategies. While we have been profitable over the last several years, we compete in an industry with recurring average selling price declines. These price declines require us to apply judgment related to our forecast of future profitability and our recoverability of net deferred tax assets. Unanticipated downturns, alternative technologies or other negative factors in a continually changing high technology industry could result in declining future profitability and have an adverse impact on the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Our estimates for tax uncertainties require substantial judgment based upon the period of occurrence, complexity of the matter, available federal tax case law, interpretation of foreign laws and regulations and other estimates. There is no assurance that domestic or international tax authorities will agree with the tax positions we have taken which could materially impact future results. Share Based Compensation Employee Incentive Plans and Employee Stock Purchase Plans. Accounting for share based compensation awards and accounting for Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, shares are based upon the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), or SFAS 123(R), Share Based Payments, which requires the recognition of the fair value of share based compensation. The fair value of share based awards and ESPP shares was estimated using a Black Scholes Merton closed form option valuation model. The Black Scholes Merton model requires the input of assumptions in implementing SFAS 123(R), including expected stock price volatility, expected term and estimated forfeitures of each award. The parameters used in the model are reviewed and adjusted on a quarterly basis. We recognized compensation expense for the fair values of these awards, which have graded vesting, on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of each of these awards, net of estimated forfeitures at a rate of 7.59%. We make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the APIC credit pool generated by previous share based compensation excess tax benefits to determine if there are any tax deficiencies which require recognition in the consolidated statements of income. The fair value of restricted stock units was calculated based upon the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Business Combinations. In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, or SFAS 141, Business Combinations, we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and in process research and development based on their estimated fair values. Management makes significant estimates and assumptions, which are believed to be reasonable, in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to intangible assets. These estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from product sales, customer relationships, acquired developed technologies and patents, expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed, 39 Table of Contents expected life of the core technology and discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. Results of Operations Product Revenues.

Our unit sales increased 75% compared to fiscal year 2006 with the strongest unit growth coming from cards for mobile phones. OEM revenue particularly benefited from higher sales of mobile cards and embedded products to mobile handset vendors. Retail revenue growth benefited from the growing market for cards for mobile phones as well as increased sales of USB flash drives. The increase in our fiscal year 2006 product revenues was comprised of a 246% increase in the number of megabytes sold, partially offset by a 59% reduction in our average selling price per megabyte. The markets that we sell to have experienced price elasticity of demand. In fiscal year 2006, as the price per megabyte decreased, the average memory density of our products sold increased by 67%. Our unit sales also increased by 106% with the growth in our unit sales primarily attributable to growth in sales of cards for mobile phones and flash based digital audio players. OEM revenues particularly benefited from higher sales of mobile cards to mobile phone manufacturers, 3D gaming cards and from our acquisition of msystems Ltd., or msystems, which accounted for an additional $115 million of revenue. Retail revenue growth benefited primarily from higher sales of mobile cards, flash based digital audio players and USB flash drives. Geographical Product Revenues.

Japan revenue increased from fiscal year 2006 to fiscal year 2007 primarily as a result of product revenue from our msystems acquisition in November 2006. Unit sales in United States increased 41% over fiscal year 2006; however total revenues in United States were lower by 2% due primarily to aggressive price reductions in fiscal year 2007. In fiscal year 2006, on an absolute basis, revenues in all regions increased year over year. Revenue from other foreign countries, which is primarily Asia, increased the most, primarily reflecting increased sales to mobile phone manufacturers and their related contract manufacturers. Sales in Japan increased primarily from higher sales of 3D gaming cards from our acquisition of Matrix Semiconductor, Inc., or Matrix. The increase in sales in United States was due primarily to sales of our flash based digital audio players, sales of cards for mobile phones and USB drives. 40 Table of Contents License and Royalty Revenues.

The increase in our fiscal year 2006 license and royalty revenues was primarily due to increased royalty bearing sales by our licensees. Gross Margins. Percent Percent FY 2007 Change FY 2006 Change FY 2005 (In millions, except percentages) Product gross profit $ 752.5 (17 )% $ 908.4 24 % $ 733.3 Product gross margins (as a percent of product revenue) 21.8 % 31.0 % 35.5 % Total gross margins (as a percent of total revenue) 30.9 % 38.0 % 42.2 % Product gross margins in fiscal year 2007 decreased 9.2 percentage points compared to fiscal year 2006 due to excess industry supply which led to price per megabyte declining faster than cost per megabyte and also led to lower of cost or market inventory charges. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by charges for excess inventory of certain products and Flash Alliance venture costs, partially offset by insurance proceeds related to claims on a fab power outage that occurred in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006. In addition, cost of product increased due to amortization of acquisition related intangible assets of $65 million, which accounted for approximately 1.4 percentage points. The fiscal year 2006 product gross margin decreased from fiscal year 2005 by 4.5 percentage points. Approximately 2.9 percentage points of the gross margin decline was due to average selling prices declining at a faster rate than our product cost. In addition, our margins were negatively impacted by approximately 0.8% due to the acquisition of msystems, whose business in the fourth quarter was primarily based on non captive memory supply. In addition, cost of product increased due to amortization of acquisition related intangible assets of $28 million and share based compensation expense related to implementation of SFAS 123(R) of $8 million, which combined accounted for approximately 0.8% of the decrease in the product gross margins over fiscal year 2005. Research and Development.

In addition, in fiscal year 2007, we recognized Flash Alliance start up costs of $18 million. Our fiscal year 2006 research and development expense growth was primarily due to an increase in payroll, payroll related expenses and facility related expenses of approximately $57 million associated with headcount growth. Share based compensation expense related to implementation of SFAS 123(R) accounted for $41 million of the research and development expense growth. In addition, research and development expense growth included initial design and development of 56 nanometer technology. 41 Table of Contents Sales and Marketing.

The value was determined by estimating the net cash flows and discounting forecasted net cash flows to their present values. As of December 30, 2007, it was estimated that the remaining in process projects related to the msystems acquisition would be completed over the next three years at an estimated total cost of $14 million. For further discussion on write off of acquired in process technology, please refer to Note 14, Business Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. 42 Table of Contents Amortization of Acquisition Related Intangible Assets.

A restructuring charge of $7 million was recorded, of which $6 million related to severance and benefits to 149 terminated employees and the remaining was primarily for excess lease obligations. This restructuring resulted in a reduction to our annual expenses of approximately $22 million in operations, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expense. We do not expect additional charges relating to this restructuring plan. For further discussion on our restructuring plans, please refer to Note 9, Restructuring, to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. Other Income.

Other income for fiscal year 2006 was comprised primarily of interest income of $101 million offset by interest expense of ($11) million resulting from our $1.15 billion debt offering in May 2006. See Note 5, Financing Arrangements, to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. 43 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes.

This decrease was partially offset by foreign losses not benefited and non deductible share based compensation expenses. We adopted FIN 48 at the beginning of fiscal year 2007. As a result of the adoption, we recognized approximately a $1 million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as a reduction to retained earnings as of January 1, 2007. See Note 10, Income Taxes, to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion on the impact of FIN 48. Our fiscal year 2006 effective tax rate increased over fiscal year 2005 primarily due to the write off of acquired in process technology and non deductible share based compensation expenses, which was partially offset by foreign earnings at other than U.S. rates. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows. Operating activities generated $652.9 million of cash during the fiscal year ended December 30, 2007. The primary sources of operating cash flow for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2007 were: (1) net income, adjusted to exclude the effect of non cash charges including depreciation, amortization, share based compensation, loss on equity investments and deferred taxes, and (2) changes in balance sheet accounts including a decrease in accounts receivable and increases in accounts payable trade and accounts payable to related parties, which were partially offset by increases in inventory and other assets and a decrease in other liabilities. Operating activities generated $598.1 million of cash during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. The primary sources of operating cash flow for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 were: (1) net income, adjusted to exclude the effect of non cash charges including depreciation, amortization, share based compensation and write off of acquired in process technology, which were partially offset by lower deferred taxes and gain on investment in foundries, and (2) increases in accounts payable to related parties and other liabilities, which were partially offset by increases in accounts receivables, inventory and other assets and decreases in accounts payable trade. We used $1.22 billion for investing activities during the fiscal year ended December 30, 2007. Purchases of short and long term investments, net of proceeds from sales and maturities of short term investments, totaled $318.3 million. Capital expenditures for the year were $259.0 million and investments and notes to the flash ventures with Toshiba were $613.3 million, net of repayments. We used $978.1 million for investing activities during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. Purchases of short and long term investments, net of proceeds from sales and maturities of short term investments, totaled $638.9 million. Capital expenditures totaling $176.5 million and investments and notes to the flash ventures with Toshiba of $204.1 million, net of repayments was partially offset by cash acquired of $51.8 million as a result of our acquisition of Matrix and msystems. We used $181.0 million of cash for financing activities during the fiscal year ended December 30, 2007 comprised primarily of $299.6 million to purchase treasury shares pursuant to our share repurchase program, partially offset by cash received from exercises of share based awards of $100.3 million. Additionally, during the fiscal year ended December 30, 2007, we received a tax benefit of $18.4 million on employee stock programs. In fiscal year 2006, we generated $1.20 billion of cash from financing activities including $1.13 billion from the issuance of the 1% Convertible Senior Notes, net of issuance costs, partially offset by the purchase of the convertible bond hedge of $386.1 million. We received $308.7 million from the issuance of warrants and 44 Table of Contents $96.3 million from exercises of share based awards. Additionally, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, we received a tax benefit of $57.4 million on employee stock programs. Liquid Assets. At December 30, 2007, we had cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $1.84 billion. Short Term Liquidity. As of December 30, 2007, our working capital balance was $2.39 billion. We do not expect any liquidity constraints over the next twelve months. We expect our loans and investments in the flash ventures with Toshiba as well as our investments in property, plant and equipment to be approximately $1.0 billion in fiscal year 2008. Long Term Requirements. Depending on the demand for our products, we may decide to make additional investments, which could be substantial, in wafer fabrication foundry capacity and assembly and test manufacturing equipment to support our business in the future. We may also make equity investments in other companies or engage in merger or acquisition transactions. These activities may require us to raise additional financing, which could be difficult to obtain, and which if not obtained in satisfactory amounts may prevent us from funding the flash ventures with Toshiba; increasing our wafer supply; developing or enhancing our products; taking advantage of future opportunities; engaging in investments in or acquisitions of companies; growing our business or responding to competitive pressures or unanticipated industry changes; any of which could harm our business. Financing Arrangements. In May 2006, we issued and sold $1.15 billion in aggregate principal amount of 1% Notes due 2013. The 1% Notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 1% per annum. The 1% Notes may be converted into our common stock, under certain circumstances, based on an initial conversion rate of 12.1426 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $82.36 per share). The conversion price will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest. The net proceeds to us from the offering of the 1% Notes were $1.13 billion. Concurrently with the issuance of the 1% Notes, we purchased a convertible bond hedge and sold warrants. The separate convertible bond hedge and warrant transactions are structured to reduce the potential future economic dilution associated with the conversion of the 1% Notes and to increase the initial conversion price to $95.03 per share. In November 2006, we assumed through our acquisition of msystems, their $75 million in aggregate principal amount of 1% Convertible Senior Notes due 2035, or the 1% Notes due 2035. The 1% Notes due 2035 pay interest at a rate of 1% per annum. The 1% Notes due 2035 may be converted into our common stock, under certain circumstances, based on an initial conversion rate of 26.8302 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $37.27 per share). The conversion price will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest. See Note 5, Financing Arrangements, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report. Toshiba Ventures. We are a 49.9% percent owner in FlashVision, Flash Partners and Flash Alliance, or collectively referred to as Flash Ventures, our business ventures with Toshiba to develop and manufacture NAND flash memory products. These NAND flash memory products are manufactured by Toshiba at Toshibas Yokkaichi, Japan operations using the semiconductor manufacturing equipment owned or leased by Flash Ventures. This equipment is funded or will be funded by investments in or loans to the ventures from us and Toshiba. Flash Ventures purchase wafers from Toshiba at cost and then resells those wafers to us and Toshiba at cost plus a markup. We are contractually obligated to purchase half of Flash Ventures NAND wafer supply. We are not able to estimate our total wafer purchase obligations beyond our rolling three month purchase commitment because the price is determined by reference to the future cost to produce the semiconductor wafers. In addition to the semiconductor assets owned or leased by Flash Ventures, we directly own certain semiconductor manufacturing equipment in Toshibas Yokkaichi, Japan operations from which we receive 100% of the output. See Note 13, Related Parties and Strategic Investments, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report. From time to time, we and Toshiba mutually approve increases in the wafer supply capacity of Flash Ventures that may contractually obligate us to increase capital funding. As of December 30, 2007, Flash Partners Fab 3 had reached full capacity of approximately 150,000 wafers per month; however, we expect to continue to invest in Flash Partners in order to convert to the next technology node. The capacity of Flash Alliances Fab 4 at full expansion is expected to be approximately 210,000 wafers per month, and the timeframe to reach full capacity is to be mutually 45 Table of Contents agreed upon by both parties. In fiscal year 2008, we expect to invest approximately $2 billion in Flash Ventures, which we expect will be funded through additional investments, loans, lease guarantees and working capital contributions to Flash Ventures. On February 19, 2008, we signed a non binding memorandum of understanding with Toshiba for a new memory wafer fab in Japan. No specific investment amount has been determined by the parties. However, we expect in fiscal year 2009 and beyond to be required to make investments, loans and guarantees related to our portion of the equipment and start up costs, should a definitive agreement be signed. See Note 12, Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report. The cost of the wafers we purchase from Flash Ventures is recorded in inventory and ultimately cost of sales. Flash Ventures are variable interest entities, and we are not the primary beneficiary of these ventures because we are entitled to less than a majority of expected gains and losses with respect to each venture. Accordingly, we account for our investments under the equity method and do not consolidate. Under Flash Ventures agreements, we agreed to share in Toshibas costs associated with NAND product development and its common semiconductor research and development activities. As of December 30, 2007, we had accrued liabilities related to those expenses of $8.0 million. Our common research and development obligation related to Flash Ventures is variable but capped at fixed quarterly amounts through fiscal year 2008. In addition to general NAND product development and common semiconductor research performed by Toshiba, both parties perform direct research and development activities specific to Flash Ventures, and our contribution is based on a variable computation. We and Toshiba each pay the cost of our own design teams and 50% of the wafer processing and similar costs associated with this direct design and development of flash memory. For semiconductor fixed assets that are leased by Flash Ventures, we and or Toshiba guaranteed, in whole or in part, a portion of the outstanding lease payments under each of those leases through various methods. These obligations are denominated in Japanese yen and are noncancelable. Under the terms of the FlashVision lease, Toshiba guaranteed these commitments on behalf of FlashVision and we agreed to indemnify Toshiba for certain liabilities Toshiba incurs as a result of its guarantee of the FlashVision equipment lease arrangement. As of December 30, 2007, the maximum amount of our contingent indemnification obligation, which reflects payments and any lease adjustments, was approximately 3.6 billion Japanese yen, or approximately $32 million based upon the exchange rate at December 30, 2007. Under the terms of Flash Partners and Flash Alliance leases, we guaranteed on an unsecured and several basis 50% of Flash Partners and Flash Alliances lease obligations under master lease agreements entered into from December 2004 through November 2007. Our total lease obligation guarantee, net of lease payments as of December 30, 2007, was 125.0 billion Japanese yen, or approximately $1.11 billion based upon the exchange rate at December 30, 2007. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Our contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements at December 30, 2007, and the effect those contractual obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow over the next five years is presented in textual and tabular format in Note 12, Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees, to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. Impact of Currency Exchange Rates Exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have not used financial instruments to hedge our economic exposures related to costs or revenue denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our most significant foreign currency exposure is to the Japanese yen in which we purchase the vast majority of our NAND flash wafers. In addition, we also have significant expenses denominated in the Chinese renminbi, or RMB, and the Israeli New Israel shekel, or ILS. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. In fiscal years 2007 and 2006, we used foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate transaction gains and losses generated by certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our derivative instruments are recorded at fair value with changes recorded in other income (expense) or accumulated other income. See Note 12, Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. 46 Table of Contents For a discussion of foreign operating risks and foreign currency risks, see Item 1A, Risk Factors. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. This is accomplished by investing in widely diversified marketable securities, consisting primarily of investment grade securities. As of December 30, 2007, a hypothetical 50 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $12.7 million decline (less than 0.49%) in the fair value of our available for sale debt securities. Foreign Currency Risk. A substantial majority of our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activity is transacted in U.S. dollars. However, we do enter into transactions in other currencies, primarily the Japanese yen. Movements in currency exchange rates, especially the Japanese yen, could cause variability in our revenues, expenses, or other income (expense), net. We had net forward exchange contracts in place to sell the U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $538 million in foreign currencies based upon the exchange rate at December 30, 2007 and approximately $72 million as of December 31, 2006. The effect of an immediate 10% adverse change in exchange rates on forward exchange contracts would result in an approximate $64 million loss. However, as we utilize foreign currency instruments for mitigating anticipated balance sheet exposures, a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the functional currency value of the underlying non functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. See Item 1A, Risk Factors and Note 12, Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees, to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. Market Risk. We also hold available for sale equity securities in semiconductor wafer manufacturing companies. As of December 30, 2007, a reduction in prices of 10% of these marketable equity securities would result in a decrease in the fair value of our investments in marketable equity securities of approximately $2 million. All of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial position at December 30, 2007. Actual results may differ materially.
