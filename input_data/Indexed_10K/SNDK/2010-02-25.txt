Our mission is to provide simple, reliable and affordable storage for consumer use in portable devices. We sell our products globally through broad retail and OEM distribution channels. We design, develop and manufacture data storage products and solutions in a variety of form factors using our flash memory, proprietary controller and firmware technologies. We purchase the vast majority of our NAND flash memory supply requirements through our significant flash venture relationships with Toshiba which provide us with leading edge, low cost memory wafers. Our removable card products are used in a wide range of consumer electronics devices such as mobile phones, digital cameras, gaming devices and laptop computers. Our embedded flash products are used in mobile phones, navigation devices, gaming systems, imaging devices and computing platforms. For computing platforms, we provide high speed, high capacity storage solutions known as SSDs that can be used in lieu of hard disk drives in a variety of computing devices. 37 Table of Contents Our results are primarily driven by worldwide demand for flash storage devices, which in turn depends on end user demand for electronic products. We believe the market for flash storage is generally price elastic. Accordingly, we expect that as we reduce the price of our flash devices, consumers will demand an increasing number of gigabytes and or units of memory and that over time, new markets will emerge. In order to profitably capitalize on price elasticity of demand in the market for flash storage products, we must reduce our cost per gigabyte at a rate similar to the change in selling price per gigabyte, and the average capacity and or the number of units of our products must grow enough to offset price declines. We seek to achieve these cost reductions through technology improvements, primarily by increasing the amount of memory stored in a given area of silicon. Effective December 29, 2008, we implemented a change in accounting and have separately accounted for the liability and equity components of our 1% Senior Convertible Note due 2013 that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement) in a manner that reflects our economic interest cost. Accordingly, we bifurcated the debt into debt and equity components and are amortizing the debt discount (the economic interest cost) in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We have retrospectively applied the change in accounting to all periods presented, and have recast the Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal years 2008 and 2007 presented in this report. Effective December 29, 2008, we implemented a change in accounting and have reclassified for all periods presented non controlling interests, formerly called a minority interest, to a component of equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the net income (loss) attributable to non controlling interests has been separately identified in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and the Consolidated Statements of Equity. The Company has also reclassified certain distributions to non controlling interests from cash flows from operating activities to cash flows from investing activities for fiscal years ended December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009, we identified that our third party equity software contained a feature that resulted in incorrect share based compensation expense. This software feature affected our share based compensation expense reported for the nine months ended September 27, 2009 and the three fiscal years ended December 28, 2008. We determined that the impact of the underreported share based compensation expense was not material to any of the previously issued annual or interim financial statements. Accordingly, the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2009 include a cumulative non cash adjustment of $16.2 million to increase share based compensation, allocated to multiple expense categories. Fiscal year 2009 included 53 weeks as compared to 52 weeks in fiscal years 2008 and 2007. Critical Accounting Policies & Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. Use of Estimates. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including, among others, those related to customer programs and incentives, product returns, bad debts, inventories and related reserves, investments, long lived assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, restructuring, contingencies, share based compensation, and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities when those values are not readily apparent from other sources. Estimates have historically approximated actual results. However, future results will differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. 38 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition, Sales Returns and Allowances and Sales Incentive Programs. We recognize revenues when the earnings process is complete, as evidenced by an agreement with the customer, there is transfer of title and acceptance, if applicable, fixed pricing and reasonable assurance of realization. Revenue is generally recognized at the time of shipment for customers not eligible for price protection and or a right of return. Sales made to distributors and retailers are generally under agreements allowing price protection and or right of return and, therefore, the sales and related costs of these transactions are deferred until the retailers or distributors sell the merchandise to their end customer, or the rights of return expire. At January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, deferred income from sales to distributors and retailers was $177.7 million and $75.7 million, respectively. Estimated sales returns are provided for as a reduction to product revenues and deferred revenues and were not material for any period presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We record estimated reductions to revenues or to deferred revenues for customer and distributor incentive programs and offerings, including price protection, promotions, co op advertising, and other volume based incentives and expected returns. Additionally, we have incentive programs that require us to estimate, based on historical experience, the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. All sales incentive programs are recorded as an offset to product revenues or deferred revenues. In calculating the value of sales incentive programs, actual and estimated activity is used based upon reported weekly sell through data from our customers. The timing and resolution of these claims could materially impact product revenues or deferred revenues. In addition, actual returns and rebates in any future period could differ from our estimates, which could impact the revenue we report. Inventories and Inventory Valuation. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out) or market. Market value is based upon an estimated average selling price reduced by estimated costs of disposal. The determination of market value involves numerous judgments including estimating average selling prices based upon recent sales, industry trends, existing customer orders, current contract prices, industry analysis of supply and demand and seasonal factors. Should actual market conditions differ from our estimates, our future results of operations could be materially affected. The valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory. The determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products within specific time horizons, generally six to twelve months. To the extent our demand forecast for specific products is less than both our product on hand and on noncancelable orders, we could be required to record additional inventory reserves, which would have a negative impact on our gross margin. Deferred Tax Assets. We must make certain estimates in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. We have recorded a valuation allowance against a significant portion of our U.S. and certain foreign net deferred tax assets as there was substantial uncertainty as to the realizability of the deferred tax assets in future periods. In determining the need for and amount of our valuation allowance, we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets using historical levels of income, estimates of future income and tax planning strategies. Our estimates of future income include our internal projections and various internal estimates and certain external sources which we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Our estimates for tax uncertainties require substantial judgment based upon the period of occurrence, complexity of the matter, available federal tax case law, interpretation of foreign laws and regulations and other estimates. There is no assurance that domestic or international tax authorities will agree with the tax positions we have taken which could materially impact future results. 39 Table of Contents Valuation of Long Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Equity Method Investments. We perform tests for impairment of long lived and intangible assets and equity method investments whenever events or circumstances suggest that other long lived assets may not be recoverable. An impairment of long lived and intangible assets are only deemed to have occurred if the sum of the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows related to the assets are less than the carrying value of the asset we are testing for impairment. If the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying value, then we must write down the carrying value to its estimated fair value based primarily upon forecasted discounted cash flows. An impairment of an equity method investment is deemed to occur if the fair value, based upon quoted market prices if available or forecasted discounted cash flows, is less than the carrying value. Substantially all of our equity method investments are not actively traded and we rely on discounted cash flows to estimate fair value. These forecasted discounted cash flows include estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates and operating margins, risk adjusted discount rates based on our weighted average cost of capital, future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. Our estimates of market segment growth and our market segment share and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates and certain external sources, and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business. Our business consists of both established and emerging technologies and our forecasts for emerging technologies are based upon internal estimates and external sources rather than historical information. If future forecasts are revised, they may indicate or require future impairment charges. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. Fair Value of Investments in Debt Instruments. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value (see Note 3, Investments and Fair Value Measurements in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report). Each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value. Level 1 securities represent quoted prices in active markets, and therefore do not require significant management judgment. Our Level 2 securities are primarily valued using quoted market prices for similar instruments and nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. We use inputs such as actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, and other similar data, which are obtained from independent pricing vendors, quoted market prices, or other sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and liabilities. The inputs and fair value are reviewed for reasonableness, may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information, compared to multiple independent valuation sources and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information. In the current market environment, the assessment of fair value can be difficult and subjective. However, given the relative reliability of the inputs we use to value our investment portfolio, and because substantially all of our valuation inputs are obtained using quoted market prices for similar or identical assets, we do not believe that the nature of estimates and assumptions was material to the valuation of our cash equivalents, short and long term marketable securities. We currently do not have any investments that use Level 3 inputs. 40 Table of Contents Results of Operations Product Revenues. FY 2009 Percent Change FY 2008 Percent Change FY 2007 (In millions, except percentages) Retail $ 1,567.5 (14 )% $ 1,812.9 (16 )% $ 2,162.5 OEM 1,586.8 54 % 1,030.3 (20 )% 1,283.6 Product revenues $ 3,154.3 11 % $ 2,843.2 (17 )% $ 3,446.1 The increase in our fiscal year 2009 product revenues compared to fiscal year 2008 reflected a 116% increase in the number of gigabytes sold, partially offset by a 48% reduction in average selling price per gigabyte. The increase in number of gigabytes sold was the result of an increase in average capacity of 71% and an increase in memory units sold of 26%. The decline in retail product revenues in fiscal year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008 was primarily attributable to a weak worldwide consumer spending environment through all of 2009. The increase in OEM product revenues in fiscal year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008 was due to increased sales of cards and embedded products primarily in the mobile phone markets and increased sales to new OEM channels, including the sale of private label cards, wafers and components. The decrease in our fiscal year 2008 product revenues compared to fiscal year 2007 reflected a 62% reduction in average selling price per gigabyte, partially offset by a 125% increase in the number of gigabytes sold, which reflected 15% growth in memory product units sold and 96% growth in average capacity. The decline in retail product revenues in fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007 was due to aggressive price declines partially offset by a 116% increase in gigabytes sold. The decline in OEM product revenues in fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007 was due to aggressive price declines, partially offset by a 135% increase in gigabytes sold, and the discontinuation of TwinSys Data Storage Limited Partnership, or TwinSys, operations on March 31, 2007, which contributed $53 million of product revenues in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 prior to ceasing operations. Unit growth of 15% in fiscal year 2008 was below the 75% unit growth in fiscal year 2007 due primarily to deteriorating worldwide economic conditions. Geographical Product Revenues. FY 2009 FY 2008 FY 2007 Revenue Percent of Total Revenue Percent of Total Revenue Percent of Total (In millions, except percentages) United States $ 916.3 29 % $ 1,006.7 35 % $ 1,193.6 35 % Asia Pacific 1,447.7 46 % 1,013.1 36 % 1,228.5 36 % Europe, Middle East and Africa 707.7 22 % 752.6 26 % 889.7 26 % Other foreign countries 82.6 3 % 70.8 3 % 134.3 3 % Product revenues $ 3,154.3 100 % $ 2,843.2 100 % $ 3,446.1 100 % Product revenues in Asia Pacific, which now includes Japan, increased on a year over year basis due to growth in our OEM channel sales for the mobile phone market and growth in the sale of private label cards, wafers and components. Product revenues in fiscal year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008 decreased in the United States and Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, primarily due to a weak consumer spending environment. Product revenues in fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007 decreased in all geographical regions due to aggressive industry price declines partially offset by unit sales growth in all regions. The decline in Asia Pacific revenue also included the discontinuation of TwinSys operations on March 31, 2007, which contributed $53 million of product revenues in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 prior to ceasing operations. 41 Table of Contents License and Royalty Revenues. FY 2009 Percent Change FY 2008 Percent Change FY 2007 (In millions, except percentages) License and royalty revenues $ 412.5 (19 )% $ 508.1 13 % $ 450.2 The decrease in our fiscal year 2009 license and royalty revenues was due to lower flash memory revenues reported by our licensees and a new license agreement with an existing licensee at a lower effective royalty rate as compared to the previous license agreement. These declines were partially offset by fiscal year 2009 including a full year of royalty revenue for new licensees added in fiscal year 2008. The increase in our fiscal year 2008 license and royalty revenues was primarily due to the addition of new licensees. Gross Margins. FY 2009 Percent Change FY 2008 Percent Change FY 2007 (In millions, except percentages) Product gross profit (loss) $ 872.1 296 % $ (445.0 ) (159 )% $ 752.5 Product gross margins (as a percent of product revenue) 27.6 % (15.7 )% 21.8 % Total gross margins (as a percent of total revenue) 36.0 % 1.9 % 30.9 % Product gross margins in fiscal year 2009 increased 43.3 percentage points compared to fiscal year 2008 due to manufacturing costs declining faster than prices and a net benefit of $364 million, primarily from the sale of inventory which had been previously partially reserved in fiscal year 2008 to reflect the market value of certain inventory which was determined to be below cost. The increase in product gross margin in fiscal year 2009 as compared with fiscal year 2008 was also due to charges in 2008 for the impairment of our investments in Flash Ventures of $83 million and for adverse purchase commitments of $121 million associated with under utilization of Flash Ventures capacity. The rate of decline in average selling price per gigabyte slowed in fiscal year 2009 due to an improved balance between supply and demand, impacted in part by our actions in early fiscal year 2009 to sell a portion of our manufacturing capacity in Flash Ventures to Toshiba, and hold the remaining wafer output capacity constant. The rate of cost decline of our memory products was similar in fiscal years 2009 and 2008. Product gross margins in fiscal year 2008 decreased 37.5 percentage points compared to fiscal year 2007 primarily due to aggressive industry price declines resulting in the sale of products at negative gross margins and related charges. The related charges in fiscal year 2008 included: Inventory reserves primarily to reduce the carrying value to the lower of cost or market for both inventory on hand and in the channel of $394 million. Charges of $121 million for adverse purchase commitments associated with under utilization of Flash Ventures capacity for the 90 day period in which we have non cancellable orders. Impairment in our investments in Flash Partners and Flash Alliance of $83 million. 42 Table of Contents Research and Development. FY 2009 Percent Change FY 2008 Percent Change FY 2007 (In millions, except percentages) Research and development $ 384.2 (11 )% $ 429.9 3 % $ 418.1 Percent of revenue 10.8 % 12.8 % 10.7 % Our fiscal year 2009 research and development expense was reduced from the comparable period in fiscal year 2008 primarily due to lower usage of third party engineering services of ($36.6) million and lower employee related costs of ($3.4) million due to decreased headcount and lower share based compensation expense. Our fiscal year 2008 research and development expense growth was primarily due to an increase in payroll, payroll related expenses and headcount related expenses of approximately $21 million, an increase in consulting and material and equipment costs of $6 million, partially offset by lower share based compensation expense of ($10) million and lower Flash Venture related costs of ($7) million. The growth in fiscal year 2008 research and development expense reflects parallel investment in NAND X2, X3 and X4 storage technologies, and 3D Read/Write memory architecture technology. Sales and Marketing. FY 2009 Percent Change FY 2008 Percent Change FY 2007 (In millions, except percentages) Sales and marketing $ 208.5 (36 )% $ 328.1 11 % $ 294.6 Percent of revenue 5.8 % 9.8 % 7.6 % Our fiscal year 2009 sales and marketing expense was reduced from the comparable period in fiscal year 2008 primarily due to decreased branding and merchandising costs of ($99) million and lower outside service costs of ($19) million. Our fiscal year 2008 sales and marketing expense growth over the comparable period in fiscal year 2007 was primarily due to increased branding and merchandising costs of $34 million and increased employee related costs of $13 million, partially offset by lower share based compensation expense of ($12) million. The growth in branding and merchandising and employee related costs primarily reflected expansion of our international sales channels. General and Administrative. FY 2009 Percent Change FY 2008 Percent Change FY 2007 (In millions, except percentages) General and administrative $ 171.4 (16 )% $ 204.8 13 % $ 181.5 Percent of revenue 4.8 % 6.1 % 4.7 % Our fiscal year 2009 general and administrative expense was reduced over the comparable period in fiscal year 2008 primarily due to lower intellectual property legal costs of ($29) million and lower bad debt expense of ($9) million, partially offset by an increase in employee related costs of $5 million. Our fiscal year 2008 general and administrative expense growth over the comparable period in fiscal year 2007 was primarily related to increased legal and outside advisor costs of $30 million and bad debt expense of $5 million, partially offset by lower share based compensation costs of ($9) million and payroll and employee related costs of ($3) million. Our legal and outside advisor costs increased in fiscal year 2008 as compared to fiscal year 2007 primarily due to increased patent and anti trust litigation expenses as well as expenses incurred in connection with strategic initiatives. 43 Table of Contents Impairment of Goodwill. FY 2009 Percent Change FY 2008 Percent Change FY 2007 (In millions, except percentages) Impairment of goodwill n/a n/a $ 845.5 n/a n/a Percent of revenue n/a 25.2 % n/a In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, we concluded that there were sufficient indicators based on a combination of factors, including the economic environment, current and forecasted operating results, NAND industry pricing conditions and a sustained decline in our market capitalization, to require an interim goodwill impairment analysis. As a result of the interim goodwill impairment analysis, we recognized an impairment charge of $846 million. As of December 28, 2008, we have no goodwill remaining on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Impairment of Acquisition Related Intangible Assets. FY 2009 Percent Change FY 2008 Percent Change FY 2007 (In millions, except percentages) Impairment of acquisition related intangible assets n/a n/a $ 175.8 n/a n/a Percent of revenue n/a 5.3 % n/a In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, we recorded a $176 million impairment on acquisition related intangible assets. This impairment was based upon forecasted discounted cash flows which considered factors including a reduced business outlook primarily due to NAND industry pricing conditions. There were no such impairments or impairment indicators in fiscal years 2009 and 2007. Amortization of Acquisition Related Intangible Assets. FY 2009 Percent Change FY 2008 Percent Change FY 2007 (In millions, except percentages) Amortization of acquisition related intangible assets $ 1.2 (93 )% $ 17.1 (32 )% $ 25.3 Percent of revenue 0.0 % 0.5 % 0.6 % Amortization of acquisition related intangible assets in fiscal year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008 was lower due to the impairment of certain Matrix and msystems acquisition related intangible assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008. Amortization of acquisition related intangible assets in fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007 was lower due to intangible assets that were fully amortized in fiscal year 2007. Our expense from the amortization of acquisition related intangible assets was primarily related to our acquisitions of Matrix in January 2006 and msystems in November 2006. Restructuring Charges and Other. FY 2009 Percent Change FY 2008 Percent Change FY 2007 (In millions, except percentages) Restructuring and other $ (100 )% $ 35.5 430 % $ 6.7 Percent of revenue 0.0 % 1.1 % 0.2 % During fiscal years 2008 and 2007, we implemented several restructuring plans which included reductions of our workforce and consolidation of operations. We recorded negligible restructuring charges and other in fiscal year 2009 compared to $36 million and $7 million in fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively. The goal of these restructuring and other charges was to bring our operational expenses to more appropriate levels relative to our net revenues, while simultaneously implementing extensive company wide expense control programs. All expenses, including adjustments, associated with our restructuring plans are included in Restructuring and Other in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For further discussion of our restructuring plans, refer to Note 10, Restructuring Plans, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K included in Item 8 of this report. 44 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), net. FY 2009 Percent Change FY 2008 Percent Change FY 2007 (In millions, except percentages) Interest income $ 63.3 (33 )% $ 94.4 (29 )% $ 133.4 Interest expense (68.6 ) 4 % (65.8 ) 5 % (62.7 ) Loss on equity investments (1.6 ) (96 )% (39.6 ) 300 % (9.9 ) Other income (expense), net (8.7 ) (127 )% 32.1 110 % 15.3 Total other income (expense), net $ (15.6 ) (174 )% $ 21.1 (72 )% $ 76.1 Our fiscal year 2009 Total other income (expense), net decreased compared to fiscal year 2008 primarily due to lower foreign currency gains and transaction costs incurred in fiscal year 2009 related to the sale of equipment and transfer of lease obligations resulting from the restructuring of Flash Ventures, reflected in Other income (expense), net. In addition, interest income in fiscal year 2009 declined by ($31) million compared to fiscal year 2008, reflecting lower interest rates and lower average cash balances during the year. Our fiscal year 2008 Total other income (expense), net decrease compared to fiscal year 2007 was primarily due to lower interest income in fiscal year 2008 reflecting reduced interest rates and lower cash and investment balances, impairment of our equity investment in Tower of ($19) million, and an impairment of our investment in FlashVision of ($10) million. Provision for Income Taxes. FY 2009 Percent Change FY 2008 Percent Change FY 2007 (in millions, except percentages) Provision for income taxes $ 88.5 158 % $ 34.3 (78 )% $ 156.8 Effective income tax rates 17.6 % (1.8 )% 44.5 % Our fiscal year 2009 effective tax rate was primarily related to withholding taxes on license and royalty income from certain foreign licensees and income tax provisions recorded by foreign subsidiaries while income taxes for federal and state were substantially offset by the reduction of valuation allowance related to the utilization of tax credits. Our fiscal year 2008 provision for income taxes was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the non deductibility of the goodwill impairment charge and a valuation allowance recorded on certain U.S. and foreign gross deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance significantly increased due primarily to the size of the fiscal year 2008 net loss and that it is not more likely than not that certain U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets will be realized in the future. Fiscal year 2007 provision for income taxes was higher than the statutory rate primarily due to non deductible share based compensation expenses and certain foreign losses partially offset by foreign earnings taxed at other than U.S. rates and tax exempt interest. Our reserve for unrecognized tax benefits increased by $60 million and $69 million in fiscal years 2009 and 2008, respectively. In October 2009, the Internal Revenue Service commenced an examination of our federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2005 through 2008. We do not expect a resolution to be reached during the next twelve months. In addition, we are currently under audit by various state and international tax authorities. We cannot reasonably estimate that the outcome of these examinations will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 45 Table of Contents Non GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss). Twelve months ended January 3, 2010 December 28, 2008 December 30, 2007 (In thousands except per share amounts) Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders $ 415,310 $ (1,986,624 ) $ 190,616 Share based compensation 95,560 97,799 133,010 Impairment of goodwill and acquisition related intangible assets 1,021,238 Amortization of acquisition related intangible assets 13,696 71,581 90,117 Inventory step up expense related to msystems acquisition 7,066 Convertible debt interest 54,454 49,340 45,758 Income tax adjustments (151,813 ) 280,692 (58,458 ) Non GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders $ 427,207 $ (465,974 ) $ 408,109 Diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders per share: $ 1.79 $ (8.82 ) $ 0.81 Share based compensation 0.41 0.43 0.56 Impairment of goodwill and acquisition related intangible assets 4.53 Amortization of acquisition related intangible assets 0.06 0.32 0.38 Inventory step up expense related to msystems acquisition 0.03 Convertible debt interest 0.23 0.22 0.19 Income tax adjustments (0.65 ) 1.25 (0.24 ) Non GAAP diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders per share: $ 1.84 $ (2.07 ) $ 1.73 Shares used in computing diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders per share: GAAP 231,959 225,292 235,857 Non GAAP 232,300 225,292 236,614 Management believes that providing this additional information is useful to the investor to better assess and understand operating performance, especially when comparing results with previous periods or forecasting performance for future periods, primarily because management typically monitors the business excluding these items. Management also uses these non GAAP measures to establish operational goals and for measuring performance for compensation purposes. However, analysis of results on a non GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, and not as a replacement for, data presented in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that the presentation of non GAAP measures, including net income (loss) and non GAAP net income (loss) per diluted share, provides important supplemental information to management and investors about financial and business trends relating to the companys results of operations. Management believes that the use of these non GAAP financial measures also provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports. Management has historically used these non GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations. Externally, we believe that these non GAAP measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and their valuation of the company. 46 Table of Contents Internally, these non GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of: evaluating the core operating performance of the company; establishing internal budgets; setting and determining variable compensation levels; calculating return on investment for development programs and growth initiatives; comparing performance with internal forecasts and targeted business models; strategic planning; and benchmarking performance externally against our competitors. We exclude the following items from our non GAAP measures: Share based Compensation Expense. These expenses consist primarily of expenses for employee stock options, employee restricted stock units and the employee stock purchase plan. Although share based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of SanDisks employees and executives, we exclude share based compensation expenses from our non GAAP measures primarily because they are non cash expenses that we do not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. Further, we believe that it is useful to exclude share based compensation expense for investors to better understand the long term performance of our core business and to facilitate comparison of our results to those of peer companies. Impairment of Goodwill and Acquisition related Intangible Assets. This item reflects the write down of goodwill and other intangible assets to their fair values. Because of the infrequent nature of this charge, management does not include this type of item in internal operating forecasts and models. Excluding this data provides investors with a basis to compare our core operating results in different periods without this variability. Amortization of Acquisition related Intangible Assets. We incur amortization of intangible assets in connection with acquisitions. Since we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, we exclude these items in order to provide investors and others with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods. Inventory Step up Expense Related to msystems Acquisition. This is an acquisition related charge. It results from marking to fair value an acquired companys inventory at the time of acquisition. This charge is not factored into managements evaluation of potential acquisitions or our performance after completion of acquisitions, because it is not related to our core operating performance, and the frequency and amount of this type of charge can vary significantly based on the size and timing of our acquisitions. Excluding this data provides investors with a basis to compare the company against the performance of other companies without this variability. Convertible Debt Interest. This is the non cash economic interest expense relating to the implied value of the equity conversion component of the convertible debt. The value of the equity conversion component is treated as a debt discount and amortized to interest expense over the life of the note using the effective interest rate method. We exclude this non cash interest expense as it does not represent the semi annual cash interest payments made to our note holders. Income Tax Adjustments. This amount is used to present each of the amounts described above on an after tax basis, considering jurisdictional tax rates, consistent with the presentation of non GAAP net income. It also represents the amount of tax expense or benefit that we would record, considering jurisdictional tax rates, if we did not have any valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that we may exclude if we believe that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management. 47 Table of Contents Limitations of Relying on Non GAAP Financial Measures. We have incurred and will incur in the future, many of the costs excluded from the non GAAP measures, including share based compensation expense, impairment of goodwill and acquisition related intangible assets, amortization of acquisition related intangible assets and other acquisition related costs, convertible debt interest expense and income tax adjustments. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non GAAP measures may be different than the non GAAP measures used by other companies. 48 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows. Our cash flows were as follows: FY 2009 Percent Change FY 2008 Percent Change FY 2007 (In millions, except percentages) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 487.8 456 % $ 87.7 (87 )% $ 653.0 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (374.8 ) (1379 )% 29.3 102 % (1,218.4 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 20.9 90 % 11.0 106 % (181.1 ) Effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on cash 4.4 1367 % 0.3 160 % (0.5 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 138.3 8 % $ 128.3 117 % $ (747.0 ) Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities is generated by net income (loss) adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. Cash provided by operations was $488 million for fiscal year 2009 as compared to cash provided by operations of $88 million for fiscal year 2008. The increase in cash provided by operations in fiscal year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008 resulted primarily from our net income of $415 million compared with a net loss of ($1.99) billion, which included non cash impairment charges, in the comparable period of the prior year. Cash flow from accounts receivable decreased, as reflected by higher accounts receivable levels in fiscal year 2009 compared with the prior year, due to increased revenue in fiscal year 2009. Cash used for inventory decreased primarily due to higher sales. Cash flow from other assets increased compared with the prior year primarily due to a tax refund received in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 related to carryback claims from the fiscal year 2008 net loss. Accounts payable trade and accounts payable from related parties decreased primarily due to the reduction of gross inventory, operating expenses and the timing of Flash Ventures payments as compared to the prior year, resulting in a decrease in cash provided. Cash flow from other liabilities in fiscal year 2009 decreased as compared to the prior year as a result of settlements in hedge contracts and the elimination of liabilities for Flash Ventures adverse purchase commitments associated with under utilization of Flash Ventures capacity. Cash provided by operations was $88 million for fiscal year 2008 as compared to cash provided by operations of $653 million for fiscal year 2007. The decline in cash provided by operations in fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007 resulted primarily from our net loss of $1.99 billion offset by non cash impairments. Cash flow from accounts receivable in fiscal year 2008 was positively impacted by increased collection efforts and by reduced product accounts receivable levels as compared with the prior year period. The increase in inventory was related primarily to the expansion of capacity and production at Flash Ventures while revenue from our products declined from fiscal year 2007 to fiscal year 2008. The increase in other assets was due to the increase in tax receivables related to tax refunds expected on carryback claims due to the fiscal year 2008 net loss. Within operating activities for fiscal year 2008, there was an increase in cash provided primarily related to an increase in related parties payables due to timing of Flash Ventures payments at fiscal year 2008 year end, an increase in other liabilities related to Flash Ventures capacity under utilization accrual, timing of the cash settlement of outstanding hedge contracts, and lower deferred income on shipments to distributors and retailers related to lower revenue levels. 49 Table of Contents Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2009 was ($375) million as compared to cash provided by investing activities of $29 million in fiscal year 2008. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily related to lower proceeds from sale and maturities of short and long term marketable securities, offset by a reduction in the net loans made to Flash Ventures and a reduced investment in property and equipment. During fiscal year 2009, we loaned $378 million to Flash Ventures for equipment purchases and received $387 million on the collection of outstanding notes receivable from Flash Ventures for the sale of a portion of our production capacity and the return of excess cash from Flash Partners. This resulted in a net loan repayment from Flash Ventures of $9 million in fiscal year 2009 compared to a loan of $384 million to Flash Ventures for equipment purchases in fiscal year 2008. Cash provided by investing activities for fiscal year 2008 was $29 million as compared to cash used in investing activities of ($1.12) billion in fiscal year 2007. The increase in cash provided by investing was primarily related to reduced purchases of short and long term marketable securities due to our higher liquidity requirements and the return of $103 million on our investment in FlashVision and $40 million from the sale of 200 millimeter fab equipment that we owned directly as compared to the return of $38 million from FlashVision in the fiscal year 2007. Usage of cash for investments in and loans to Flash Partners and Flash Alliance was ($384) million in fiscal year 2008 compared to ($651) million in fiscal year 2007. Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year 2009 of $21 million as compared to cash provided by financing activities of $11 million in fiscal year 2008 was primarily due to the repayment of debt financing in fiscal year 2008 of ($10) million. Net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year 2008 of $11 million as compared to cash used in financing activities of ($181) million in fiscal year 2007 was primarily related to lower cash proceeds from employee stock programs and repayment of debt financing in fiscal year 2008 offset by the termination of the share repurchase programs which used cash in fiscal year 2007. Liquid Assets. At January 3, 2010, we had cash, cash equivalents and short term marketable securities of $1.92 billion. We have $1.10 billion of long term marketable securities which we believe are also liquid assets, but are classified as long term marketable securities due to the remaining maturity of the marketable security being greater than one year. Short Term Liquidity. As of January 3, 2010, our working capital balance was $2.04 billion. We expect our loans to Flash Ventures as well as our investments in property, plant and equipment to be approximately $300 million to $400 million in fiscal year 2010. On February 11, 2010, we notified the holders of our 1% Convertible Notes due 2035 that we would exercise our option to redeem the $75 million outstanding on March 15, 2010. The redemption price will be $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount of the debentures, plus accrued interest, for an aggregate cash expenditure of $75 million plus accrued interest of $0.4 million. Our short term liquidity is impacted in part by our ability to maintain compliance with covenants in the outstanding Flash Ventures master lease agreements. The Flash Ventures master lease agreements contain customary covenants for Japanese lease facilities as well as an acceleration clause for certain events of default related to us as guarantor, including, among other things, our failure to maintain a minimum shareholder equity of at least $1.51 billion, and our failure to maintain a minimum corporate rating of BB from S&P, or Moodys Corporation, or a minimum corporate rating of BB+ from R&I. As of January 3, 2010, Flash Ventures was in compliance with all of its master lease covenants. While our S&P credit rating was B, two levels below the required minimum corporate rating threshold from S&P, our R&I credit rating was BBB , one level above the required minimum corporate rating threshold from R&I. 50 Table of Contents If R&I were to downgrade our credit rating below the minimum corporate rating threshold, Flash Ventures would become non compliant with certain covenants under its master equipment lease agreements and would be required to negotiate a resolution to the non compliance to avoid acceleration of the obligations under such agreements. Such resolution could include, among other things, supplementary security to be supplied by us, as guarantor, or increased interest rates or waiver fees, should the lessors decide they need additional collateral or financial consideration under the circumstances. If a resolution was unsuccessful, we could be required to pay a portion or up to the entire $1.07 billion outstanding lease obligations covered by our guarantee under such Flash Ventures master lease agreements, based upon the exchange rate at January 3, 2010, which could negatively impact our short term liquidity. Long Term Requirements. Depending on the demand for our products, we may decide to make additional investments, which could be substantial, in wafer fabrication foundry capacity and assembly and test manufacturing equipment to support our business in the future. We may also make equity investments in other companies or engage in merger or acquisition transactions. These activities may require us to raise additional financing, which could be difficult to obtain, and which if not obtained in satisfactory amounts could prevent us from funding Flash Ventures; increasing our wafer supply; developing or enhancing our products; taking advantage of future opportunities; engaging in investments in or acquisitions of companies; growing our business or responding to competitive pressures or unanticipated industry changes; any of which could harm our business. Financing Arrangements. At January 3, 2010, we had $1.23 billion of aggregate principal amount in convertible notes outstanding, consisting of $1.15 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 1% Senior Convertible Notes due 2013 and $75.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 1% Convertible Notes due 2035. Our 1% Convertible Notes due 2035 may be redeemed in whole or in part by the holders thereof at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest on March 15, 2010 and various dates thereafter. On February 11, 2010, we notified the holders of our 1% Convertible Notes due 2035 that we would exercise our option to redeem the $75 million outstanding on March 15, 2010. The redemption price will be $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount of the debentures, plus accrued interest, for an aggregate cash expenditure of $75 million plus accrued interest of $0.4 million. Concurrent with the issuance of the 1% Senior Convertible Notes due 2013, we sold warrants to acquire shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $95.03 per share. As of January 3, 2010, the warrants had an expected life of approximately 3.6 years and expire in August 2013. At expiration, we may, at our option, elect to settle the warrants on a net share basis. As of January 3, 2010, the warrants had not been exercised and remain outstanding. In addition, counterparties agreed to sell to us up to approximately 14.0 million shares of our common stock, which is the number of shares initially issuable upon conversion of the 1% Senior Convertible Notes due 2013 in full, at a conversion price of $82.36 per share. The convertible bond hedge transaction will be settled in net shares and will terminate upon the earlier of the maturity date of the 1% Senior Convertible Notes due 2013 or the first day that none of the 1% Senior Convertible Notes due 2013 remain outstanding due to conversion or otherwise. Settlement of the convertible bond hedge in net shares on the expiration date would result in us receiving net shares equivalent to the number of shares issuable by us upon conversion of the 1% Senior Convertible Notes due 2013. As of January 3, 2010, we had not purchased any shares under this convertible bond hedge agreement. See Note 7, Financing Arrangements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K included in Item 8 of this report. 51 Table of Contents Flash Partners and Flash Alliance Ventures with Toshiba. We are a 49.9% owner in both Flash Partners and Flash Alliance, or hereinafter collectively referred to as Flash Ventures, our business ventures with Toshiba to develop and manufacture NAND flash memory products. These NAND flash memory products are manufactured by Toshiba at Toshibas Yokkaichi, Japan operations using the semiconductor manufacturing equipment owned or leased by Flash Ventures. This equipment is funded or will be funded by investments in or loans to the Flash Ventures from us and Toshiba as well as through operating leases received by Flash Ventures from third party banks and guaranteed by us and Toshiba. Flash Ventures purchase wafers from Toshiba at cost and then resells those wafers to us and Toshiba at cost plus a markup. We are contractually obligated to purchase half of Flash Ventures NAND wafer supply or to pay for 50% of the fixed costs of Flash Ventures. We are not able to estimate our total wafer purchase obligations beyond our rolling three month purchase commitment because the price is determined by reference to the future cost to produce the wafers. See Note 14, Related Parties and Strategic Investments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K included in Item 8 of this report. The cost of the wafers we purchase from Flash Ventures is recorded in inventory and ultimately cost of product revenues. Flash Ventures are variable interest entities; however, we are not the primary beneficiary of these ventures because we are entitled to less than a majority of expected gains and losses with respect to each venture. Accordingly, we account for our investments under the equity method and do not consolidate. Under Flash Ventures agreements, we agreed to share in Toshibas costs associated with NAND product development and our common semiconductor research and development activities. We and Toshiba each pay the cost of our own design teams and 50% of the wafer processing and similar costs associated with this direct design and development of flash memory. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, our requirement to fund common research and development activities ended and final funding was completed in the second quarter of fiscal year 2009. As of January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, we accrued liabilities related to these expenses of zero and $4.0 million, respectively. We continue to participate in other common research and development activities with Toshiba but are not committed to any minimum funding level. For semiconductor fixed assets that are leased by Flash Ventures, we and Toshiba jointly guarantee on an unsecured and several basis, 50% of the outstanding Flash Ventures lease obligations under master lease agreements entered into from December 2004 through December 2008. These master lease obligations are denominated in Japanese yen and are noncancelable. Our total master lease obligation guarantee, net of lease payments, as of January 3, 2010, was 98.9 billion Japanese yen, or approximately $1.07 billion based upon the exchange rate at January 3, 2010. In our fiscal year 2009, we and Toshiba restructured Flash Ventures by selling more than 20% of Flash Ventures capacity to Toshiba. The restructuring resulted in us receiving value of 79.3 billion Japanese yen of which 26.1 billion Japanese yen, or $277 million, was received in cash, reducing outstanding notes receivable from Flash Ventures and 53.2 billion Japanese yen of value reflected the transfer of off balance sheet equipment lease guarantee obligations from us to Toshiba. The restructuring was completed in a series of closings beginning in January 2009 and extending through March 31, 2009. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2009, transaction costs of $10.9 million related to the sale and transfer of equipment and lease obligations were expensed. From time to time, we and Toshiba mutually approve the purchase of equipment in the Flash Ventures for conversion to new process technologies or the addition of wafer capacity. Flash Partners has reached full wafer capacity. Flash Alliances production output ramped in fiscal year 2008 to more than 50% of its estimated full wafer capacity. During fiscal year 2010, we expect our portion of capital investments in Flash Ventures for new process technologies and additional wafer capacity to be between $600 million to $800 million, which we expect will be funded through additional loans to Flash Ventures, working capital contributions from Flash Ventures and equipment operating leases. 52 Table of Contents FlashVision Venture with Toshiba. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2008, we and Toshiba determined that production of NAND flash memory products utilizing 200 millimeter wafers was no longer cost effective relative to market prices for NAND flash memory and decided to wind down the FlashVision venture. As part of the ongoing wind down of FlashVision, Toshiba purchased certain assets of FlashVision. The existing master equipment lease agreement between FlashVision and a consortium of financial institutions has been retired, thereby releasing us from our contingent indemnification obligation with Toshiba. In fiscal year 2009, we received distributions of $12.7 million, released $43.3 million of cumulative translation adjustments recorded in accumulated OCI and impaired the remaining $7.9 million relating to our investment in FlashVision. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Our contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements at January 3, 2010, and the effect those contractual obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow over the next five years are presented in textual and tabular format in Note 13, Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K included in Item 8 of this report. Impact of Currency Exchange Rates Exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our most significant foreign currency exposure is to the Japanese yen in which we purchase the vast majority of our NAND flash wafers. In addition, we also have significant costs denominated in the Chinese renminbi and the Israeli new shekel, and we have revenue denominated in the European euro and the British pound. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. We use foreign currency forward and cross currency swap contracts to mitigate transaction gains and losses generated by certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We use foreign currency forward contracts and options to partially hedge our future Japanese yen costs for NAND flash wafers. Our derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in assets or liabilities with final gains or losses recorded in other income (expense) or as a component of accumulated OCI and subsequently reclassified into cost of product revenues in the same period or periods in which the cost of product revenues is recognized. These foreign currency exchange exposures may change over time as our business and business practices evolve, and they could harm our financial results and cash flows. See Note 4, Derivatives and Hedging Activities, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K included in Item 8 of this report. For a discussion of foreign operating risks and foreign currency risks, see Item 1A, Risk Factors. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K included in Item 8 of this report. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. This is accomplished by investing in widely diversified investment grade marketable securities. As of January 3, 2010, a hypothetical 50 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $12 million decline (less than 0.68%) in the fair value of our available for sale debt securities. Foreign Currency Risk. The majority of our revenues are transacted in the U.S. dollar, with some revenues transacted in the European euro, the British pound, and the Japanese yen. Our flash memory costs, which represent the largest portion of our cost of revenues, are denominated in the Japanese yen. We also have some cost of revenues denominated in Chinese renminbi. The majority of our operating expenses are denominated in the U.S. dollar; however, we have expenses denominated in the Israeli new shekel and numerous other currencies. On the balance sheet, we have numerous foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, with the largest monetary exposure being our notes receivable from Flash Ventures, which are denominated in Japanese yen. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains or losses generated by the remeasurement of our significant foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The fair value of these contracts is reflected as other current assets or other current liabilities and the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income (expense) to largely offset the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities which is also recorded in other income (expense). We use foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts to partially hedge our future Japanese yen flash memory costs. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the contracts gains or losses included in accumulated OCI and subsequently recognized in cost of product revenues in the same period the hedged cost of product revenues is recognized. At January 3, 2010, we had foreign currency forward exchange and cross currency swap contracts in place that amounted to a net sale in U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $250 million in foreign currencies to hedge our foreign currency denominated monetary net asset position. The maturities of these contracts were 36 months or less. At January 3, 2010 we had no foreign currency forward exchange contracts and option contracts in place to partially hedge our expected future wafer purchases in Japanese yen due to the low exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen relative to historical levels. 54 Table of Contents The notional amount and unrealized gain of our outstanding cross currency swap and foreign currency forward contracts that are non designated (balance sheet hedges) as of January 3, 2010 is shown in the table below. In addition, this table shows the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedges assuming a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent. These changes in fair values would be largely offset in other income (expense) by corresponding changes in the fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. Notional Amount Unrealized Gain (Loss) as of January 3, 2010 Change in Fair Value Due to 10% Adverse Rate Movement (In thousands) Balance sheet hedges: Cross currency swap contracts entered $ (412,610 ) $ (18,175 ) $ (60,271 ) Forward contracts sold (97,578 ) 2,779 (7,216 ) Forward contracts purchased 260,195 (4,142 ) 24,746 Total net outstanding contracts $ (249,993 ) $ (19,538 ) $ (42,741 ) Notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign exchange risks, we do not hedge all of our foreign currency exposures, and there can be no assurances that our mitigating activities related to the exposures that we do hedge will adequately protect us against risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. Market Risk. We also hold available for sale equity securities in semiconductor wafer manufacturing companies. As of January 3, 2010, a reduction in price of 10% of these marketable equity securities would result in a decrease in the fair value of our investments in marketable equity securities of approximately $1 million. All of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial position at January 3, 2010. Actual results may differ materially.
