Our goal is to provide simple, reliable, and affordable storage solutions for consumer use in a wide variety of formats and devices. We sell our products globally to retail and OEM customers. We design, develop and manufacture data storage solutions in a variety of form factors using our flash memory, proprietary controller and firmware technologies. We purchase the vast majority of our NAND flash memory supply requirements through our significant flash venture relationships with Toshiba, which produce and provide us with leading edge, low cost memory wafers. Our removable card products are used in a wide range of consumer electronics devices such as mobile phones, digital cameras, gaming devices and laptop computers. Our embedded flash products are used in mobile phones, tablets, eReaders, GPS devices, gaming systems, imaging devices and computing platforms. For computing platforms, we provide high speed, high capacity storage solutions known as SSDs that can be used in lieu of har d disk drives. Our strategy is to be an industry leading supplier of NAND flash storage solutions and to develop large scale markets for NAND based storage products. We maintain our technology leadership by investing in advanced technologies and NAND flash memory fabrication capacity in order to produce leading edge, low cost NAND memory for use in a variety of end products, including consumer, mobile phone and computing devices. We are a one stop shop for our retail and OEM customers, selling in high volumes all major NAND flash storage card formats for our target markets. Our results are primarily driven by worldwide demand for flash storage devices, which in turn primarily depends on end user demand for consumer electronic products. We believe the markets for flash storage are generally price elastic, meaning that a decrease in the price per gigabyte results in increased demand for higher capacities and the emergence of new applications for flash storage. Accordingly, we expect that as we reduce the price of our flash devices, consumers will demand an increasing number of gigabytes and or units of memory and that over time, new markets will emerge. In order to profitably capitalize on this price elasticity, we must reduce our cost per gigabyte at a rate similar to the change in selling price per gigabyte, while at the same time, increasing the average capacity and or the number of units of our products enough to offset price declines. We continually seek to achieve these cost reductions through technology improvements, primarily by increasing the amount of memory stored in a given area of silicon. Our industry is characterized by rapid technology transitions. Since our inception, we have been able to scale NAND technology through fourteen generations over approximately twenty years. However, the pace at which NAND technology is transitioning to new generations is expected to slow due to inherent physical technology limitations. We currently expect to be able to continue to scale our NAND technology through a few additional generations, but beyond that there is no certainty that further technology scaling can be achieved cost effectively with the current NAND flash technology and architecture. We also continue to invest in future alternative technologies, including our 3D Read/Write technology, which we believe may be a viable alternative to NAND when NAND can no longer scale at a su fficient rate, or at all. However, even when NAND flash can no longer be further scaled, we expect NAND and potential alternative technologies to coexist for an extended period of time. 41 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2010 Developments and Transactions In March 2010, we completed the redemption of our 1% Convertible Notes due 2035 through an all cash transaction of $75 million plus accrued interest of $0.4 million. In July 2010, we and Toshiba entered into an agreement to create Flash Forward to operate in Fab 5, of which we will own 49.9% and Toshiba will own 50.1%. Toshiba will own and fund the construction of the Fab 5 building, which will be located in Yokkaichi, Japan, adjacent to the site of our current Flash Partners and Flash Alliance ventures. Fab 5 is designed to be built in two phases. The Phase 1 building shell is expected to be completed in the second quarter of calendar year 2011, after which equipment outfitting is expected to begin, with initial NAND production scheduled for the third quarter of our fiscal year 2011. We are committed to invest in 50% of the initial ramp within Phase 1 of Fab 5, which is expected to occur in the second half of fiscal year 2011. No timelines have been finali zed for Phase 1 capacity expansions beyond 2011 or for the construction of Phase 2. For Phase 1 expansion beyond the initial ramp, we have the option to make investments and share output on a 50/50 basis between us and Toshiba. If and when Phase 2 is built, we are committed to 50% of an initial ramp in Phase 2, similar to that in Phase 1. On completion of the second phase, Fab 5 is expected to be of similar size and capacity to Fab 4. We and Toshiba will each retain some flexibility as to the extent and timing of each partys respective fab capacity ramps, and the output allocation will be in accordance with each of the parties proportionate level of equipment funding. In August 2010, we issued and sold $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 1.5% Convertible Senior Notes due August 15, 2017, or the 1.5% Notes due 2017. The 1.5% Notes due 2017 were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 1.5% per annum. The 1.5% Notes due 2017 may be converted into our common stock, under certain circumstances, based on an initial conversion rate of 19.0931 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $52.37 per share). The conversion price will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest. The net proceeds to us from the offering of the 1.5% Notes were $981 million. Concurrently with the issuance of the 1.5% Notes due 2017, we purchased a convertible bond hedge for ($293) million and sold warrants for $188 million. The separate convertible bond hedge and warrant transactions are structured to reduce the potential future economic dilution associated with the conversion of the 1.5% Notes due 2017. We currently intend to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, including the repayment at maturity or repurchase, from time to time, of a portion of our outstanding 1% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013, which mature on May 15, 2013, capital expenditures for new and existing manufacturing facilities, development of new technologies, general working capital, and other non manufacturing capital expenditures. The net proceeds may also be used to fund strategic investments or acquisitions of products, technologies or complementary businesses or to obtain the right or license to use additional technologies. On January 1, 2011, Sanjay Mehrotra, cofounder and most recently our President and Chief Operating Officer, became our President and Chief Executive Officer, following the December 31, 2010 retirement of our founder Dr. Eli Harari, who had been our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The Board appointed Mr. Mehrotra to serve as a director of the Company effective July 21, 2010. Michael Marks, a member of our Board since 2003, assumed the role of Chairman on January 1, 2011. Fiscal years 2010 and 2008 included 52 weeks as compared to 53 weeks in fiscal year 2009. 42 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies & Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. Use of Estimates. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including, among others, those related to customer programs and incentives, product returns, bad debts, inventories and related reserves, investments, long lived assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, restructuring, contingencies, share based compensation, and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for our judg ments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities when those values are not readily apparent from other sources. Estimates have historically approximated actual results. However, future results will differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. Revenue Recognition, Sales Returns and Allowances and Sales Incentive Programs. We recognize revenues when the earnings process is complete, as evidenced by an agreement with the customer, there is transfer of title and acceptance, if applicable, pricing is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue is generally recognized at the time of shipment for customers not eligible for price protection and or a right of return. Sales made to distributors and retailers are generally under agreements allowing price protection and or right of return and, therefore, the sales and related costs of these transactions are deferred until the retailers or distributors sell the merchandise to their end customer, or the r ights of return expire. At January 2, 2011 and January 3, 2010, deferred income from sales to distributors and retailers was $184 million and $178 million, respectively. Estimated sales returns are provided for as a reduction to product revenues and deferred revenues and were not material for any period presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We record estimated reductions to revenues or to deferred revenues for customer and distributor incentive programs and offerings, including price protection, promotions, co op advertising, and other volume based incentives and expected returns. All sales incentive programs are recorded as an offset to product revenues or deferred revenues. In calculating the value of sales incentive programs, actual and estimated activity is used based upon reported weekly sell through data from our customers. The timing and resolution of these claims could materially impact product revenues or deferred revenues. In addition, actual returns and rebates in any future period could differ from our estimates, which could impact the revenue we report. Inventories and Inventory Valuation. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out) or market. Market value is based upon an estimated average selling price reduced by estimated costs of disposal. The determination of market value involves numerous judgments including estimating average selling prices based upon recent sales, industry trends, existing customer orders, current contract prices, industry analysis of supply and demand and seasonal factors. Should actual market conditions differ from our estimates, our future results of operations could be materially affected. The valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory. The determination of ob solete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products within specific time horizons, generally six to twelve months. To the extent our demand forecast for specific products is less than both our product on hand and on noncancelable orders, we could be required to record additional inventory reserves, which would have a negative impact on our gross margin. 43 Table of Contents Deferred Tax Assets. We must make certain estimates in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. From time to time, we must evaluate the expected realization of our deferred tax assets and determine whether a valuation allowance needs to be established or released. In determining the need for and amount of our valuation allowance, we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets using historical levels of income, estimates of future income and tax planning strategies . Our estimates of future income include our internal projections and various internal estimates and certain external sources which we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. We also consider the jurisdictional mix of income and loss, changes in tax regulations in the period the changes are enacted and the type of deferred tax assets and liabilities. In assessing whether a valuation allowance needs to be established or released, we use judgment in considering the cumulative effect of negative and positive evidence and the weight given to the potential effect of the evidence. Recent historical income or loss and future projected operational results have the most influence on our determinations of whether a deferred tax valuation allowance is required or not. Our estimates for tax uncertainties require substantial judgment based upon the period of occurrence, complexity of the matter, available federal tax case law, interpretation of foreign laws and regulations and other estimates. There is no assurance that domestic or international tax authorities will agree with the tax positions we have taken which could materially impact future results. Valuation of Long Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Equity Method Investments. We perform tests for impairment of long lived and intangible assets and equity method investments whenever events or circumstances suggest that other long lived assets may not be recoverable. An impairment of long lived and intangible assets are only deemed to have occurred if the sum of the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows related to the assets are less than the carrying value of the asset we are testing for impairment. If the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying value, then we must write down the carrying value to its estimated fair value based primarily upon forecasted discount ed cash flows. An impairment of an equity method investment is deemed to occur if the fair value, based upon quoted market prices if available or forecasted discounted cash flows, is less than the carrying value. Substantially all of our equity method investments are not actively traded and we rely on discounted cash flows to estimate fair value. These forecasted discounted cash flows include estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates and operating margins, risk adjusted discount rates based on our weighted average cost of capital, future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. Our estimates of market segment growth and our market segment share and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates and certain external sources, and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business. Our business consists of both est ablished and emerging technologies and our forecasts for emerging technologies are based upon internal estimates and external sources rather than historical information. If future forecasts are revised, they may indicate or require future impairment charges. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. Fair Value of Investments in Debt Instruments. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value (see Note 2, Investments and Fair Value Measurements in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report). Each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value. Level 1 securities represent quoted prices in active markets, and therefore do not require significant management judgment. Our Level 2 securities are primarily valued using quoted market prices for similar instruments and nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. We use inputs such as actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, and other similar data, which are obtained from independent pricing vendors, quoted market prices, or other sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and liabilities. The inputs and fair value are reviewed for reasonableness, may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information, compared to multiple independent valuation sources and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information. In the current market environment, the assessment of fair value can be difficult and subjective. However, given the relative reliability of the inputs we use to value our investment portfolio and because substantially all of our valuation inputs are obtained using quoted market prices for similar or identical assets, we do not believe that the nature of estimates and assumptions was material to the valuation of our cash equivalents and short and long term marketable securities. We curr ently do not have any investments that use Level 3 inputs. 44 Table of Contents Results of Operations Product Revenues. FY 2010 Percent Change FY 2009 Percent Change FY 2008 (In millions, except percentages) OEM $ 2,776.8 75 % $ 1,586.8 54 % $ 1,030.3 Retail 1,686.1 8 % 1,567.5 (14 %) 1,812.9 Product revenues $ 4,462.9 41 % $ 3,154.3 11 % $ 2,843.2 The increase in our fiscal year 2010 product revenues compared to fiscal year 2009 reflected a 74% increase in the number of gigabytes sold, partially offset by a (19%) reduction in average selling price per gigabyte. The increase in number of gigabytes sold was the result of a 41% increase in memory units sold with an increase in average capacity of 23%. The increase in product revenues in fiscal year 2010 over fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to higher OEM revenues, principally from cards and embedded solutions for the mobile phone market and full year sales of private label cards, wafers and components to new OEM channels and customers that we added in the second half of fiscal year 2009. Our retail product revenue growth was driven primarily by increased sales of imaging products, partially offset b y a decline in sales of audio/video products. The increase in our fiscal year 2009 product revenues compared to fiscal year 2008 reflected a 116% increase in the number of gigabytes sold, partially offset by a (48%) reduction in average selling price per gigabyte. The increase in number of gigabytes sold was the result of an increase in average capacity of 71% and an increase in memory units sold of 26%. The decline in retail product revenues in fiscal year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008 was primarily attributable to a weak worldwide consumer spending environment through all of 2009. The increase in OEM product revenues in fiscal year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008 was due to increased sales of cards and embedded products primarily in the mobile phone markets and increased sales to new OEM channels, including the sale of private label cards, wa fers and components. Geographical Product Revenues. FY 2010 FY 2009 FY 2008 Revenue Percent of Total Revenue Percent of Total Revenue Percent of Total (In millions, except percentages) United States $ 771.0 17 % $ 916.3 29 % $ 1,006.7 35 % Asia Pacific 2,825.1 63 % 1,447.7 46 % 1,013.1 36 % Europe, Middle East and Africa 714.3 16 % 707.7 22 % 752.6 26 % Other foreign countries 152.5 4 % 82.6 3 % 70.8 3 % Product revenues $ 4,462.9 100 % $ 3,154.3 100 % $ 2,843.2 100 % Product revenues in Asia Pacific, which includes Japan, increased in fiscal year 2010 on a year over year basis due primarily to increased OEM sales of mobile phone products, wafers and components, and growth in retail sales primarily of imaging products. The decrease in product revenues for the U.S. in fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009 primarily reflected a shift in our OEM sales from U.S. customers to Asia Pacific customers. Product revenues in EMEA increased slightly compared to fiscal year 2009, reflecting increased OEM sales primarily for the mobile market, partially offset by a decrease in retail sales due to continued weak consumer spending and our decision not to participate in certain lower margin opportunities. Product revenues in Asia Pacific increased in fiscal year 2009 on a year over year basis due to growth in our OEM channel sales for the mobile phone market and growth in the sale of private label cards, wafers and components. Product revenues in fiscal year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008 decreased in the U.S. and EMEA, primarily due to a weak consumer spending environment. 45 Table of Contents License and Royalty Revenues. FY 2010 Percent Change FY 2009 Percent Change FY 2008 (In millions, except percentages) License and royalty revenues $ 363.9 (12 )% $ 412.5 (19 )% $ 508.1 The decrease in our fiscal year 2010 license and royalty revenues when compared to fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to a lower effective royalty rate in a renewed license agreement with one of our significant licensees as compared to the previous license agreement. The decrease in our fiscal year 2009 license and royalty revenues when compared to fiscal year 2008 was due to lower flash memory revenues reported by our licensees and a new license agreement with an existing licensee at a lower effective royalty rate as compared to the previous license agreement. These declines were partially offset by fiscal year 2009 including a full year of royalty revenue for new licensees added in fiscal year 2008. Gross Margins. FY 2010 Percent Change FY 2009 Percent Change FY 2008 (In millions, except percentages) Product gross profit (loss) $ 1,898.2 118 % $ 872.1 296 % $ (445.0 ) Product gross margins (as a percent of product revenue) 42.5 % 27.6 % (15.7 )% Total gross margins (as a percent of total revenue) 46.9 % 36.0 % 1.9 % Product gross margins in fiscal year 2010 increased compared to fiscal year 2009 due primarily to cost reductions exceeding average selling price reductions. The decrease in product cost is primarily due to wafer production transitioning from 43 nanometer to 32 nanometer technology, increased usage of X3 technology, and production at Flash Partners and Flash Alliance running at full utilization in fiscal year 2010 compared to less than full utilization in the first half of fiscal year 2009. While cost reductions exceeded average selling price reductions in fiscal year 2010, the rate of cost decline of our memory products was less in fiscal year 2010 than fiscal year 2009 in part due to the appreciation of the Japanese yen, which resulted in an increase in our foreign denominated costs. Furtherm ore, the increase in product gross margin was partially offset by an ($18) million charge related to a power outage experienced at Fab 3 and Fab 4 in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010. Product gross margins in fiscal year 2009 increased 43.3 percentage points compared to fiscal year 2008 due to manufacturing costs declining faster than prices and a net benefit of $364 million, primarily from the sale of inventory which had been previously partially reserved in fiscal year 2008 to reflect the market value of certain inventory which was determined to be below cost. The increase in product gross margin in fiscal year 2009 as compared with fiscal year 2008 was also due to charges in 2008 for the impairment of our investments in Flash Ventures of ($83) million and for adverse purchase commitments of ($121) million associated with under utilization of Flash Ventures capacity. The rate of decline in average selling price per gigabyte slowed in fiscal year 2009 due to an improved bal ance between supply and demand, impacted in part by our actions in early fiscal year 2009 to sell a portion of our manufacturing capacity in Flash Ventures to Toshiba, and hold the remaining wafer output capacity constant. The rate of cost decline of our memory products was similar in fiscal years 2009 and 2008. 46 Table of Contents Research and Development. FY 2010 Percent Change FY 2009 Percent Change FY 2008 (In millions, except percentages) Research and development $ 422.6 10 % $ 384.2 (11 )% $ 429.9 Percent of revenue 8.7 % 10.8 % 12.8 % Our fiscal year 2010 research and development expense increased from fiscal year 2009 primarily due to higher third party engineering costs of $23 million and employee related costs of $14 million related to increased headcount and compensation expense. Our fiscal year 2009 research and development expense was reduced from fiscal year 2008 primarily due to lower usage of third party engineering services of ($37) million and lower employee related costs of ($3) million due to decreased headcount and lower share based compensation expense. Sales and Marketing. FY 2010 Percent Change FY 2009 Percent Change FY 2008 (In millions, except percentages) Sales and marketing $ 209.8 1 % $ 208.5 (36 )% $ 328.1 Percent of revenue 4.4 % 5.8 % 9.8 % Our fiscal year 2010 sales and marketing expense did not change significantly in total or by expense category from fiscal year 2009. Our fiscal year 2009 sales and marketing expense was reduced from fiscal year 2008 primarily due to decreased branding and merchandising costs of ($99) million and lower outside service costs of ($19) million. General and Administrative. FY 2010 Percent Change FY 2009 Percent Change FY 2008 (In millions, except percentages) General and administrative $ 166.5 (3 )% $ 171.4 (16 )% $ 204.8 Percent of revenue 3.5 % 4.8 % 6.1 % Our fiscal year 2010 general and administrative expense declined from fiscal year 2009 primarily due to lower legal costs of ($14) million, outside advisor costs of ($6) million and bad debt expense of ($2) million, partially offset by a non cash charge of $17 million related to the modification of stock awards and a cash charge of $4 million related to certain provisions and benefits pursuant to the retirement agreement of our former Chief Executive Officer. Our fiscal year 2009 general and administrative expense was reduced from fiscal year 2008 primarily due to lower intellectual property legal costs of ($29) million and lower bad debt expense of ($9) million, partially offset by an increase in employee related costs of $5 million. 47 Table of Contents Impairment of Goodwill.

As a result of the interim goodwill impairment analysis, we recognized an impairment charge of $846 million. As of December 28, 2008, we have no goodwill remaining on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Impairment of Acquisition Related Intangible Assets. FY 2010 Percent Change FY 2009 Percent Change FY 2008 (In millions, except percentages) Impairment of acquisition related intangible assets n/a n/a n/a n/a $ 175.8 Percent of revenue n/a n/a 5.3 % In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, we recorded a $176 million impairment on acquisition related intangible assets. This impairment was based upon forecasted discounted cash flows which considered factors including a reduced business outlook primarily due to NAND flash memory industry pricing conditions. There were no such impairments or impairment indicators in fiscal years 2010 and 2009. Amortization of Acquisition Related Intangible Assets. FY 2010 Percent Change FY 2009 Percent Change FY 2008 (In millions, except percentages) Amortization of acquisition related intangible assets $ 1.6 33 % $ 1.2 (93 )% $ 17.1 Percent of revenue 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.5 % Amortization of acquisition related intangible assets in fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009 was higher due to the acceleration of amortization expense in the third quarter of fiscal year 2010 related to the remaining intangible asset acquired from MusicGremlin, Inc. Amortization of acquisition related intangible assets related to the intangible assets acquired from Matrix will continue to be amortized through the first quarter of fiscal year 2012. Amortization of acquisition related intangible assets in fiscal year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008 was lower due to the impairment of certain Matrix and msystems acquisition related intangible assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008. Restructuring Charges and Other.

We recorded no charge in fiscal year 2010 compared with negligible restructuring charges and other in fiscal year 2009. The goal of these restructuring and other charges was to bring our operational expenses to more appropriate levels relative to our net revenues, while simultaneously implementing extensive company wide expense control programs. All expenses, including adjustments, associated with our restructuring plans are included in Restructuring and Other in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For further discussion of our restructuring plans, refer to Note 9, Restructuring Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Stateme nts of this Form 10 K included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. 48 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), net.

Other income (expense), net in fiscal year 2010 included a gain of $13 million related to the sale of the net assets of our mobile phone SIM card business and the sale of certain public equity securities. Other income (expense), net was a net expense for fiscal year 2009 due to bank charges and fees of ($11) million related to the restructuring of the Flash Ventures master equipment leases and impairment of our equity investment in FlashVision of ($8) million. Our fiscal year 2009 Total other income (expense), net decreased compared to fiscal year 2008 primarily due to lower foreign currency gains and transaction costs incurred in fiscal year 2009 related to the sale of equipment and transfer of lease obligations resulting from the restructuring of Flash Ventures, reflected in Other income (expense), net. In addition, interest income in fiscal year 2009 declined by ($31) million compared to fiscal year 2008, reflecting lower interest rates and lower average cash balances during the year. Provision for Income Taxes. FY 2010 Percent Change FY 2009 Percent Change FY 2008 (In millions, except percentages) Provision for income taxes $ 157.3 78 % $ 88.5 158 % $ 34.3 Effective income tax rates 10.9 % 17.6 % (1.8 )% Our fiscal year 2010 provision for income taxes was primarily related to income taxes on our U.S. and foreign operations, partially offset by the release of valuation allowances that were previously recorded against our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets and favorable adjustments to uncertain tax positions related to specific tax jurisdictions. Our fiscal year 2009 provision for income taxes was primarily related to withholding taxes on license and royalty income from certain foreign licensees and income tax provisions recorded by foreign subsidiaries while income taxes for U.S. federal and state were substantially offset by the reduction of valuation allowance related to the utilization of tax credits. Our fiscal year 2008 provision for income taxes was primarily due to the non deductibility of the goodwill impairment charge and a valuation allowance recorded on certain U.S. and foreign gross deferred tax assets. The increase in the valuation allowance was due primarily to the size of the fiscal year 2008 net loss and that it was not more likely than not that certain U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets would be realized in the future. In October 2009, the I.R.S. commenced an examination of our federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2005 through 2008. We do not expect a resolution to be reached during the next twelve months. In addition, we are currently under audit by various state and international tax authorities. We cannot reasonably estimate that the outcome of these examinations will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 49 Table of Contents Non GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss). Twelve months ended January 2, 2011 January 3, 2010 December 28, 2008 (In thousands except per share amounts) Net income (loss) $ 1,300,142 $ 415,310 $ (1,986,624 ) Share based compensation 77,590 95,560 97,799 Impairment of goodwill and acquisition related intangible assets 1,021,238 Amortization of acquisition related intangible assets 14,201 13,696 71,581 Convertible debt interest 68,898 54,454 49,340 Income tax adjustments (360,508 ) (151,813 ) 280,692 Non GAAP net income (loss) $ 1,100,323 $ 427,207 $ (465,974 ) Diluted net income (loss) per share: $ 5.44 $ 1.79 $ (8.82 ) Share based compensation 0.32 0.41 0.43 Impairment of goodwill and acquisition related intangible assets 4.53 Amortization of acquisition related intangible assets 0.06 0.06 0.32 Convertible debt interest 0.29 0.23 0.22 Income tax adjustments (1.51 ) (0.65 ) 1.25 Non GAAP diluted net income (loss) per share: $ 4.60 $ 1.84 $ (2.07 ) Shares used in computing diluted net income (loss) per share: GAAP 238,901 231,959 225,292 Non GAAP 239,042 232,300 225,292 We believe that providing this additional information is useful in enabling investors to better assess and understand our operating performance, especially when comparing results with previous periods or forecasting performance for future periods, primarily because our management typically monitors our business excluding these items. We also use these non GAAP measures to establish operational goals and for measuring performance for compensation purposes. However, analysis of results on a non GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, and not as a replacement for, results presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of non GAAP measures, including net income (loss) and non GAAP net income (loss) per diluted share, provides important supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our results of operations. We believe that the use of these non GAAP financial measures also provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports. We have historically used these non GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations. Externally, we believe that these non GAAP measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and their valuation of our company. Internally, these non GAAP measures are significant measures used by us for: evaluating the core operating performance of the company; establishing internal budgets; setting and determining variable compensation levels; calculating return on investment for development programs and growth initiatives; comparing performance with internal forecasts and targeted business models; strategic planning; and benchmarking performance externally against our competitors. 50 Table of Contents We exclude the following items from our non GAAP measures: Share based Compensation Expense. These expenses consist primarily of expenses for employee stock options, employee restricted stock units, modifications of employee stock options and restricted stock units and the employee stock purchase plan. Although share based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees and executives, we exclude share based compensation expenses from our non GAAP measures primarily because they are non cash expenses that we do not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. Further, we believe that it is useful to exclude share based compensation expense for investors to better understand the long term performance of our core business and to facilitate comparison of our results to those of our peer companies. Impairment of Goodwill and Acquisition related Intangible Assets. This item reflects the write down of goodwill and other intangible assets to their fair values. Because of the infrequent nature of this charge, management does not include this type of item in internal operating forecasts and models. Excluding this data provides investors with a basis to compare our core operating results in different periods without this variability. Amortization of Acquisition related Intangible Assets. We incur amortization of intangible assets in connection with acquisitions. Since we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, we exclude these items in order to provide investors and others with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods. Convertible Debt Interest. This is the non cash economic interest expense relating to the implied value of the equity conversion component of our convertible debt. The value of the equity conversion component is treated as a debt discount and amortized to interest expense over the life of the notes using the effective interest rate method. We exclude this non cash interest expense as it does not represent the semi annual cash interest payments made to our note holders. Income Tax Adjustments. This amount is used to present each of the amounts described above on an after tax basis, considering jurisdictional tax rates, consistent with the presentation of non GAAP net income. It also represents the amount of tax expense or benefit that we would record, considering jurisdictional tax rates, if we did not have any valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that we may exclude if we believe that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management. Limitations of Relying on Non GAAP Financial Measures. We have incurred and will incur in the future, many of the costs excluded from the non GAAP measures, including share based compensation expense, impairment of goodwill and acquisition related intangible assets, amortization of acquisition related intangible assets and other acquisition related costs, non cash economic interest expense related to our convertible debt and income tax adjustments. These non GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non GAAP measures may be different than the non GAAP measures used by other companies. 51 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows. Our cash flows were as follows: FY 2010 Percent Change FY 2009 Percent Change FY 2008 (In millions, except percentages) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,451.9 198 % $ 487.8 456 % $ 87.7 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (2,714.6 ) 624 % (374.8 ) (1379 %) 29.3 Net cash provided by financing activities 985.2 4614 % 20.9 90 % 11.0 Effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on cash 6.3 43 % 4.4 1367 % 0.3 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (271.2 ) (296 %) $ 138.3 8 % $ 128.3 Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities is generated by net income (loss) adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. The increase in cash provided by operations in fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009 resulted primarily from higher net income of $1.30 billion compared with net income of $415 million in the prior year. Cash flow from accounts receivable decreased, as reflected by higher accounts receivable levels in fiscal year 2010 compared with the prior year, due to increased revenue in fiscal year 2010. Cash flow from inventory increased primarily due to a reduction in inventory from increased product sales. Cash flow from other assets decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in tax related receivables in fiscal year 2010 and a tax refund received in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. Accounts payable trade and accounts payable from related parties increased primarily due to the timing of Flash Ventures payments as compared to the prior year, resulting in an increase in cash provided. Cash flow from other liabilities in fiscal year 2010 increased as compared to the prior year primarily as a result of increased accrued payroll and related expenses. The increase in cash provided by operations in fiscal year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008 resulted primarily from our net income of $415 million compared with a net loss of ($1.99) billion, which included non cash impairment charges, in the comparable period of the prior year. Cash flow from accounts receivable decreased, as reflected by higher accounts receivable levels in fiscal year 2009 compared with the prior year, due to increased revenue in fiscal year 2009. Cash used for inventory decreased primarily due to higher sales. Cash flow from other assets increased compared with the prior year primarily due to a tax refund received in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 related to carryback claims from the fiscal year 2008 net loss. Accounts payable trade and accounts payable fr om related parties decreased primarily due to the reduction of gross inventory, operating expenses and the timing of Flash Ventures payments as compared to the prior year, resulting in a decrease in cash provided. Cash flow from other liabilities in fiscal year 2009 decreased as compared to the prior year as a result of settlements in hedge contracts and the elimination of liabilities for Flash Ventures adverse purchase commitments associated with under utilization of Flash Ventures capacity. 52 Table of Contents Investing Activities. The higher usage of cash in investing activities in fiscal year 2010 was primarily related to a net increase in short and long term marketable securities and an increase in property and equipment purchases. During fiscal year 2010, we had negligible net loan issuances to Flash Ventures compared to a net loan repayment from Flash Ventures of $9 million in fiscal year 2009. In addition, in fiscal year 2010, we received proceeds of $18 million related to the sale of the net assets of our mobile phone SIM card business. The increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2009 was primarily related to lower proceeds from sale and maturities of short and long term marketable securities, offset by a reduction in the net loans made to Flash Ventures and a reduced investment in property and equipment. During fiscal year 2009, we loaned $378 million to Flash Ventures for equipment purchases and received $387 million on the collection of outstanding notes receivable from Flash Ventures for the sale of a portion of our production capacity and the return of excess cash from Flash Partners. This resulted in a net loan repayment from Flash Ventures of $9 million in fiscal year 2009 compared to a loan of $384 million to Flash Ventures for equipment purchases in fiscal year 2008. Financing Activities. The fiscal year 2010 net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the net proceeds from the issuance of our 1.5% Notes due 2017, related warrants and convertible bond hedge in August 2010 of $878 million, higher cash received from employee stock programs and the excess tax benefit from share based compensation, offset by the redemption of our 1% Convertible Notes due 2035 of ($75) million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. Net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year 2009 of $21 million was higher than fiscal year 2008 primarily due to the repayment of debt financing in fiscal year 2008 of ($10) million. Liquid Assets. At January 2, 2011, we had cash, cash equivalents and short term marketable securities of $2.85 billion. We have $2.49 billion of long term marketable securities which we believe are also liquid assets, but are classified as long term marketable securities due to the remaining maturity of each marketable security being greater than one year. Short Term Liquidity. As of January 2, 2011, our working capital balance was $3.07 billion. During fiscal year 2011, we expect our portion of capital investments in Flash Ventures plus our investment in non fab property, plant and equipment to be between $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion, of which we expect approximately $800 million to $900 million will be funded through our cash, including by providing loans and investments to the Flash Ventures. Depending on the demand for our products, we may decide to make additional investments, which could be substantial, in wafer fabrication foundry capacity and assembly and test manufacturing equipment to support our business. We may also make equity investments in other companies, engage in merger or acquisition transactions, or purchase or license technologies. These activities may require us to raise additional financing, which could be difficult to obtain, and which if not obtained in satisfactory amounts, could prevent us from funding Flash Ventures, increasing our wafer supply, developing or enhancing our products, taking advantage of future opportunities, engaging in investments in or acquisitions of companies, growing our business, responding to competitive pressures or unanticipated industry changes, any of w hich could harm our business. Our short term liquidity is impacted in part by our ability to maintain compliance with covenants in the outstanding Flash Ventures master lease agreements. The Flash Ventures master lease agreements contain customary covenants for Japanese lease facilities as well as an acceleration clause for certain events of default related to us as guarantor, including, among other things, our failure to maintain a minimum shareholder equity of at least $1.51 billion, and our failure to maintain a minimum corporate rating of BB from S&P or Moodys, or a minimum corporate rating of BB+ from R&I. As of January 2, 2011, Flash Ventures was in compliance with all of its master lease covenants. As of January 2, 2011, our R&I credit rating was BBB, three notches above the required minimum c orporate rating threshold from R&I and our S&P credit rating was BB , which is the required minimum corporate rating threshold from S&P. If both S&P and R&I were to downgrade our credit rating below the minimum corporate rating threshold, Flash Ventures would become non compliant with certain covenants under its master equipment lease agreements and would be required to negotiate a resolution to the non compliance to avoid acceleration of the obligations under such agreements. Such resolution could include, among other things, supplementary security to be supplied by us, as guarantor, or increased interest rates or waiver fees, should the lessors decide they need additional collateral or financial consideration under the circumstances. If a resolution was unsuccessful, we could be required to pay a portion or up to the entire outstanding lease obligations which are denominated in Japanese yen and valued at approximately $879 million cove red by our guarantee under such Flash Ventures master lease agreements, based upon the exchange rate at January 2, 2011, which would negatively impact our short term liquidity. 53 Table of Contents Long Term Requirements. Depending on the demand for our products, we may decide to make additional investments, which could be substantial, in wafer fabrication foundry capacity and assembly and test manufacturing equipment to support our business. We may also make equity investments in other companies, engage in merger or acquisition transactions, or purchase or license technologies. These activities may require us to raise additional financing, which could be difficult to obtain, and which if not obtained in satisfactory amounts, could prevent us from funding Flash Ventures, increasing our wafer supply, developing or enhancing our products, taking advantage of future opportunities, engaging in investments in or acquisitions of c ompanies, growing our business, responding to competitive pressures or unanticipated industry changes, any of which could harm our business. Financing Arrangements. At January 2, 2011, we had $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of 1% Notes due 2013 outstanding and $1.00 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.5% Notes due 2017 outstanding. See Note 6, Financing Arrangements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. Concurrent with the issuance of the 1% Notes due 2013, we sold warrants to acquire shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $95.03 per share. As of January 2, 2011, the warrants had an expected life of approximately 2.6 years and expire in August 2013. At expiration, we may, at our option, elect to settle the warrants on a net share basis. As of January 2, 2011, the warrants had not been exercised and remain outstanding. In addition, concurrent with the issuance of the 1% Notes due 2013, we entered into a convertible bond hedge transaction in which counterparties agreed to sell to us up to approximately 14.0 million shares of our common stock, which is the number of shares initially issuable upon conversion of the 1% Notes due 2013 in full, at a conversion pri ce of $82.36 per share. The convertible bond hedge transaction will be settled in net shares and will terminate upon the earlier of the maturity date of the 1% Notes due 2013 or the first day that none of the 1% Notes due 2013 remain outstanding due to conversion or otherwise. Settlement of the convertible bond hedge in net shares on the expiration date would result in us receiving net shares equivalent to the number of shares issuable by us upon conversion of the 1% Notes due 2013. As of January 2, 2011, we had not purchased any shares under this convertible bond hedge agreement. Concurrent with the issuance of the 1.5% Notes due 2017, we sold warrants to acquire shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $73.33 per share. As of January 2, 2011, the warrants had an expected life of approximately 6.9 years and expire over 40 different dates from November 13, 2017 through January 10, 2018. At each expiration date, the Company may, at its option, elect to settle the warrants on a net share basis. As of January 2, 2011, the warrants had not been exercised and remained outstanding. In addition, concurrent with the issuance of the 1.5% Notes due 2017, we entered into a convertible bond hedge transaction in which counterparties agreed to sell to us up to approximately 19.1 million shares of our common stock, which is the number of shares i nitially issuable upon conversion of the 1.5% Notes due 2017 in full, at a conversion price of $52.37 per share. The convertible bond hedge transaction will be settled in net shares and will terminate upon the earlier of the maturity date of the 1.5% Notes due 2017 or the first day none of the 1.5% Notes due 2017 remains outstanding due to conversion or otherwise. Settlement of the convertible bond hedge in net shares, based on the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the 1.5% Notes due 2017, on the expiration date would result in the Company receiving net shares equivalent to the number of shares issuable by the Company upon conversion of the 1.5% Notes due 2017. As of January 2, 2011, we had not purchased any shares under this convertible bond hedge agreement. 54 Table of Contents Ventures with Toshiba. We are a 49.9% owner in both Flash Partners and Flash Alliance, our business ventures with Toshiba to develop and manufacture NAND flash memory products. In July 2010, we and Toshiba entered into an agreement to create Flash Forward to operate in Fab 5, of which we will own 49.9% and Toshiba will own 50.1%. Toshiba will own and fund the construction of the Fab 5 building, which will be located in Yokkaichi, Japan, adjacent to the site of our current Flash Partners and Flash Alliance ventures. Fab 5 is designed to be built in two phases. The Phase 1 building shell is expected to be completed in the second quarter of calendar year 2011, after which equipment outfitting is expected to begi n, with initial NAND production scheduled for the third quarter of our fiscal year 2011. We are committed to invest in 50% of the initial ramp within Phase 1 of Fab 5, which is expected to occur in the second half of fiscal year 2011. No timelines have been finalized for Phase 1 capacity expansions beyond 2011 or for the construction of Phase 2. For Phase 1 expansion beyond the initial ramp, we have the option to make investments and share output on a 50/50 basis between us and Toshiba. If and when Phase 2 is built, we are committed to 50% of an initial ramp in Phase 2, similar to that in Phase 1. On completion of the second phase, Fab 5 is expected to be of similar size and capacity to Fab 4. We and Toshiba will each retain some flexibility as to the extent and timing of each partys respective fab capacity ramps, and the output allocation will be in accordance with each of the parties proportionate level of equipment funding. Se e Note 12, Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for our contractual obligations related to Flash Forward. With these ventures, we and Toshiba collaborate in the development and manufacture of NAND flash memory products. These NAND flash memory products are manufactured by Toshiba at Toshibas Yokkaichi, Japan operations using the semiconductor manufacturing equipment owned or leased by these ventures. This equipment is funded or will be funded by investments in or loans to the Flash Ventures from us and Toshiba as well as through operating leases received by Flash Ventures from third party banks and guaranteed by us and Toshiba. These ventures purchase wafers from Toshiba at cost and then resell those wafers to us and Toshiba at cost plus a markup. We are contractually obligated to purchase half of these ventures NAND wafer supply or pay for 50% of the fixed costs of these ventures.&#1 60; We are not able to estimate our total wafer purchase obligations beyond our rolling three month purchase commitment because the price is determined by reference to the future cost to produce the wafers. See Note 13, Related Parties and Strategic Investments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. The cost of the wafers we purchase from these ventures is recorded in inventory and ultimately cost of product revenues. These ventures are variable interest entities; however, we are not the primary beneficiary of these ventures because we do not have a controlling financial interest in each venture. Accordingly, we account for our investments under the equity method and do not consolidate. Under Flash Ventures agreements, we agreed to share in Toshibas costs associated with NAND product development and our common semiconductor research and development activities. We and Toshiba each pay the cost of our own design teams and 50% of the wafer processing and similar costs associated with this direct design and development of flash memory. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, our requirement to fund common research and development activities ended and final funding was completed in the second quarter of fiscal year 2009. As of January 2, 2011 and January 3, 2010, we had no accrued liabilities related to these expenses. We continue to participate in other common research and development activities with Toshiba but are not committed to any minimum funding l evel. 55 Table of Contents For semiconductor fixed assets that are leased by Flash Ventures, we and or Toshiba jointly guarantee on an unsecured and several basis, 50% of the outstanding Flash Ventures lease obligations under master lease agreements entered into from December 2004 through April 2010. These master lease obligations are denominated in Japanese yen and are noncancelable. Our total master lease obligation guarantee as of January 2, 2011 was 71.4 billion Japanese yen, or approximately $879 million based upon the exchange rate at January 2, 2011. On January 27, 2011, Flash Partners refinanced two of its maturing equipment leases totaling 11.0 billion Japanese yen, or approximately $136 million based upon the exchange rate at January 2, 2011. We and Toshiba have each guaranteed 50%, on a several basis, of Flash Partners obligations under the refinanced lease agreement. This refinanced equipment lease, due in fiscal year 2014, is to be paid by Flash Partners in quarterly installments, with interest based on the 3 month Euro Yen Tokyo InterBank Offer Rate (TIBOR). In our fiscal year 2009, we and Toshiba restructured Flash Partners and Flash Alliance by selling more than 20% of the capacity of each of the two ventures to Toshiba. The restructuring resulted in us receiving value of 79.3 billion Japanese yen of which 26.1 billion Japanese yen, or $277 million, was received in cash, reducing outstanding notes receivable from Flash Ventures and 53.2 billion Japanese yen of value reflected the transfer of off balance sheet equipment lease guarantee obligations from us to Toshiba. The restructuring was completed in a series of closings beginning in January 2009 and extending through March 31, 2009. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2009, transaction costs of $10.9 million related to the sale and transfer of equipment and lease obligati ons were expensed. From time to time, we and Toshiba mutually approve the purchase of equipment for the ventures in order to convert to new process technologies or add wafer capacity. Flash Partners has previously reached full wafer capacity. Flash Alliance is expected to reach full wafer capacity in 2011. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Our contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements at January 2, 2011, and the effect those contractual obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow over the next five years are presented in textual and tabular format in Note 12, Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. Impact of Currency Exchange Rates Exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our most significant foreign currency exposure is to the Japanese yen in which we purchase the vast majority of our NAND flash wafers. In addition, we also have significant costs denominated in the Chinese renminbi and the Israeli new shekel, and we have revenue denominated in the European euro and the British pound. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. We use foreign currency forward and cross currency swap contracts to mitigate transaction gains and losses generated by certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We use foreign currency forward contracts and options to partia lly hedge our future Japanese yen costs for NAND flash wafers. Our derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in assets or liabilities with final gains or losses recorded in other income (expense) or as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, or OCI, and subsequently reclassified into cost of product revenues in the same period or periods in which the cost of product revenues is recognized. These foreign currency exchange exposures may change over time as our business and business practices evolve, and they could harm our financial results and cash flows. See Note 3, Derivatives and Hedging Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. For a discussion of foreign operating risks and foreign currency risks, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. This is accomplished by investing in widely diversified investment grade marketable securities. As of January 2, 2011, a hypothetical 50 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $31 million decline (less than 0.70%) in the fair value of our available for sale debt securities. Foreign Currency Risk. The majority of our revenues are transacted in the U.S. dollar, with some revenues transacted in the European euro, the British pound, and the Japanese yen. Our flash memory costs, which represent the largest portion of our cost of revenues, are denominated in the Japanese yen. We also have some cost of revenues denominated in Chinese renminbi. The majority of our operating expenses are denominated in the U.S. dollar; however, we have expenses denominated in the Israeli new shekel and numerous other currencies. On the balance sheet, we have numerous foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, with the largest monetary exposure being our notes recei vable from Flash Ventures, which are denominated in Japanese yen. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps to hedge the gains or losses generated by the remeasurement of our significant foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The fair value of these contracts is reflected as other assets or other liabilities and the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income (expense) to largely offset the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities which is also recorded in other income (expense). We use foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts to partially hedge our future Japanese yen flash memory costs. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the contracts gains or losses included in accumulated OCI and subsequently recognized in cost of product revenues in the same period the hedged cost of product revenues is recognized. At January 2, 2011, we had foreign currency forward and cross currency swap contracts in place that amounted to a net sale in U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $305 million in foreign currencies to hedge our foreign currency denominated monetary net asset position. The maturities of these contracts were 36 months or less. At January 2, 2011, we had foreign currency forward exchange contracts in place that amounted to a net purchase in U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $843 million in foreign currencies to partially hedge our expected future wafer purchases in Japanese yen. The maturities of these contracts were 12 months or less. 57 Table of Contents The notional amount and unrealized gain or loss of our outstanding cross currency swap and foreign currency forward contracts that are non designated (balance sheet hedges) as of January 2, 2011 is shown in the table below. In addition, this table shows the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedges assuming a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent. These changes in fair values would be largely offset in other income (expense) by corresponding changes in the fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. Notional Amount Unrealized Gain (Loss) as of January 2, 2011 Change in Fair Value Due to 10% Adverse Rate Movement (In thousands) Balance sheet hedges: Cross currency swap contracts entered $ (469,038 ) $ (67,250 ) $ (50,428 ) Forward contracts sold (125,054 ) (962 ) (12,783 ) Forward contracts purchased 289,242 4,308 31,890 Total net outstanding contracts $ (304,850 ) $ (63,904 ) $ (31,321 ) The notional amount and fair value of our outstanding forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges as of January 2, 2011 is shown in the table below. In addition, this table shows the change in fair value of these cash flow hedges assuming a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent. Notional Amount Fair Value as of January 2, 2011 Change in Fair Value Due to 10% Adverse Rate Movement (In thousands) Cash flow hedges: Forward contracts purchased $ 843,465 $ 13,465 $ (75,839 ) Notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign exchange risks, we do not hedge all of our foreign currency exposures, and there can be no assurances that our mitigating activities related to the exposures that we do hedge will adequately protect us against risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. Market Risk. We hold available for sale equity securities, a portion of which is hedged, in publicly traded companies. As of January 2, 2011, a reduction in price of 10% of these marketable equity securities would result in a decrease in the fair value of our investments in marketable equity securities of approximately $9 million. All of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial position at January 2, 2011. Actual results may differ materially.
