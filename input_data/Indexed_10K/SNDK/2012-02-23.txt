Our goal is to provide simple, reliable and affordable storage solutions for consumer and enterprise use in a wide variety of formats and devices. We sell our products globally to OEM and retail customers. We design, develop and manufacture data storage solutions in a variety of form factors using our flash memory, proprietary controller and firmware technologies. We purchase the vast majority of our NAND flash memory supply requirements through our significant flash venture relationships with Toshiba, which produce and provide us with leading edge, low cost memory wafers. Our removable card products are used in a wide range of consumer electronics devices such as mobile phones, digital cameras, gaming devices and laptop computers. Our embedded flash products are used in mobile phones, tablets, ultrabooks, eReaders, GPS devices, gaming systems, imaging devices and computing platforms. For computing platforms, we provide high speed, high capacity storage solutions such as SSDs, that can be used in lieu of hard disk drives. Our strategy is to be an industry leading supplier of NAND flash storage solutions and to develop large scale markets for NAND based storage products. We intend to maintain our technology leadership by investing in advanced technologies and NAND flash memory fabrication capacity in order to produce leading edge, low cost NAND flash memory for use in a variety of end products, including consumer, mobile phone and computing devices. We are a one stop shop for our retail and OEM customers, selling in high volumes all major NAND flash storage card formats for our target markets. Our results are primarily driven by worldwide demand for flash storage devices, which in turn primarily depends on demand for consumer electronic products and for SSDs in computing devices and enterprise storage systems. We believe the markets for flash storage are generally price elastic, meaning that a decrease in the price per gigabyte results in increased 33Table of Contentsdemand for higher capacities and the emergence of new applications for flash storage. Accordingly, we expect that as we reduce the price of our flash devices, consumers will demand an increasing number of gigabytes and or units of memory and that over time, new markets will emerge. In order to profitably capitalize on this price elasticity, we must reduce our cost per gigabyte at a rate similar to the decrease in selling price per gigabyte, while at the same time increasing the average capacity and or the number of product units enough to offset price declines. We continually seek to achieve these cost reductions through technology improvements, primarily by increasing the amount of memory stored in a given area of silicon.Our industry is characterized by rapid technology transitions. Since our inception, we have been able to scale NAND flash technology through fifteen generations over approximately twenty two years. However, the pace at which NAND flash technology is transitioning to new generations is expected to slow due to inherent physical technology limitations. We currently expect to be able to continue to scale our NAND flash technology through a few additional generations, but beyond that there is no certainty that further technology scaling can be achieved cost effectively with the current NAND flash technology and architecture. We also continue to invest in future alternative technologies, including our 3D ReRAM technology, which we believe may be a viable alternative to NAND flash technology, when NAND flash technology can no longer scale at a sufficient rate, or at all. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, we made investments in BiCS and other technologies. We believe BiCS technology, if successful, could enable further memory cost reductions beyond the NAND roadmap. However, even when NAND flash technology can no longer be further scaled, we expect NAND flash technology and potential alternative technologies to coexist for an extended period of time. Fiscal Year 2011 Developments and TransactionsOn May 24, 2011, we completed the acquisition of Pliant, a developer of enterprise flash storage solutions. This acquisition represents a significant opportunity for us to participate in the enterprise storage solutions market. We acquired all of the outstanding shares of Pliant through an all cash transaction. The total purchase price was $322 million. Total acquisition related costs of approximately $2 million were expensed during the year ended January 1, 2012.In the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we repurchased $222 million principal amount of our 1% Notes due 2013 for $211 million in cash.Fiscal years 2011 and 2010 included 52 weeks as compared to 53 weeks in fiscal year 2009.Critical Accounting Policies & EstimatesOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP. Use of Estimates. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including, among others, those related to customer programs and incentives, intellectual property claims, product returns, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventories, marketable securities and investments, impairments of goodwill and long lived assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, restructuring, contingencies, share based compensation and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities when those values are not readily apparent from other sources. Estimates have historically approximated actual results. However, future results will differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.Revenue Recognition, Sales Returns and Allowances and Sales Incentive Programs. We recognize revenues when the earnings process is complete, as evidenced by an agreement with the customer, there is transfer of title and acceptance, if applicable, pricing is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue is generally recognized at the time of shipment for customers not eligible for price protection and or a right of return. Sales made to distributors and retailers are generally under agreements allowing price protection and or right of return and, therefore, the sales and related costs of these transactions are deferred until the distributors or retailers sell the merchandise to their end customer, or the rights of return expire. At January 1, 2012 and January 2, 2011, deferred income from sales to distributors and retailers was $162 million and $184 million, respectively. Estimated sales returns are provided for as a reduction to product revenues and deferred revenues and were not material for any period presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements.34Table of ContentsWe record estimated reductions to revenues or to deferred revenues for customer and distributor incentive programs and offerings, including price protection, promotions, co op advertising, and other volume based incentives and expected returns. All sales incentive programs are recorded as an offset to product revenues or deferred revenues. In calculating the value of sales incentive programs, actual and estimated activity is used based upon reported weekly sell through data from our customers. The resolution of these claims is generally within twelve months and could materially impact product revenues or deferred revenues. In addition, actual returns and rebates in any future period could differ from our estimates, which could impact the revenue we report.Inventories and Inventory Valuation. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out) or market. Market value is based upon an estimated average selling price reduced by estimated costs of disposal. The determination of market value involves numerous judgments including estimating average selling prices based upon recent sales, industry trends, existing customer orders, current contract prices, industry analysis of supply and demand and seasonal factors. Should actual market conditions differ from our estimates, our future results of operations could be materially affected. The valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory. The determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products within specific time horizons, generally six to twelve months. To the extent our demand forecast for specific products is less than the combination of our product on hand and our noncancelable orders from suppliers, we could be required to record additional inventory reserves, which would have a negative impact on our gross margin.Deferred Tax Assets. We must make certain estimates in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. From time to time, we must evaluate the expected realization of our deferred tax assets and determine whether a valuation allowance needs to be established or released. In determining the need for and amount of our valuation allowance, we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets using historical levels of income, estimates of future income and tax planning strategies. Our estimates of future income include our internal projections and various internal estimates and certain external sources which we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. We also consider the jurisdictional mix of income and loss, changes in tax regulations in the period the changes are enacted and the type of deferred tax assets and liabilities. In assessing whether a valuation allowance needs to be established or released, we use judgment in considering the cumulative effect of negative and positive evidence and the weight given to the potential effect of the evidence. Recent historical income or loss and future projected operational results have the most influence on our determinations of whether a deferred tax valuation allowance is required or not.Our estimates for tax uncertainties require substantial judgment based upon the period of occurrence, complexity of the matter, available federal tax case law, interpretation of foreign laws and regulations and other estimates. There is no assurance that domestic or international tax authorities will agree with the tax positions we have taken which could materially impact future results.Valuation of Long Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill. We perform tests for impairment of long lived assets whenever events or circumstances suggest that other long lived assets may not be recoverable. An impairment is only deemed to have occurred if the sum of the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows related to the assets are less than the carrying value of the asset we are testing for impairment. If the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying value, then we must write down the carrying value to its estimated fair value based primarily upon forecasted discounted cash flows. These forecasted discounted cash flows include estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates and operating margins, risk adjusted discount rates based on our weighted average cost of capital, future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. Our estimates of market growth and our market share and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates and certain external sources, and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business. Our business consists of both established and emerging technologies and our forecasts for emerging technologies are based upon internal estimates and external sources rather than historical information. If future forecasts are revised, they may indicate or require future impairment charges. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. 35Table of ContentsWe perform our annual impairment analysis of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets (such as in process research and development) on the first day of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if there are indicators of impairment. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. For our annual goodwill impairment test in fiscal year 2011, we adopted the authoritative guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in September 2011. In accordance with this guidance, we first assessed qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and whether the two step impairment test on goodwill is required. If based upon qualitative factors it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, we will not be required to proceed to a two step impairment test on goodwill. However, we also have the option to proceed directly to a two step impairment test on goodwill. In the first step, or Step 1, of the two step impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value of the net assets, goodwill is considered not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets exceeds the fair value, then we must perform the second step, or Step 2, of the two step impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. We evaluate the reasonableness of the fair value calculations of our reporting units by reconciling the total of the fair values of all of our reporting units to our total market capitalization, taking into account an appropriate control premium. The determination of a control premium requires the use of judgment and is based primarily on comparable industry and deal size transactions, related synergies and other benefits. When we are required to perform a Step 2 analysis, determining the fair value of our net assets and our off balance sheet intangibles used in Step 2 requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Fair Value of Investments in Debt Instruments. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value (see Note 3, Investments and Fair Value Measurements in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report). Each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value. Level 1 securities represent quoted prices in active markets, and therefore do not require significant management judgment. Our Level 2 securities are primarily valued using quoted market prices for similar instruments and nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. We use inputs such as actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, and other similar data, which are obtained from independent pricing vendors, quoted market prices, or other sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and liabilities. The inputs and fair value are reviewed for reasonableness, may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information, compared to multiple independent valuation sources and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information. In the current market environment, the assessment of fair value can be difficult and subjective. However, given the relative reliability of the inputs we use to value our investment portfolio and because substantially all of our valuation inputs are obtained using quoted market prices for similar or identical assets, we do not believe that the nature of estimates and assumptions was material to the valuation of our cash equivalents and short and long term marketable securities. We currently do not have any investments that use Level 3 inputs. Results of OperationsProduct Revenues.

The increase in number of gigabytes sold was the result of a 31% increase in memory units sold with an increase in average capacity of 38%. The increase in product revenues in fiscal year 2011, over fiscal year 2010, was due primarily to higher OEM sales of memory products for 36Table of Contentsmobile devices, such as phones and tablets, and for gaming devices. Our retail product revenue growth was driven primarily by increased sales of cards for mobile phones and USB drives. The increase in our fiscal year 2010 product revenues, compared to fiscal year 2009, reflected a 74% increase in the number of gigabytes sold, partially offset by a (19%) reduction in average selling price per gigabyte. The increase in number of gigabytes sold was the result of a 41% increase in memory units sold with an increase in average capacity of 23%. The increase in product revenues in fiscal year 2010, over fiscal year 2009, was primarily due to higher OEM revenues, principally from cards and embedded solutions for the mobile phone market and full year sales of private label cards, wafers and components to new OEM channels and customers that we added in the second half of fiscal year 2009. Our retail product revenue growth was driven primarily by increased sales of imaging products, partially offset by a decline in sales of audio/video products. Geographical Product Revenues.

Our retail sales in Asia Pacific also increased due to increased consumer demand, primarily in China and India. The slight increase in product revenues for the U.S. in fiscal year 2011, compared to fiscal year 2010, was due primarily to growth in retail sales of cards for the mobile market and USB flash drives. Product revenues in EMEA decreased slightly in fiscal year 2011, compared to fiscal year 2010, due primarily to a decrease in sales to certain mobile OEM customers. Product revenues in Asia Pacific, which includes Japan, increased in fiscal year 2010 on a year over year basis due primarily to increased OEM sales of mobile phone products, wafers and components, and growth in retail sales primarily of imaging products. The decrease in product revenues for the U.S. in fiscal year 2010, compared to fiscal year 2009, primarily reflected a shift in our OEM sales from U.S. customers to Asia Pacific customers. Product revenues in EMEA increased slightly in fiscal year 2010, compared to fiscal year 2009, reflecting increased OEM sales primarily for the mobile market, partially offset by a decrease in retail sales due to continued weak consumer spending and our decision not to participate in certain lower margin opportunities. License and Royalty Revenues. FY 2011 Percent Change FY 2010 Percent Change FY 2009 (In millions, except percentages)License and royalty revenues$374.5 3% $363.9 (12%) $412.5The increase in our fiscal year 2011 license and royalty revenues, when compared to fiscal year 2010, was primarily due to higher licensable flash memory revenues reported by our licensees. The decrease in our fiscal year 2010 license and royalty revenues, when compared to fiscal year 2009, was primarily due to a lower effective royalty rate in a renewed license agreement with one of our significant licensees as compared to the previous license agreement. 37Table of ContentsGross Profit and Margins. FY 2011 Percent Change FY 2010 Percent Change FY 2009 (In millions, except percentages)Product gross profit$2,064.6 9% $1,898.2 118% $872.1Product gross margins (as a percent of product revenue)39.0% 42.5% 27.6%Total gross margins (as a percent of total revenue)43.1% 46.9% 36.0%Product gross margins decreased in fiscal year 2011, compared to fiscal year 2010, due primarily to average selling price reductions exceeding cost reductions. Costs per gigabyte decreased over the prior year by 31%, primarily due to wafer production transitioning from 32 nanometer to 24 nanometer. This cost reduction includes the negative impact of the appreciation of the Japanese yen to the U.S. dollar for wafer purchases denominated in Japanese yen, increased sale of products incorporating non captive flash memory, startup costs incurred by Flash Forward, a ($25) million charge related to both a power outage in early March 2011 and an earthquake on March 11, 2011, that affected Flash Ventures, and an increase in amortization of acquisition related intangible assets related to our acquisition of Pliant. Product gross margins increased in fiscal year 2010, compared to fiscal year 2009, due primarily to cost reductions exceeding average selling price reductions. The decrease in product cost is primarily due to wafer production transitioning from 43 nanometer to 32 nanometer technology, increased usage of X3 technology, and production at Flash Partners and Flash Alliance running at full utilization in fiscal year 2010 compared to less than full utilization in the first half of fiscal year 2009. While cost reductions exceeded average selling price reductions in fiscal year 2010, the rate of cost decline of our memory products was less in fiscal year 2010 than fiscal year 2009 in part due to the appreciation of the Japanese yen, which resulted in an increase in our foreign denominated costs. Furthermore, the increase in product gross margin was partially offset by an ($18) million charge related to a power outage experienced at Fab 3 and Fab 4 in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010.

FY 2011 Percent Change FY 2010 Percent Change FY 2009 (In millions, except percentages)Amortization of acquisition related intangible assets$4.4 175% $1.6 33% $1.2Percent of revenue0.1% 0.0% 0.0%Amortization of acquisition related intangible assets in fiscal year 2011, compared to fiscal year 2010, was higher due to increased amortization of intangible assets from the Pliant acquisition, which was completed in May 2011. Amortization of acquisition related intangible assets associated with the Pliant acquisition will continue to be amortized through the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, while the intangible assets acquired from our January 2006 acquisition of Matrix Technology, Inc., or Matrix, will be fully amortized at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2012. As part of the Pliant purchase agreement, $36.2 million related to the next generation of enterprise storage products was allocated to acquired in process technology because technological feasibility had not been established and no alternative future uses existed. The value was determined by estimating the net cash flows and discounting forecasted net cash flows to their present values. The net cash flows from the project were based on estimates of revenues, costs of revenues, operating expenses and income taxes. The estimated net revenues and gross margins were based on our projections of the project and were in line with industry averages. Estimated operating expenses included research and development expenses and selling, marketing and administrative expenses based upon historical and expected direct expense level and general industry metrics. The project is expected to be completed by the second quarter of fiscal year 2013, at which point, amortization of the $36.2 million in process research and development intangible will begin. As of January 1, 2012, it was estimated that these in process projects would be completed at a total remaining cost of approximately $33 million, which includes incremental non recurring engineering costs and customer qualification costs. The project is dependent on general development and project milestones, which if not met, may result in higher costs, or if not successful, could result in an impairment of the acquired in process technology intangible.Amortization of acquisition related intangible assets in fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009 was higher due to the acceleration of amortization expense in the third quarter of fiscal year 2010 related to the remaining intangible asset acquired from MusicGremlin, Inc. Amortization of acquisition related intangible assets related to the intangible assets acquired from Matrix will continue to be amortized through the first quarter of fiscal year 2012. 39Table of ContentsOther Income (Expense), net.

Other income (expense), net for fiscal year 2011 primarily included a net gain on sale of equity securities of $19 million, offset by the expense of ($11) million incurred from the change in fair value of the liability component of the repurchased portion of the 1% Notes due 2013. Other income (expense), net for fiscal year 2010 was primarily comprised of a non recurring gain of $13 million related to the sale of the net assets of our SIM business and a gain on sales of equity securities of $16 million. Our fiscal year 2010 Total other income (expense), net was a lower net expense compared to fiscal year 2009 primarily due to non recurring gains on the sale of assets and investments reflected in Other income (expense), net, offset by increased interest expense related to the issuance of the 1.5% Notes due 2017 in August 2010 and lower interest income due to lower interest rates earned on our cash investments. Other income (expense), net in fiscal year 2010 included a gain of $13 million related to the sale of the net assets of our mobile phone SIM card business and the sale of certain public equity securities. Other income (expense), net was a net expense for fiscal year 2009 due to bank charges and fees of ($11) million related to the restructuring of Flash Ventures master equipment leases and impairment of our equity investment in FlashVision of ($8) million. Provision for Income Taxes. FY 2011 Percent Change FY 2010 Percent Change FY 2009 (In millions, except percentages)Provision for income taxes$489.8 211% $157.3 78% $88.5Effective income tax rates33.2% 10.8% 17.6%Our fiscal year 2011 provision for income taxes differs from the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to the tax impact of earnings from foreign operations, state taxes, tax exempt interest income and benefit from federal and California research and development credits. Earnings and taxes resulting from foreign operations are largely attributable to our Irish, Chinese, Israeli and Japanese entities.Our fiscal year 2010 provision for income taxes was primarily related to income taxes on our U.S. and foreign operations, partially offset by the release of valuation allowances that were previously recorded against our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets and favorable adjustments to uncertain tax positions related to specific tax jurisdictions.Our fiscal year 2009 provision for income taxes was primarily related to withholding taxes on license and royalty income from certain foreign licensees and income tax provisions recorded by foreign subsidiaries while income taxes for U.S. federal and state were substantially offset by the reduction of valuation allowance related to the utilization of tax credits.In October 2009, the I.R.S. commenced an examination of our federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2005 through 2008. It is not certain that a complete resolution of this examination will occur within the next twelve months. In addition, we are currently under audit by various state and international tax authorities. We cannot reasonably estimate that the outcome of these examinations will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 40Table of ContentsNon GAAP Financial MeasuresReconciliation of Net Income.

We also use these non GAAP measures to establish operational goals and for measuring performance for compensation purposes. However, analysis of results on a non GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, and not as a replacement for, data presented in accordance with GAAP.We believe that the presentation of non GAAP measures, including non GAAP net income and non GAAP net income per diluted share, provides important supplemental information to management and investors about financial and business trends relating to our operating results. We believe that the use of these non GAAP financial measures also provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports. We have historically used these non GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations. Externally, we believe that these non GAAP measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and their valuation of the company. 41Table of ContentsInternally, these non GAAP measures are significant measures used by us for purposes of: evaluating the core operating performance of the company;establishing internal budgets; setting and determining variable compensation levels;calculating return on investment for development programs and growth initiatives;comparing performance with internal forecasts and targeted business models;strategic planning; andbenchmarking performance externally against our competitors.We exclude the following items from our non GAAP measures: Share based Compensation Expense. These expenses consist primarily of expenses for employee stock options, employee restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan. Although share based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees and executives, we exclude share based compensation expenses from our non GAAP measures primarily because they are non cash expenses that we do not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. Further, we believe that it is useful to exclude share based compensation expense for investors to better understand the long term performance of our core business and to facilitate comparison of our results to those of our peer companies. Amortization of Acquisition related Intangible Assets. We incur amortization of intangible assets in connection with acquisitions. Since we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, we exclude these items in order to present a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods. Convertible Debt Interest. This is the non cash economic interest expense relating to the implied value of the equity conversion component of the convertible debt and the change in fair value of the liability component of the convertible debt due to the repurchase of a portion of the 1% Notes due 2013. The value of the equity conversion component is treated as a debt discount and amortized to interest expense over the life of the notes using the effective interest rate method. We exclude this non cash interest expense as it does not represent the semi annual cash interest payments made to our note holders. We also exclude the change in fair value of the liability component upon the convertible debt repurchase as it does not represent a cash expense.Income Tax Adjustments. This amount is used to present each of the amounts described above on an after tax basis, considering jurisdictional tax rates, consistent with the presentation of non GAAP net income. It also represents the amount of tax expense or benefit that we would record, considering jurisdictional tax rates, if we did not have any valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that we may exclude if we believe that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management.Limitations of Relying on Non GAAP Financial Measures. We have incurred and will incur in the future, many of the costs excluded from the non GAAP measures, including share based compensation expense, impairment of goodwill and acquisition related intangible assets, amortization of acquisition related intangible assets and other acquisition related costs, convertible debt interest expense and income tax adjustments. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non GAAP measures may be different than the non GAAP measures used by other companies.42Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesCash Flows. Our cash flows were as follows: FY 2011 Percent Change FY 2010 Percent Change FY 2009 (In millions, except percentages)Net cash provided by operating activities$1,053.7 (27%) $1,451.9 198 % $487.8Net cash used in investing activities(667.0) 75 % (2,714.6) (624%) (374.8)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities(47.1) (105%) 985.2 4,614 % 20.9Effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on cash(1.3) (121%) 6.3 43 % 4.4Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$338.3 225 % $(271.2) (296%) $138.3Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities is generated by net income adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. The decrease in cash provided by operations in fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 resulted primarily from higher inventory and other working capital increases. Inventory increased primarily due to the growth in our business and the production ramp at Flash Forward, which began production in the third quarter of fiscal year 2011. Cash flow from accounts receivable decreased, as reflected by higher accounts receivable levels in fiscal year 2011 compared with the prior year, due to increased revenue in fiscal year 2011. Cash flow from other assets decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to a decrease in tax related receivables compared to the prior year and a prepayment to Flash Forward. Accounts payable trade increased primarily due to the timing of payments and an increase in volume as compared to the prior year, resulting in an increase in cash provided. Cash flow from other liabilities in fiscal year 2011 decreased as compared to the prior year primarily as a result of lower accrued payroll and related expenses.The increase in cash provided by operations in fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009 resulted primarily from higher net income of $1.30 billion compared with net income of $415 million in the prior year. Cash flow from accounts receivable decreased, as reflected by higher accounts receivable levels in fiscal year 2010 compared with the prior year, due to increased revenue in fiscal year 2010. Cash flow from inventory increased primarily due to a reduction in inventory from increased product sales. Cash flow from other assets decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in tax related receivables in fiscal year 2010 and a tax refund received in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. Accounts payable trade and accounts payable from related parties increased primarily due to the timing of Flash Ventures payments as compared to the prior year, resulting in an increase in cash provided. Cash flow from other liabilities in fiscal year 2010 increased as compared to the prior year primarily as a result of increased accrued payroll and related expenses. Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2011 was primarily related to the Pliant acquisition of ($318) million, acquisition of property and equipment of ($193) million, purchases of technology and other assets of ($100) million and net loans and investments made to Flash Ventures of ($66) million. In fiscal year 2010, net cash used in investing activities was primarily related to a net purchase of short and long term marketable securities of ($2.6) billion and the acquisition of property and equipment of ($108) million, offset by net loans and investments made to Flash Ventures of ($0.1) million and $18 million related to the sale of the net assets of our SIM business. Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2011, as compared to cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year 2010, was primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of our 1.5% Notes due 2017 and related warrants and convertible bond hedge in August 2010, the repurchase of a portion of our 1% Notes due 2013 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 and lower cash from employee stock programs in fiscal year 2011.The fiscal year 2010 net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the net proceeds from the issuance of our 1.5% Notes due 2017 and related warrants and convertible bond hedge in August 2010 of $878 million, higher cash received from employee stock programs and the excess tax benefit from share based compensation, offset by the redemption of our 1% Convertible Notes due 2035 of ($75) million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. 43Table of ContentsLiquid Assets. At January 1, 2012, we had cash, cash equivalents and short term marketable securities of $2.85 billion. We have $2.77 billion of long term marketable securities which we believe are also liquid assets, but are classified as long term marketable securities due to the remaining maturity of each marketable security being greater than one year.Short Term Liquidity. As of January 1, 2012, our working capital balance was $3.26 billion. During fiscal year 2012, we expect our portion of capital investments in Flash Ventures plus our investment in non fab property, plant and equipment to be between $1.1 billion and $1.6 billion, of which we expect approximately $400 million to $500 million will be funded through our cash, which includes providing loans and investments to the Flash Ventures. The remaining portion will be funded through the working capital of Flash Ventures and equipment leases of Flash Ventures.Depending on the demand for our products, we may decide to make additional investments, which could be substantial, in wafer fabrication foundry capacity and assembly and test manufacturing equipment to support our business. We have completed an acquisition in February 2012 and we may also make equity investments in other companies, engage in additional merger or acquisition transactions, or purchase or license technologies. These activities may require us to raise additional financing, which could be difficult to obtain, and which if not obtained in satisfactory amounts, could prevent us from funding Flash Ventures, increasing our wafer supply, developing or enhancing our products, taking advantage of future opportunities, engaging in investments in or acquisitions of companies, growing our business, responding to competitive pressures or unanticipated industry changes, any of which could harm our business.Our short term liquidity is impacted in part by our ability to maintain compliance with covenants in the outstanding Flash Ventures master lease agreements. The Flash Ventures master lease agreements contain customary covenants for Japanese lease facilities as well as an acceleration clause for certain events of default related to us as guarantor, including, among other things, our failure to maintain a minimum shareholder equity of at least $1.51 billion, and our failure to maintain a minimum corporate rating of BB from S&P or Moodys, or a minimum corporate rating of BB+ from R&I. As of January 1, 2012, Flash Ventures was in compliance with all of its master lease covenants. As of January 1, 2012, our R&I credit rating was BBB, three notches above the required minimum corporate rating threshold for R&I; and our S&P credit rating was BB, one notch above the required minimum corporate rating threshold for S&P. If our shareholders equity falls below $1.51 billion, or both S&P and R&I were to downgrade our credit rating below the minimum corporate rating threshold, or other events of default occur, Flash Ventures would become non compliant with certain covenants under certain master equipment lease agreements and would be required to negotiate a resolution to the non compliance to avoid acceleration of the obligations under such agreements. Such resolution could include, among other things, supplementary security to be supplied by us, as guarantor, or increased interest rates or waiver fees, should the lessors decide they need additional collateral or financial consideration under the circumstances. If a resolution was unsuccessful, we could be required to pay a portion or up to the entire $731.7 million outstanding lease obligations covered by our guarantees under such Flash Ventures master lease agreements, based upon the exchange rate at January 1, 2012, which would negatively impact our short term liquidity.As of January 1, 2012, the amount of cash and cash equivalents and short and long term marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was $649 million. We provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the earnings are considered indefinitely invested outside of the U.S. As of January 1, 2012, no provision had been made for U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on $362 million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries since we intend to indefinitely reinvest these earnings outside the U.S. We determined that the calculation of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these cumulative unremitted earnings was not practicable. If these earnings were distributed to the U.S., we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes reduced by available foreign tax credits.In October 2011, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which we may acquire up to $500 million of our outstanding common stock over a period of up to five years. Under this program, share purchases may be made from time to time in both the open market and privately negotiated transactions, and may include the use of derivative contracts, structured share repurchase agreements and Rule 10b5 1 trading plans. The stock repurchase program does not obligate us to purchase any particular amount of shares and the plan may be suspended at our discretion. 44Table of ContentsLong Term Requirements. Depending on the demand for our products, we may decide to make additional investments, which could be substantial, in wafer fabrication foundry capacity and assembly and test manufacturing equipment to support our business. We may also make equity investments in other companies, engage in merger or acquisition transactions, or purchase or license technologies. These activities may require us to raise additional financing, which could be difficult to obtain, and which if not obtained in satisfactory amounts, could prevent us from funding Flash Ventures, increasing our wafer supply, developing or enhancing our products, taking advantage of future opportunities, engaging in investments in or acquisitions of companies, growing our business, responding to competitive pressures or unanticipated industry changes, any of which could harm our business. Financing Arrangements. At January 1, 2012, we had $928.1 million aggregate principal amount of 1% Notes due 2013 outstanding and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.5% Notes due 2017 outstanding. In the year ended January 1, 2012, we repurchased $221.9 million principal amount of the 1% Notes due 2013 in private transactions with a limited number of bondholders for $211.1 million in cash. See Note 7, Financing Arrangements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. Concurrent with the issuance of the 1% Notes due 2013, we sold warrants to acquire shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $95.03 per share. As of January 1, 2012, the warrants had an expected life of approximately 1.6 years and expire on 20 different dates from August 23, 2013 through September 20, 2013. At expiration, we may, at our option, elect to settle the warrants on a net share basis. In addition, concurrent with the issuance of the 1% Notes due 2013, we entered into a convertible bond hedge in which counterparties agreed to sell to us up to approximately 14.0 million shares of our common stock, which is the number of shares initially issuable upon conversion of the 1% Notes due 2013 in full, at a conversion price of $82.36 per share. During fiscal year 2011, concurrent with the repurchase of a portion of the outstanding 1% Notes due 2013, we unwound a pro rata portion of the convertible bond hedge and warrants and received net proceeds of $0.3 million from this unwinding, which was recorded in equity. We may now purchase up to 11.3 million shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $82.36 per share. As of January 1, 2012, none of the remaining warrants had been exercised nor had we purchased any shares under the remaining convertible bond hedge. The convertible bond hedge will be settled in net shares and will terminate upon the earlier of the maturity date of the 1% Notes due 2013 or the first day that none of the 1% Notes due 2013 remain outstanding due to conversion or otherwise. Settlement of the convertible bond hedge in net shares on the expiration date would result in us receiving net shares equivalent to the number of shares issuable by us upon conversion of the 1% Notes due 2013. Concurrent with the issuance of the 1.5% Notes due 2017, we sold warrants to acquire shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $73.33 per share. As of January 1, 2012, the warrants had an expected life of approximately 6.0 years and expire on 40 different dates from November 13, 2017 through January 10, 2018. At each expiration date, we may, at our option, elect to settle the warrants on a net share basis. As of January 1, 2012, the warrants had not been exercised and remained outstanding. In addition, concurrent with the issuance of the 1.5% Notes due 2017, we entered into a convertible bond hedge transaction in which counterparties agreed to sell to us up to approximately 19.1 million shares of our common stock, which is the number of shares initially issuable upon conversion of the 1.5% Notes due 2017 in full, at a conversion price of $52.37 per share. The convertible bond hedge transaction will be settled in net shares and will terminate upon the earlier of the maturity date of the 1.5% Notes due 2017 or the first day none of the 1.5% Notes due 2017 remains outstanding due to conversion or otherwise. Settlement of the convertible bond hedge in net shares, based on the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the 1.5% Notes due 2017, on the expiration date would result in us receiving net shares equivalent to the number of shares issuable by us upon conversion of the 1.5% Notes due 2017. As of January 1, 2012, we had not purchased any shares under this convertible bond hedge agreement.Ventures with Toshiba. We are a 49.9% owner in each entity within Flash Ventures, our business ventures with Toshiba to develop and manufacture NAND flash memory products. These NAND flash memory products are manufactured by Toshiba at its Yokkaichi, Japan operations using the semiconductor manufacturing equipment owned or leased by these ventures. This equipment is funded or will be funded by investments in or loans to the Flash Ventures from us and Toshiba as well as through operating leases received by Flash Ventures from third party banks and guaranteed by us and Toshiba. Flash Ventures purchase wafers from Toshiba at cost and then resell those wafers to us and Toshiba at cost plus a markup. We are contractually obligated to purchase half of Flash Ventures NAND wafer supply or pay for 50% of the fixed costs of Flash Ventures. We are not able to estimate our total wafer purchase obligations beyond our rolling three month purchase commitment because the price is determined by reference to the future cost to produce the wafers. 45Table of ContentsIn the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, the Phase 1 building shell construction of Fab 5 was completed and initial NAND production began at Flash Forward. As of January 2012, Phase 1 of Fab 5 was approximately 30% equipped and we have invested in 50% of that capacity. No commitment has yet been made for further Phase 1 capacity expansion; however, we are periodically reviewing the timeline of further Phase 1 capacity expansion. Furthermore, no timelines have been finalized for the construction of Phase 2. If and when Phase 2 is built, we are committed to 50% of the initial ramp in Phase 2, similar to that in Phase 1. On completion of Phase 2, Fab 5 is expected to be of similar size and capacity to Toshibas Fab 4. We and Toshiba will each retain some flexibility as to the extent and timing of each partys respective fab capacity ramps, and the output allocation will be in accordance with each partys proportionate level of equipment funding. See Note 12, Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.The cost of the wafers we purchase from these ventures is recorded in inventory and ultimately cost of product revenues. These ventures are variable interest entities; however, we are not the primary beneficiary of these ventures because we do not have a controlling financial interest in each venture. Accordingly, we account for our investments under the equity method and do not consolidate.Under Flash Ventures agreements, we agreed to share in Toshibas costs associated with NAND product development and our common semiconductor research and development activities. We and Toshiba each pay the cost of our own design teams and 50% of the wafer processing and similar costs associated with this direct design and development of flash memory. In our fiscal year 2009, we and Toshiba restructured Flash Partners and Flash Alliance by selling more than 20% of the capacity of each of the two ventures to Toshiba. The restructuring resulted in us receiving value of 79.3 billion Japanese yen of which 26.1 billion Japanese yen, or $277 million, was received in cash, reducing outstanding notes receivable from Flash Ventures and 53.2 billion Japanese yen of value reflected the transfer of off balance sheet equipment lease guarantee obligations from us to Toshiba. The restructuring was completed in a series of closings beginning in January 2009 and extending through March 31, 2009. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2009, transaction costs of $10.9 million related to the sale and transfer of equipment and lease obligations were expensed. In fiscal year 2011, we made a $62 million prepayment for Flash Forward building related costs. As of January 1, 2012, $50 million was remaining, of which $21 million was classified as Other current assets and $29 million was classified as Other non current assets.For semiconductor manufacturing equipment that is leased by Flash Ventures, we and Toshiba jointly guarantee on an unsecured and several basis, 50% of the outstanding Flash Ventures lease obligations under original master lease agreements entered into from March 2007 through November 2011 and refinanced master lease agreements entered into from April 2010 through November 2011. These master lease obligations are denominated in Japanese yen and are noncancelable. Our total master lease obligation guarantee as of January 1, 2012 was 56.5 billion Japanese yen, or approximately $732 million based upon the exchange rate at January 1, 2012.From time to time, we and Toshiba mutually approve the purchase of equipment for the ventures in order to convert to new process technologies or add wafer capacity. Flash Partners has previously reached full wafer capacity. Flash Alliance reached full wafer capacity in the first quarter of fiscal year 2011. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsOur contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements at January 1, 2012, and the effect those contractual obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow over the next five years are presented in textual and tabular format in Note 12, Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.46Table of ContentsImpact of Currency Exchange RatesExchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our most significant foreign currency exposure is to the Japanese yen in which we purchase the vast majority of our NAND flash wafers. In addition, we also have significant costs denominated in the Chinese yuan and the Israeli new shekel, and we have revenue denominated in the European euro, the British pound and the Canadian dollar. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. We use foreign currency forward and cross currency swap contracts to mitigate transaction gains and losses generated by certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We use foreign currency forward contracts and options to partially hedge our future Japanese yen costs for NAND flash wafers. Our derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in assets or liabilities with final gains or losses recorded in other income (expense) or as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, or OCI, and subsequently reclassified into cost of product revenues in the same period or periods in which the cost of product revenues is recognized. These foreign currency exchange exposures may change over time as our business and business practices evolve, and they could harm our financial results and cash flows. See Note 4, Derivatives and Hedging Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.For a discussion of foreign operating risks and foreign currency risks, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.47Table of ContentsITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. As of January 1, 2012, a hypothetical 50 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $30.5 million decline (less than 0.68%) of the fair value of our available for sale debt securities.Foreign Currency Risk. The majority of our revenues are transacted in the U.S. dollar, with some revenues transacted in the European euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen and the Canadian dollar. Our flash memory costs, which represent the largest portion of our cost of product revenues, are denominated in the Japanese yen. We also have some cost of product revenues denominated in the Chinese yuan. The majority of our operating expenses are denominated in the U.S. dollar; however, we have expenses denominated in the Israeli new shekel and numerous other currencies. On the balance sheet, we have numerous foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities; with the largest monetary exposure being our notes receivable from Flash Ventures which are denominated in Japanese yen.We enter into foreign currency forward and cross currency swap contracts to hedge the gains or losses generated by the remeasurement of our significant foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The fair value of these contracts is reflected as other assets or other liabilities and the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income (expense) to largely offset the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities which is also recorded in other income (expense).We use foreign currency forward contracts to partially hedge future Japanese yen flash memory costs. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the contracts gains or losses included in accumulated OCI and subsequently recognized in cost of product revenues in the same period the hedged cost of product revenues is recognized.At January 1, 2012, we had foreign currency forward contracts and cross currency swap contracts in place that amounted to a purchase in U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $155.2 million in foreign currencies to hedge our foreign currency denominated monetary net liability position over the next twelve months. At January 1, 2012, we had foreign currency forward contracts and cross currency swap contracts in place that amounted to a sale in U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately ($213.8) million in foreign currencies to hedge our foreign currency denominated monetary net asset position beyond the next twelve months. The notional amount and unrealized gain or loss of our outstanding cross currency swap and foreign currency forward contracts that are non designated (balance sheet hedges) as of January 1, 2012 is shown in the table below. In addition, this table shows the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedges assuming a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent. These changes in fair values would be largely offset in other income (expense) by corresponding changes in the fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. Notional Amount Unrealized Gain (Loss) as of January 1, 2012 Change in Fair Value Due to 10% Adverse Rate Movement (In millions)Balance sheet hedges: Cross currency swap contracts sold$(390.0) $(40.6) $(41.9)Cross currency swap contracts purchased168.4 1.3 18.6Forward contracts sold(177.7) 1.6 (18.8)Forward contracts purchased340.7 1.3 37.4Total net outstanding contracts$(58.6) $(36.4) $(4.7)48Table of ContentsAt January 1, 2012, we had foreign currency forward in place that amounted to a net purchase in U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $1.3 billion to partially hedge our expected future wafer purchases in Japanese yen. The maturities of these contracts were 12 months or less. The notional amount and fair value of our outstanding forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges as of January 1, 2012 is shown in the table below. In addition, this table shows the change in fair value of these cash flow hedges assuming a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent. Notional Amount Fair Value as of January 1, 2012 Change in Fair Value Due to 10% Adverse Rate Movement (In millions)Cash flow hedges: Forward contracts purchased$1,335.1 $11.6 $(119.2)Notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign exchange risks, we do not hedge all of our foreign currency exposures, and there can be no assurances that our mitigating activities related to the exposures that we hedge will adequately protect us against risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations.Market Risk. The S&P downgrade of U.S. long term sovereign credit rating and the risk of additional future downgrades or related downgrades by any recognized credit rating agency could reduce the investment choices for our cash and marketable securities portfolio, which could negatively impact our non operating results. We do not have direct ownership of European sovereign debt in our investment portfolio. Sales to Europe accounted for approximately 12% of our total revenues in fiscal year 2011, and any significant uncertainties in the European financial markets could impact our revenues and financial condition.All of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial position at January 1, 2012. Actual results may differ materially.49Table of Contents
