Properties Portfolio Properties Our Properties primarily consist of regional malls and community shopping centers. Regional malls generally contain two or more anchors and a wide variety of smaller stores ("Mall" stores) located in enclosed malls connecting the anchors. Additional stores ("Freestanding" stores) are usually located along the perimeter of the parking area. Our 166 regional malls range in size from approximately 300,000 to 2.8 million square feet of GLA, with all but four regional malls over 400,000 square feet. Our regional malls contain in the aggregate more than 17,000 occupied stores, including over 650 anchors which are mostly national retailers. As of December 31, 2001, regional malls (including specialty retail centers and retail space in the mixed use Properties) represented 84.8% of total GLA, 79.3% of Owned GLA and 86.4% of total annualized base rent of the Properties. Community shopping centers are generally unenclosed and smaller than regional malls. Most of our 72 community shopping centers in the Properties range in size from approximately 50,000 to 600,000 square feet of GLA. Community shopping centers generally are of two types. First, we own traditional community centers that focus primarily on value oriented and convenience goods and services. These centers are usually anchored by a supermarket, drugstore or discount retailer and are designed to service a neighborhood area. Second, we own "power centers" that are designed to serve a larger trade area and contain at least two anchors that are usually national retailers among the leaders in their markets and occupy more than 70% of the GLA in the center. As of December 31, 2001, community shopping centers represented 9.1% of total GLA, 10.8% of Owned GLA and 6.0% of the total annualized base rent of the Properties. We also have interests in five specialty retail centers, four office and mixed use Properties and five value oriented super regional malls. The specialty retail centers contain approximately 1,843,000 square feet of GLA and do not have anchors. These properties feature retailers and entertainment facilities in a distinctive shopping environment and location. The four office and mixed use Properties range in size from approximately 512,000 to 1,030,000 square feet of GLA. Two of these Properties are regional malls with connected office buildings, and two are located in mixed use developments and contain primarily office space. The value oriented super regional malls range in size from approximately 1.0 million to 1.6 million square feet of GLA. These Properties combine retail outlets, manufacturers off price stores and other value oriented tenants. As of December 31, 2001, value oriented super regional malls represented 3.5% of total GLA, 5.8% of Owned GLA and 5.4% of the total annualized base rent of the Properties. As of December 31, 2001, approximately 91.9% of the Mall and Freestanding Owned GLA in regional malls, specialty retail centers and the retail space in the mixed use Properties was leased, approximately 93.7% of the Owned GLA in the value oriented super regional malls was leased, and approximately 89.3% of Owned GLA in the community shopping centers was leased. Of our 252 Properties, we own 100% of 171 of the Properties and the remainder we hold as joint venture interests. We are the managing or co managing general partner or member of all but 15 of the Properties held as joint venture interests. 9   Additional Information The following table sets forth certain information, as of December 31, 2001, regarding the Properties: Name/Location Ownership Interest (Expiration if Lease) (1) Our Percentage Interest (2) Type (3) Year Built or Acquired Total GLA Retail Anchors REGIONAL MALLS 1.

Paired Shares are acquired pursuant to the Plan at a price equal to the prevailing market price of such Paired Shares, without payment of any brokerage commission or service charge. Shareholders who do not participate in the Plan continue to receive cash dividends, as declared.
