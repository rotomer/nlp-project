Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation The following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company should be read in conjunction with the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes in Item 8 of this Report. Background We were incorporated in March 1989. We provide regulated medical waste collection, transportation and treatment services to our customers and related training and education programs and consulting services. We also sell ancillary supplies and transport pharmaceuticals, photographic chemicals, lead foil and amalgam for recycling in selected geographic service areas. We are also expanding into international markets through joint ventures or by licensing our proprietary technology and selling associated equipment. Our revenues have increased from $1.6 million in 1991 to $359.0 million in 2001. We derive our revenues from services to two principal types of customers: (i) outpatient clinics, medical and dental offices, biomedical companies, municipal entities, long term and sub acute care facilities and other smaller quantity generators of regulated medical waste ("small account" customers) and (ii) hospitals, blood banks, pharmaceutical manufacturers and other larger quantity generators of regulated medical waste ("large account" customers). Substantially all of our services are provided pursuant to customer contracts specifying either scheduled or on call regulated medical waste management services, or both. Contracts with small account customers generally provide for annual price increases and have an automatic renewal provision unless the customer notifies us prior to completion of the contract. Contracts with hospitals and other large account customers, which may run for more than one year, typically include price escalator provisions, which allow for price increases generally tied to an inflation index or set at a fixed percentage. As of December 31, 2001, we served over 269,000 customers. Critical Accounting Policies and Procedures Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements). We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements), the following may involve a higher degree of judgment on our part and complexity of reporting. Accounts Receivable. Accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to us from our normal business activities. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected uncollectibility of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified among uncollected accounts. No single customer accounts for more than 1% of our revenues. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue at the time of medical waste collection. Revenue and costs on contracts to supply our proprietary treatment equipment are accounted for by the percentage of completion method, whereby income is recognized based on the estimated stage of completion of the individual contract using the cost to cost method. We routinely review total estimated costs to complete each contract and revise the estimated gross margin on the contract as necessary. Payments received in advance are deferred and recognized over the related service period. Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets. Goodwill associated with the excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and other identifiable intangible assets, such as assembled workforce and covenants not to compete, are currently amortized on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives. These assets are currently reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements). Insurance. Our insurance for workers compensation, vehicle liability and physical damage, and employee related health care benefits are covered using high deductible insurance polices. A third party administrator is used to process all such claims. We require all workers compensation claims to be reported within 24 hours. As a result, we accrue our workers compensation liability based upon the claim reserves established by the third party administrator each month. Our employee health insurance benefit liability is based on our historical claims experience rate. To the extent actual claims vary from historical experience, our earnings would be impacted. We review our accruals associated with the exposure to these liabilities for adequacy at the end of each reporting period. Year Ended December 31, 2001 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2000 The following summarizes (in thousands) our operations: Year Ended December 31, 2001 2000 Revenues....................................... $ 359,024 100.0% $ 323,722 100.0% Cost of revenues............................... 215,959 60.2% 196,345 60.7% Gross profit................................... 143,065 39.8% 127,377 39.3% Selling, general and administrative............ 66,086 18.4% 59,457 18.4% Income from operations before acquisition related costs and write offs..... 76,979 21.4% 67,920 21.0% Acquisition related costs...................... 356 0.1% 4,454 1.4% Write off fixed assets......................... 3,329 0.9% Income from operations......................... 73,294 20.4% 63,466 19.6% Income before income taxes and extraordinary item............................. 22,019 6.1% 14,511 4.5% Extraordinary item debt financing, net of tax. (7,309) 2.0% Net income..................................... 14,710 4.1% 14,511 4.5% Depreciation and amortization.................. 25,234 7.0% 23,469 7.2% EBITDA......................................... $ 97,395 27.1% $ 86,512 26.7% Earnings per share Diluted before extraordinary item............................. $ 1.04 $ 0.72 Extraordinary item debt refinancing............ (0.34) Earnings per share diluted.................... $ 0.70 $ 0.72 Revenues. Our revenues increased $35.3 million, or 10.9%, to $359.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2001 from $323.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2000 as we continued to focus on sales to higher margin small account customers while simultaneously paring specified higher revenue but lower margin accounts with large account customers. Revenues generated from the sale of machinery and licensing of technology internationally were $7.7 million during 2001 as compared to $7.2 million during 2000. During 2001, acquisitions contributed approximately $6.9 million to the increase in our revenues from 2000. For the year, internal growth for small account customers increased approximately 9.0% while revenues from large account customers increased by approximately 4.8%. Cost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues increased $19.7 million or 10.0%, to $216.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2001, from $196.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase was primarily due to the increase in revenues during 2001 compared to 2000 and to the increase in cost of equipment sold internationally. Our gross margin percentage increased to 39.8% during 2001 from 39.3% during 2000 as we increased utilization of treatment capacity, had lower costs relating to the changing mix of small account versus large account customers and had reduced energy costs, which were offset by higher insurance costs. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $66.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2001, from $59.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2000. This increase was primarily a result of increased marketing expenses related to the Steri SafeSM program and higher insurance costs. Bad debt expense increased during 2001 to $1.8 million from $1.6 million in 2000. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue remained constant at 18.4% during 2001 as compared to 2000. Excluding amortization, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue increased to 14.5% during 2001 from 14.1% during 2000. Acquisition related costs. During the year ended December 31, 2001 we incurred integration and other non recurring acquisition costs of $0.4 million as compared to $4.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2000. These costs included severance and facility closure costs, other non recurring acquisition related costs, and transition related expenses. We anticipate that we will incur an additional $0.5 million in acquisition related expenses during the year ended December 31, 2002. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased to $73.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2001 from $63.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase was due to higher revenues and lower acquisition related costs, offset by higher costs of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses and the write off of fixed assets related to our 3CI subsidiary during the period. Income from operations as a percentage of revenue increased to 20.4% during the year ended December 31, 2001 from 19.6% during the same period in 2000 as a result of productivity improvements and the factors described above. EBITDA. EBITDA increased by 12.6% to $97.4 million or 27.1% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001, as compared to $86.5 million or 26.7% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase in EBITDA is primarily due to the factors described above. Interest Expense and Interest Income. Interest expense decreased to $35.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2001, from $39.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2000, primarily due to lower debt levels and lower interest rates during the year. Interest income decreased to $0.4 million during 2001, from $0.6 million during 2000, primarily due lower cash balances and lower interest rates throughout the year. Income tax expense. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 40.0% for federal and state income taxes. Extraordinary Item. During the year ended December 31, 2001 we refinanced our senior credit facility and successfully completed an offering of 1,025,000 shares of common stock. The net proceeds of the offering were used to repay $43.8 million of senior subordinated notes. As a result, we incurred certain one time cash and non cash pre tax charges as follows (in thousands): Cash Non Cash Total Redemption premium upon prepayment of senior subordinated notes............... $ 5,416 $ $ 5,416 Senior credit facility refinancing fees....... 957 957 Accelerated amortization of finance fees associated with senior subordinated notes.. 1,451 1,451 Accelerated amortization of finance fees associated with bank debt financing... 4,408 4,408 $ 6,373 $ 5,859 $ 12,232 Year Ended December 31, 2000 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1999 The following summarizes (in thousands) our operations: Year Ended December 31, 2000 1999 Revenues....................................... $ 323,722 100.0% $ 132,848 100.0% Cost of revenues............................... 196,345 60.7% 86,123 64.8% Gross profit................................... 127,377 39.3% 46,725 35.2% Selling, general and administrative............ 59,457 18.4% 26,480 19.9% Income from operations before acquisition related costs.................... 67,920 21.0% 20,245 15.2% Acquisition related costs...................... 4,454 1.4% 7,961 6.0% Income from operations......................... 63,466 19.6% 12,284 9.2% Net income..................................... 14,511 4.5% 13,968 10.5% Depreciation and amortization.................. 23,469 7.2% 9,879 7.4% EBITDA......................................... $ 86,512 26.7% $ 22,728 17.1% Earnings per share diluted.................... $ 0.72 $ 0.92 Revenues. Our revenues increased $190.9 million, or 143.7%, to $323.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2000 from $132.8 million during the year ended December 31, 1999 as we had a full year of revenues from our acquisition of BFIs medical waste business in November 1999 and we continued to focus on sales to higher margin small account customers while simultaneously paring specified higher revenue but lower margin accounts with large account customers. Revenues generated from the sale of machinery and licensing of technology internationally were $7.2 million during 2000 as compared to $6.6 million during 1999. During 2000, acquisitions contributed approximately $180.0 million to the increase in our revenues from 1999. For the year, internal growth for small account customers increased approximately 8.0% while revenues from large account customers increased by approximately 3.5%. Cost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues increased $110.2 million or 128.0%, to $196.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2000, from $86.1 million during the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase was primarily due to the substantial increase in revenues during 2000 compared to 1999 and to the cost of equipment sold internationally. Our gross margin percentage increased to 39.3% during 2000 from 35.2% during 1999 as a result of the further integration of the BFI medical waste business into our existing infrastructure, lower costs relating to the changing mix of small account versus large account customers, higher gross margins on international equipment sales, and increased utilization of treatment capacity. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $59.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2000, from $26.5 million during the year ended December 31,1999. This increase was largely the result of increases in selling and marketing expenses and goodwill amortization as a result of the BFI acquisition. Bad debt expense increased during 2000 to $1.6 million from $0.8 million in 1999 as a result of increased sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 18.4% during 2000 from 19.9% during 1999. Excluding amortization, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue decreased to 14.1% during 2000 from 16.7% during 1999. Acquisition related costs. During the year ended December 31, 2000 we incurred integration and other non recurring acquisition costs of $4.5 million related to the BFI acquisition as compared to $8.0 million during the year ended December 31, 1999. These costs included severance and facility closure costs, other non recurring acquisition related costs, and transition related expenses. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased to $63.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2000 from $12.3 million during the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase was due to higher revenues and lower acquisition related costs, offset by higher costs of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses during the period. Income from operations as a percentage of revenue increased to 19.6% during the year ended December 31, 2000 from 9.2% during the same period in 1999 as a result of productivity improvements and lower acquisition related costs relative to the BFI acquisition. EBITDA. EBITDA increased by 280.6% to $86.5 million or 26.7% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000, as compared to $22.7 million or 17.1% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase in EBITDA is primarily due to the factors described above. Interest Expense and Interest Income. Interest expense increased to $39.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2000, from $6.2 million during the year ended December 31, 1999, primarily due to increased borrowings for the BFI acquisition. Interest income decreased to $0.6 million during 2000, from $1.1 million during 1999, primarily due lower cash balances throughout the year. Income tax expense. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2000 reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 39.1% for federal and state income taxes. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 1999 reflects a one time tax benefit of $6.3 million recorded in compliance with FASB 109. Liquidity and Capital Resources In November 1999, we completed the acquisition of BFIs medical waste business in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. Prior to our acquisition, BFI had been the largest provider of regulated medical waste services in the United States, with revenues of $201.7 million for the 12 months ended June 30, 1999. The purchase price for the acquisition was $410.5 million in cash. We paid the purchase price from the following sources, in addition to cash on hand: (i) $225.0 million in borrowings under the term loan facilities of a new senior secured credit facility that we established with DLJ Capital Funding, Inc. and affiliate of Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation, Bankers Trust Company and Bank of America, N.A.; (ii) $125.0 million in proceeds from the sale of our 12 3/8% senior subordinated notes due November 2009; (iii) $75.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of new Series A convertible preferred stock to certain investment funds associated with Bain Capital, LLC and Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC. These transactions were completed concurrently with the completion of our acquisition of BFIs medical waste business. As a result we are a substantially leveraged company. We also recorded a substantial increase in goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the BFI acquisition, and we have experienced a corresponding large increase in amortization expense. On October 10, 2001, we refinanced our senior secured credit facility to increase our revolving credit facility and extend its maturity, reallocate the term loan A and B components of the facility and extend their maturities, and reduce the interest rates that we are charged. Under the amendment and restatement of our existing credit agreement, we increased our revolving credit facility from $50.0 million to $80.0 million and extended its maturity from November 11, 2005 to September 30, 2006. We also reallocated the term loan components of the credit facility, increasing the lower interest Term A component form $75.0 million to $100.0 million and extending its maturity from November 11, 2005 to September 30, 2006, and reducing the higher interest Term B component from $150.0 million to $75.0 million and extending its maturity from November 10, 2006 to September 30, 2007. Both term loans will be repaid in quarterly installments on the last business day of March, June, September, and December beginning on January 1, 2002. The refinancing of our senior secured credit facility reduces the interest rates that we are charged by reducing the applicable margin added to the relevant interest rate. Our borrowings continue to bear interest at fluctuating interest rates determined, at our election in advance for any quarterly or other applicable interest period, by reference to (i) a "base rate" (the higher of the reference rate at Bank of America, N.A. or 0.5% above the rate on overnight federal funds transactions) or (ii) the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus, in either case, the applicable margin within the relevant range of margins provided in the credit agreement. The applicable margin is based upon our leverage ratio. At December 31, 2001 the margin for interest rates on borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the Term A component is 0.75% on base rate loans and 1.75% on LIBOR loans, and the margin for interest rates on borrowings under the Term B component is 1.50% on base rate loans and 2.50% on LIBOR loans. Our amended and restated credit facility is secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets and all of the assets of our subsidiaries (except for the assets of 3CI) and by a pledge of all of the stock of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, all of our stock in 3CI and Medam, and 65% of our stock in Med Tech. The amended and restated credit facility also requires us to comply with various financial, reporting and other covenants and restrictions, including a restriction on dividend payments. As of December 31, 2001, we had $190.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our senior secured credit facility. Dividends on our Series A convertible preferred stock are payable in kind in additional shares of convertible preferred stock and accrue at the annual rate of 3.375%, subject to adjustment. At December 31, 2001, our working capital was $34.6 million compared to working capital of $47.9 million at December 31, 2000. The decrease in working capital is primarily due to lower account receivable and higher accrued liability balances. As noted, we have available a $80.0 million revolving line of credit under our senior secured credit facility which is secured by our accounts receivable and all of our other assets. At December 31, 2001 we had $15.0 million borrowed under this line. Net cash provided by operating activities was $64.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $10.5 million for the comparable period in 2000. This increase primarily reflects better collections of accounts receivable in 2001 compared to 2000 and higher accrued liability and deferred revenue balances, and higher depreciation and amortization expenses partially offset by a lower accounts payable balance and higher other asset balances. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $36.7 million compared to $15.6 million for the comparable period in 2000. This increase is primarily attributable to the increase in capital expenditures and investments in international joint ventures. Capital expenditures were $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, primarily for upgrades to our incinerator treatment facilities, compared to $11.6 million for the same period in 2000. This rate of capital spending is within the 4 5% of revenues that we anticipated spending during 2001. After the upgrades are completed we will have 15 20% of our treatment capacity in incineration and 80 85% in non incineration technologies such as our proprietary ETD technology and autoclaving. Investments in acquisitions and international joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2001 were $21.3 million versus $4.5 million in the comparable period in 2000. Net cash used in financing activities was $17.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $11.5 million for the comparable period in 2000. In November 2001 we completed a public offering of 1,025,000 shares of common stock. We received proceeds of $49.0 million from the offering, net of offering expenses. We used the proceeds to repay 35% or $43.8 million of our senior subordinated notes due November 2009 and an additional $5.4 million prepayment premium. During 2001 we made repayments of $38.6 million in debt and capital leases which consisted of $5.2 million in scheduled repayments and $33.4 million in prepayments. Our other financial obligations include industrial development revenue bonds issued on behalf of and guaranteed by us to finance our Woonsocket, Rhode Island treatment facility and equipment. These bonds which had an outstanding balance of $0.8 million as of December 31, 2001 at a fixed interest rate of 6.5% are due June 2017. In addition, we have issued various promissory notes in connection with acquisitions during 1997, 1998, and 2000, consisting primarily of a 10 year note issued as a part of the Environmental Control Co., Inc. acquisition, which had an outstanding balance of $1.4 million at December 31, 2001. The table below displays our future contractual cash commitments. Payments due by period (in thousands) Less than After Total 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years 5 years Long term debt .............................. $ 276,279 $ 11,656 $ 38,047 $ 57,110 $ 169,466 Capital lease obligations.................... 3,719 1,013 1,552 990 164 Operating leases............................. 45,311 12,541 19,910 9,241 3,619 Total contractual cash obligations........... $ 325,309 $ 25,210 $ 59,509 $ 67,341 $ 173,249 We anticipate that our operating cash flow, together with borrowings under our senior secured credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated future operating expenses, capital expenditures and debt service obligations as they become due and for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations, and No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Under the new rules, goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statements. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. We will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of 2002. Application of the nonamortization provisions of the statements is expected to result in an increase in net income of $6.8 million ($0.32 per diluted share) per year. During 2002, we will perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of January 1, 2002, but we have not yet determined what the effect of these tests will be on our earnings and financial position. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are subject to market risks arising from changes in interest rates on our senior secured credit facility. Our interest rate exposure results from changes in LIBOR or the base rate which are used to determine the applicable interest rates under our term loans and revolving credit facility. Our potential loss over one year that would result from a hypothetical, instantaneous and unfavorable change of 100 basis points in the interest rate on all of our variable rate obligations would be approximately $0.2 million. Fluctuations in interest rates will not affect the interest payable on our senior subordinated notes, which is fixed. We have entered into interest rate swap/collar agreements that effectively convert a portion of our floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis for the next two years, thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense. Approximately 92% ($175 million) of our outstanding variable rate debt was covered by interest rate swap/collar agreements at December 31, 2001. The differential to be paid or received is accrued monthly as an adjustment to interest expense.
