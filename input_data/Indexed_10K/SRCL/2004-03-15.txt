Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation The following discussion our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8 of this Report. Introduction We are the largest provider of regulated medical waste services in North America. In addition we offer OSHA compliance services for health care providers and will be introducing several new services during 2004, including software for hospitals to monitor accreditation readiness. 19 Table of Contents We derive our medical waste revenues from services to two principal types of customers: (i) outpatient clinics, medical and dental offices, biomedical companies, municipal entities, long term and sub acute care facilities and other smaller quantity generators of regulated medical waste (small account customers) and (ii) hospitals, blood banks, pharmaceutical manufacturers and other larger quantity generators of regulated medical waste (large account customers). Substantially all of our medical waste services are provided pursuant to customer contracts specifying either scheduled or on call services, or both. Contracts with small account customers generally provide for annual price increases and have an automatic renewal provision unless the customer notifies us to the contrary prior to the expiration of the current term of the contract. Contracts with hospitals and other large account customers, which may run for more than one year, typically include price escalator provisions, which allow for price increases generally tied to an inflation index or set at a fixed percentage. As of December 31, 2003, we served approximately 301,000 customers, of which approximately 295,500 were small account customers and approximately 5,500 were large account customers. Critical Accounting Policies and Procedures Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities (see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements). We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements), the following ones may involve a higher degree of judgment on our part and greater complexity of reporting. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue for our medical waste services at the time of medical waste collection. Revenue and costs on contracts to supply our proprietary ETD treatment equipment are accounted for by the percentage of completion method, whereby income is recognized based on the estimated stage of completion of the individual contract using the cost to cost method. We routinely review total estimated costs to complete each contract and revise the estimated gross margin on the contract as necessary. Payments received in advance are deferred and recognized as services are provided. Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets. Goodwill associated with the excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired is not currently amortized. We have determined that our permits have indefinite lives and, accordingly, are not amortized. This position is in accordance with Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, which became effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Our goodwill and permits are currently tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. Other identifiable intangible assets, such as customer lists and covenants not to compete, are currently amortized on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives. We have determined that our customer lists have 40 year lives. These assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may be less than the undiscounted cash flows (see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements). Accounts Receivable. Accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to us from our normal business activities. Accounts receivable balances are determined to be delinquent when the amount is past due based on the contractual terms with the customer. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected uncollectibility of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified among uncollected accounts. Accounts receivable are charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts when we have determined that the receivable will not be collected and or when the account has been referred to a third party collection agency. No single customer accounts for more than 2% of our revenues. 20 Table of Contents Insurance. Our insurance for workers compensation, vehicle liability and physical damage, and employee related health care benefits is obtained using high deductible insurance polices. A third party administrator is used to process all such claims. We require all workers compensation claims to be reported within 24 hours. As a result, we accrue our workers compensation liability based upon the claim reserves established by the third party administrator at the end of each reporting period. Our employee health insurance benefit liability is based on our historical claims experience rate. Our earnings would be impacted to the extent that actual claims vary from historical experience. We review our accruals associated with the exposure to these liabilities for adequacy at the end of each quarter. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 The following summarizes (in thousands) our operations: Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 Revenues $ 453,225 100.0 % $ 401,519 100.0 % Cost of revenues 243,170 53.7 % 225,056 56.1 % Depreciation 13,430 3.0 % 11,954 3.0 % Total cost of revenues 256,600 56.6 % 237,010 59.0 % Gross profit 196,625 43.4 % 164,509 41.0 % Selling, general and administrative 65,733 14.5 % 57,375 14.3 % Depreciation 1,975 0.4 % 1,057 0.3 % Amortization 1,850 0.4 % 1,970 0.5 % Acquisition related costs 670 0.1 % 362 0.1 % Total selling, general and administrative expenses 70,228 15.5 % 60,764 15.1 % Write off fixed assets 2,913 0.7 % Income from operations 126,397 27.9 % 100,832 25.1 % Net income $ 65,781 14.5 % $ 45,724 11.4 % Earnings per share diluted $ 1.43 $ 1.01 Revenues. Our revenues increased $51.7 million, or 12.9%, to $453.2 million during 2003 from $401.5 million during 2002 as we continued to focus our medical waste services on sales to higher margin small account customers. Revenues generated from the sale of ETD equipment and licensing of technology internationally were $2.8 million during 2003, compared to $6.4 million during 2002. During 2003, acquisitions less than one year old contributed approximately $40.0 million to the increase in our revenues from 2002. For the year, internal growth for small account customers increased approximately 9.5% while revenues from large account customers decreased by approximately 2.5% because of our winnowing of lower margin accounts. During 2003, the size of the regulated medical waste market in the United States remained relatively stable. Through our acquisition in January of Scherer Healthcare, Inc. and its BioSystems sharps management program, we were able to expand our service offerings. The Scherer Healthcare acquisition contributed $20.6 million of the approximately $40.0 million in acquisition revenue during 2003. Cost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues increased $19.6 million or 8.3%, to $256.6 million during 2003, from $237.0 million during 2002. The increase was primarily related to the increase in revenues during 2003 compared to 2002. Our gross margin percentage increased to 43.4% during 2003 from 41.0% during 2002 as we realized improvements from our continuous programs to improve margins on our large quantity business, increased our number of small quantity customers electing our Steri SafeSM program from 50,000 to 70,000 and improved our transportation productivity by increasing route density. These improvements to our gross margins were partially offset by an increase in employee benefit costs, which increased by 1.3 percentage points as a 21 Table of Contents percentage of compensation costs as the cost of healthcare claims increased. This increase resulted in the evaluation of our employee healthcare programs and changes to our third party administrators and providers, in an effort to manage future cost increases. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $70.2 million during 2003, from $60.8 million during 2002. This increase was primarily the result of increased spending as a result of the Scherer Healthcare acquisition, marketing our Steri SafeSM program and starting the national rollout of the BioSystems sharps management program. In addition, as noted in the cost of revenues discussion above, employee benefit costs as a percentage of compensation costs increased by 1.3 percentage points. Amortization decreased to $1.9 million during 2003, from $2.0 million during 2002. Acquisition related costs increased to $0.7 million in 2003 from $0.4 million in 2002. Bad debt expense decreased during 2003 to $2.0 million from $3.4 million in 2002. This decrease was the result of improved collections and decreased write offs during 2003. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 15.5% during 2003 compared to 15.1% in 2002. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased to $126.4 million during 2003 from $100.8 million during 2002. The increase was due to higher revenues, offset by higher costs of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2002 we had a non cash write down of idled incinerator equipment and related spare parts in the amount of $2.9 million. Income from operations as a percentage of revenue increased to 27.9% during 2003 from 25.1% during 2002 as a result of the factors described above. Interest Expense and Interest Income. Interest expense decreased to $12.8 million during 2003, from $21.5 million during 2002, primarily due to lower debt levels and lower interest rates during the year. Interest income increased to $0.6 million during 2003 compared to $0.4 million in 2002 as a result of higher interest income on notes receivable. Debt Extinguishments and Refinancing Expenses. During 2003 we repurchased $17.8 million of senior subordinated notes compared to a repurchase of $12.6 million in 2002. As a result in 2003, we incurred $2.8 million in redemption premium expenses and $0.5 million in non cash accelerated amortization of financing fees associated with the repurchase of the senior subordinated notes compared to $1.8 million and $0.4 million, respectively, in 2002. In addition, we amended our bank credit facility agreement in 2002 and paid $0.2 million in financing fees. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense for the years 2003 and 2002 reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 39.5% for federal and state income taxes. 22 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2001 The following summarizes (in thousands) our operations: Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 Revenues $ 401,519 100.0 % $ 359,024 100.0 % Cost of revenues 225,056 56.1 % 205,873 57.3 % Depreciation 11,954 3.0 % 10,086 2.8 % Total cost of revenues 237,010 59.0 % 215,959 60.2 % Gross profit 164,509 41.0 % 143,065 39.8 % Selling, general and administrative 57,375 14.3 % 50,938 14.2 % Depreciation 1,057 0.3 % 1,271 0.4 % Amortization 1,970 0.5 % 13,877 3.9 % Acquisition related costs 362 0.1 % 356 0.1 % Total selling, general and administrative expenses 60,764 15.1 % 66,442 18.5 % Write off fixed assets 2,913 0.7 % 3,329 0.9 % Income from operations 100,832 25.1 % 73,294 20.4 % Net income $ 45,724 11.4 % $ 14,710 4.1 % Earnings per share diluted $ 1.01 $ 0.35 Revenues. Our revenues increased $42.5 million, or 11.8%, to $401.5 million during 2002 from $359.0 million during 2001 as we continued to focus our medical waste services on sales to higher margin small account customers. Revenues generated from the sale of ETD equipment and licensing of technology internationally were $6.4 million during 2002 as compared to $7.7 million during 2001. During 2002, acquisitions less than one year old contributed approximately $18.2 million to the increase in our revenues from 2001. For the year, internal growth for small account customers increased approximately 10.2% while revenues from large account customers increased by approximately 5.2%. The internal growth was fueled by an increasing number of current and new customers selecting our Steri SafeSM program and increased revenues from our large customers. Cost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues increased $21.1 million or 9.7%, to $237.0 million during 2002, from $216.0 million during 2001. The increase was primarily related to the increase in revenues during 2002 compared to 2001. Our gross margin percentage increased to 41.0% during 2002 from 39.8% during 2001 as we improved our margins on our large account business and increased our number of small account customers selecting our Steri SafeSM program to 50,000. This increase was partially offset by a 1.3% increase in insurance, energy and employee benefit costs as a percentage of cost of revenue during 2002. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $60.8 million during 2002 from $66.4 million during 2001. This decrease was primarily a result of decreased amortization expense as a result of adopting FAS 142, which was partially offset by higher bad debt and legal expenses, increased marketing expenses related to the Steri SafeSM program and higher insurance costs. Amortization decreased to $2.0 million during 2002 from $13.9 million during 2001 as a result of the adoption of FAS 142. Bad debt expense increased during 2002 to $3.4 million from $1.8 million in 2001 because of an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts after an evaluation of the collectibility of our outstanding accounts receivable. Legal expenses increased during 2002 to $2.1 million from $0.7 million in 2001 as a result of the lawsuits in Arizona and Utah. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 15.1% during 2002 compared to 18.5% in 2001. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased to $100.8 million during 2002 from $73.3 million during 2001. The increase was due to higher revenues combined with lower amortization expense, which 23 Table of Contents was partially offset by higher costs of revenues. During 2002 we had a non cash write down of incinerator equipment and related spare parts in the amount of $2.9 million compared to a $3.3 million non cash write down of treatment fixed assets related to our 3CI subsidiary during 2001. Income from operations as a percentage of revenue increased to 25.1% during 2002 from 20.4% during the same period in 2001 as a result of the factors described above. Interest Expense and Interest Income. Interest expense decreased to $21.5 million during 2002, from $35.4 million during 2001, primarily due to lower debt levels and lower interest rates during the year. Interest income remained constant at $0.4 million during 2002 and 2001. Debt Extinguishment and Refinancing expenses. During 2002 we repurchased $12.6 million of senior subordinated notes. As a result we incurred $1.8 million in redemption premium expenses and $0.4 million in non cash accelerated amortization of financing fees associated with the repurchase of the senior subordinated notes. In addition, we amended our senior credit facility in 2002 and paid $0.2 million in financing fees. During 2001 we refinanced our senior credit facility and successfully completed an offering of 2,050,000 shares of common stock. The net proceeds were used to repay $43.8 million in senior subordinated notes. As a result, we paid $1.0 million in refinancing fees and $5.4 million in redemption premium expenses and incurred $4.4 million in non cash accelerated amortization of financing fees associated with the senior credit facility and $1.4 million in accelerated amortization of financing fees associated with the senior subordinated notes. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense for 2002 and 2001 reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 39.5% and 40.0%, respectively, for federal and state income taxes. Liquidity and Capital Resources In January 2003, we amended our senior secured credit facility to increase our borrowing capacity by $51.0 million by reclassifying borrowings under our revolving credit facility to Term A loans. As amended, the credit facility consists of a $105 million revolving credit facility, a $112.6 million Term A loan facility and a $47.2 million Term B loan facility. Our borrowings bear interest at fluctuating interest rates determined, at our election in advance for any quarterly or other applicable interest period, by reference to (i) a base rate (the higher of the reference rate at Bank of America, N.A. or 0.5% above the rate on overnight federal funds transactions) or (ii) the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus, in either case, the applicable margin within the relevant range of margins provided in the credit agreement. The applicable margin is based upon our leverage ratio. At December 31, 2003 the margin for interest rates on borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the Term A component is 0.0% on base rate loans and 1.25% on LIBOR loans, and the margin for interest rates on borrowings under the Term B component is 0.75% on base rate loans and 2.25% on LIBOR rate loans. Under the credit agreement as amended in January 2003, we extended the maturity of the revolving credit component and the Term A loan component to September 2007 and extended the maturity of the Term B component to September 2008. Both term loans are repayable in quarterly installments on the last business day of March, June, September and December beginning in 2003. The required principal repayments under the Term A loan component are $5.0 million on each quarterly payment date through June 2007, with a final payment of the outstanding principal balance upon maturity in September 2007. The required principal payments under the Term B loan component are $0.2 million on each quarterly payment date through June 2008, with a final payment of the outstanding balance upon maturity in September 2008. Our amended and restated credit facility is secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets and all of the assets of our subsidiaries (except for the assets of 3CI) and by a pledge of all of the stock of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, all of our stock in 3CI, all of our stock in our Mexican subsidiary and 65% of our stock in our Canadian subsidiary. The amended and restated credit facility also requires us to comply with various 24 Table of Contents financial, reporting and other covenants and restrictions, including a restriction on dividend payments. At December 31, 2003, our material financial debt covenants were as follows: The permitted minimum leverage ratio is 3.00:1.00. As of December 31, 2003, our actual leverage ratio was 1.15:1.00. The permitted minimum fixed charge coverage ratio is 1.10:1.00. As of December 31, 2003, our actual fixed charge coverage ratio was 1.49:1.00. The minimum amount of net worth allowed at December 31, 2003, as defined by the credit agreement, is $346.2 million. As of December 31, 2003, our actual net worth was $428.8 million. As of December 31, 2003, we had $109.7 million of borrowings outstanding under our senior secured credit facility, consisting of $20.0 million under our revolving credit facility, $62.4 million under our Term A loan facility and $27.3 under the Term B loan facility. Prior to June 1, 2002, the Series A convertible preferred stock bore preferential dividends, payable in additional shares of Series A convertible preferred stock, at the rate of 3.375% per annum from the date of issuance. Dividends accrued daily and accumulated annually on the anniversary of the initial issuance. In July 2002, we entered into a waiver and amendment agreement with the holders of Series A convertible preferred stock pursuant to which they agreed that, among other things, the 3.375% payment in kind dividends ceased to accrue after May 31, 2002. Working Capital. At December 31, 2003, our working capital was $27.3 million compared to working capital of $40.6 million at December 31, 2002. The decrease in working capital is primarily due to higher accrued insurance and employee compensation liabilities and lower accounts receivable. We have a high deductible insurance program and our accrued liability increases as we add an additional year of exposure to the balance. As noted, we have available a $105.0 million revolving line of credit under our senior secured credit facility and at December 31, 2003 had borrowed $20.0 million under this line. Net Cash Provided or Used. Net cash provided by operating activities was $121.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to $96.9 million for 2002. This increase primarily reflects higher revenues and income, higher accrued liability and deferred income tax balances and better collections of accounts receivable in 2003 compared to 2002, partially offset by increased other asset balances. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2003 included a $10.0 million tax benefit from disqualifying dispositions of stock acquired upon the exercise of incentive stock options. Net cash used in investing activities for 2003 was $57.6 million compared to $49.5 million for 2002. This increase is primarily attributable to the increase in payments for capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were $21.0 million for 2003, primarily for investments in capital equipment to support a nationwide rollout of the BioSystems sharps management program and other improvements in our infrastructure, compared to $14.8 million for in 2002. As of December 31, 2003 we had approximately 12% of our treatment capacity in incineration and approximately 88% in non incineration technologies such as our proprietary ETD technology and autoclaving. The implementation of our commitment to move away from incineration may result in a write down of the incineration equipment as and when we close incinerators that we are currently operating. Our commitment to move away from incineration is in the nature of a goal to be accomplished over an undetermined number of years. Because of uncertainties relating, among other things, to customer education and acceptance and legal requirements to incinerate portions of the medical waste, we do not have a timetable for this transition or specific plans to close any of our existing incinerators. Cash investments in acquisitions and international joint ventures for 2003 were $37.2 million compared to $34.6 million in 2002. Our largest acquisition in 2003 was Scherer Healthcare, Inc. for $30.2 million in net cash. Net cash used in financing activities was $64.0 million during 2003 compared to $51.9 million for in 2002. During 2003 we made repayments of $62.1 million in debt and capital leases which consisted of $26.3 million in 25 Table of Contents scheduled repayments and $35.8 million in prepayments. Included in prepayments was $17.8 million in repurchases of our 12 3/8% senior subordinated notes. In addition, at December 31, 2003 we had $2.6 million outstanding related to promissory notes issued in connection with acquisitions during 2000 and 2002, consisting primarily of a 2 year note issued as part of the Micro Med Industries, Inc. acquisition, which had an outstanding balance of $2.3 million at December 31, 2003. Senior Subordinated Notes. At December 31, 2003, we had $50.9 million in principal amount of our senior subordinated notes outstanding. These notes bear a fixed rate of interest at 12 3/8% per annum, payable semiannually, and will mature on November 15, 2009. Under the trust indenture governing the notes, we have the right, beginning on November 15, 2004, to redeem all or any portion of the outstanding notes at a redemption price equal to varying percentages of the aggregate principal amount of note redeemed, plus accrued interest to the redemption date. For redemptions during the year beginning November 15, 2004, the redemption percentage is 106.1875%. Contractual Cash Commitments. The following table displays our future contractual cash commitments. Total Less than 1 year 13 years 45 years After 5 years Payments due by period (in thousands) Long term debt $ 165,288 $ 3,797 $ 83,321 $ 78,170 $ Capital lease obligations 2,889 1,159 1,695 35 Purchasing obligations 1,089 1,089 Operating leases 51,858 15,995 27,189 5,904 2,770 Total contractual cash obligations $ 221,124 $ 22,040 $ 112,205 $ 84,109 $ 2,770 We have not issued any guarantees to other parties that are not recorded on our balance sheet. At December 31, 2003 we had $12.6 million in stand by letters of credit issued. We anticipate that our operating cash flow, together with borrowings under our senior secured credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated future operating expenses, capital expenditures and debt service obligations as they become due during the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. Risk Factors We are subject to extensive governmental regulation with which it is frequently difficult, expensive and time consuming to comply. The medical waste management industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the collection, transportation, packaging, labeling, handling, documentation, reporting, treatment and disposal of regulated medical waste. Our business requires us to obtain many permits, authorizations, approvals, certificates or other types of governmental permission from every jurisdiction where we operate. We believe that we currently comply in all material respects with all applicable permitting requirements. State and local regulations change often, however, and new regulations are frequently adopted. Changes in the applicable regulations could require us to obtain new permits or to change the way in which we operate. We might be unable to obtain the new permits that we require, and the cost of compliance with new or changed regulations could be significant. The permits that we require, especially those to build and operate treatment plants and transfer facilities, are difficult and time consuming to obtain. They may also contain conditions or restrictions that limit our ability to operate efficiently, and they may not be issued as quickly as we need (or at all). If we cannot obtain the permits that we need when we need them, or if they contain unfavorable conditions, it could substantially impair our operations and reduce our revenues. 26 Table of Contents The handling and treatment of hazardous medical waste carries with it the risk of personal injury to employees and others. Our business requires us to handle materials that may be infectious, poisonous, corrosive or dangerous to life and property in other ways. While we strive to handle such materials with care and in accordance with accepted and safe methods, the possibility of accidents, leaks, spills, and acts of God always exists. Examples of how people and property may be exposed to such materials include: truck accidents; damaged or leaking containers; improper storage of medical waste by customers; vandalism, arson or sabotage; placement by customers of materials into the waste stream that we are not authorized or able to process, such as nuclear waste and certain body parts and tissues; or malfunctioning treatment plant equipment. Human beings, animals or property might be injured, sickened or damaged by exposure to medical waste. This in turn could result in lawsuits in which we are found liable for such injuries, and substantial damages could be awarded against us. While we carry liability insurance intended to cover these contingencies, particular instances, claims, damages or events may occur that are not insured against or are inadequately insured against. An uninsured or underinsured loss could be substantial and could impair our profitability and reduce our liquidity. The handling of medical waste exposes us to the risk of environmental liabilities, which may not be covered by insurance. As a company engaged in medical waste management, we face risks of liability for environmental contamination. The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA, and similar state laws impose strict liability on current or former owners and operators of facilities that release hazardous substances into the environment as well as on the businesses that generate those substances and the businesses that transport them to the facilities. Responsible parties may be liable for substantial investigation and clean up costs even if they operated their businesses properly and complied with applicable federal and state laws and regulations. Liability under CERCLA may be joint and several, which means that if we were found to be a business with responsibility for a particular CERCLA site, we could be required to pay the entire cost of the investigation and clean up even though we were not the party responsible for the release of the hazardous substance and even though other companies might also be liable. Our pollution liability insurance excludes liabilities under CERCLA. Thus, if we were to incur liability under CERCLA and if we could not identify other parties responsible under the law whom we can compel to contribute to our expenses, the cost to us could be substantial and could impair our profitability and reduce our liquidity. Our customer service agreements make it clear that the customer is responsible for making sure that only appropriate materials are disposed of. If there were a claim that a customer might be legally liable for, we may not be successful in recovering our damages. The level of governmental enforcement of environmental regulations has an uncertain effect on our business and could reduce the demand for our services. We believe that the governments strict enforcement of laws and regulations relating to medical waste collection and treatment has been good for our business. These laws and regulations increased the demand for our services. A relaxation of standards or other changes in governmental regulation of medical waste, such as: encouraging the use of landfills without prior treatment of medical waste; 27 Table of Contents removing obstacles to the use of incineration and autoclaving, thus allowing the continued use of existing on site incinerators by medical waste generators without having to incur additional compliance costs; or reducing manpower and money used to enforce environmental regulations favorable to our operations; could increase the number of competitors or reduce the need for our services. We may be required to pay fines and penalties for violations of environmental regulations or our permits. From time to time we are subject to governmental proceedings to enforce regulations relating to the handling and treatment of medical waste. We have had to pay fines and penalties and to undertake remedial work at our facilities. We may be subject to similar proceedings in the future. Government enforcement actions also may be initiated against us based on claims that we are violating our permits. Such proceedings could distract management attention from our business operations and any resulting fines or shutdowns could reduce our profitability. If we are unable to acquire other medical waste businesses, our revenue and profit growth may be slowed. Historically our growth strategy has been based in part on our ability to acquire other medical waste businesses. We do not know whether in the future we will be able to: identify suitable businesses to buy; complete the purchase of those businesses on terms acceptable to us; improve the operations of the businesses that we buy and successfully integrate their operations into our own; or avoid or overcome any concerns expressed by regulators. We compete with other potential buyers for the acquisition of other medical waste companies. This competition may result in fewer opportunities to purchase companies that are for sale. It may also result in higher purchase prices for the businesses that we want to purchase. In addition, we cannot be certain that we will: have enough money; be able to borrow enough money on reasonable terms; be able to issue stock or debt instruments (like promissory notes) as consideration for the purchase; or be able to raise enough money by issuing stock or through other financing methods; to complete the purchases of the businesses that we want to acquire. We also do not know whether our growth strategy will continue to be effective. Our business is significantly larger than before, and new acquisitions may not have the desired benefits that we have expected in the past. The implementation of our acquisition strategy could be affected in certain instances by the concerns of state regulators, which could result in our not being able to realize the full synergies or profitability of particular acquisitions. We may become subject to inquiries and investigations by state antitrust regulators from time to time in the course of completing acquisitions of other medical waste businesses. In order to obtain regulatory clearance for a particular acquisition, we could be required to modify certain operating practices of the acquired business or to divest ourselves of one or more assets of the acquired business. Changes in the terms of our acquisitions required 28 Table of Contents by regulators or agreed to by us in order to settle regulatory investigations could impede our acquisition strategy or reduce the anticipated synergies or profitability of our acquisitions. The likelihood and outcome of inquiries and investigations from state regulators in the course of completing acquisitions cannot be predicted. Aggressive pricing by existing competitors and the entrance of new competitors could drive down our profits and slow our growth. The medical waste industry is very competitive. This has required us in the past to reduce our prices, especially to large account customers, and competition may require us to reduce our prices in the future. Substantial price reductions could significantly reduce our earnings. We face important competition from a large number of small, local competitors. Because it requires very little money or technical know how to compete with us in the collection and transport of medical waste, there are many regional and local companies in the industry. We face competition from these businesses and that competition may exist in each location to which we try to expand in the future. Our competitors could take actions that would hurt our growth strategy, including the support of regulations that could delay or prevent us from obtaining or keeping permits. They might also give financial support to citizens groups that oppose our plans to locate a treatment or transfer facility at a particular location. Other sources of competition include large waste generators, such as some hospitals, who maintain their own treatment facilities. These and other yet unidentified competitors could prevent us from obtaining new customers and could take existing customers away from us. We require a significant amount of cash to service our substantial indebtedness, which reduces the cash available to finance our internal growth and our acquisition of other medical waste businesses. We have a large amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2003, our total long term indebtedness was $163.0 million, net of current maturities. We had borrowings of $20.0 million under our revolving credit facility, and we had the ability to utilize a further $85.0 million under the facility. We have scheduled debt service payments under our senior credit facility during 2004, 2005 and 2006 of zero, $9.8 million and $20.0 million, respectively. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness, as well as to fund our operations and future growth depends upon our ability to generate cash. Our success in doing so depends upon the results of our operations and upon general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. Our indebtedness could: make us more vulnerable to unfavorable economic conditions; make it more difficult to pursue the acquisition of other medical waste management businesses; and require us to dedicate or reserve a large portion of our cash flow from operations to making payments on our indebtedness, which would prevent us from using it for other purposes. Restrictions in our debt instruments may limit our ability to pay dividends, incur additional debt, make acquisitions and make other investments. Our debt instruments contain covenants that restrict our ability to make distributions to stockholders or other payments unless we satisfy certain financial tests and comply with various financial ratios. If we do not do so, our creditors could declare a default under our debt instruments, and our indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable. Our ability to comply with the provisions of our debt instruments may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions beyond our control. Our debt instruments also contain covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, acquire other businesses and make capital expenditures, and impose various other restrictions. These covenants could 29 Table of Contents affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. The loss of our senior executives could affect our ability to manage our business profitably. We depend on a small number of senior executives. Our future success will depend, among other things, upon our ability to keep these executives and to hire other highly qualified employees at all levels. We compete with other potential employers for employees, and we may not be successful in hiring and keeping the executives and other employees that we need. We do not have written employment agreements with our President and Chief Executive Officer or other executive officers, and officers and other key employees could leave us with little or no prior notice, either individually or as part of a group. Our loss or inability to hire key employees could impair our ability to manage our business and direct its growth. Our expansion into foreign countries exposes us to unfamiliar regulations and may expose us to new obstacles to growth. We plan to grow both in the United States and in foreign countries. We have established operations in Canada, Mexico and Argentina, and South Africa and have entered into ETD equipment sales and licensing agreements in Australia, Brazil and Japan. Foreign operations carry special risks. Although our business in foreign countries has not yet been affected, our business in the countries in which we currently operate and those in which we may operate in the future could be limited or disrupted by: government controls; import and export license requirements; political or economic insecurity; trade restrictions; changes in tariffs and taxes; exchange rate fluctuations; our unfamiliarity with laws, regulations, and customs; restrictions on repatriating foreign profits back to the United States; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations. Foreign governments and agencies often establish permit and regulatory standards different from those in the United States. If we cannot obtain foreign regulatory approvals, or if we cannot get them when we expect, our growth and profitability from international operations could be limited. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates and increases in duty rates for ETD equipment could have similar effects. The competitive advantages of our ETD treatment process and other aspects of our business depend on patents and proprietary rights. We hold 18 United States patents relating to the ETD treatment process and other aspects of processing medical waste. We have filed or have been assigned patent applications in several foreign countries and we have received patents in Australia, Canada, France, Hong Kong, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, South Korea and the United Kingdom. Pending or future patent applications may not be granted, issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages, and our patents may be challenged by other parties. In addition, other companies may develop similar processes or avoid our patents. Litigation or administrative proceedings may be necessary to enforce the patents issued to us or to determine the scope and validity of others proprietary rights. Any litigation 30 Table of Contents or administrative proceeding could result in substantial cost to us and distraction of our management. A ruling against us in any litigation or administrative proceeding could expose us to new competition and depress our earnings. Our commercial success also depends on our not infringing patents issued to other parties. Patents belonging to other parties may require us to alter our processes, pay licensing fees or cease using any current or future processes, and as a result, we may be unable to license the technology rights that we may require at a reasonable cost or at all. If we cannot obtain a license to any infringing technology that we currently use, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. We own registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks. There can be no assurance that our registered or unregistered trademarks or service marks will not infringe upon the rights of other parties. The requirement to change any of our trademarks, service marks or trade names could result in the loss of any goodwill associated with that trademark, service mark or trade name and could entail significant expense. Our earnings could decline if we write off intangible assets, such as goodwill. As a result of purchase accounting for our various acquisitions, our balance sheet at December 31, 2003 contains goodwill, net of accumulated amortization, of $464.9 million and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of $31.6 million (including indefinite lived intangibles of $11.0 million). In accordance with FAS 142, we evaluate on an ongoing basis, using the fair value of reporting units, whether facts and circumstances indicate any impairment of the value of indefinite lived intangible assets such as goodwill. As circumstances after an acquisition can change, the value of these intangible assets may not be realized by us. If we were to determine that a significant impairment has occurred, we would be required to incur noncash write offs of the impaired portion of goodwill and other unamortized intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the write off occurs. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are subject to market risks arising from changes in interest rates on our senior secured credit facility. Our interest rate exposure results from changes in LIBOR or the base rate, which are used to determine the applicable interest rates under our term loans and revolving credit facility. Our potential loss over one year that would result from a hypothetical, instantaneous and unfavorable change of 100 basis points in the interest rate on all of our variable rate obligations would be approximately $1.0 million. Fluctuations in interest rates will not affect the interest payable on our senior subordinated notes, which is fixed. In 2001 we entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted a portion of our floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis for the subsequent two years, thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense. These swaps expired during the first quarter of 2003. At December 31, 2003 none of our floating rate debt was covered by an interest rate swap agreement. We have exposure to commodity pricing for gas and diesel fuel for our trucks. We do not hedge these items to manage the exposure.
