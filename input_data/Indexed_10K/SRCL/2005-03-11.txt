Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8 of this Report. Introduction We are the largest provider of regulated medical waste services in North America. In addition we offer OSHA compliance services to health care providers and other monitoring services. During 2004, we acquired White Rose Environmental Ltd., which is a leading provider of regulated medical waste services in the United Kingdom. We derive our medical waste revenues from services to two principal types of customers: (i) outpatient clinics, medical and dental offices, biomedical companies, municipal entities, long term and sub acute care facilities and other smaller quantity generators of regulated medical waste (small account customers) and (ii) hospitals, blood banks, pharmaceutical manufacturers and other larger quantity generators of regulated medical waste (large account customers). Substantially all of our medical waste services are provided pursuant to customer contracts specifying either scheduled or on call services, or both. Contracts with small account customers generally provide for annual price increases and have an automatic renewal provision unless the customer notifies us to the contrary prior to the expiration of the current term of the contract. Contracts with hospitals and other large account customers, which may run for more than one year, typically include price escalator provisions, which allow for price increases generally tied to an inflation index or set at a fixed percentage. As of December 31, 2004, we served approximately 317,000 customers, of which approximately 310,000 were small account customers and approximately 7,500 were large account customers. Critical Accounting Policies and Procedures Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements), the following ones may involve a higher degree of judgment on our part and greater complexity of reporting. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue for our medical waste services at the time of medical waste collection. Revenue and costs on contracts to supply our proprietary ETD treatment equipment are recognized based on shipment of equipment and services provided for the individual contract. We routinely review total estimated costs and shipments to complete each contract and revise the revenues and estimated gross margin on the contract as necessary. Payments received in advance are deferred and recognized as services are provided. Royalty revenues are calculated based on measurements specified in each contract or license and revenues are recognized at the end of each reporting period when the activity being measured has been completed. Revenues from product sales are recognized at the time the goods are shipped to the ordering customer. We do not have any contracts in a loss position. Losses would be recorded when known and estimable for any contracts that should go into a loss position. Payments received in advance are deferred and recognized as services are provided. Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets. Goodwill associated with the excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired is not currently amortized. We have determined that our permits have indefinite lives and, accordingly are not amortized. This position is in accordance with Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, which became effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. 20 Table of Contents Our balance sheet at December 31, 2004 contains goodwill, net of accumulated amortization, of $516.8 million. In accordance with FAS 142, we evaluate on an annual basis, using the fair value of reporting units, whether facts and circumstances indicate any impairment of the value of our goodwill. If we were to determine that a significant impairment has occurred, we would be required to incur noncash write offs of the impaired portion of goodwill which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the write off occurs. We use the market value of our stock as the current measurement of fair value of our reporting units and any unforeseen material drop in our stock price maybe an indicator of a potential impairment of goodwill. The results of the 2004 impairment test conducted in June 2004 did not show any impairment of goodwill, and there have not occurred any events since that time that indicate that an impairment situation exists. Our permits are currently tested for impairment annually at December 31 or more frequently if circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. We use a discounted cash flow model as the current measurement of the fair value of the permits. The estimate of cash flow is based upon, among other things, certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and an appropriate discount rate determined by management. Our estimates of discounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to, among other things, inaccuracies in economic estimates, and actual cash flow could materially affect the future financial value of the permits. The results of the 2004 impairment test did not show any impairment of our permits and no events have occurred since that time that would indicate an impairment situation exists. Other identifiable intangible assets, such as customer lists and covenants not to compete, are currently amortized on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives. We have determined that our customer lists have 40 year lives. These assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may be less than the undiscounted cash flows. There have been no indicators of impairment of these intangibles (see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements). We have an intangible asset that is an exclusive license to market certain software that is the subject of a breach of contract arbitration and pending resolution of the arbitration. Accounts Receivable. Accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to us from our normal business activities. Accounts receivable balances are determined to be delinquent when the amount is past due based on the contractual terms with the customer. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected uncollectibility of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified among uncollected accounts. Accounts receivable are charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts when we have determined that the receivable will not be collected and or when the account has been referred to a third party collection agency. No single customer accounts for more than 2% of our revenues. Insurance. Our insurance for workers compensation, vehicle liability and physical damage, and employee related health care benefits is obtained using high deductible insurance polices. A third party administrator is used to process all such claims. We require all workers compensation, vehicle liability and physical damage claims to be reported within 24 hours. As a result, we accrue our workers compensation, vehicle and physical damage liability based upon the claim reserves established by the third party administrator at the end of each reporting period. Our employee health insurance benefit liability is based on our historical claims experience rate. Our earnings would be impacted to the extent that actual claims vary from historical experience. We review our accruals associated with the exposure to these liabilities for adequacy at the end of each reporting period. Litigation. We operate in a highly regulated industry and deal with regulatory inquiries or investigations from time to time that may be instituted for a variety of reasons. We are also involved in a variety of civil litigation from time to time. Settlements from litigation would be recorded when known, probable and estimable. Stock Option Plans. We have issued stock options to employees and directors as an integral part of our compensation programs. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States allow alternative methods of accounting for these plans. We have chosen to account for our stock option plans under Accounting Principles 21 Table of Contents Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25). As required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure (FAS 148), calculations of pro forma net income and earnings per share, computed in accordance with the method prescribed by FAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (FAS 123), are set forth in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements. We expect to adopt the provisions of FAS 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payments, (FAS 123R) on July 1, 2005. Among other things, FAS 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim or annual period after June 15, 2005. See Note 2 New Accounting Pronouncements in Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplemental Data for further information. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 The following summarizes (in thousands) our operations: Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 Revenues $ 516,228 100.0% $ 453,225 100.0% Cost of revenues 271,189 52.5% 243,170 53.7% Depreciation 16,833 3.3% 13,430 3.0% Total cost of revenues 288,022 55.8% 256,600 56.6% Gross profit 228,206 44.2% 196,625 43.4% Selling, general and administrative 75,653 14.7% 65,733 14.5% Depreciation 2,540 0.5% 1,975 0.4% Amortization 2,430 0.5% 1,850 0.4% Acquisition related costs 773 0.1% 670 0.1% Total selling, general and administrative expenses 81,396 15.8% 70,228 15.5% Write off fixed assets 1,155 0.2% Income from operations 145,655 28.2% 126,397 27.9% Net income 78,178 15.1% 65,781 14.5% Earnings per share diluted $ 1.69 $ 1.43 Revenues. Our revenues increased $63.0 million, or 13.9%, to $516.2 million in 2004 from $453.2 million in 2003. Revenues generated from the sale of ETD equipment and licensing of technology internationally were $8.2 million during 2004, compared to $2.8 million during 2003. This increase is a result of the delivery of a large portion of an order of ETD equipment to a customer in Japan in 2004. During 2004, acquisitions less than one year old contributed approximately $47.6 million to the increase in our revenues from 2003. For the year, internal growth for small account customers increased approximately 9% while revenues from large quantity customers decreased by approximately 4% because of our program of improving lower margin accounts. This margin improvement program identifies large quantity customers with margins below internally acceptable thresholds and we make adjustments to pricing or service in an effort to improve the margin. These adjustments may result in our not renewing the customer contract and therefore may result in a reduction of revenues. During 2004, the size of the regulated medical waste market in the United States remained relatively stable. Through our acquisition in June of White Rose Environmental Ltd., we were able to expand our geographic presence outside of North America. Cost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues increased $31.4 million or 12.2%, to $288.0 million during 2004, from $256.6 million during 2003. The increase was primarily related to the increase in revenues during 2004 compared to 2003. Our gross margin percentage increased to 44.2% during 2004 from 43.4% during 2003 as we 22 Table of Contents realized improvements from our continuous programs to improve margins on our large quantity business, increased our number of small quantity customers electing our Steri SafeSM program from 70,000 to 87,000 and improved our transportation productivity by increasing route density. During the year fuel prices as a percent of revenue increased by 20%. Employee benefit costs as a percentage of compensation costs decreased by 3.3% in 2004. This was a result of the changes implemented in late 2003 to our employee healthcare programs including changes to our third party administrators and providers. The lower gross margins of White Rose which started consolidating into our financials in June 2004, reduced the gross margin percentage for the consolidated business by 134 basis points in 2004. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $81.4 million during 2004, from $70.2 million during 2003. This increase was primarily the result of increased spending as a result on marketing our Steri SafeSM program and the national rollout of the Bio Systems sharps management program and the acquisition of White Rose in June 2004. Amortization increased to $2.4 million during 2004, from $1.9 million during 2003. Acquisition related costs increased to $0.8 million in 2004 from $0.7 million in 2003. Bad debt expense decreased during 2004 to $0.8 million from $2.0 million in 2003. This decrease was the result of improved collections and decreased write offs during 2004. Legal expenses increased to $5.4 million in 2004 from $3.4 million in 2003 as a result of litigation expense of which, $1.5 million was incurred by our majority owned subsidiary 3CI under the direction of the special committee of its board of directors. In addition, as noted in the cost of revenues discussion above, employee benefit costs as a percentage of compensation costs decreased in 2004. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 15.8% during 2004 compared to 15.5% in 2003. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased to $145.7 million during 2004 from $126.4 million during 2003. The increase was due to higher revenues, offset by higher costs of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2004 we had a non cash write down of idled incinerator equipment and related spare parts in the amount of $1.2 million. Income from operations as a percentage of revenue increased to 28.2% during 2004 from 27.9% during 2003 as a result of the factors described above. Interest Expense and Interest Income. Interest expense decreased to $11.2 million during 2004, from $12.8 million during 2003, primarily due to lower debt levels and lower interest rates during the year. Interest income was $0.6 million during 2004 and 2003. Debt Extinguishments and Refinancing Expenses. During 2004 we repurchased and retired the remaining $50.9 million of our senior subordinated notes compared to a repurchase and retirement of $17.8 million of notes in 2003. As a result, in 2004 we incurred $3.1 million in redemption premium expenses and $1.1 million in non cash accelerated amortization of financing fees associated with the repurchase of the notes compared to $2.8 million and $0.5 million, respectively, in 2003. In addition, we amended our bank credit facility agreement in 2004 and paid $0.3 million in financing fees. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense for the years 2004 and 2003 reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 39.2% and 39.5%, respectively, for federal and state income taxes. 23 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 The following summarizes (in thousands) our operations: Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 Revenues $ 453,225 100.0% $ 401,519 100.0% Cost of revenues 243,170 53.7% 225,056 56.1% Depreciation 13,430 3.0% 11,954 3.0% Total cost of revenues 256,600 56.6% 237,010 59.0% Gross profit 196,625 43.4% 164,509 41.0% Selling, general and administrative 65,733 14.5% 57,375 14.3% Depreciation 1,975 0.4% 1,057 0.3% Amortization 1,850 0.4% 1,970 0.5% Acquisition related costs 670 0.1% 362 0.1% Total selling, general and administrative expenses 70,228 15.5% 60,764 15.1% Write off fixed assets 2,913 0.7% Income from operations 126,397 27.9% 100,832 25.1% Net income 65,781 14.5% 45,724 11.4% Earnings per share diluted $ 1.43 $ 1.01 Revenues. Our revenues increased $51.7 million, or 12.9%, to $453.2 million 2003 from $401.5 million 2002 as we continued to focus our medical waste services on sales to higher margin small account customers. Revenues generated from the sale of ETD equipment and licensing of technology internationally were $2.8 million during 2003, compared to $6.4 million during 2002. During 2003, acquisitions less than one year old contributed approximately $40.0 million to the increase in our revenues from 2002. For the year, internal growth for small account customers increased approximately 9.5% while revenues from large quantity customers decreased by approximately 2.5% because of our program of improving lower margin accounts. This margin improvement program identifies large quantity customers with margins below internally acceptable thresholds and we make adjustments to pricing or service in an effort to improve the margin. These adjustments may result in our not renewing the customer contract and therefore may result in a reduction of revenues. During 2003, the size of the regulated medical waste market in the United States remained relatively stable. Through our acquisition in January of Scherer Healthcare, Inc. and its Bio Systems sharps management program, we were able to expand our service offerings. Cost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues increased $19.6 million or 8.3%, to $256.6 million during 2003, from $237.0 million during 2002. The increase was primarily related to the increase in revenues during 2003 compared to 2002. Our gross margin percentage increased to 43.4% during 2003 from 41.0% during 2002 as we realized improvements from our continuous programs to improve margins on our large quantity business, increased our number of small quantity customers electing our Steri SafeSM program from 50,000 to 70,000 and improved our transportation productivity by increasing route density. These improvements to our gross margins were partially offset by an increase in employee benefit costs, which increased by 1.3 percentage points as a percentage of compensation costs as the cost of healthcare claims increased. This increase resulted in the evaluation of our employee healthcare programs and providers in an effort to manage future cost increases. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $70.2 million during 2003, from $60.8 million during 2002. This increase was primarily the result of increased spending as a result of the Scherer Healthcare acquisition, on marketing our Steri SafeSM program and starting the national rollout of the Bio Systems sharps management program. In addition, as noted in the cost of revenues discussion above, employee benefit costs as a percentage of compensation costs increased in 2003. Amortization 24 Table of Contents decreased to $1.9 million during 2003, from $2.0 million during 2002. Acquisition related costs increased to $0.7 million in 2003 from $0.4 million in 2002. Bad debt expense decreased during 2003 to $2.0 million from $3.4 million in 2002. This decrease was the result of improved collections and decreased write offs during 2003. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 15.5% during 2003 compared to 15.1% in 2002. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased to $126.4 million during 2003 from $100.8 million during 2002. The increase was due to higher revenues, offset by higher costs of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2002 we had a non cash write down of idled incinerator equipment and related spare parts in the amount of $2.9 million. Income from operations as a percentage of revenue increased to 27.9% during 2003 from 25.1% during 2002 as a result of the factors described above. Interest Expense and Interest Income. Interest expense decreased to $12.8 million during 2003, from $21.5 million during 2002, primarily due to lower debt levels and lower interest rates during the year. Interest income increased to $0.6 million during 2003 compared to $0.4 million in 2002 as a result of higher interest income on notes receivable. Debt Extinguishments and Refinancing Expenses. During 2003 we repurchased and retired $17.8 million of our senior subordinated notes compared to a repurchase of $12.6 million of notes in 2002. As a result in 2003, we incurred $2.8 million in redemption premium expenses and $0.5 million in non cash accelerated amortization of financing fees associated with the repurchase of the notes compared to $1.8 million and $0.4 million, respectively, in 2002. In addition, we amended our bank credit facility agreement in 2002 and paid $0.2 million in financing fees. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense for the years 2003 and 2002 reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 39.5% for federal and state income taxes. Liquidity and Capital Resources In June 2004 we amended our credit facility to increase the size of our revolver capacity. As amended, the credit facility consists of a $205 million revolving credit facility and a $112.6 million Term A loan facility and a $47.2 million Term B loan facility. Our borrowings bear interest at fluctuating interest rates determined, at our election in advance for any quarterly or other applicable interest period, by reference to (i) a base rate (the higher of the reference rate at Bank of America, N.A. or 0.5% above the rate on overnight federal funds transactions) or (ii) the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus, in either case, the applicable margin within the relevant range of margins provided in the credit agreement. The applicable margin is based upon our leverage ratio. At December 31, 2004 the margin for interest rates on borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the Term A component is 0.0% on base rate loans and 1.25% on LIBOR loans. Under the credit agreement as amended in January 2003, we extended the maturity of the revolving credit component and the Term A loan component to September 2007 and extended the maturity of the Term B component to September 2008. Both term loans are repayable in quarterly installments on the last business day of March, June, September and December beginning in 2003. The required principal repayments under the Term A loan component are $5.0 million on each quarterly payment date through June 2007, with a final payment of the outstanding principal balance upon maturity in September 2007. The required principal payments under the Term B loan component are $0.2 million on each quarterly payment date through June 2008, with a final payment of the outstanding balance upon maturity in September 2008. In July 2004 we repaid the $27.3 million balance of the Term B loan component and at December 31, 2004 there was nothing outstanding on the Term B loan. Our amended and restated credit facility is secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets and all of the assets of our domestic subsidiaries (except for the assets of 3CI) and by a pledge of all of the stock of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, all of our stock in 3CI and our Mexican subsidiary, and 65% of our stock in our 25 Table of Contents Canadian and United Kingdom subsidiaries. The amended and restated credit facility also requires us to comply with various financial, reporting and other covenants and restrictions, including a restriction on dividend payments. At December 31, 2004, our material financial debt covenants were as follows: The permitted maximum leverage ratio is 3.00:1.00. As of December 31, 2004, our actual leverage ratio was 1.18:1.00. The minimum fixed charge coverage ratio is 1.10:1.00. As of December 31, 2004, our actual fixed charge coverage ratio was 1.48:1.00. The minimum amount of net worth allowed at December 31, 2004, as defined by the credit agreement, is $391.9 million. As of December 31, 2004, our actual net worth was $495.4 million. As of December 31, 2004, we had $171.4 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, consisting of $109.0 million under our revolving credit facility and $62.4 million under our Term A loan facility. Working Capital. At December 31, 2004, our working capital was $32.3 million compared to working capital of $28.7 million at December 31, 2003. As noted, we have available a $205.0 million revolving line of credit under our senior secured credit facility and at December 31, 2004 had borrowed $109.0 million under this line and had an additional $30.9 million committed in letters of credit. Net Cash Provided or Used. Net cash provided by operating activities was $114.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to $123.9 million for 2003. This decrease primarily reflects lower accounts payable and accrued liability balances and a higher accounts receivable balance partially offset by higher revenues and income, higher deferred income tax balances and increased other asset balances. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2004 included a $7.7 million tax benefit from disqualifying dispositions of stock options and exercise of non qualified stock options. Net cash used in investing activities for 2004 was $105.1 million compared to $57.6 million for 2003. This increase is primarily attributable to the increase in payments for acquisitions and capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were $33.3 million for 2004, primarily for investments in capital equipment to support a nationwide rollout of the Bio Systems sharps management program and other improvements in our infrastructure, compared to $21.0 million for in 2003. As of December 31, 2004 we had approximately 10% of our treatment capacity in North America in incineration and approximately 90% in non incineration technologies such as our proprietary ETD technology and autoclaving. The implementation of our commitment to move away from incineration in North America may result in a write down of the incineration equipment as and when we close incinerators that we are currently operating. Our commitment to move away from incineration in North America is in the nature of a goal to be accomplished over an undetermined number of years. Because of uncertainties relating, among other things, to customer education and acceptance and legal requirements to incinerate portions of the medical waste, we do not have a timetable for this transition or specific plans to close any of our existing incinerators. Cash investments in acquisitions and international joint ventures for 2004 were $72.4 million compared to $37.2 million in 2003. The increase was primarily the result of our acquisition of White Rose Environmental Ltd. completed in June 2004. Net cash used in financing activities was $6.9 million during 2004 compared to $66.8 million for in 2003. During 2004 we borrowed money to fund the acquisition of White Rose Environmental Ltd. In addition, we made repayments of $83.6 million in debt and capital leases which consisted of $5.4 million in scheduled repayments and $78.2 million in prepayments. Included in prepayments was $50.9 million in repurchases of our 12 3/8% senior subordinated notes and $27.3 million in prepayments on our Term B loan. In addition, at December 31, 2004 we had $17.5 million outstanding related to promissory notes issued in connection with acquisitions during 2002 and 2004, consisting primarily of a 3 year note issued as part of the White Rose Environmental Ltd. acquisition, which had an outstanding balance of $10.9 million at December 31, 2004. 26 Table of Contents Contractual Cash Commitments. The following table displays our future contractual cash commitments. Total Less than1 year 13 years 45 years After5 years Payments due by period (in thousands) Long term debt* $ 204,972 $ 12,827 $ 181,741 $ 8,591 $ 1,813 Capital lease obligations* 1,732 925 807 Purchasing obligations 1,680 1,137 543 Operating leases 67,387 21,276 35,040 8,667 2,404 Other long term liabilities* 3,867 843 1,868 727 429 Total contractual cash obligations $ 279,638 $ 37,008 $ 219,999 $ 17,985 $ 4,646 * The long term debt, capital lease and other long term liabilities items include both the future principal payment amount as well as an amount calculated for expected future interest payments. For long term debt with variable rates of interest, management used judgment to estimate the future rate of interest. At December 31, 2004 we had $30.9 million in stand by letters of credit issued. We anticipate that our operating cash flow, together with borrowings under our senior secured credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated future operating expenses, capital expenditures and debt service obligations as they become due during the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. Guarantees. We have guaranteed a loan to the Azoroa Bank in Japan on behalf of Shiraishi Sogyo Co. Ltd (Shiraishi). Shiraishi is a customer in Japan that is expanding their medical waste management business and has a five year loan with a current balance of $9.3 million with the Azoroa Bank that expires in June 2009. Management currently believes no amount will be paid under the guarantee. Risk Factors We are subject to extensive governmental regulation which it is frequently difficult, expensive and time consuming to comply with. The medical waste management industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the collection, transportation, packaging, labeling, handling, documentation, reporting, treatment and disposal of regulated medical waste. Our business requires us to obtain many permits, authorizations, approvals, certificates or other types of governmental permission from every jurisdiction where we operate. We believe that we currently comply in all material respects with all applicable permitting requirements. State and local regulations change often, however, and new regulations are frequently adopted. Changes in the regulations could require us to obtain new permits or to change the way in which we operate under existing permits. We might be unable to obtain the new permits that we require, and the cost of compliance with new or changed regulations could be significant. Many of the permits that we require, especially those to build and operate treatment plants and transfer facilities, are difficult and time consuming to obtain. They may also contain conditions or restrictions that limit our ability to operate efficiently, and they may not be issued as quickly as we need them (or at all). If we cannot obtain the permits that we need when we need them, or if they contain unfavorable conditions, it could substantially impair our operations and reduce our revenues. The handling and treatment of hazardous medical waste carries with it the risk of personal injury to employees and others. Our business requires us to handle materials that may be infectious, poisonous, corrosive or dangerous to life and property in other ways. While we strive to handle such materials with care and in accordance with 27 Table of Contents accepted and safe methods, the possibility of accidents, leaks, spills, and acts of God always exists. Examples of possible exposure to such materials include: truck accidents; damaged or leaking containers; improper storage of medical waste by customers; vandalism; improper placement by customers of materials into the waste stream that we are not authorized or able to process, such as certain body parts and tissues; or malfunctioning treatment plant equipment. Human beings, animals or property could be injured, sickened or damaged by exposure to medical waste. This in turn could result in lawsuits in which we are found liable for such injuries, and substantial damages could be awarded against us. While we carry liability insurance intended to cover these contingencies, particular instances may occur that are not insured against or that are inadequately insured against. An uninsured or underinsured loss could be substantial and could impair our profitability and reduce our liquidity. The handling of medical waste exposes us to the risk of environmental liabilities, which may not be covered by insurance. As a company engaged in medical waste management, we face risks of liability for environmental contamination. The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA, and similar state laws impose strict liability on current or former owners and operators of facilities that release hazardous substances into the environment as well as on the businesses that generate those substances and the businesses that transport them to the facilities. Responsible parties may be liable for substantial investigation and clean up costs even if they operated their businesses properly and complied with applicable federal and state laws and regulations. Liability under CERCLA may be joint and several, which means that if we were found to be a business with responsibility for a particular CERCLA site, we could be required to pay the entire cost of the investigation and clean up even though we were not the party responsible for the release of the hazardous substance and even though other companies might also be liable. Our pollution liability insurance excludes liabilities under CERCLA. Thus, if we were to incur liability under CERCLA and if we could not identify other parties responsible under the law whom we are able to compel to contribute to our expenses, the cost to us could be substantial and could impair our profitability and reduce our liquidity. Our customer service agreements make clear that the customer is responsible for making sure that only appropriate materials are disposed of. If there were a claim against us that a customer might be legally liable for, we might not be successful in recovering our damages from the customer. The level of governmental enforcement of environmental regulations has an uncertain effect on our business and could reduce the demand for our services. We believe that the governments strict enforcement of laws and regulations relating to medical waste collection and treatment has been good for our business. These laws and regulations increase the demand for our services. A relaxation of standards or other changes in governmental regulation of medical waste, such as: encouraging the use of landfills without prior treatment of medical waste; removing obstacles to the use of incineration and autoclaving, thus allowing the continued use of existing on site incinerators by medical waste generators without having to incur additional compliance costs; or reducing manpower and money used to enforce environmental regulations favorable to our operations; could increase the number of competitors or reduce the need for our services. 28 Table of Contents We may be required to pay fines and penalties for violations of environmental regulations or our permits. From time to time we are subject to governmental proceedings to enforce regulations relating to the handling and treatment of medical waste. We have had to pay fines and penalties and to undertake remedial work at our facilities. We may be subject to similar proceedings in the future. Government enforcement actions also may be initiated against us based on claims that we are violating our permits. Such proceedings could distract management attention from our business operations and any resulting fines or shutdowns could reduce our profitability. If we are unable to acquire other medical waste businesses, our revenue and profit growth may be slowed. Historically our growth strategy has been based in substantial part on our ability to acquire other medical waste businesses. We do not know whether in the future we will be able to: identify suitable businesses to buy; complete the purchase of those businesses on terms acceptable to us; improve the operations of the businesses that we do buy and successfully integrate their operations into our own; or avoid or overcome any concerns expressed by regulators. We compete with other potential buyers for the acquisition of other medical waste companies. This competition may result in fewer opportunities to purchase companies that are for sale. It may also result in higher purchase prices for the businesses that we want to purchase. In addition, we cannot be certain that we will: have enough money; be able to borrow enough money on reasonable terms; be able to issue stock or debt instruments (like promissory notes) as consideration for the purchase; or be able to raise enough money through various financing methods; to complete the purchases of the businesses that we want to acquire. We also do not know whether our growth strategy will continue to be effective. Our business is significantly larger than before, and new acquisitions may not have the desired benefits that we have obtained in the past. The implementation of our acquisition strategy could be affected in certain instances by the concerns of state regulators, which could result in our not being able to realize the full synergies or profitability of particular acquisitions. We may become subject to inquiries and investigations by state antitrust regulators from time to time in the course of completing acquisitions of other medical waste businesses. In order to obtain regulatory clearance for a particular acquisition, we could be required to modify certain operating practices of the acquired business or to divest ourselves of one or more assets of the acquired business. Changes in the terms of our acquisitions required by regulators or agreed to by us in order to settle regulatory investigations could impede our acquisition strategy or reduce the anticipated synergies or profitability of our acquisitions. The likelihood and outcome of inquiries and investigations from state regulators in the course of completing acquisitions cannot be predicted. 29 Table of Contents Aggressive pricing by existing competitors and the entrance of new competitors could drive down our profits and slow our growth. The medical waste industry is very competitive because of low barriers to entry, among other reasons. This competition has required us in the past to reduce our prices, especially to large account customers, and may require us to reduce our prices in the future. Substantial price reductions could significantly reduce our earnings. We face direct competition from a large number of small, local competitors. Because it requires very little money or technical know how to compete with us in the collection and transportation of medical waste, there are many regional and local companies in the industry. We face competition from these businesses, and competition from them is likely to exist in the new locations to which we may expand in the future. In addition, large national companies with substantial resources may decide to enter the medical waste industry. For example, Waste Management, Inc., a major solid waste treatment company, announced in February 2005 that it intended to begin offering medical waste management services to hospitals and possibly other large quantity generators of medical waste. Our competitors could take actions that would hurt our growth strategy, including the support of regulations that could delay or prevent us from obtaining or keeping permits. They might also give financial support to citizens groups that oppose our plans to locate a treatment or transfer facility at a particular location. Other sources of competition include large waste generators, such as some hospitals, who maintain their own treatment facilities. These and other yet unidentified competitors could prevent us from obtaining new customers and could take existing customers away from us. We require a significant amount of cash to service our substantial indebtedness, which reduces the cash available to finance our internal growth and our acquisition of other medical waste businesses. We have a large amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2004, our total long term indebtedness was $190.4 million, net of current maturities. We had borrowings of $109.0 million under our revolving credit facility, and we had the ability to borrow a further $96.0 million under the facility. We have scheduled debt service payments under our senior credit facility during 2005, 2006 and 2007 of $9.8 million, $20.0 million and $141.6 million, respectively. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness, as well as to fund our operations and future growth depends upon our ability to generate cash. Our success in doing so depends upon the results of our operations and upon general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. Our indebtedness could: make us more vulnerable to unfavorable economic conditions; make it more difficult to pursue the acquisition of other medical waste management businesses; and require us to dedicate or reserve a large portion of our cash flow from operations to making payments on our indebtedness, which would prevent us from using it for other purposes. Restrictions in our debt instruments may limit our ability to pay dividends, incur additional debt, make acquisitions and make other investments. Our debt instruments contain covenants that restrict our ability to make distributions to stockholders or other payments unless we satisfy certain financial tests and comply with various financial ratios. If we do not do so, our creditors could declare a default under our debt instruments, and our indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable. Our ability to comply with the provisions of our debt instruments may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions beyond our control. 30 Table of Contents Our debt instruments also contain covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, acquire other businesses and make capital expenditures, and impose various other restrictions. These covenants could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. The loss of our senior executives could affect our ability to manage our business profitably. We depend on a small number of senior executives. Our future success will depend upon, among other things, our ability to keep these executives and to hire other highly qualified employees at all levels. We compete with other potential employers for employees, and we may not be successful in hiring and keeping the executives and other employees that we need. We do not have written employment agreements with our President and Chief Executive Officer or any of our other executive officers, and officers and other key employees could leave us with little or no prior notice, either individually or as part of a group. Our loss of or inability to hire key employees could impair our ability to manage our business and direct its growth. Our expansion into foreign countries exposes us to unfamiliar regulations and may expose us to new obstacles to growth. We plan to grow both in the United States and in foreign countries. We have established operations in Canada, Mexico and the United Kingdom and have entered into ETD equipment sales and licensing agreements and, in one case, a related joint venture, in Argentina, Australia, Brazil and Japan. Foreign operations carry special risks. Although our business in foreign countries has not yet been affected, our business in the countries in which we currently operate and those in which we may operate in the future could be limited or disrupted by: government controls; import and export license requirements; political or economic insecurity; trade restrictions; changes in tariffs and taxes; exchange rate fluctuations; our unfamiliarity with local laws, regulations, practices and customs; restrictions on repatriating foreign profits back to the United States; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations. Foreign governments and agencies often establish permit and regulatory standards different from those in the United States. If we cannot obtain foreign regulatory approvals, or if we cannot obtain them when we expect, our growth and profitability from international operations could be limited. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates and increases in duty rates for ETD equipment could have similar effects. The competitive advantages of our ETD treatment process and other aspects of our business depend on patents and proprietary rights. We hold 18 United States patents relating to the ETD treatment process and other aspects of processing medical waste. We have filed or have been assigned patent applications in several foreign countries and we have received patents in Australia, Canada, France, Hong Kong, Mexico, Russia, South Africa and the United Kingdom. Pending or future patent applications may not be granted, issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages, and our patents may be challenged by other parties. In addition, other companies may develop similar processes or avoid our patents. Litigation or administrative proceedings may be necessary to enforce the patents issued to us or to determine the scope and validity of others proprietary rights. Any litigation or administrative proceeding could result in substantial cost to us and distraction of our management. A ruling against us in any litigation or administrative proceeding could expose us to new competition and depress our earnings. 31 Table of Contents Our commercial success also depends on our not infringing patents issued to other parties. Patents belonging to other parties may require us to alter our processes, pay licensing fees or cease using any current or future processes, and as a result, we may be unable to license the technology rights that we may require at a reasonable cost or at all. If we cannot obtain a license to any infringing technology that we currently use, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. We own registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks. There can be no assurance that our registered or unregistered trademarks or service marks will not infringe upon the rights of other parties. The requirement to change any of our trademarks, service marks or trade names could result in the loss of any goodwill associated with that trademark, service mark or trade name and could entail significant expense. Litigation is always unpredictable and adverse judgments against us could require us to pay substantial amounts. We are parties to private antitrust litigation and 3CI stockholder litigation described elsewhere in this report (see Part I, Item 3 Legal Proceedings). We do not believe that any of the lawsuits against us has merit, and we are vigorously defending the litigation. Litigation, however, is by its nature unpredictable, and the outcome of these lawsuits cannot be assessed with any degree of certainty. Our insurance may or may not cover some or any of the claims in these lawsuits, and to the extent that it does not, we, and not an insurance company, would have to bear the financial burden of any adverse judgment. The potential thus exists for unanticipated adverse judgments against us which may be substantial in amount and which could materially impair our cash reserves and financial condition. Our earnings could decline if we write off intangible assets, such as goodwill. As a result of purchase accounting for our various acquisitions, our balance sheet at December 31, 2004 contains goodwill, net of accumulated amortization, of $516.8 million and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of $50.8 million (including indefinite lived intangibles of $17.4 million). In accordance with FAS 142, we evaluate on an annual basis, using the fair value of reporting units, whether facts and circumstances indicate any impairment of the value of our goodwill. We use the market value of our stock as the current measurement of fair value of our reporting units and any unforeseen material drop in our stock price maybe an indicator of a potential impairment of goodwill. In addition we evaluate our indefinite lived intangibles on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. We use a discounted cash flow model as the current measurement of the fair value of the permits. Other identifiable intangible assets are currently amortized on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives. These assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may be less than the undiscounted cash flows. As circumstances after an acquisition can change, the value of these intangible assets may not be realized by us. If we were to determine that a significant impairment has occurred, we would be required to incur non cash write offs of the impaired portion of goodwill and other unamortized intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the write off occurs. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are subject to market risks arising from changes in interest rates on our senior secured credit facility. Our interest rate exposure results from changes in LIBOR or the base rate, which are used to determine the applicable interest rates under our term loans and revolving credit facility. Our potential loss over one year that would result from a hypothetical, instantaneous and unfavorable change of 100 basis points in the interest rate on all of our variable rate obligations would be approximately $1.7 million. Fluctuations in interest rates will not affect the interest payable on our senior subordinated notes, which is fixed. We have exposure to commodity pricing for gas and diesel fuel for our trucks. We do not hedge these items to manage the exposure.
