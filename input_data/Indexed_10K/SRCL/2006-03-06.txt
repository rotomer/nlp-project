Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8 of this Report. Introduction We are the largest provider of regulated medical waste services in North America. In addition we offer OSHA compliance services to health care providers and other monitoring services. During 2004, we acquired White Rose Environmental Ltd., which is a leading provider of regulated medical waste services in the United Kingdom. We derive our revenues from services to two principal types of customers: (i) outpatient clinics, medical and dental offices, biomedical companies, pharmacies municipal entities, long term and sub acute care facilities and other smaller quantity generators of regulated medical waste (small account customers) and (ii) hospitals, blood banks, pharmaceutical manufacturers and other larger quantity generators of regulated medical waste (large account customers). 20 Table of Contents Substantially all of our services are provided pursuant to customer contracts specifying either scheduled or on call services, or both. Contracts with small account customers generally provide for annual price increases and have an automatic renewal provision unless the customer notifies us to the contrary prior to the expiration of the current term of the contract. Contracts with hospitals and other large account customers, which may run for more than one year, typically include price escalator provisions, which allow for price increases generally tied to an inflation index or set at a fixed percentage. We also serve pharmacies, distributors and manufacturers of pharmaceutical products by managing the return and disposal of expired or surplus pharmaceutical products and by managing the recall of pharmaceutical products being recalled by the manufacturer. In 2005, we completed four acquisitions of companies that provide these services. As of December 31, 2005, we served approximately 333,000 customers, of which approximately 325,000 were small account customers and approximately 7,700 were large account customers. Critical Accounting Policies and Procedures Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements), the following ones may involve a higher degree of judgment on our part and greater complexity of reporting. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue for our medical waste services at the time of medical waste collection. Revenue and costs on contracts to supply our proprietary ETD treatment equipment are recognized based on shipment of equipment and services provided for in the individual contract. We routinely review total estimated costs and shipments to complete each contract and revise the revenues and estimated gross margin on the contract as necessary. Payments received in advance are deferred and recognized as services are provided. Royalty revenues are calculated based on measurements specified in each contract or license and revenues are recognized at the end of each reporting period when the activity being measured has been completed. Revenues from product sales are recognized at the time the goods are shipped to the ordering customer. Software licensing revenues are recognized on a prorated basis over the term of the license agreement. Revenues from pharmaceutical services are recorded at the time services are performed. We do not have any contracts in a loss position. Losses would be recorded when known and estimable for any contracts that should go into a loss position. Payments received in advance are deferred and recognized as services are provided. Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets. Goodwill associated with the excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired is not amortized. We have determined that our permits have indefinite lives and, accordingly are not amortized. This position is in accordance with Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 142, which became effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Our balance sheet at December 31, 2005 contains goodwill, net of accumulated amortization, of $685.2 million. In accordance with FAS 142, we evaluate on at least an annual basis, using the fair value of reporting units, whether goodwill is impaired. If we were to determine that a significant impairment has occurred, we would be required to incur non cash write offs of the impaired portion of goodwill that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the write off occurs. We use the market value of our stock as the current measurement of total fair value of our reporting units and any unforeseen material drop in our stock price maybe an indicator of a potential impairment of goodwill. The results of the 2005 impairment test conducted in June 2005 did not show any impairment of goodwill, and there have not occurred any events since that time that indicate that an impairment situation exists. 21 Table of Contents Our permits are currently tested for impairment annually at December 31 or more frequently if circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. We use a discounted cash flow model as the current measurement of the fair value of the permits. The estimate of cash flow is based upon, among other things, certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and an appropriate discount rate determined by management. Our estimates of discounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to, among other things; inaccuracies in economic estimates and actual cash flow could materially affect the future financial value of the permits. The results of the 2005 impairment test did not show any impairment of our permits and no events have occurred since that time that would indicate an impairment situation exists. Other identifiable intangible assets, such as customer lists, tradenames and covenants not to compete, are currently amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives. We have determined that our medical waste business customer lists have 40 year lives and our pharmaceutical services business customer lists have 20 year lives. These assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may be less than the undiscounted cash flows. There have been no indicators of impairment of these intangibles (see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements). During 2005 we were in arbitration proceedings regarding various disputes under an exclusive marketing and distribution license agreement with a licensor of software. On March 1, 2006, subsequent to year end, the arbitrator awarded damages to the licensor and the license agreement was effectively terminated. Although this event occurred after the end of the year, we are required to write off the unamortized portion of the license fee that we had previously paid. The effect is a reduction in the carrying amount of this intangible by $1.8 million and a reduction in the accumulated amortization of $0.4 million. Income Taxes. Deferred income tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Accounts Receivable. Accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to us from our normal business activities. Accounts receivable balances are determined to be delinquent when the amount is past due based on the contractual terms with the customer. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected uncollectibility of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified among uncollected accounts. Accounts receivable are charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts when we have determined that the receivable will not be collected and or when the account has been referred to a third party collection agency. No single customer accounts for more than 2% of our revenues. Insurance. Our insurance for workers compensation, vehicle liability and physical damage, and employee related health care benefits is obtained using high deductible insurance polices. A third party administrator is used to process all such claims. We require all workers compensation, vehicle liability and physical damage claims to be reported within 24 hours. As a result, we accrue our workers compensation, vehicle and physical damage liability based upon the claim reserves established by the third party administrator at the end of each reporting period. Our employee health insurance benefit liability is based on our historical claims experience rate. Our earnings would be impacted to the extent that actual claims vary from historical experience. We review our accruals associated with the exposure to these liabilities for adequacy at the end of each reporting period. Litigation. We operate in a highly regulated industry and deal with regulatory inquiries or investigations from time to time that may be instituted for a variety of reasons. We are also involved in a variety of civil litigation from time to time. Settlements from litigation would be recorded when known, probable and estimable. Stock Option Plans. We have issued stock options to employees and directors as an integral part of our compensation programs. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States allow alternative methods of accounting for these plans. We have chosen to account for our stock option plans under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25). As required by FAS 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, calculations of 22 Table of Contents pro forma net income and earnings per share, computed in accordance with the method prescribed by FAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, are set forth in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements. We will adopt the provisions of FAS 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payments, (FAS 123R) on January 1, 2006. Among other things, FAS 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim or annual period after January 1, 2006. See Note 2 New Accounting Pronouncements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data for further information. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 The following summarizes (in thousands) our operations: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 Revenues $ 609,457 100.0 % $ 516,228 100.0 % Cost of revenues 324,988 53.3 % 271,189 52.5 % Depreciation 16,432 2.7 % 16,833 3.3 % Total cost of revenues 341,420 56.0 % 288,022 55.8 % Gross profit 268,037 44.0 % 228,206 44.2 % Selling, general and administrative 93,033 15.3 % 75,653 14.7 % Depreciation 3,403 0.6 % 2,540 0.5 % Amortization 1,596 0.3 % 2,430 0.5 % Acquisition related costs 778 0.1 % 773 0.1 % Total selling, general and administrative expenses 98,810 16.2 % 81,396 15.8 % Write off fixed as sets 872 0.1 % 1,155 0.2 % Income from operations 168,355 27.6 % 145,655 28.2 % Write down of note receivable with former joint venture 2,495 0.4 % Licensing legal settlement 1,823 0.3 % 3CI legal settlement 36,481 6.0 % Net income 67,154 11.0 % 78,178 15.1 % Earnings per share diluted $ 1.48 $ 1.69 Revenues. Our revenues increased $93.2 million, or 18.1%, to $609.5 million in 2005 from $516.2 million in 2004. Revenues generated from the sale of ETD equipment and licensing of technology internationally were $1.0 million during 2005, compared to $8.2 million during 2004. This decrease is a result of the delivery of a large portion of an order of ETD equipment to a customer in Japan in 2004. During 2005, acquisitions less than one year old contributed approximately $63.6 million to the increase in our revenues from 2004. For the year, internal growth for small account customers increased approximately 9% while revenues from large quantity customers increased by approximately 5%. During 2005, the size of the regulated medical waste market in the United States remained relatively stable. Through our acquisition of White Rose Environmental Ltd. in June 2004 and subsequent United Kingdom acquisitions in 2005, we were able to expand our geographic presence outside of North America. Cost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues increased $53.4 million or 18.5%, to $341.4 million during 2005, from $288.0 million during 2004. The increase was primarily related to the increase in revenues during 2005 compared to 2004. Our gross margin percentage decreased to 44.0% during 2005 from 44.2% during 2004 as we experienced higher energy related costs. Domestic energy costs increased in 2005, which were partially offset by higher revenues related to fuel surcharges. Employee benefit costs as a percentage of 23 Table of Contents compensation costs decreased by 2.0% in 2005. This was a result of the changes to our employee healthcare programs including changes to our providers and program formats. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $98.8 million during 2005, from $81.4 million during 2004. This increase was primarily the result of increased spending on marketing our Steri Safesm program and Bio Systems sharps management program and the expansion into the pharmaceutical services programs. Bad debt expense increased during 2005 to $2.7 million from $0.8 million in 2004 due to higher sales and increased write offs in 2005. In addition, as noted in the cost of revenues discussion above, employee benefit costs as a percentage of compensation costs decreased in 2005. Amortization decreased to $1.6 million during 2005, from $2.4 million during 2004 as a result of intangibles becoming fully amortized at the end of 2004. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 16.2% during 2005 compared to 15.8% in 2004. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased to $168.4 million during 2005 from $145.7 million during 2004. The increase was due to higher revenues partially offset by higher costs of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2005 3CI Complete Compliance Corporation, of which we own a majority of the common stock, recorded a non cash impairment charge of $0.9 million on its Springhill, Louisiana building and property. During the year ended December 31, 2004 we recorded a non cash write down of idled Stericycle incinerator equipment at our Baltimore, Maryland and Terrell, Texas facility of $1.2 million. Income from operations as a percentage of revenue decreased to 27.6% during 2005 from 28.2% during 2004 as a result of the factors described above. Interest Expense and Interest Income. Interest expense increased to $13.0 million during 2005, from $11.2 million during 2004, primarily due to higher debt levels during the year. Interest income was $0.8 million during 2005 and $0.6 million during 2004. Write down of note receivable. During 2005 we wrote down a $2.5 million note receivable that we had recorded from the sale of interest in our former South African joint venture when we had determined that the amount was uncollectible. Legal Settlements. During November 2005 we incurred $36.5 million in expenses related to the preliminary settlement of the 3CI class action litigation and related legal expenses. In December 2005, we recorded a cash charge of $0.4 million for damages and a non cash charge of $1.4 million, representing the write off of the unamortized portion of a license fee that we previously paid, as a result of an arbitrators award in March 2006 and the license agreement being effectively terminated. Debt Extinguishments and Refinancing Expenses. During 2005 we incurred $0.5 million in refinancing expense for non cash accelerated amortization of financing fees related to amendments to our bank credit facility agreements. During 2004 we repurchased the remaining $50.9 million of our senior subordinated notes. As a result, in 2004 we incurred $3.1 million in redemption premium expenses and $1.1 million in non cash accelerated amortization of financing fees associated with the repurchase of the notes. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense for the years 2005 and 2004 reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 40.0% and 39.2%, respectively, for federal and state income taxes. Excluding the effect of the legal settlement expense, the effective tax rate for 2005 was 39%. 24 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 The following summarizes (in thousands) our operations: Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 Revenues $ 516,228 100.0 % $ 453,225 100.0 % Cost of revenues 271,189 52.5 % 243,170 53.7 % Depreciation 16,833 3.3 % 13,430 3.0 % Total cost of revenues 288,022 55.8 % 256,600 56.6 % Gross profit 228,206 44.2 % 196,625 43.4 % Selling, general and administrative 75,653 14.7 % 65,733 14.5 % Depreciation 2,540 0.5 % 1,975 0.4 % Amortization 2,430 0.5 % 1,850 0.4 % Acquisition related costs 773 0.1 % 670 0.1 % Total selling, general and administrative expenses 81,396 15.8 % 70,228 15.5 % Write off fixed assets 1,155 0.2 % Income from operations 145,655 28.2 % 126,397 27.9 % Net income 78,178 15.1 % 65,781 14.5 % Earnings per share diluted $ 1.69 $ 1.43 Revenues. Our revenues increased $63.0 million, or 13.9%, to $516.2 million in 2004 from $453.2 million in 2003. Revenues generated from the sale of ETD equipment and licensing of technology internationally were $8.2 million during 2004, compared to $2.8 million during 2003. This increase is a result of the delivery of a large portion of an order of ETD equipment to a customer in Japan in 2004. During 2004, acquisitions less than one year old contributed approximately $47.6 million to the increase in our revenues from 2003. For the year, internal growth for small account customers increased approximately 9% while revenues from large quantity customers decreased by approximately 4% because of our program of improving lower margin accounts. This margin improvement program identifies large quantity customers with margins below internally acceptable thresholds and we make adjustments to pricing or service in an effort to improve the margin. These adjustments may result in our not renewing the customer contract and therefore may result in a reduction of revenues. During 2004, the size of the regulated medical waste market in the United States remained relatively stable. Through our acquisition in June of White Rose Environmental Ltd., we were able to expand our geographic presence outside of North America. Cost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues increased $31.4 million or 12.2%, to $288.0 million during 2004, from $256.6 million during 2003. The increase was primarily related to the increase in revenues during 2004 compared to 2003. Our gross margin percentage increased to 44.2% during 2004 from 43.4% during 2003 as we realized improvements from our continuous programs to improve margins on our large quantity business, increased our number of small quantity customers electing our Steri Safesm program from 70,000 to 87,000 and improved our transportation productivity by increasing route density. During the year fuel prices as a percent of revenue increased by 20%. Employee benefit costs as a percentage of compensation costs decreased by 3.3% in 2004. This was a result of the changes implemented in late 2003 to our employee healthcare programs including changes to our third party administrators and providers. The lower gross margins of White Rose, which started consolidating into our financials in June 2004, reduced the gross margin percentage for the consolidated business by 134 basis points in 2004. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $81.4 million during 2004, from $70.2 million during 2003. This increase was primarily the result of increased spending as a result on marketing our Steri Safesm program and the national rollout of the Bio 25 Table of Contents Systems sharps management program and the acquisition of White Rose in June 2004. Amortization increased to $2.4 million during 2004, from $1.9 million during 2003. Acquisition related costs increased to $0.8 million in 2004 from $0.7 million in 2003. Bad debt expense decreased during 2004 to $0.8 million from $2.0 million in 2003. This decrease was the result of improved collections and decreased write offs during 2004. Legal expenses increased to $5.4 million in 2004 from $3.4 million in 2003 as a result of litigation expense of which, $1.5 million was incurred by our majority owned subsidiary 3CI under the direction of the special committee of its board of directors. In addition, as noted in the cost of revenues discussion above, employee benefit costs as a percentage of compensation costs decreased in 2004. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 15.8% during 2004 compared to 15.5% in 2003. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased to $145.7 million during 2004 from $126.4 million during 2003. The increase was due to higher revenues, offset by higher costs of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2004 we had a non cash write down of idled incinerator equipment and related spare parts in the amount of $1.2 million. Income from operations as a percentage of revenue increased to 28.2% during 2004 from 27.9% during 2003 as a result of the factors described above. Interest Expense and Interest Income. Interest expense decreased to $11.2 million during 2004, from $12.8 million during 2003, primarily due to lower debt levels and lower interest rates during the year. Interest income was $0.6 million during 2004 and 2003. Debt Extinguishments and Refinancing Expenses. During 2004 we repurchased the remaining $50.9 million of our senior subordinated notes compared to a repurchase of $17.8 million of notes in 2003. As a result, in 2004 we incurred $3.1 million in redemption premium expenses and $1.1 million in non cash accelerated amortization of financing fees associated with the repurchase of the notes compared to $2.8 million and $0.5 million, respectively, in 2003. In addition, we amended our bank credit facility agreement in 2004 and paid $0.3 million in financing fees. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense for the years 2004 and 2003 reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 39.2% and 39.5%, respectively, for federal and state income taxes. Liquidity and Capital Resources In June 2005, we obtained a new $400.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility maturing in June 2010 in place of our existing senior secured credit facility. The new credit facility reduced the interest rates that we are charged by reducing the applicable margin that is added to the relevant interest rate. The new credit facility also allowed us to borrow in pre approved currencies other than United States dollars. Our borrowings bear interest at fluctuating interest rates determined, at our election in advance for any quarterly or other applicable interest period, by reference to (i) a base rate (the higher of the prime rate at Bank of America, N.A. or 0.5% above the rate on overnight federal funds transactions) or (ii) the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus, in either case, the applicable margin within the relevant range of margins provided in our credit agreement. The applicable margin is based upon our consolidated leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2005, the margin for interest rates on borrowings under our new credit facility was 0.0% on base rate loans and 0.75% on LIBOR loans. In December 2005, we amended our $400.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility. The facility was increased to $550.0 million, with additional capacity available up to $650.0 million upon request. We also increased the letter of credit sub limit from $125.0 million to $150.0 million. Our amended credit facility requires us to comply with various financial, reporting and other covenants and restrictions, including a restriction on dividend payments. At December 31, 2005, our material financial covenants were as follows: The permitted maximum leverage ratio is 3.00:1.00. As of December 31, 2005, our actual leverage ratio was 1.80:1.00. 26 Table of Contents The permitted minimum interest coverage ratio is 3.00:1.00. As of December 31, 2005, our actual interest coverage ratio was 16.45:1.00. As of December 31, 2005, we had $291.7 million of borrowings outstanding under our senior unsecured credit facility, which includes foreign currency borrowings of $5.2 million. In addition, we had $65.9 million committed to outstanding letters of credit. Working Capital. At December 31, 2005, our working capital was $45.3 million compared to working capital of $32.3 million at December 31, 2004. As noted, we have available a $550.0 million revolving line of credit under our senior unsecured credit facility and at December 31, 2005 had borrowed $291.7 million under this line and had an additional $65.9 million committed in letters of credit. Net Cash Provided or Used. Net cash provided by operating activities was $94.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $114.6 million for 2004. This decrease primarily reflects higher accounts receivable, accrued liability balances and lower net income. The decrease in net income was primarily the result of the $23.4 million, net of tax, recorded for the preliminary settlement of the 3CI class action litigation. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2005 included a $7.4 million tax benefit from disqualifying dispositions of stock options. Net cash used in investing activities for 2005 was $156.0 million compared to $105.1 million for 2004. This increase is primarily attributable to the increase in payments for acquisitions. Cash investments in acquisitions and international joint ventures for 2005 were $139.7 million compared to $72.4 million in 2004. The increase was primarily the result of our acquisition of pharmaceutical return businesses. In addition, in 2005 we sold the Consumer Products Division of Universal Solutions, Inc., which we had acquired as part of the Universal Solutions, Inc. acquisition, and received $10.3 million of net proceeds. Capital expenditures were $26.3 million for 2005, for investments in capital equipment to support a nationwide rollout of the Bio Systems sharps management program and other improvements in our infrastructure, compared to $33.3 million in 2004. As of December 31, 2005 we had less than 9% of our treatment capacity in North America in incineration and approximately 91% in non incineration technologies such as our proprietary ETD technology and autoclaving. The implementation of our commitment to move away from incineration in North America may result in a write down of the incineration equipment as and when we close incinerators that we are currently operating. Our commitment to move away from incineration in North America is in the nature of a goal to be accomplished over an undetermined number of years. Because of uncertainties relating, among other things, to customer education and acceptance and legal requirements to incinerate portions of the medical waste, we do not have a timetable for this transition or specific plans to close any of our existing incinerators. Net cash provided by financing activities was $59.5 million during 2005 compared to $6.9 million net cash used in financing activities in 2004. During 2005 we borrowed money to fund acquisitions, stock repurchases and the 3CI legal settlement. In addition, we made debt repayments of $198.9 million when we terminated our 2001 senior credit facility, $60.7 million in common stock repurchases, $12.8 million repayments on promissory notes and $0.8 million for capital leases. In 2005, we also amended our $400.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility. The facility was increased to $550.0 million, in which we borrowed $371.5 million and made debt repayments of $79.8 million. In addition, at December 31, 2005 we had $68.0 million outstanding primarily related to promissory notes issued in connection with acquisitions made during 2002 through 2005. 27 Table of Contents Contractual Cash Commitments. The following table displays our future contractual cash commitments. Less than After Payments Due by Period (In Thousands) Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years Long term debt* $ 441,224 $ 30,504 $ 98,832 $ 309,151 $ 2,737 Capital lease obligations* 1,298 1,068 230 Purchasing obligations 1,650 864 786 Operating leases 97,742 24,747 47,364 15,550 10,081 Other long term liabilities* 3,187 839 1,634 417 297 Total contractual cash obligations $ 545,101 $ 58,022 $ 148,846 $ 325,118 $ 13,115 * The long term debt, capital lease and other long term liabilities items include both the future principal payment amount as well as an amount calculated for expected future interest payments. For long term debt with variable rates of interest, management used judgment to estimate the future rate of interest. At December 31, 2005 we had $65.9 million in stand by letters of credit issued. We anticipate that our operating cash flow, together with borrowings under our senior secured credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated future operating expenses, capital expenditures and debt service obligations as they become due during the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. Guarantees. We have guaranteed a loan to the Azoroa Bank in Japan on behalf of Shiraishi Sogyo Co. Ltd (Shiraishi). Shiraishi is a customer in Japan that is expanding their medical waste management business and has a five year loan with a current balance of $6.5 million with the Azoroa Bank that expires in June 2009. Management currently believes no amount will be paid under the guarantee. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are subject to market risks arising from changes in interest rates on our senior unsecured credit facility. Our interest rate exposure results from changes in LIBOR or the base rate, which are used to determine the applicable interest rates under our revolving credit facility. Our potential loss over one year that would result from a hypothetical, instantaneous and unfavorable change of 100 basis points in the interest rate on all of our variable rate obligations would be approximately $2.9 million. We have exposure to commodity pricing for gas and diesel fuel for our trucks. We do not hedge these items to manage the exposure.
