Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8 of this Report. Introduction We are in the business of managing regulated waste and providing an array of related services. We operate in the United States, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Canada, Ireland, and Argentina. For large quantity generators of regulated waste such as hospitals and for pharmaceutical companies and distributors, we offer: our institutional medical waste management services; our Bio Systems&reg; sharps management services to reduce the risk of needle sticks; a variety of products and services for infection control; and our regulated returns management services for expired or recalled health care products. For small quantity generators of regulated waste such as doctors offices and for retail pharmacies, we offer: our medical waste management services; our Steri Safe&reg; Occupational Safety and Health Act and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliance programs; a variety of products and services for infection control; and our pharmaceutical returns services for expired or recalled pharmaceuticals. We operate integrated national medical waste management networks in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, the United Kingdom and Ireland. Our national networks include a total of 76 processing or combined processing and collection sites and 104 additional transfer, collection or combined transfer and collection sites. Our medical waste processing technologies include autoclaving, our proprietary electro thermal deactivation system (ETD), chemical treatment and incineration. As of December 31, 2006, we served approximately 351,700 customers, of which approximately 343,100 were small quantity customers and approximately 8,600 were large quantity customers. Critical Accounting Policies and Procedures Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements), the following ones may involve a higher degree of judgment on our part and greater complexity of reporting. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue for our regulated waste services at the time of waste collection. Revenues from regulated returns management services are recorded at the time services are performed. Royalty revenues are calculated based on measurements specified in each contract or license and revenues are recognized at the end of each reporting period when the activity being measured has been completed. Revenues from product sales are recognized at the time the goods are shipped to the ordering customer. Software licensing revenues are recognized on a prorated basis over the term of the license agreement. Revenue and costs on contracts to supply our proprietary ETD treatment equipment are recognized based on shipment of equipment and services provided for in the individual contract. We had no revenues related to ETD sales in 2006 or 2005. We do not have any contracts in a loss position. Losses would be recorded when known and estimable for any contracts that should go into a loss position. Payments received in advance are deferred and recognized as services are provided. Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets. Goodwill associated with the excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired is not amortized. We have determined that our permits have indefinite lives and, accordingly are not amortized. This position is in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting 21 Table of Contents Standards (SFAS) No. 142, which became effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. See Note 8 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for additional information. Our balance sheet at December 31, 2006 contains goodwill of $814.0 million. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we evaluate on at least an annual basis, using the fair value of reporting units, whether goodwill is impaired. If we were to determine that a significant impairment has occurred, we would be required to incur non cash write offs of the impaired portion of goodwill that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the write off occurs. We use the market value of our stock as a measure of fair value and compare that to the ratio of earnings before income tax expense, depreciation expense, and amortization expense, to book value of each of our reporting unit when testing for goodwill impairment, and any unforeseen material drop in our stock price may be an indicator of a potential impairment of goodwill. The results of the 2006 impairment test conducted in June 2006 did not show any impairment of goodwill, and no events have occurred since that time that indicate that an impairment situation exists. Our permits are currently tested for impairment annually at December 31, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. We use a discounted cash flow model as the current measurement of the fair value of the permits. The estimate of cash flow is based upon, among other things, certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and an appropriate discount rate determined by management. Our estimates of discounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to, among other things, inaccuracies in economic estimates, and actual cash flow could materially affect the future financial value of the permits. The results of the 2006 impairment test did not show any impairment of our permits and no events have occurred since that time that would indicate an impairment situation exists. Other identifiable intangible assets, such as customer lists, tradenames and covenants not to compete, are currently amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives. We have determined that our regulated waste customer lists have between 20 year and 40 year lives based on the specific type of relationship. These assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may be less than the undiscounted cash flows. There have been no indicators of impairment of these intangibles (see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements). Income Taxes. Deferred income tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. To provide for certain potential tax exposures, we maintain a reserve for specific tax contingencies, the balance of which management believes is adequate. Accounts Receivable. Accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to us from our normal business activities. Accounts receivable balances are determined to be delinquent when the amount is past due based on the contractual terms with the customer. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected uncollectibility of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified among uncollected accounts. Accounts receivable are charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts when we have determined that the receivable will not be collected and or when the account has been referred to a third party collection agency. No single customer accounts for more than 2% of our revenues. Insurance. Our insurance for workers compensation, vehicle liability and physical damage, and employee related health care benefits is obtained using high deductible insurance polices. A third party administrator is used to process all such claims. We require all workers compensation, vehicle liability and physical damage claims to be reported within 24 hours. As a result, we accrue our workers compensation, vehicle and physical damage liability based upon the claim reserves established by the third party administrator at the end of each reporting period. Our employee health insurance benefit liability is based on our historical claims experience rate. Our earnings would be impacted to the extent that actual claims vary from historical experience. We review our accruals associated with the exposure to these liabilities for adequacy at the end of each reporting period. Litigation. We operate in a highly regulated industry and deal with regulatory inquiries or investigations from time to time that may be instituted for a variety of reasons. We are also involved in a variety of civil litigation from time to time. Settlements from litigation would be recorded when known, probable and estimable. 22 Table of Contents Stock Option Plans. We have issued stock options to employees and directors as an integral part of our compensation programs. On January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R) using the modified prospective method to account for stock compensation costs. SFAS No. 123R requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based payment awards made to our employees and directors. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R, stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment, including estimating expected volatility, expected term and risk free rate. Our expected volatility is based upon historical experience. The expected term of the stock options is based upon historical experience. The risk free interest rate assumption is based upon the average of the U.S. Treasury three and five year yield rates. If factors change and we employ different assumptions, stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past. Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 The following summarizes (in thousands except per share amounts) our operations: Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Revenues $ 789,637 100.0 % $ 609,457 100.0 % Cost of revenues 419,689 53.1 % 324,988 53.3 % Depreciation 20,081 2.5 % 16,432 2.7 % Total cost of revenues 439,770 55.7 % 341,420 56.0 % Gross profit 349,867 44.3 % 268,037 44.0 % Selling, general and administrative 137,411 17.4 % 93,033 15.3 % Depreciation 3,989 0.5 % 3,403 0.6 % Amortization 2,966 0.4 % 1,596 0.3 % Total selling, general and administrative expenses 144,366 18.3 % 98,032 16.1 % Licensing legal settlement 1,823 0.3 % Write off fixed assets 300 0.0 % 872 0.1 % Acquisition integration related expenses 3,439 0.4 % 778 0.1 % Income from operations 201,762 25.6 % 166,532 27.3 % Write down of investment in securities 1,000 0.2 % Write down of note receivable with former joint venture 2,495 0.4 % 3CI legal settlement(2005)/proceeds from insurance(2006) (1,025 ) 0.1 % 36,481 6.0 % Net interest expense 27,061 3.4 % 12,247 2.0 % Income tax expense 67,304 8.5 % 44,826 7.4 % Net income $ 105,270 13.3 % $ 67,154 11.0 % Earnings per share diluted $ 2.33 $ 1.48 Revenues. Our revenues increased $180.2 million, or 29.6%, to $789.6 million in 2006 from $609.5 million in 2005. Revenues primarily increased as a result of domestic and international acquisitions. During 2006, acquisitions less than one year old contributed approximately $116.1 million to the increase in our revenues from 2005. In addition, strong revenue growth was exhibited in our Steri SafeSM product offerings as a result of increased market penetration in the small quantity generator markets, continued success in the rollout of our Bio Systems sharps management program and growth in returns management services revenues. For the year, internal growth for small account customers increased approximately 11% while revenues from large quantity customers increased by approximately 9%. 23 Table of Contents During 2006, the size of the regulated waste market in the United States for the services we provide remained relatively stable. Through our acquisition of STG and Habitat Ecologico S.A. in February 2006, we were able to expand our geographic presence outside of North America. Cost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues increased $98.4 million or 28.8%, to $439.8 million during 2006, from $341.4 million during 2005. This was primarily due to an increase in incremental expenses as a result of business acquisitions completed during 2006 and 2005. Our gross margin percentage increased to 44.3% during 2006 from 44.0% during 2005 due to an increase in gross margins on our domestic business as we continued to realize efficiencies from ongoing programs to improve the gross margins on our large and small quantity business. Domestic energy and transportation costs increased in 2006, which were partially offset by higher revenues related to fuel surcharges. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses, less stock compensation expense, increased $36.6 million or 37.2% to $144.4 million during 2006 from $98.0 million during 2005. This increase was primarily the result of incremental overhead expenses as a result of our acquisition of STG in 2006 and other acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter in 2005. Effective January 1, 2006 we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, Share Based Payments (SFAS No. 123R) using the modified prospective basis, which resulted in a change in the way we recognize share based compensation expense, which increased selling, general and administrative expenses by $9.8 million or 1.0% as a percentage of revenue. Bad debt expense increased during 2006 to $4.2 million from $2.7 million in 2005 due to higher sales. Amortization expense increased to $3.0 million during 2006, from $1.6 million during 2005 as a result of amortization of new intangibles during 2006 and 2005. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 18.3% during 2006 compared to 16.1% in 2005 as a result of the factors described above. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased $35.2 million or 21.2% to $201.8 million during 2006 from $166.5 million during 2005. The increase was due to higher gross margin partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded expenses of $3.4 million related to acquisition integration compared to $0.8 million in 2005. Of the $3.4 million of 2006 expense, approximately $1.1 million related to facility closures; one in the United States and one in the United Kingdom. During the year ended December 31, 2006 we recorded a $0.3 million non cash write down of equipment acquired from 3CI. During the year ended December 31, 2005 we recorded a non cash impairment charge of $0.9 million related to our Springhill, Louisiana building and property. Income from operations as a percentage of revenue decreased to 25.6% during 2006 from 27.3% during 2005 as a result of the factors described above. Interest Expense and Interest Income. Interest expense increased to $28.4 million during 2006, from $13.0 million during 2005, primarily due to higher debt levels and higher interest rates during the year. Interest income was $1.4 million during 2006 and $0.8 million during 2005. Write down of investment. During 2006 we had a $1.0 million non cash write down of an investment in securities. Proceeds from Insurance. During 2006 we received $1.0 million for insurance proceeds related to the 3CI litigation. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense for the years 2006 and 2005 reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 39.0% and 40.0%, respectively, for federal and state income taxes. The legal settlement negatively impacted our 2005 effective tax rate by 1.0% 24 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 The following summarizes (in thousands except per share amounts) our operations: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 Revenues $ 609,457 100.0 % $ 516,228 100.0 % Cost of revenues 324,988 53.3 % 271,189 52.5 % Depreciation 16,432 2.7 % 16,833 3.3 % Total cost of revenues 341,420 56.0 % 288,022 55.8 % Gross profit 268,037 44.0 % 228,206 44.2 % Selling, general and administrative 93,033 15.3 % 75,653 14.7 % Depreciation 3,403 0.6 % 2,540 0.5 % Amortization 1,596 0.3 % 2,430 0.5 % Total selling, general and administrative expenses 98,032 16.1 % 80,623 15.6 % Licensing legal settlement 1,823 0.3 % Write off fixed assets 872 0.1 % 1,155 0.2 % Acquisition integration related expenses 778 0.1 % 773 0.1 % Income from operations 166,532 27.3 % 145,655 28.2 % Write down of note receivable with former joint venture 2,495 0.4 % 3CI legal settlement 36,481 6.0 % Net interest expense 12,247 2.0 % 10,628 2.1 % Income tax expense 44,826 7.4 % 50,386 9.8 % Net income $ 67,154 11.0 % $ 78,178 15.1 % Earnings per share diluted $ 1.48 $ 1.69 Revenues. Our revenues increased $93.2 million, or 18.1%, to $609.5 million in 2005 from $516.2 million in 2004. Revenues generated from the sale of ETD equipment and licensing of technology internationally were $1.0 million during 2005, compared to $8.2 million during 2004. This decrease is a result of the delivery of a large portion of an order of ETD equipment to a customer in Japan in 2004. During 2005, acquisitions less than one year old contributed approximately $63.6 million to the increase in our revenues from 2004. For the year, internal growth for small account customers increased approximately 9% while revenues from large quantity customers increased by approximately 5%. During 2005, the size of the regulated waste market in the United States for the services we provide remained relatively stable. Through our acquisition of White Rose Environmental Ltd. in June 2004 and subsequent United Kingdom acquisitions in 2005, we were able to expand our geographic presence outside of North America. Cost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues increased $53.4 million or 18.5%, to $341.4 million during 2005, from $288.0 million during 2004. The increase was primarily related to the increase in revenues during 2005 compared to 2004. Our gross margin percentage decreased to 44.0% during 2005 from 44.2% during 2004 as we experienced higher energy related costs. Domestic energy costs increased in 2005, which were partially offset by higher revenues related to fuel surcharges. Employee benefit costs as a percentage of compensation costs decreased by 2.0 % in 2005. This was a result of the changes to our employee healthcare programs including changes to our providers and program formats. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $98.0 million during 2005, from $80.6 million during 2004. This increase was primarily the result of increased spending on marketing our Steri SafeSM program and Bio Systems sharps management program and the expansion into the pharmaceutical services programs. Bad debt expense increased during 2005 to $2.7 million 25 Table of Contents from $0.8 million in 2004 due to higher sales and increased write offs in 2005. In addition, as noted in the cost of revenues discussion above, employee benefit costs as a percentage of compensation costs decreased in 2005. Amortization decreased to $1.6 million during 2005, from $2.4 million during 2004 as a result of some intangibles becoming fully amortized at the end of 2004. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 16.2% during 2005 compared to 15.8% in 2004 as a result of the factors described above. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased to $166.5 million during 2005 from $145.7 million during 2004. The increase was due to higher revenues partially offset by higher costs of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2005, 3CI Complete Compliance Corporation, of which we own a majority of the common stock, recorded a non cash impairment charge of $0.9 million on its Springhill, Louisiana building and property. In December 2005, we recorded a cash charge of $0.4 million for damages and a non cash charge of $1.4 million, representing the write off of the unamortized portion of a license fee that we previously paid, as a result of an arbitrators award in March 2006 and the license agreement being effectively terminated. During the year ended December 31, 2004 we recorded a non cash write down of idled Stericycle incinerator equipment at our Baltimore, Maryland and Terrell, Texas facility of $1.2 million. Income from operations as a percentage of revenue decreased to 27.3% during 2005 from 28.2% during 2004 as a result of the factors described above. Interest Expense and Interest Income. Interest expense increased to $13.0 million during 2005, from $11.2 million during 2004, primarily due to higher debt levels during the year. Interest income was $0.8 million during 2005 and $0.6 million during 2004. Write down of note receivable. During 2005 we wrote down a $2.5 million note receivable that we had recorded from the sale of interest in our former South African joint venture when we had determined that the amount was uncollectible. Legal Settlements. During November 2005 we incurred $36.5 million in expenses related to the preliminary settlement of the 3CI class action litigation and related legal expenses. Debt Extinguishments and Refinancing Expenses. During 2005 we incurred $0.5 million in refinancing expense for non cash accelerated amortization of financing fees related to amendments to our bank credit facility agreements. During 2004 we repurchased the remaining $50.9 million of our senior subordinated notes. As a result, in 2004 we incurred $3.1 million in redemption premium expenses and $1.1 million in non cash accelerated amortization of financing fees associated with the repurchase of the notes. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense for the years 2005 and 2004 reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 40.0% and 39.2%, respectively, for federal and state income taxes. The legal settlement negatively impacted our 2005 effective tax rate by 1.0% Liquidity and Capital Resources On July 31, 2006, we, and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a new credit agreement (Credit Agreement) with Bank of America, N.A., and other lenders party to the Credit Agreement. The new credit agreement is in effect an amendment of our prior senior unsecured credit facility. The new credit agreement (i) reduces our costs of borrowing by using a more favorable pricing grid; (ii) increases our revolving credit facility from $550 million to $650 million; (iii) increases the accordion (the amount for which we may request an increase in the size of our revolving credit facility) from $100 million to $200 million; (iv) increases the letter of credit sublimit from $150 million to $200 million; (v) increases the foreign currency sublimit from $125 million to $200 million; (vi) increases the debt to EBITDA covenant from 3.00:1.00 to 3.75:1.00; and (vii) extends the maturity date of our borrowings from June 30, 2010 to July 31, 2011. 26 Table of Contents The new credit agreement reduces our costs of borrowing by reducing the applicable margin that is added to the relevant interest rate that we are charged. Our borrowings bear interest at fluctuating interest rates determined, at our election in advance for any quarterly or other applicable interest period, by reference to (i) a base rate (the higher of the prime rate at Bank of America, N.A. or 0.5% above the rate on overnight federal funds transactions) or (ii) the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus, in either case, the applicable margin within the relevant range of margins provided in our credit agreement. Under the new credit agreement, the applicable margin is based on (i) our consolidated leverage ratio, or, if our long term non credit enhanced debt has been rated by Standard & Poors, (ii) our S&P debt rating, whichever margin is more favorable to us. As of December 31, 2006, the margin for interest rates on borrowings under our new credit facility was 0.0% on base rate loans and 0.75% on LIBOR loans. The new credit agreement contains customary events of default, including our failure to pay any principal, interest or other amount when due, our violation of certain of our affirmative covenants or any of our negative covenants, a breach of our representations and warranties, or a change of control. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, payment of our indebtedness may be accelerated and the lending commitments under the credit agreement may be terminated. As of December 31, 2006, we had $387.3 million of borrowings outstanding under our senior unsecured credit facility, which includes foreign currency borrowings of $9.3 million. In addition, we had $48.8 million committed to outstanding letters of credit. The weighted average rate of interest on the unsecured revolving credit facility was 6.08% for the year ended December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, we had $77.9 million in other debt outstanding, which includes promissory notes issued in connection with acquisitions during 2003 through 2006 and foreign subsidiary bank debt. Working Capital. At December 31, 2006, our working capital was $76.6 million compared to working capital of $45.3 million at December 31, 2005. Of the change in working capital, $26.5 million is related to Asset group held for sale as this amount is primarily comprised of fixed assets and intangible assets that will be sold, presented as current assets, per accounting rules. As noted, we have available a $650.0 million revolving line of credit under our senior unsecured credit facility and at December 31, 2006 had borrowed $387.3 million under this line and had an additional $48.8 million committed in letters of credit. Net Cash Provided or Used. Net cash provided by operating activities was $160.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $94.3 million for 2005. This increase primarily reflects higher net income and an emphasis on improved collections. 2005 net income included a $23.4 million, net of tax, settlement of the 3CI class action litigation. As a result of adopting SFAS No. 123R effective January 1, 2006, benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense is reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as prescribed under the prior accounting rules. This requirement reduces net operating cash flow and increases net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. Total cash flows remain unchanged from what would have been reported under prior accounting rules. As a result $8.4 million in tax benefits on stock options exercised was reported as cash provided from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $7.4 million reported as cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2005. Net cash used in investing activities for 2006 was $201.4 million compared to $156.0 million for 2005. This increase is primarily attributable to the increase in payments for acquisitions. Cash investments in acquisitions and international joint ventures for 2006 were $164.0 million compared to $139.7 million in 2005. The increase was primarily the result of our acquisition of STG. Capital expenditures were $36.4 million for 2006, for investments in capital equipment to support the growth of the Bio Systems sharps management program and other improvements in our infrastructure, compared to $26.3 million in 2005. As of December 31, 2006 we had less than 8% of our treatment capacity in North America in incineration and approximately 92% in non incineration technologies such as our proprietary ETD technology and autoclaving. The implementation of our commitment to move away from incineration in North America may result in a write down of the incineration equipment as and when we close incinerators that we are currently operating. Our commitment to move away from incineration in North America is in the nature of a goal to be accomplished over an undetermined number of years. Because 27 Table of Contents of uncertainties relating, among other things, to customer education and acceptance and legal requirements to incinerate portions of the regulated waste, we do not have a timetable for this transition or specific plans to close any of our existing incinerators. Net cash provided by financing activities was $52.5 million during 2006 compared to $59.5 million in 2005. During 2006 we borrowed money to fund acquisitions and common stock repurchases. During 2006, we made $42.8 million in common stock repurchases, $30.7 million in promissory notes payments $266.0 million in debt repayments and $0.8 million for capital leases. In 2005, we borrowed money to fund acquisitions, stock repurchases and the 3CI legal settlement while we made debt repayments of $198.9 million when we terminated our 2001 senior credit facility, $12.8 million repayments on promissory notes and $0.8 million for capital leases. Contractual Cash Commitments. The following table displays our future contractual cash commitments. Payments due by period (in thousands) Total Less than1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5years Long term debt* $ 558,407 $ 49,536 $ 101,159 $ 407,623 $ 89 Capital lease obligations* 689 447 214 28 Purchase obligations 1,307 470 837 Operating leases 135,946 31,196 66,298 35,273 3,179 Other long term liabilities* 2,515 838 1,248 264 165 Total contractual cash obligations $ 698,864 $ 82,487 $ 169,756 $ 443,188 $ 3,433 * The long term debt, capital lease and other long term liabilities items include both the future principal payment amount as well as an amount calculated for expected future interest payments. For long term debt with variable rates of interest, management used judgment to estimate the future rate of interest. Other long term liabilities include amounts related to non compete agreements. At December 31, 2006 we had $48.8 million in stand by letters of credit issued. We anticipate that our operating cash flow, together with borrowings under our senior secured credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated future operating expenses, capital expenditures and debt service obligations as they become due during the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. Guarantees: We have guaranteed a loan to the Aozora Bank in Japan on behalf of Shiraishi Sogyo Co. Ltd (Shiraishi). Shiraishi is a customer in Japan that is expanding their regulated waste management business and has a five year loan with a current balance of $4.8 million with the Aozora Bank that expires in June 2009. Management currently believes no amount will be paid under the guarantee. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are subject to market risks arising from changes in interest rates on our senior unsecured credit facility. Our interest rate exposure results from changes in LIBOR or the base rate, which are used to determine the applicable interest rates under our revolving credit facility.
