Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8 of this Report. Introduction We are in the business of managing regulated waste and providing an array of related services. We operate in the United States, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Canada, Ireland and Argentina. For large quantity generators of regulated waste such as hospitals and for pharmaceutical companies and distributors, we offer: our institutional medical waste management services; our Bio Systems&reg; sharps management services to reduce the risk of needle sticks; a variety of products and services for infection control; and our regulated returns management services for expired or recalled products. For small quantity generators of regulated waste such as doctors offices and for retail pharmacies, we offer: our medical waste management services; our Steri Safe&reg; Occupational Safety and Health Act and HIPAA compliance programs; a variety of products and services for infection control; and our pharmaceutical returns services for expired or recalled pharmaceuticals. We operate integrated national medical waste management networks in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, the United Kingdom and Ireland. Our national networks include a total of 78 processing or combined processing and collection sites and 98 additional transfer, collection or combined transfer and collection sites. Our medical waste processing technologies include autoclaving, our proprietary ETD, chemical treatment and incineration. As of December 31, 2007, we served approximately 394,600 customers, of which approximately 384,900 were small quantity customers and approximately 9,700 were large quantity customers. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally 19 Table of Contents accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements), the following ones may involve a higher degree of judgment on our part and greater complexity of reporting. Revenue Recognition: We recognize revenues for our regulated waste services at the time of waste collection. Payments received in advance are deferred and recognized as services are provided. Revenues from regulated returns management services are recorded at the time services are performed. Royalty revenues are calculated based on measurements specified in each contract or license and revenues are recognized at the end of each reporting period when the activity being measured has been completed. Revenues from product sales are recognized at the time the goods are shipped to the ordering customer. Software licensing revenues are recognized on a prorated basis over the term of the license agreement. We do not have any contracts in a loss position. Losses would be recorded when known and estimable for any contracts that should go into a loss position. Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets: Goodwill associated with the excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired is not amortized. We have determined that our permits have indefinite lives and, accordingly are not amortized. This position is in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS No. 142). See Note 9 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for additional information. Our balance sheet at December 31, 2007 contains goodwill of $1,033.3 million. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we evaluate on at least an annual basis, using the fair value of reporting units, whether goodwill is impaired. If we were to determine that a significant impairment has occurred, we would be required to incur non cash write offs of the impaired portion of goodwill that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the write off occurs. We use the market value of our stock compared to book as the current measurement of total fair value of our company. The performance of each of our reporting units is compared to that fair value ratio, and any unforeseen material drop in our stock price may be an indicator of a potential impairment of goodwill. The results of the 2007 impairment test conducted in June 2007 did not show any impairment of goodwill, and no events have occurred since that time that indicate that an impairment situation exists. Our permits are currently tested for impairment annually at December 31, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. We use a discounted income approach model as the current measurement of the fair value of the permits. The estimate of income is based upon, among other things, certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and an appropriate discount rate determined by management. Our estimates of discounted income may differ from actual income due to, among other things, inaccuracies in economic estimates. In the second quarter of 2007 we wrote down approximately $0.2 million for a permit in the United Kingdom due to a management decision to move waste processing to an alternate location. The results of the 2007 impairment test did not show any impairment of our remaining permits and no events have occurred since that time that would indicate an impairment situation exists. Other identifiable intangible assets, such as customer relationships, tradenames and covenants not to compete, are currently amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives. We have determined that our regulated waste customer relationships have between 20 year and 40 year lives based on the specific type of relationship. This determination was based on an independent study performed on our customer relationships. Although the regulated waste management business is highly competitive we have been able to maintain high customer retention through contracts with automatic renewal provisions and excellent customer service. The valuation of our contractual customer relationships was derived using a discounted income approach valuation model similar to the method used for permit impairment testing mentioned earlier. These assets are 20 Table of Contents reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may be less than its undiscounted estimated future cash flows. There have been no indicators of impairment of these intangibles (see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements). Income Taxes: Deferred income tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. To provide for certain potential tax exposures, we maintain a reserve for specific tax contingencies, the balance of which management believes is adequate. In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). This interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This Interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return. This interpretation also provides guidance on de recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Accounts Receivable: Accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to us from our normal business activities. Accounts receivable balances are determined to be delinquent when the amount is past due based on the contractual terms with the customer. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected uncollectibility of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified among uncollected accounts. Accounts receivable are charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts when we have determined that the receivable will not be collected and or when the account has been referred to a third party collection agency. No single customer accounts for more than 2% of our revenues. Insurance: Our insurance for workers compensation, vehicle liability and physical damage, and employee related health care benefits is obtained using high deductible insurance polices. A third party administrator is used to process all such claims. We require all workers compensation, vehicle liability and physical damage claims to be reported within 24 hours. As a result, we accrue our workers compensation, vehicle and physical damage liability based upon the claim reserves established by the third party administrator at the end of each reporting period. Our employee health insurance benefit liability is based on our historical claims experience rate. Our earnings would be impacted to the extent that actual claims vary from historical experience. We review our accruals associated with the exposure to these liabilities for adequacy at the end of each reporting period. Litigation: We operate in a highly regulated industry and deal with regulatory inquiries or investigations from time to time that may be instituted for a variety of reasons. We are also involved in a variety of civil litigation from time to time. Settlements from litigation would be recorded when known, probable and estimable. Stock Option Plans: We have issued stock options to employees and directors as an integral part of our compensation programs. On January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R) using the modified prospective method to account for stock compensation costs. SFAS No. 123R requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based payment awards made to our employees and directors. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R, stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment, including estimating expected volatility, expected term and risk free rate. Our expected volatility is based upon historical experience. The expected term of the stock options is based upon a measure of historical volatility of our stock price. The risk free interest rate assumption is based upon the U.S. Treasury yield rates of a comparable period. If factors change and we employ different assumptions, stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past. 21 Table of Contents New Accounting Pronouncements: For information about recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 The following summarizes the Companys operations: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 $ % $ % in thousands, except per share data Revenues $ 932,767 100.0 $ 789,637 100.0 Cost of revenues 491,789 52.7 419,689 53.1 Depreciation 23,057 2.5 20,081 2.5 Total cost of revenues 514,846 55.2 439,770 55.7 Gross profit 417,921 44.8 349,867 44.3 Selling, general and administrative expenses 168,657 18.1 137,411 17.4 Depreciation 4,423 0.5 3,989 0.5 Amortization 3,657 0.4 2,966 0.4 Total selling, general and administrative expenses 176,737 18.9 144,366 18.3 Gain on sale of assets (2,099 ) (0.2 ) Impairment of intangible assets 2,269 0.2 Impairment of fixed assets 1,261 0.1 300 0.0 Arbitration award and related costs 13,904 1.5 Acquisition integration expenses 1,305 0.1 3,439 0.4 Income from operations 224,544 24.1 201,762 25.6 Write down of investment 2,930 0.3 1,000 0.1 Insurance proceeds (3,300 ) (0.4 ) (1,025 ) (0.1 ) Net interest expense 32,375 3.5 27,061 3.4 Income tax expense 72,862 7.8 67,304 8.5 Net income $ 118,378 12.7 $ 105,270 13.3 Earnings per share Diluted $ 1.32 $ 1.16 Revenues: Our revenues increased $143.1 million, or 18.1%, to $932.8 million in 2007 from $789.6 million in 2006. Domestic revenues increased $105.0 million, or 17.0%, to $721.4 million from $616.4 million in 2006 as internal growth for domestic small account customers increased by approximately $37.1 million, over 10%, driven by an increase of Steri Safe customers. Revenues from domestic large account customers increased approximately $13.1 million, or over 6% as we increased the total number of accounts. Returns Management Services increased revenues compared to 2006 by over $22.3 million from internal growth due to larger than expected recall volumes. Domestic acquisitions less than one year old added an additional $32.5 million in revenues compared to 2006. International revenues in 2007 were $211.4 million, compared to $173.2 million in 2006, an increase of $38.1 million or 22.0%. Internal growth, currency rate fluctuations, acquisitions, and the divestiture of some plants in the United Kingdom, impact the comparison of 2007 to 2006. Internal growth was $16.2 million. The effect of exchange rates favorably impacted international 2007 revenues by $11.8 million as foreign currencies appreciated against the U.S. dollar, acquisitions less than one year old favorably impacted revenues by $24.5 million, while the divestiture at a gain of selected Sterile Technologies Group, Ltd., (STG) plants in the first quarter of 2007 negatively impacted the comparison to 2006 by $14.4 million. 22 Table of Contents Cost of Revenues: Our 2007 cost of revenues increased $75.1 million, or $17.1%, to $514.8 million compared to $439.8 million in 2006. Domestic cost of revenues increased $47.4 million, or 14.7%, to $369.9 million in 2007 compared to $322.6 million for 2006. International cost of revenues increased $27.7 million, or 23.6%, to $144.9 million in 2007 compared to $117.2 million in 2006. Our gross margin percentage increased to 44.8% during 2007 from 44.3% during 2006. Domestic gross margin percentage improved 1.0% to 48.7% during 2007 from 47.7% in 2006. Our gross margin increase was primarily the result of increased number of small quantity customers, which have a better gross margin. Domestic energy and transportation costs increased in 2007, which were partially offset by higher revenues related to fuel surcharges. International gross margin decreased 0.9% in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to acquisitions whose margins are lower. In general, international gross margins are lower than domestic gross margins because the international operations have less penetration into the small quantity generator market, which has a better gross margin. Historically, the international operations have had most of their revenues from large national healthcare hospitals. As the international segment increases, consolidated gross margins receive downward pressure due this business mix, which can be offset by additional international small quantity market penetration, integration savings and domestic business expansion. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses: In 2007, our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $32.4 million, or 22.4%, to $176.7 million from $144.4 million in 2006. Amortization and depreciation expense, as a percentage of revenue, did not change from 2006 to 2007. Domestically, 2007 SG&A increased $26.6 million, or 22.8%, to $143.1 million from $116.6 million in 2006. The increase was primarily due to spending related to market penetration for our Bio Systems&reg; sharps management program and investments in the Steri Safe and returns management services. Internationally, our SG&A increased $5.8 million, or 20.7%, in 2007 to $33.6 million from $27.8 million in 2006, mostly due to foreign exchange fluctuations (higher dollar costs as the dollar weakened versus other currencies). As a percentage of revenue, international SG&A decreased 0.2%. This decrease reflects the ongoing efforts to integrate our businesses in the United Kingdom and Argentina. Income from Operations: Income from operations increased by $22.8 million, or 11.3%, to $224.5 million in 2007 from $201.8 million in 2006. Comparisons of income from operations between 2007 and 2006 are affected by various charges not considered part of our day to day operations. During the year ended December 31, 2007 we had charges totaling $17.4 million related to permit write offs, fixed asset write offs and settlement of arbitration proceedings in Australia. Those charges were partially offset by gains of $2.1 million from the sale of assets of STG and of Scherer Labs. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded expenses of $0.3 million related to fixed asset write downs. Domestically, our income from operations increased $17.7 million, or 10.1%, to $192.8 million from $175.1 million in 2006. Internationally our income from operations increased $5.1 million, or 19.1%, to $31.7 million from $26.7 million in 2006. Interest Expense and Interest Income: Interest expense increased to $34.0 million during 2007 from $28.4 million during 2006. The increase of $5.6 million is related to higher debt levels incurred to finance acquisitions and stock repurchases. Interest income was $1.6 million during 2007 and $1.4 million during 2006. Write down of Investment: During 2007 we had a $2.9 million non cash write down of our investment in Medam B.A., an Argentine medical waste processing company. The write down was due to a legal restructuring of the Medam B.A. operations. Stericycle now is the sole owner of Medam B.A. During 2006 we had a $1.0 million non cash write down of an investment in securities. 23 Table of Contents Proceeds from Insurance: During 2007 we received $3.3 million of insurance proceeds related to the 3CI litigation settled in 2005. During 2006 we received $1.0 million of insurance proceeds related to the 3CI litigation settled in 2005. Income Tax Expense: Income tax expense for the years 2007 and 2006 reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 38.1% and 39.0%, respectively, for federal and state income taxes. Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 The following summarizes the Companys operations: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 $ % $ % in thousands, except per share data Revenues $ 789,637 100.0 $ 609,457 100.0 Cost of revenues 419,689 53.1 324,988 53.3 Depreciation 20,081 2.5 16,432 2.7 Total cost of revenues 439,770 55.7 341,420 56.0 Gross profit 349,867 44.3 268,037 44.0 Selling, general and administrative expenses 137,411 17.4 93,033 15.3 Depreciation 3,989 0.5 3,403 0.6 Amortization 2,966 0.4 1,596 0.3 Total selling, general and administrative expenses 144,366 18.3 98,032 16.1 Licensing legal settlement 1,823 0.3 Impairment of fixed assets 300 0.0 872 0.1 Acquisition integration expenses 3,439 0.4 778 0.1 Income from operations 201,762 25.6 166,532 27.3 Write down of security investment 1,000 0.1 Write down of note receivable with joint venture 2,495 0.4 3CI legal settlement (2005)/ proceeds from insurance (2006) (1,025 ) (0.1 ) 36,481 6.0 Net interest expense 27,061 3.4 12,247 2.0 Income tax expense 67,304 8.5 44,826 7.4 Net income $ 105,270 13.3 $ 67,154 11.0 Earnings per share diluted $ 1.16 $ 0.74 Revenues: Our revenues increased $180.2 million, or 29.6%, to $789.6 million in 2006 from $609.5 million in 2005. Domestic revenues increased $108.2 million, or 21.3%, to $616.4 million from $508.3 million in 2005 as internal growth for domestic small account customers increased by approximately $33.5 million, or 11%, and internal growth for large quantity customers increased by approximately $16.5 million, or 9%. Internal growth for returns management was $7.8 million, and acquisitions less than one year old contributed approximately $50.4 million to the increase in domestic revenues. International revenues increased $72.0 million to $173.2 million from $101.2 million in 2005. Internal growth of international revenues, excluding the $3.2 million effect of favorable exchange rates, was approximately $9.4 million, or 9.3%. International acquisitions less than one year old contributed approximately $59.4 million to the increase in international revenues. Through our acquisition of The Sterile Technologies Group Limited and Habitat Ecologico S.A. in February 2006, we were able to expand our geographic presence outside of North America. 24 Table of Contents Cost of Revenues: Our cost of revenues increased $98.4 million, or 28.8%, to $439.8 million during 2006 from $341.4 million during 2005. Our domestic cost of revenues increased $50.1 million, or 18.3%, to $322.6 million from $272.7 million in 2005, and our international cost of revenues increased $48.3 million to $117.2 million from $68.7 million in 2005. This increase was primarily due to an increase in incremental expenses in both domestic and international cost of revenues as a result of acquisitions completed during 2006. Our gross margin percentage increased to 44.3% during 2006 from 44.0% during 2005. Domestic gross margin increased to 47.7% in 2006 from 46.5% in 2005 and international gross margin increased to 32.2% in 2006 from 31.4% in 2005. The increase in the gross margins of our domestic business was a result of increased efficiencies and higher margin service add ons, and the increase in the gross margins of our international business was a result of continued acquisition integration efficiencies and of leveraging our international infrastructure. In general, international gross margins are lower than domestic gross margins because the international operations have less penetration into the small quantity generator market, which has a better gross margin. Historically, the international operations have had most of their revenues from large national healthcare hospitals. Margins may be impacted by acquisitions in any period as the revenue may change. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses: In 2006, our SG&A expenses, less stock compensation expense, increased $36.5 million, or 37.2%, to $134.5 million from $98.0 million in 2006. Effective January 1, 2006 we adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective basis, which resulted in a change in the way we recognize share based compensation expense, which increased SG&A expenses by $9.8 million or 1.2% as a percentage of revenue. Domestically, 2006 SG&A, less stock compensation expense, increased $25.6 million, or 31.6%, to $106.7 million from $81.0 million in 2005. The increase was primarily due to spending related to market penetration for our Bio Systems&reg; sharps management program and increased investing in growing the Steri Safe products. Internationally, our SG&A increased $10.9 million, or 64.0%, in 2006 to $27.8 million from $17.0 million in 2005. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of STG in February 2006. Income from Operations: Income from operations increased $35.2 million or 21.2% to $201.8 million during 2006 from $166.5 million during 2005. The increase was due to higher gross margin partially offset by higher SG&A expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded expenses of $3.4 million related to acquisition integration compared to $0.8 million in 2005. Of the $3.4 million of 2006 expense, approximately $1.1 million related to facility closures; one in the United States and one in the United Kingdom. During the year ended December 31, 2006 we recorded a $0.3 million non cash write down of equipment acquired from 3CI. During the year ended December 31, 2005 we recorded a non cash impairment charge of $0.9 million related to our Springhill, Louisiana building and property. Income from operations as a percentage of revenue decreased to 25.6% during 2006 from 27.3% during 2005 as a result of the factors described above. Interest Expense and Interest Income: Interest expense increased to $28.4 million during 2006 from $13.0 million during 2005, primarily due to higher debt levels and higher interest rates during the year. Interest income was $1.4 million during 2006 and $0.8 million during 2005. Write down of Investment: During 2006 we had a $1.0 million non cash write down of an investment in securities. Proceeds from Insurance: During 2006 we received $1.0 million for insurance proceeds related to the 3CI litigation. Legal Settlements: During 2005 we incurred $36.5 million in expenses related to the preliminary settlement of the 3CI class action litigation and related legal expenses. Write down of note receivable: During 2005 we wrote down a $2.5 million note receivable that we had recorded from the sale of interest in our former South African joint venture when we had determined that the amount was uncollectible. 25 Table of Contents Income Tax Expense: Income tax expense for the years 2006 and 2005 reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 39.0% and 40.0%, respectively, for federal and state income taxes. The legal settlement negatively impacted our 2005 effective tax rate by 1.0%. Liquidity and Capital Resources On August 24, 2007, we amended and restated our $650.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility maturing in July 2011. The credit facility was increased to $850.0 million and the maturity was extended to August 24, 2012. At December 31, 2007 the margin for interest rates on borrowings under our new credit facility was 0.0% on base rate (at the higher of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or (ii) the prime rate) loans and 0.625% on LIBOR loans. Our credit facility requires compliance with various financial, reporting and other covenants and restrictions, including a restriction on dividend payments. At December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with all of our financial debt covenants. As of December 31, 2007, we had $465.4 million of borrowings outstanding under our senior unsecured credit facility, which includes foreign currency borrowings of $16.0 million. In addition, we had $139.4 million committed to outstanding letters of credit. The weighted average rate of interest on the unsecured revolving credit facility was 5.53% per annum. At December 31, 2007 we had $170.4 million in other debt outstanding, which includes promissory notes issued in connection with acquisitions during 2004 through 2007, other foreign subsidiary bank debt and $1.7 million in capital leases. Working Capital: At December 31, 2007, our working capital was $60.6 million compared to working capital of $76.6 million at December 31, 2006. Working capital decreased by $26.5 million due to the completion of the divestiture of selected STG plants that were classified as Assets of disposal group held for sale and Liabilities of disposal group held for sale and presented as current assets and current liabilities at December 31, 2006. Working capital increased by $27.0 million due to higher accounts receivable related to increased revenues, and decreased $15.0 million due to higher accounts payable. Net Cash Provided or Used: Net cash provided by operating activities was $174.0 million during 2007 compared to $160.2 million for 2006. The increase was primarily due to increased net income and accounts payable. Net cash used in investing activities during 2007 was $135.3 million compared to $201.4 million used in 2006. The difference is due to approximately $49.2 million less paid for acquisitions and $26.5 million received from the divestiture of selected STG plants completed in February 2007, partially offset by $12.0 million in increased capital expenditures. At December 31, 2007 we had approximately 9% of our treatment capacity in North America in incineration and approximately 91% in non incineration technologies, such as autoclaving and our proprietary patented ETD technology. The implementation of our commitment to move away from incineration in North America may result in a write down of the incineration equipment as and when we close incinerators that we are currently operating. The net book value of our North American incinerators was approximately $7.3 million, or 0.5% of our total assets. Our commitment to move away from incineration in North America is in the nature of a goal to be accomplished over an undetermined number of years. Because of uncertainties relating, among other things, to customer education and acceptance and legal requirements to incinerate portions of the medical waste, we do not have a timetable for this transition or specific plans to close any of our existing incinerators. Net cash used in financing activities was $32.6 million during 2007 compared to net cash provided of $52.5 million for 2006. Approximately $60.9 million of this difference is the result of an increase in the repurchase of and cancellation of common stock in 2007 compared to 2006, while another $18.5 million is related to the pay down of long term debt. 26 Table of Contents Contractual Cash Commitments: The following table displays our future contractual cash commitments: Payments due by period (dollars in thousands) Total 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 andAfter Long term debt(1) $ 782,585 $ 53,442 $ 106,955 $ 549,577 $ 72,611 Capital lease obligations(1) 1,875 683 990 202 Purchase obligations 1,057 642 415 Operating leases 138,568 31,083 50,208 28,552 28,725 Other long term liabilities(1)(2) 2,869 799 1,349 556 165 Total contractual cash obligations $ 926,954 $ 86,649 $ 159,917 $ 578,887 $ 101,501 (1) The long term debt, capital lease and other long term liabilities items include both the future principal payment amount as well as an amount calculated for expected future interest payments. For long term debt with variable rates of interest, management used judgment to estimate the future rate of interest. Other long term liabilities include amounts related to non compete agreements. (2) Excludes payments for unrecognized tax benefits. Based on the contingent and uncertain nature of our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make an estimate of the period of potential settlement, if any, with respective taxing authorities. At December 31, 2007 we had $139.4 million in stand by letters of credit issued. We anticipate that our operating cash flow, together with borrowings under our senior secured credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated future operating expenses, capital expenditures and debt service obligations as they become due during the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. Guarantees: We have guaranteed a loan to JPMorganChase Bank N.A. on behalf of Shiraishi Sogyo Co. Ltd (Shiraishi). Shiraishi is a customer in Japan that is expanding their medical waste management business and has a six month loan with a current balance of $4.3 million with JPMorganChase Bank N.A. that expires in May 2008. Management currently believes no amount will be paid under the guarantee. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are subject to market risks arising from changes in interest rates. Our potential additional interest expense over one year that would result from a hypothetical, instantaneous and unfavorable change of 100 basis points in the interest rate on all of our variable rate obligations would be approximately $4.9 million on a pre tax basis. We have exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and U.K. pound sterling (GBP) related to an 11 million GBP inter company loan to Stericycle International, Ltd., the parent company of White Rose Environmental. We use cash flow hedge accounting treatment on our forward contracts. Both the inter company loan balance and the forward contracts are marked to market at the end of each reporting period and the impact on the balances is recorded on the balance sheet to other comprehensive income. We have exposure to commodity pricing for gas and diesel fuel for our trucks and for the purchase of containers and boxes. We do not hedge these items to manage the exposure. 27 Table of Contents
