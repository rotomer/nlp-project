Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Item 8 of this Report. Introduction We are in the business of managing regulated waste and providing an array of related services. We operate in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, the United Kingdom and Ireland. For large quantity generators of regulated waste such as hospitals and for pharmaceutical companies and distributors, we offer: our institutional medical waste management services; our Bio Systems&reg; sharps management services to reduce the risk of needle sticks; a variety of products and services for infection control; and our regulated returns management services for expired or recalled products. For small quantity generators of regulated waste such as doctors offices and for retail pharmacies, we offer: our medical waste management services; our Steri Safe&reg; Occupational Safety and Health Act and HIPAA compliance programs; a variety of products and services for infection control; and our regulated returns services for expired or recalled products. We operate integrated national regulated waste management networks in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, the United Kingdom and Ireland. Our national networks include a total of 89 processing or combined processing and collection sites and 97 additional transfer, collection or combined transfer and collection sites. Our regulated waste processing technologies include autoclaving, our proprietary ETD, chemical treatment and incineration. As of December 31, 2008, we served approximately 418,000 customers worldwide, of which approximately 407,000 were small quantity customers and 11,000 were large quantity customers. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally 19 Table of Contents accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), the following ones may involve a higher degree of judgment on our part and greater complexity of reporting. Revenue Recognition: We recognize revenues for our regulated waste services at the time of waste collection. Payments received in advance are deferred and recognized as services are provided. Revenues from regulated returns management services are recorded at the time services are performed. Royalty revenues are calculated based on measurements specified in each contract or license and revenues are recognized at the end of each reporting period when the activity being measured has been completed. Revenues from product sales are recognized at the time the goods are shipped to the customer. Software licensing revenues are recognized on a prorated basis over the term of the license agreement. We do not have any contracts in a loss position. Losses would be recorded when known and estimable for any contracts that should go into a loss position. Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets: Goodwill associated with the excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired is not amortized. We have determined that our permits have indefinite lives and, accordingly, are not amortized. This position is in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS No. 142). See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Our balance sheet at December 31, 2008 contains goodwill of $1,135.8 million. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we evaluate on at least an annual basis, using the fair value of reporting units, whether goodwill is impaired. If we were to determine that a significant impairment has occurred, we would be required to incur non cash write offs of the impaired portion of goodwill that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the write off occurs. We use the market value of our stock compared to book as the current measurement of total fair value of our company. The performance of each of our reporting units is compared to that fair value ratio, and any unforeseen material drop in our stock price may be an indicator of a potential impairment of goodwill. The results of the 2008 impairment test conducted in June 2008 did not show any impairment of goodwill, and no events have occurred since that time that indicates that an impairment situation exists. Our permits are currently tested for impairment annually at December 31 or more frequently if circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. We use a discounted income approach model as the current measurement of the fair value of the permits. The estimate of income is based upon, among other things, certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and an appropriate discount rate determined by management. Our estimates of discounted income may differ from actual income due to, among other things, inaccuracies in economic estimates. The results of the 2008 impairment test did not show any impairment of our permits and no events have occurred since that time that would indicate an impairment situation exists. Other identifiable intangible assets, such as customer relationships, tradenames and covenants not to compete, are currently amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives. We have determined that our regulated waste customer relationships have between 20 year and 40 year lives based on the specific type of relationship. This determination was based on an independent study performed on our customer relationships. Although the regulated waste management business is highly competitive, we have been able to maintain high customer retention through contracts with automatic renewal provisions and excellent customer service. The valuation of our contractual customer relationships was derived using a discounted income approach valuation model similar to the method used for permit impairment testing mentioned earlier. These assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may be less than its undiscounted estimated future cash flows. There have been no indicators of impairment of these intangibles (see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 20 Table of Contents Income Taxes: Deferred income tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. To provide for certain potential tax exposures, we maintain a reserve for specific tax contingencies, the balance of which management believes is adequate, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). Accounts Receivable: Accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to us from our normal business activities. Accounts receivable balances are determined to be delinquent when the amount is past due based on the contractual terms with the customer. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected uncollectibility of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified among uncollected accounts. Accounts receivable are charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts when we have determined that the receivable will not be collected and or when the account has been referred to a third party collection agency. No single customer accounts for more than 2% of our revenues. Insurance: Our insurance for workers compensation, vehicle liability and physical damage, and employee related health care benefits is obtained using high deductible insurance polices. A third party administrator is used to process all such claims. We require all workers compensation, vehicle liability and physical damage claims to be reported within 24 hours. As a result, we accrue our workers compensation, vehicle and physical damage liability based upon the claim reserves established by the third party administrator at the end of each reporting period. Our employee health insurance benefit liability is based on our historical claims experience rate. Our earnings would be impacted to the extent that actual claims vary from historical experience. We review our accruals associated with the exposure to these liabilities for adequacy at the end of each reporting period. Litigation: We operate in a highly regulated industry and deal with regulatory inquiries or investigations from time to time that may be instituted for a variety of reasons. We are also involved in a variety of civil litigation from time to time. Settlements from litigation would be recorded when known, probable and estimable. Stock Option Plans: We have issued stock options to employees and directors as an integral part of our compensation programs. On January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R) using the modified prospective method to account for stock compensation costs. SFAS No. 123R requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based payment awards made to our employees and directors. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R, stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment, including estimating expected volatility, expected term and risk free rate. Our expected volatility is based upon historical experience. The expected term of the stock options is based upon a measure of historical volatility of our stock price. The risk free interest rate assumption is based upon the U.S. Treasury yield rates of a comparable period. If factors change and we employ different assumptions, stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past. New Accounting Pronouncements: For information about recently issued accounting pronouncements (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Fair Value Considerations: As required by SFAS No. 157, financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels. The impact of our creditworthiness has been considered in the fair value measurements noted below. In addition, under SFAS No. 157, the fair value measurement of a liability must reflect the nonperformance risk of an entity. At December 31, 2008, we have $9.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1.4 million of short term investments that we carry on our books at fair value using Level 1 inputs. 21 Table of Contents We have a cash flow hedge with an objective to offset foreign currency exchange risk to the U.S. dollar equivalent cash inflows on the settlement of a GBP denominated intercompany loan. The fair value of the hedge was calculated using Level 2 inputs and was recorded as a current asset of $2.3 million as of December 31, 2008. In October 2008, Stericycle entered into three interest rate swap contracts, covering $225 million of our borrowings outstanding under our senior credit facility. The objective of the swap is to reduce the risk of volatile interest expense by fixing the rate. The fair value of the hedge is calculated using Level 2 inputs and is recorded as a liability of $4.8 million, of which $2.1 million is current as of December 31, 2008. The fair value was determined using market data inputs to calculate expected future interest rates. The cash streams attributable to the difference between expected future rates and the fixed rate payable is discounted to arrive at the fair value of the three hedges. There were no movements of items between fair value hierarchies. Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 The following summarizes the Companys operations: In thousands, except per share data Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 $ % $ % Revenues $ 1,083,679 100.0 $ 932,767 100.0 Cost of revenues 573,554 52.9 491,789 52.7 Depreciation 25,096 2.3 23,057 2.5 Total cost of revenues 598,650 55.2 514,846 55.2 Gross profit 485,029 44.8 417,921 44.8 Selling, general and administrative expenses 194,158 17.9 168,657 18.1 Depreciation 5,013 0.5 4,423 0.5 Amortization 4,039 0.4 3,657 0.4 Total selling, general and administrative expenses 203,210 18.8 176,737 18.9 Gain on sale of assets (2,099 ) (0.2 ) Impairment of intangible assets 2,269 0.2 Impairment of fixed assets 472 0.0 1,261 0.1 Arbitration award and related costs 5,595 0.5 13,904 1.5 Acquisition integration expenses 1,513 0.1 1,305 0.1 Income from operations 274,239 25.3 224,544 24.1 Write down of investment 2,930 0.3 Insurance proceeds (3,300 ) (0.4 ) Net interest expense 32,174 3.0 32,375 3.5 Income tax expense 90,296 8.3 72,862 7.8 Net income $ 148,708 13.7 $ 118,378 12.7 Earnings per share Diluted $ 1.68 $ 1.32 Revenues: Our revenues increased $150.9 million, or 16.2%, to $1,083.7 million in 2008 from $932.8 million in 2007. Domestic revenues increased $109.4 million, or 15.2%, to $830.8 million from $721.4 million in 2007 as internal growth for domestic small account customers increased by approximately $52.5 million, over 13%, driven by an increase of Steri Safe customers. Revenues from domestic large account customers increased approximately $21.9 million, or over 9% as we increased the total number of accounts. Returns Management Services decreased revenues compared to 2007 by over $10.8 million due to lower than expected recall volumes. Domestic acquisitions less than one year old added an additional $45.8 million in revenues compared to 2007. 22 Table of Contents International revenues in 2008 were $252.9 million, compared to $211.4 million in 2007, an increase of $41.5 million or 19.6%. Internal growth, currency rate fluctuations, acquisitions, and the divestiture of some plants in the United Kingdom, impact the comparison of 2008 to 2007. Internal growth was $30.8 million. The effect of exchange rates negatively impacted international 2008 revenues by $11.3 million as foreign currencies depreciated against the U.S. dollar, acquisitions less than one year old favorably impacted revenues by $23.9 million. The divestiture of selected Sterile Technologies Group, Ltd., (STG) plants in the first quarter of 2007 negatively impacted the comparison to 2008 by $1.9 million. Cost of Revenues: Our 2008 cost of revenues increased $83.8 million, or $16.3%, to $598.6 million compared to $514.8 million in 2007. Domestic cost of revenues increased $65.1 million, or 17.6%, to $435.0 million in 2008 compared to $369.9 million for 2007. International cost of revenues increased $18.7 million, or 12.9%, to $163.6 million in 2008 compared to $144.9 million in 2007. Our gross margin percentage remained at 44.8% during 2008 and 2007. Domestic gross margin percentage decreased 1.1% to 47.6% during 2008 from 48.7% in 2007. Our domestic gross margin decrease was primarily the result of energy and transportation costs increases in 2008, which were partially offset by higher revenues related to energy surcharges. International gross margin increased 3.9% in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to integration of acquisitions and related efficiencies. In general, international gross margins are lower than domestic gross margins because the international operations have less penetration into the small quantity generator market, which has a better gross margin. Historically, the international operations have had most of their revenues from large national healthcare hospitals. As the international segment increases, consolidated gross margins receive downward pressure due this business mix shift, which can be offset by additional international small quantity market penetration, integration savings and domestic business expansion. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses: In 2008, our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $26.5 million, or 15.0%, to $203.2 million from $176.7 million in 2007. Amortization and depreciation expense, as a percentage of revenue, did not change from 2007 to 2008. Domestically, 2008 SG&A increased $18.1 million, or 12.6%, to $161.2 million from $143.1 million in 2007. The increase was primarily due to spending related to acquisitions, market penetration for our Bio Systems&reg; sharps management program and investments in the Steri Safe and returns management services. Internationally, our SG&A increased $8.4 million, or 25.0%, in 2008 to $42.0 million from $33.6 million in 2007, mostly due to acquisitions. Income from Operations: Income from operations increased by $49.7 million, or 22.1%, to $274.2 million in 2008 from $224.5 million in 2007. Comparisons of income from operations between 2008 and 2007 are affected by various charges not considered part of our day to day operations. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded expenses of $5.6 million related a business dispute settlement and related costs and $0.5 million related to fixed asset write offs. During the year ended December 31, 2007 we had charges totaling $17.4 million related to permit write offs, fixed asset write offs and settlement of arbitration proceedings in Australia. Those charges were partially offset by gains of $2.1 million from the sale of assets of STG and of Scherer Labs. Domestically, our income from operations increased $40.6 million, or 21.1%, to $233.4 million from $192.8 million in 2007. Internationally, our income from operations increased $9.1 million, or 28.7%, to $40.8 million from $31.7 million in 2006. Interest Expense and Interest Income: Interest expense slightly decreased to $33.1 million during 2008 from $34.0 million during 2007. The decrease is related to lower interest rates. Interest income was $0.9 million during 2008 and $1.6 million during 2007. 23 Table of Contents Write down of Investment: During 2007 we had a $2.9 million non cash write down of our investment in Medam B.A., an Argentine medical waste processing company. The write down was due to a legal restructuring of the Medam B.A. operations. Stericycle now is the sole owner of Medam B.A. Proceeds from Insurance: During 2007 we received $3.3 million of insurance proceeds related to the 3CI litigation settled in 2005. Income Tax Expense: Income tax expense for the years 2008 and 2007 reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 37.8% and 38.1%, respectively, for federal and state income taxes.

Domestic revenues increased $105.0 million, or 17.0%, to $721.4 million from $616.4 million in 2006 as internal growth for domestic small account customers increased by approximately $37.1 million, over 10%, driven by an increase of Steri Safe customers. Revenues from domestic large account customers increased approximately $13.1 million, or over 6% as we increased the total number of accounts and grew Bio Systems&reg; services. Returns Management Services increased revenues compared to 2006 by over $22.3 million from internal growth due to larger than expected recall volumes. Domestic acquisitions less than one year old added an additional $32.5 million in revenues compared to 2006. International revenues in 2007 were $211.4 million, compared to $173.2 million in 2006, an increase of $38.1 million or 22.0%. Internal growth, currency rate fluctuations, acquisitions, and the divestiture of some plants in the United Kingdom, impact the comparison of 2007 to 2006. Internal growth was $16.2 million. The 24 Table of Contents effect of exchange rates favorably impacted international 2007 revenues by $11.8 million as foreign currencies appreciated against the U.S. dollar, acquisitions less than one year old favorably impacted revenues by $24.5 million, while the divestiture at a gain of selected STG plants in the first quarter of 2007 negatively impacted the comparison to 2006 by $14.4 million. Cost of Revenues: Our 2007 cost of revenues increased $75.1 million, or $17.1%, to $514.8 million compared to $439.8 million in 2006. Domestic cost of revenues increased $47.4 million, or 14.7%, to $369.9 million in 2007 compared to $322.6 million for 2006. International cost of revenues increased $27.7 million, or 23.6%, to $144.9 million in 2007 compared to $117.2 million in 2006. Our gross margin percentage increased to 44.8% during 2007 from 44.3% during 2006. Domestic gross margin percentage improved 1.0% to 48.7% during 2007 from 47.7% in 2006. Our gross margin increase was primarily the result of increased number of small quantity customers, which have a better gross margin. Domestic energy and transportation costs increased in 2007, which were partially offset by higher revenues related to energy surcharges. International gross margin decreased 0.9% in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to acquisitions whose margins are lower. In general, international gross margins are lower than domestic gross margins because the international operations have less penetration into the small quantity generator market, which has a better gross margin. Historically, the international operations have had most of their revenues from large national healthcare hospitals. As the international segment increases, consolidated gross margins receive downward pressure due this business mix, which can be offset by additional international small quantity market penetration, integration savings and domestic business expansion. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses: In 2007, our SG&A expenses increased $32.4 million, or 22.4%, to $176.7 million from $144.4 million in 2006. Amortization and depreciation expense, as a percentage of revenue, did not change from 2006 to 2007. Domestically, 2007 SG&A increased $26.6 million, or 22.8%, to $143.1 million from $116.6 million in 2006. The increase was primarily due to spending related to market penetration for our Bio Systems&reg; sharps management program and investments in the Steri Safe and returns management services and acquisitions. Internationally, our SG&A increased $5.8 million, or 20.7%, in 2007 to $33.6 million from $27.8 million in 2006, mostly due to foreign exchange fluctuations (higher dollar costs as the dollar weakened versus other currencies) and acquisitions. As a percentage of revenue, international SG&A decreased 0.2%. This decrease reflects the ongoing efforts to integrate our businesses in the United Kingdom and Argentina. Income from Operations: Income from operations increased by $22.8 million, or 11.3%, to $224.5 million in 2007 from $201.8 million in 2006. Comparisons of income from operations between 2007 and 2006 are affected by various charges not considered part of our day to day operations. During the year ended December 31, 2007 we had charges totaling $17.4 million related to permit write offs, fixed asset write offs and settlement of arbitration proceedings in Australia. Those charges were partially offset by gains of $2.1 million from the sale of assets of STG and of Scherer Labs. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded expenses of $0.3 million related to fixed asset write downs. Domestically, our income from operations increased $17.7 million, or 10.1%, to $192.8 million from $175.1 million in 2006. Internationally, our income from operations increased $5.1 million, or 19.1%, to $31.7 million from $26.7 million in 2006. Interest Expense and Interest Income: Interest expense increased to $34.0 million during 2007 from $28.4 million during 2006. The increase of $5.6 million is related to higher debt levels incurred to finance acquisitions and stock repurchases. Interest income was $1.6 million during 2007 and $1.4 million during 2006. 25 Table of Contents Write down of Investment: During 2007 we had a $2.9 million non cash write down of our investment in Medam B.A., an Argentine medical waste processing company. The write down was due to a legal restructuring of the Medam B.A. operations. Stericycle now is the sole owner of Medam B.A. During 2006 we had a $1.0 million non cash write down of an investment in securities. Proceeds from Insurance: During 2007 we received $3.3 million of insurance proceeds related to the 3CI litigation settled in 2005. During 2006 we received $1.0 million of insurance proceeds related to the 3CI litigation settled in 2005. Income Tax Expense: Income tax expense for the years 2007 and 2006 reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 38.1% and 39.0%, respectively, for federal and state income taxes. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our senior credit facility of $850.0 million maturing in August 2012 requires us to comply with various financial, reporting and other covenants and restrictions, including a restriction on dividend payments. At December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with all of our financial debt covenants. At December 31, 2008 the margin for interest rates on borrowings under our new credit facility was 0.0% on base rate loans (at higher of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or (ii) the prime rate) and 0.75% on LIBOR loans. As of December 31, 2008, we had $439.8 million of borrowings outstanding under our senior unsecured credit facility, which includes foreign currency borrowings of $11.3 million. In addition, we had $212.3 million committed to outstanding letters of credit. The weighted average rate of interest on the unsecured revolving credit facility was 2.70% per annum which includes the amounts under our interest rate hedge. At December 31, 2008 we had $352.9 million in other debt outstanding, which includes promissory notes issued in connection with acquisitions during 2004 through 2008, seven year $100 million private placement notes at a fixed rate of 5.64%, other foreign subsidiary bank debt and capital leases. On April 15, 2008, we entered into a note purchase agreement with nine institutional purchasers pursuant to which we issued and sold to the purchasers $100 million of our 5.64% senior notes due April 15, 2015 (the notes). The notes bear interest at the fixed rate of 5.64% per annum. Interest is payable in arrears semi annually on April 15 and October 15 beginning on October 15, 2008, and principal is payable at the maturity of the notes on April 15, 2015. The notes are unsecured obligations and rank pari passu with our obligations under our senior unsecured credit facility pursuant to our credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A. and the other lenders party to the credit agreement. We applied the proceeds from the sale of the notes to reduce our borrowings under our revolving credit facility under our senior unsecured credit facility. The notes contain customary events of default, including our failure to pay any principal, interest or other amount when due, our violation of our affirmative or negative covenants or a breach of our representations and warranties. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, payment of the notes may be accelerated by the holders of the notes. Working Capital: At December 31, 2008, our working capital decreased $15.8 million to $44.8 million compared to $60.6 million at December 31, 2007. Current assets increased by $14.2 million primarily due to an $11.6 million increase in accounts receivable from increased revenues year over year. Current liabilities increased $29.9 million primarily due to an increase in accrued liabilities of $17.9 million and debt of $16.9 million. The major components contributing to the increase in accrued liabilities is a $12.0 million acquisition purchase accrual and a $2.5 million accrual for stock repurchases that settled after December 31, 2008. The major component to the increase in short term debt is notes issued for acquisitions made in 2008. Net Cash Provided or Used: Net cash provided by operating activities increased $36.5 million, or 21.0%, to $210.6 million during 2008 compared to $174.0 million for 2007. The increase in operating cash was primarily due to collections on higher revenues, which increased 16.2%. 26 Table of Contents Net cash used in investing activities during 2008 was $132.9 million compared to $135.3 million used in 2007. The difference is due to $26.5 million received from the divestiture of selected plants in the United Kingdom completed in February 2007, offset by $29.8 million less paid for acquisitions in 2008. Net cash used in financing activities was $77.9 million during 2008 compared to $32.6 million used in 2007. As described above, in 2008, we completed the private placement of $100 million in unsecured seven year notes, primarily used to pay down our revolver debt. Three was $16.6 million less in repayment of other long term debt during 2008 compared to 2007. Offsetting the decrease in debt repayment was an additional $63.7 million for the purchase of treasury stock in 2008. Contractual Obligations: The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and cash commitments as of December 31, 2008: Payments due by period (dollars in thousands) Total 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014and After Long term debt (1) $ 881,330 $ 58,053 $ 101,832 $ 518,341 $ 203,104 Capital lease obligations (1) 1,312 688 618 6 Operating leases 137,087 37,067 54,666 24,924 20,430 Purchase obligations 2,156 2,146 10 Other long term liabilities (1)(2) 2,070 772 1,001 264 33 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,023,955 $ 98,726 $ 158,127 $ 543,535 $ 223,567 (1) The long term debt, capital leases and other long term liabilities items include both the future principal payment amount as well as an amount calculated for expected future interest payments. For long term debt with floating rate of interest, management used judgment to estimate the future rate of interest. (2) Other long term liabilities include amounts related to non compete agreements. Excludes payments for unrecognized tax benefits. Based on the contingent and uncertain nature of our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make an estimate of the period of potential settlement, if any, with respective taxing authorities. At December 31, 2008 we had $212.3 million in stand by letters of credit issued. We anticipate that our operating cash flow, together with borrowings under our senior secured credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated future operating expenses, capital expenditures and debt service obligations as they become due during the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. Guarantees: We have guaranteed a loan to JPMorganChase Bank N.A. on behalf of Shiraishi Sogyo Co. Ltd (Shiraishi). Shiraishi is a customer in Japan that is expanding their regulated waste management business and has a one year loan with a current balance of $5.4 million with JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. that expires in May 2009. Management currently believes no amount will be paid under the guarantee. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are subject to market risks arising from changes in interest rates. Our potential additional interest expense over one year that would result from a hypothetical, instantaneous and unfavorable change of 100 basis points in the interest rate on all of our variable rate obligations would be approximately $2.5 million on a pre tax basis. 27 Table of Contents In October 2008, we entered into three interest rate derivative transactions that effectively fix the interest rate on the applicable notional amounts of our variable rate debt as follows: In thousands NotionalAmount FixedInterest Rate VariableInterest Rate ExpirationDate $ 125,000 2.79 % 1 Month Libor October 2009 $ 75,000 2.79 % 1 Month Libor April 2010 $ 25,000 2.94 % 1 Month Libor October 2010 The interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges; the notional amounts and all other significant terms of the swap agreement are matched to the provisions and terms of the variable rate debt hedged. We apply hedge accounting to account for these instruments. We have exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and U.K. pound sterling (GBP) related to an eight million GBP inter company loan to Stericycle International, Ltd., the parent company of White Rose Environmental, which we hedge with a forward contract. We use cash flow hedge accounting treatment on our forward contract. Both the inter company loan balance and the forward contract are marked to market at the end of each reporting period and the impact on the balances is recorded on the balance sheet to other comprehensive income. The forward contract expires in July 2009. We have exposure to commodity pricing for gas and diesel fuel for our trucks and for the purchase of containers and boxes. We do not hedge these items to manage the exposure. 28 Table of Contents
