Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Item 8 of this Report. Introduction We are in the business of managing regulated waste and providing an array of related services. We operate in the United States, Canada, Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Ireland, Portugal, Romania, and the United Kingdom. For large quantity generators of regulated waste such as hospitals and for pharmaceutical companies and distributors, we offer our institutional regulated waste management services; our Bio Systems&reg; sharps management services to reduce the risk of needle sticks; a variety of products and services for infection control; and our regulated returns and waste management services for expired or recalled products. For small quantity generators of regulated waste such as doctors offices and for retail pharmacies, we offer: our medical and regulated waste management services; our Steri Safe&reg; OSHA and HIPAA compliance programs; a variety of products and services for infection control; and our regulated returns services for expired or recalled products. We operate integrated national regulated waste management networks in the United States, Canada, Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Ireland, Portugal, Romania, and the United Kingdom. Our national networks include a total of 113 processing or combined processing and collection sites and 135 additional transfer, collection or combined transfer and collection sites. Our regulated waste processing technologies include autoclaving, our proprietary ETD, chemical treatment, and incineration. As of December 31, 2009, we served approximately 459,200 customers worldwide, of which approximately 447,900 were small quantity customers and 11,300 were large quantity customers. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and 19 Table of Contents judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), the following ones may involve a higher degree of judgment on our part and greater complexity of reporting. Revenue Recognition: We recognize revenues for our regulated waste services at the time of waste collection. Payments received in advance are deferred and recognized as services are provided. Revenues from regulated returns management services are recorded at the time services are performed. Revenues from product sales are recognized at the time the goods are shipped to the customer. Software licensing revenues are recognized on a prorated basis over the term of the license agreement. We do not have any contracts in a loss position. Losses would be recorded when known and estimable for any contracts that should go into a loss position. Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets: Goodwill associated with the excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired is not amortized. We have determined that our permits have indefinite lives and, accordingly, are not amortized (see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). Our balance sheet at December 31, 2009 contains goodwill of $1.394 billion. In accordance with accounting standards, we evaluate on at least an annual basis, using the fair value of reporting units, whether goodwill is impaired. If we were to determine that a significant impairment has occurred, we would be required to incur non cash write offs of the impaired portion of goodwill that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the write off occurs. We use the market value of our stock compared to book as the current measurement of total fair value of our company. The performance of each of our reporting units is compared to that fair value ratio, and any unforeseen material drop in our stock price may be an indicator of a potential impairment of goodwill. The results of the 2009 impairment test conducted in June 2009 did not show any impairment of goodwill, and no events have occurred since that time that indicates that an impairment situation exists. Our permits are tested for impairment annually at December 31 or more frequently if circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. We use a discounted income approach model as the current measurement of the fair value of the permits. The estimate of income is based upon, among other things, certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and an appropriate discount rate determined by management. Our estimates of discounted income may differ from actual income due to, among other things, inaccuracies in economic estimates. The results of the 2009 impairment test did not show any impairment of our permits and no events have occurred since that time that would indicate an impairment situation exists. Other identifiable intangible assets, such as customer relationships, tradenames, and covenants not to compete, are currently amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives. We have determined that our regulated waste customer relationships have between 15 year and 40 year lives based on the specific type of relationship. This determination was based on an independent study performed on our customer relationships. Although the regulated waste management business is highly competitive, we have been able to maintain high customer retention through contracts with automatic renewal provisions and excellent customer service. The valuation of our contractual customer relationships was derived using a discounted income approach valuation model similar to the method used for permit impairment testing mentioned earlier. These assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may be less than its undiscounted estimated future cash flows. There have been no indicators of impairment of these intangibles (see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 20 Table of Contents Income Taxes: We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We compute our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. Significant judgments are required in order to determine the realizability of these deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we evaluate all significant available positive and negative evidence, including historical operating results, estimates of future taxable income and the existence of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Changes in the expectations regarding the realization of deferred tax assets could materially impact income tax expense in future periods. To provide for certain potential tax exposures, we maintain a reserve for specific tax contingencies, the balance of which management believes is adequate. Accounts Receivable: Accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to us from our normal business activities. Accounts receivable balances are determined to be delinquent when the amount is past due based on the contractual terms with the customer. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected uncollectibility of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified among uncollected accounts. Accounts receivable are charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts when we have determined that the receivable will not be collected and or when the account has been referred to a third party collection agency. No single customer accounts for more than 2% of our revenues. Insurance: Our insurance for workers compensation, vehicle liability and physical damage, and employee related health care benefits is obtained using high deductible insurance policies. A third party administrator is used to process all such claims. We require all workers compensation, vehicle liability and physical damage claims to be reported within 24 hours. As a result, we accrue our workers compensation, vehicle and physical damage liability based upon the claim reserves established by the third party administrator at the end of each reporting period. Our employee health insurance benefit liability is based on our historical claims experience rate. Our earnings would be impacted to the extent that actual claims vary from historical experience. We review our accruals associated with the exposure to these liabilities for adequacy at the end of each reporting period. Litigation: We operate in a highly regulated industry and deal with regulatory inquiries or investigations from time to time that may be instituted for a variety of reasons. We are also involved in a variety of civil litigation from time to time. Settlements from litigation would be recorded when known, probable and estimable. Stock Option Plans: We have issued stock options to employees and directors as an integral part of our compensation programs. Stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment, including estimating expected volatility, expected term and risk free rate. Our expected volatility is based upon historical experience. The expected term of the stock options is based upon a measure of historical volatility of our stock price. The risk free interest rate assumption is based upon the U.S. Treasury yield rates of a comparable period. If factors change and we employ different assumptions, stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past. New Accounting Pronouncements: For information about recently issued accounting pronouncements (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Fair Value Considerations: Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels. The impact of our creditworthiness has been considered in the fair value measurements noted below. In addition, the fair value measurement of a liability must reflect the nonperformance risk of an entity. 21 Table of Contents At December 31, 2009, we have $15.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1.1 million of short term investments that we carry on our books at fair value using Level 1 inputs. At December 31, 2009, we have two interest rate swap contracts, covering $100 million of our borrowings outstanding under our term loan facility. The objective of the swap is to reduce the risk of volatile interest expense by fixing the rate. The fair value of the hedge is calculated using Level 2 inputs and is recorded as a current liability of $1.2 million. The fair value was determined using market data inputs to calculate expected future interest rates. The cash streams attributable to the difference between expected future rates and the fixed rate payable is discounted to arrive at the fair value of the two hedges. As part of our acquisition accounting, we assign fair values to identifiable intangible assets; primarily customer relationships and operating permits. We use a discounted income approach whereby the expected after tax cash flows of the acquired entity are present valued. We use the financial information provided by the acquired company, and management assumptions related to future growth to determine expected future cash flows. We use data provided by unaffiliated external parties as well as internal financial information to calculate a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for the acquired company. The expected cash flows and the calculated WACC are significant inputs in determining the fair value of our intangibles. During 2009, we assigned $70.0 million to customer relationships and $21.0 million to facility environmental permits using Level 3 inputs. Restructuring Costs: In December of 2009, we announced the consolidation of operations within our Returns Management Services business. This consolidation will result in the closure of our facilities in Boynton Beach, Florida and Conyers, Georgia. The operations of those facilities will be moved to our Indianapolis, Indiana location. We have recognized $1.6 million in expense during the fourth quarter of 2009 related to this restructuring, of which $0.9 million was fixed asset write offs and $0.7 was primarily severance, which will be paid during 2010. We estimate an additional $1.6 million in expense during 2010 of which approximately $0.8 million will be related to severance and other employee expenses, and $0.8 million will be related to lease and related occupancy charges. We expect that our restructuring will be completed by the end of 2010. We believe this restructuring will allow us to maximize the efficiency of our Returns Management Services business at a single location and management infrastructure. 22 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 The following summarizes the Companys operations: In thousands, except per share data Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 $ % $ % Revenues $ 1,177,736 100.0 $ 1,083,679 100.0 Cost of revenues 595,608 50.6 573,554 52.9 Restructuring costs 704 0.1 Depreciation 29,028 2.5 25,096 2.3 Total cost of revenues 625,340 53.1 598,650 55.2 Gross profit 552,396 46.9 485,029 44.8 Selling, general and administrative expenses 216,911 18.4 194,158 17.9 Depreciation 5,572 0.5 5,013 0.5 Amortization 5,390 0.5 4,039 0.4 Total selling, general and administrative expenses 227,873 19.3 203,210 18.8 Restructuring costs and impairment of fixed assets 905 0.1 472 0.0 Transactional expenses related to acquisitions 7,333 0.6 Arbitration award and related costs 5,595 0.5 Acquisition integration expenses 1,096 0.1 1,513 0.1 Income from operations 315,189 26.8 274,239 25.3 Net interest expense 34,132 2.9 32,174 3.0 Income tax expense 101,299 8.6 90,296 8.3 Net income 176,389 15.0 148,771 13.7 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 698 0.1 63 0.0 Net income attributable to Stericycle, Inc. $ 175,691 14.9 $ 148,708 13.7 Earnings per share Diluted $ 2.03 $ 1.68 Revenues: Our revenues increased $94.1 million, or 8.7%, to $1.18 billion in 2009 from $1.08 billion in 2008. Domestic revenues increased $81.8 million, or 9.8%, to $912.6 million from $830.8 million in 2008 as internal growth for domestic small account customers increased by approximately $39.6 million, over 8%, driven by an increase of Steri Safe revenues. Revenues from domestic large account customers increased approximately $12.1 million, or over 4%, as we increased the total number of accounts and expanded our Sharps Management program. Returns Management Services revenues decreased by $22.3 million compared to 2008 due to lower than expected recall volumes. Domestic acquisitions less than one year old added an additional $52.4 million to the growth in revenues compared to 2008. International revenues in 2009 were $265.1 million, compared to $252.9 million in 2008, an increase of $12.3 million, or 4.9%. Internal growth, currency rate fluctuations and acquisitions impact the comparison of 2009 to 2008. Internal growth was $18.3 million. The effect of exchange rates negatively impacted international 2009 revenues by $38.1 million as foreign currencies depreciated against the U.S. dollar. Acquisitions less than one year old favorably impacted revenue growth by $32.1 million. Cost of Revenues: Our 2009 cost of revenues increased $26.7 million, or $4.5%, to $625.3 million compared to $598.6 million in 2008. Domestic cost of revenues increased $23.3 million, or 5.4%, to $458.3 million in 2009 compared to $435.0 million for 2008. International cost of revenues increased $3.4 million, or 2.1%, to $167.0 million in 2009 compared to $163.6 million in 2008. Our gross margin percentage increased to 46.9% during 2009 from 44.8% during 2008. Domestic gross margin percentage increased 2.2% to 49.8% during 2009 from 47.6% in 2008. Our domestic gross profit for 2009 23 Table of Contents was unfavorably impacted by $0.7 million of restructuring costs for our Regulated Returns Management Services business. Lower gross margin in 2008 was primarily the result of energy and transportation costs increases in 2008, which were partially offset by higher revenues related to energy surcharges. International gross margin improved 1.7 percentage points in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to integration of acquisitions and related efficiencies. In general, international gross margins are lower than domestic gross margins because the international operations have less penetration into the small quantity generator market, which has a better gross margin. Historically, the international operations have had most of their revenues from large national healthcare hospitals. As the international revenues increase, consolidated gross margins receive downward pressure due to this business mix shift, which can be offset by additional international small quantity market penetration, integration savings and domestic business expansion. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses: In 2009, our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, excluding acquisition related costs, increased $24.7 million, or 12.1%, to $227.9 million from $203.2 million in 2008. Amortization and depreciation expense as a percentage of revenue slightly increased to 0.9% in 2009 from 0.8% in 2008. Domestically, 2009 SG&A increased $21.4 million, or 13.2%, to $182.6 million from $161.2 million in 2008. The increase was primarily due to spending related to acquisitions, market penetration for our Bio Systems&reg; sharps management and pharma waste programs and investments in the Steri Safe services. Internationally, our SG&A increased $3.3 million, or 7.9%, in 2009 to $45.3 million from $42.0 million in 2008, mostly due to acquisitions. Income from Operations: Income from operations increased by $41.0 million, or 14.9%, to $315.2 million in 2009 from $274.2 million in 2008. Comparisons of income from operations between 2009 and 2008 are affected by various charges not considered part of our day to day operations. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized $7.3 million in transactional expenses as result of adopting changes issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) to accounting rules related to business combinations and $0.9 million of restructuring costs for our regulated returns management services business. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded expenses of $5.6 million related a business dispute settlement and related costs and $0.5 million related to fixed asset write offs. Domestically, our income from operations increased $31.5 million, or 13.5%, to $264.9 million in 2009 from $233.4 million in 2008. Internationally, our income from operations increased $9.5 million, or 23.4%, to $50.3 million in 2009 from $40.8 million in 2008. Interest Expense and Interest Income: Interest expense increased to $34.4 million during 2009 from $33.1 million during 2008 due to higher borrowings in 2009. Interest income was $0.3 million during 2009 and $0.9 million during 2008. Income Tax Expense: Income tax expense for the years 2009 and 2008 reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 36.5% and 37.8%, respectively, for federal and state income taxes. In 2009 we recognized a net $1.8 million benefit related to prior years unrecognized tax benefits. 24 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 The following summarizes the Companys operations: In thousands, except per share data Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 $ % $ % Revenues $ 1,083,679 100.0 $ 932,767 100.0 Cost of revenues 573,554 52.9 491,789 52.7 Depreciation 25,096 2.3 23,057 2.5 Total cost of revenues 598,650 55.2 514,846 55.2 Gross profit 485,029 44.8 417,921 44.8 Selling, general and administrative expenses 194,158 17.9 168,657 18.1 Depreciation 5,013 0.5 4,423 0.5 Amortization 4,039 0.4 3,657 0.4 Total selling, general and administrative expenses 203,210 18.8 176,737 18.9 Gain on sale of assets (2,099 ) (0.2 ) Impairment of intangible assets 2,269 0.2 Impairment of fixed assets 472 0.0 1,261 0.1 Arbitration award and related costs 5,595 0.5 13,904 1.5 Acquisition integration expenses 1,513 0.1 1,305 0.1 Income from operations 274,239 25.3 224,544 24.1 Write down of investment 2,930 0.3 Insurance proceeds (3,300 ) (0.4 ) Net interest expense 32,174 3.0 32,375 3.5 Income tax expense 90,296 8.3 72,862 7.8 Net income 148,711 13.7 118,653 12.7 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 63 0.0 275 0.0 Net income attributable to Stericycle, Inc. $ 148,708 13.7 $ 118,378 12.7 Earnings per share Diluted $ 1.68 $ 1.32 Revenues: Our revenues increased $150.9 million, or 16.2%, to $1.08 billion in 2008 from $932.8 million in 2007. Domestic revenues increased $109.4 million, or 15.2%, to $830.8 million from $721.4 million in 2007 as internal growth for domestic small account customers increased by approximately $52.5 million, over 13%, driven by an increase of Steri Safe customers. Revenues from domestic large account customers increased approximately $21.9 million, or over 9% as we increased the total number of accounts. Returns Management Services revenues decreased by over $10.8 million compared to 2007 due to lower than expected recall volumes. Domestic acquisitions less than one year old added an additional $45.8 million in revenues compared to 2007. International revenues in 2008 were $252.9 million, compared to $211.4 million in 2007, an increase of $41.5 million, or 19.6%. Internal growth, currency rate fluctuations, acquisitions, and the divestiture of some plants in the United Kingdom, impact the comparison of 2008 to 2007. Internal growth was $30.8 million. The effect of exchange rates negatively impacted international 2008 revenues by $11.3 million as foreign currencies depreciated against the U.S. dollar. Acquisitions less than one year old favorably impacted revenues by $23.9 million. The divestiture of selected Sterile Technologies Group, Ltd., (STG) plants in the first quarter of 2007 negatively impacted the comparison to 2008 by $1.9 million. Cost of Revenues: Our 2008 cost of revenues increased $83.8 million, or $16.3%, to $598.6 million compared to $514.8 million in 2007. Domestic cost of revenues increased $65.1 million, or 17.6%, to $435.0 million in 2008 compared to $369.9 million for 2007. International cost of revenues increased $18.7 million, or 12.9%, to $163.6 million in 2008 compared to $144.9 million in 2007. 25 Table of Contents Our gross margin percentage remained at 44.8% during 2008 and 2007. Domestic gross margin percentage decreased 1.1% to 47.6% during 2008 from 48.7% in 2007. Our domestic gross margin decrease was primarily the result of energy and transportation costs increases in 2008, which were partially offset by higher revenues related to energy surcharges. International gross margin increased 3.9% in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to integration of acquisitions and related efficiencies. In general, international gross margins are lower than domestic gross margins because the international operations have less penetration into the small quantity generator market, which has a better gross margin. Historically, the international operations have had most of their revenues from large national healthcare hospitals. As the international segment increases, consolidated gross margins receive downward pressure due to this business mix shift, which can be offset by additional international small quantity market penetration, integration savings and domestic business expansion. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses: In 2008, SG&A expenses increased $26.5 million, or 15.0%, to $203.2 million from $176.7 million in 2007. Amortization and depreciation expense, as a percentage of revenue, did not change from 2007 to 2008. Domestically, 2008 SG&A increased $18.1 million, or 12.6%, to $161.2 million from $143.1 million in 2007. The increase was primarily due to spending related to acquisitions, market penetration for our Bio Systems&reg; sharps management program and investments in the Steri Safe and returns management services. Internationally, our SG&A increased $8.4 million, or 25.0%, in 2008 to $42.0 million from $33.6 million in 2007, mostly due to acquisitions. Income from Operations: Income from operations increased by $49.7 million, or 22.1%, to $274.2 million in 2008 from $224.5 million in 2007. Comparisons of income from operations between 2008 and 2007 are affected by various charges not considered part of our day to day operations. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded expenses of $5.6 million related a business dispute settlement and related costs and $0.5 million related to fixed asset write offs. During the year ended December 31, 2007 we had charges totaling $17.4 million related to permit write offs, fixed asset write offs and settlement of arbitration proceedings in Australia. Those charges were partially offset by gains of $2.1 million from the sale of assets of STG and of Scherer Labs. Domestically, our income from operations increased $40.6 million, or 21.1%, to $233.4 million from $192.8 million in 2007. Internationally, our income from operations increased $9.1 million, or 28.7%, to $40.8 million from $31.7 million in 2006. Interest Expense and Interest Income: Interest expense slightly decreased to $33.1 million during 2008 from $34.0 million during 2007. The decrease is related to lower interest rates. Interest income was $0.9 million during 2008 and $1.6 million during 2007. Write down of Investment: During 2007 we had a $2.9 million non cash write down of our investment in Medam B.A., an Argentine medical waste processing company. The write down was due to a legal restructuring of the Medam B.A. operations. Stericycle now is the sole owner of Medam B.A. Proceeds from Insurance: During 2007 we received $3.3 million of insurance proceeds related to the 3CI litigation settled in 2005. Income Tax Expense: Income tax expense for the years 2008 and 2007 reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 37.8% and 38.1%, respectively, for federal and state income taxes. 26 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Our $850 million senior credit facility maturing in August 2012, our $215 million term loan maturing in June 2012, and our $100 million private placement notes maturing April 2015, all require us to comply with various financial, reporting and other covenants and restrictions, including a restriction on dividend payments. The financial debt covenants are the same for the senior credit facility, the term loan credit agreement and the private placement notes. At December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with all of our financial debt covenants. As of December 31, 2009, we had $381.6 million of borrowings outstanding under our $850 million senior unsecured credit facility, which includes foreign currency borrowings of $31.1 million. We also had $223.7 million committed to outstanding letters of credit under this facility. The unused portion of the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2009 was $244.7 million. At December 31, 2009, our interest rates on borrowings under our revolving credit facility were For short term borrowing (less than one month): Federal funds rate plus 0.5% or prime rate, whichever is higher; and For borrowing greater than one month: LIBOR plus 0.75%. The weighted average rate of interest on the unsecured revolving credit facility was 1.0% per annum. As of December 31, 2009, we had $215 million term loan debt outstanding which was entered into during 2009 with several lenders maturing in June 2012. Term loans under the term loan credit agreement bear interest at fluctuating interest rates determined, for any one month or other applicable interest period, by reference to the LIBOR plus the applicable margin provided in the term loan agreement. The applicable margin is based on our consolidated leverage ratio and ranges from 2.75% to 3.50%. As of December 31, 2009, the applicable margin was 3.0%. The weighted average rate of interest on the term loan was 5.8% per annum which includes the amounts under our interest rate hedge. After the first year, we are required to make quarterly principal payments of 2.5% of the principal amount of the outstanding term loans, and the remainder at maturity. As of December 31, 2009, we had $100 million outstanding 5.64% private placement notes which we entered into on April 15, 2008 with nine institutional purchasers. The notes bear interest at the fixed rate of 5.64% per annum. Interest is payable in arrears semi annually on April 15 and October 15 beginning on October 15, 2009, and principal is payable at the maturity of the notes on April 15, 2015. At December 31, 2009, we had $292.2 million in other debt outstanding, which includes promissory notes issued in connection with acquisitions during 2004 through 2009, other foreign subsidiary bank debt, and capital leases. Working Capital: At December 31, 2009, our working capital decreased by $19.0 million to $25.8 million compared to $44.8 million at December 31, 2008. Of the decrease in working capital, $27.1 million increase in current debt relates to financing of foreign and domestic acquisitions in 2009, partially offset by a reduction of accrued liabilities related to a $12.0 million payment of an acquisition purchase accrual. Net Cash Provided or Used: Net cash provided by operating activities increased $66.7 million, or 31.7%, to $277.2 million during 2009 compared to $210.6 million for 2008. The increase in operating cash was primarily due to an increase in net income of 18.1%, improved collections, and increase in accounts payable. Net cash used in investing activities during 2009 was $350.2 million compared to $132.9 million used in 2008. The difference is due to $226.9 million more paid for acquisitions in 2009, partially offset by $7.6 million less spent for capital expenditures. Net cash provided by financing activities was $81.8 million during 2009 compared to $77.9 million net cash used in 2008. As described above, in 2009, we entered into $215 million term loan credit agreement. In 2008, we completed the private placement of $100 million in unsecured seven year notes, primarily used to pay down our revolver debt. There was $91.7 million less of the purchase of treasury stock in 2009. 27 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and cash commitments as of December 31, 2009: Payments due by period (dollars in thousands) Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 andAfter Long term debt(1) $ 1,084,770 $ 92,393 $ 743,652 $ 100,286 $ 148,439 Capital lease obligations(1) 6,400 3,032 2,380 311 677 Operating leases 196,931 41,483 59,308 30,375 65,765 Purchase obligations 505 409 96 Other long term liabilities(1)(2) 7,698 1,002 1,545 998 4,153 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,296,304 $ 138,319 $ 806,981 $ 131,970 $ 219,034 (1) The long term debt, capital leases, and other long term liabilities items include both the future principal payment amount as well as an amount calculated for expected future interest payments. For long term debt with floating rate of interest, management used judgment to estimate the future rate of interest. (2) Other long term liabilities include amounts related to non compete agreements and exclude payments for unrecognized tax benefits. Based on the contingent and uncertain nature of our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make an estimate of the period of potential settlement, if any, with respective taxing authorities. At December 31, 2009, we had $223.7 million in stand by letters of credit issued. We anticipate that our operating cash flow, together with borrowings under our senior secured credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated future operating expenses, capital expenditures and debt service obligations as they become due during the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. Guarantees: We have guaranteed a loan to JPMorganChase Bank N.A. on behalf of Shiraishi Sogyo Co. Ltd (Shiraishi). Shiraishi is a customer in Japan that is expanding their medical waste management business and has a one year loan with a current balance of $5.2 million with JPMorganChase Bank N.A. that expires in May 2010. We also have notes receivable to Shiraihsi for approximately $14.9 million in support of their medical waste business. These amounts are collateralized with the assets of Shiraishi and related companies. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are subject to market risks arising from changes in interest rates. Our potential additional interest expense over one year that would result from a hypothetical, instantaneous and unfavorable change of 100 basis points in the interest rate on all of our variable rate obligations would be approximately $5.5 million on a pre tax basis. 28 Table of Contents In October 2008, Stericycle entered into three interest rate swap contracts covering $225 million of our borrowings outstanding under our senior credit facility. The objective of the swap is to reduce the risk of volatile interest expense by fixing the rate. In October 2009 we settled one interest rate swap with the notional value of $125 million. The remaining two contracts are as follows: In thousands NotionalAmount FixedInterest Rate VariableInterest Rate ExpirationDate $75,000 2.79 % 1 Month Libor April 2010 $25,000 2.94 % 1 Month Libor October 2010 The interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges; the notional amounts and all other significant terms of the swap agreement are matched to the provisions and terms of the variable rate debt hedged. We apply hedge accounting to account for these instruments. We have exposure to commodity pricing for gas and diesel fuel for our trucks and for the purchase of containers and boxes. We do not hedge these items to manage the exposure. 29 Table of Contents
