Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Item 8 of this Report. Introduction We are in the business of managing regulated waste and providing an array of related services. We operate in the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, Portugal, Romania, and the United Kingdom. For large quantity generators of regulated waste such as hospitals and for pharmaceutical companies and distributors, we offer our institutional regulated waste management services; our Bio Systems&reg; sharps management services to reduce the risk of needle sticks; a variety of products and services for infection control; and our regulated returns and waste management services for expired or recalled products. For small quantity generators of regulated waste such as doctors offices and for retail pharmacies, we offer: our medical and regulated waste management services; our Steri Safe&reg; OSHA and HIPAA compliance programs; a variety of products and services for infection control; and our regulated returns and recall services for expired or recalled products. We operate integrated national regulated waste management networks domestically and internationally. Our national networks include a total of 136 processing or combined processing and collection sites and 129 additional transfer, collection or combined transfer and collection sites. Our regulated waste processing technologies include autoclaving, our proprietary ETD, chemical treatment, and incineration. As of December 31, 2010, we served over 485,000 customers worldwide, of which over 472,000 were small quantity customers and over 13,000 were large quantity customers. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), the following ones may involve a higher degree of judgment on our part and greater complexity of reporting. Revenue Recognition: Revenues for our regulated waste management services, other than our Steri Safe service, are recognized at the time of waste collection. Our Steri Safe revenues are recognized evenly over the contractual service period. Payments received in advance are deferred and recognized as services are provided. Revenues from regulated returns and recall management services are recorded at the time services are performed. 19 Table of Contents Revenues from product sales are recognized at the time the goods are shipped to the customer. We do not have any contracts in a loss position. Losses would be recorded when known and estimable for any contracts that should go into a loss position. Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets: Goodwill associated with the excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired is not amortized. We have determined that our permits have indefinite lives and, accordingly, are not amortized (see Note 12 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). Our balance sheet at December 31, 2010 contains goodwill of $1.6 billion. In accordance with accounting standards, we evaluate on at least an annual basis, using the fair value of reporting units, whether goodwill is impaired. If we were to determine that a significant impairment has occurred, we would be required to incur non cash charges of the impaired portion of goodwill that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the impairment charge occurs. We use the market value of our stock compared to book value as the current measurement of total fair value of our Company. The performance of each of our reporting units is compared to that fair value ratio, and any unforeseen material drop in our stock price may be an indicator of a potential impairment of goodwill. During the quarter ended June 30, 2010 we performed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation for our three reporting units, Domestic Regulated Waste, Domestic Regulated Returns and Recall Management Services, and Foreign Countries. We performed two impairment tests, one using a market approach and the other using an income approach. Both the market and income approaches indicated no impairment to goodwill to any of our three reporting units. Market Approach: Our market approach begins by calculating the market capitalization of the Company using the average stock price for the prior 30 days and the outstanding share count at June 30, 2010. We then look at the Companys Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA), adjusted for stock compensation expense and other adjustments, such as a gain on sale of divested assets, for the prior twelve months. The calculated market capitalization is divided by the modified EBITDA to arrive at a valuation multiple. The fair value of each reporting unit is then calculated by taking the product of the valuation multiple and the trailing twelve month modified EBITDA of that reporting unit. The fair value was then compared to the reporting units book value and determined to be in excess of the book value. We believe that starting with the fair value of the Company as a whole is a reasonable measure as that fair value is then allocated to each reporting unit based on that reporting units individual earnings. A sustained drop in our stock price would have a negative impact to our fair value calculations. A temporary drop in earnings of a reporting unit would have a negative impact to our fair value calculations. The results of our goodwill impairment test using the market approach indicated the fair value of our Domestic Regulated Waste and Foreign Countries reporting units exceeded book value by a substantial amount, in excess of 100% of book value. As of June 30, 2010 our Regulated Returns and Recall Management Services reporting unit fair value exceeded book value in excess of 30%, and had $119.9 million in assigned goodwill. Income Approach: The income approach uses expected future cash flows of each reporting unit and discounts those cash flows to a present value. Expected future cash flows are calculated using management assumptions of internal growth, capital expenditures, and cost efficiencies. Future acquisitions are not included in the expected future cash flows. We use a discount rate based on our Company calculated Weighted Average Cost of Capital which is adjusted for each of our reporting units based on risk size premium and foreign country premium. Significant assumptions used in the income approach include realization of future cash flows and the discount rate used to present value those cash flows. The results of our goodwill impairment test using the income approach indicated the fair value all of our reporting units exceeded book value by a substantial amount; in excess of 100% of book value. 20 Table of Contents Our permits are tested for impairment annually at December 31 or more frequently if circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. We use either a discounted income or cost savings model as the current measurement of the fair value of the permits. The fair value is based upon, among other things, certain assumptions about expected future operating performance, internal and external processing costs, and an appropriate discount rate determined by management. Our estimates of discounted income may differ from actual income due to, among other things, inaccuracies in economic estimates. In 2010, we wrote off $0.6 million for the permit intangibles of two redundant domestic treatment locations. Other identifiable intangible assets, such as customer relationships, tradenames, and covenants not to compete, are currently amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives. We have determined that our regulated waste customer relationships have between 15 year and 40 year lives based on the specific type of relationship. This determination was based on an independent study performed on our customer relationships. Although the regulated waste management business is highly competitive, we have been able to maintain high customer retention through contracts with automatic renewal provisions and excellent customer service. The valuation of our contractual customer relationships was derived using a discounted income approach valuation model. These assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may be less than its undiscounted estimated future cash flows. There have been no indicators of impairment of these intangibles (see Note 12 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Income Taxes: We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We compute our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. Significant judgments are required in order to determine the realizability of these deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we evaluate all significant available positive and negative evidence, including historical operating results, estimates of future taxable income and the existence of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Changes in the expectations regarding the realization of deferred tax assets could materially impact income tax expense in future periods. To provide for certain potential tax exposures, we maintain a reserve for specific tax contingencies, the balance of which management believes is adequate. Accounts Receivable: Accounts receivable consists of amounts due to us from our normal business activities and are carried at their estimated collectible amounts. Accounts receivable balances are determined to be delinquent when the amount is past due based on the contractual terms with the customer. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected uncollectibility of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified among uncollected accounts. Accounts receivable are charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts when we have determined that the receivable will not be collected. Accounts receivable referred to a third party collection agency are written off if uncollected after 120 days. No single customer accounts for more than 2% of our accounts receivable. Insurance: Our insurance for workers compensation, vehicle liability and physical damage, and employee related health care benefits is obtained using high deductible insurance policies. A third party administrator is used to process all such claims. We require all workers compensation, vehicle liability and physical damage claims to be reported within 24 hours. As a result, we accrue our workers compensation, vehicle and physical damage liability based upon the claim reserves established by the third party administrator at the end of each reporting period. Our employee health insurance benefit liability is based on our historical claims experience rate. Our earnings would be impacted to the extent that actual claims vary from historical experience. We review our accruals associated with the exposure to these liabilities for adequacy at the end of each reporting period. 21 Table of Contents Litigation: We operate in a highly regulated industry and deal with regulatory inquiries or investigations from time to time that may be instituted for a variety of reasons. We are also involved in a variety of civil litigation from time to time. Settlements from litigation would be recorded when known, probable and estimable. Stock Option Plans: We have issued stock options to employees and directors as an integral part of our compensation programs. Stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment, including estimating expected volatility of our stock, expected term of the award, and the risk free rate. Our stocks expected volatility is based upon historical experience. The expected term of the awards is based upon a measure of historical volatility of our stock price. The risk free interest rate assumption is based upon the U.S. Treasury yield rates of a comparable period. If factors change and we employ different assumptions, stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past. New Accounting Pronouncements: For information about recently issued accounting pronouncements see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Fair Value Considerations: Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels. The impact of our creditworthiness has been considered in the fair value measurements noted below. In addition, the fair value measurement of a liability must reflect the nonperformance risk of an entity. At December 31, 2010, we had $77.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and $18.5 million of short term investments that we record at fair value using Level 1 inputs. At December 31, 2010, we had no derivative instruments. Restructuring Costs: In December of 2009, we announced the consolidation of operations within our returns and recall management services (RMS) business. This consolidation resulted in the closure of our facilities in Boynton Beach, Florida and Conyers, Georgia. The operations of those facilities have been moved to our Indianapolis, Indiana location. We have recognized expense of $1.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2009, and $2.2 million during 2010. We have an accrual balance of $0.3 million related to the RMS restructuring at December 31, 2010. We estimate immaterial additional expense during 2011. We believe this restructuring will allow us to maximize the efficiency of our RMS business at a single location and management infrastructure. In December 2010, we reorganized the structure of our international management group in order to leverage strong local management. We recognized $5.4 million in expense related to this restructuring, of which $3.3 million was related to stock options. We had an accrual balance of $1.8 million related to this reorganization at December 31, 2010 which will be paid primarily during 2011 with some additional disbursements in 2012. In addition to the restructuring charges, we recognized $0.9 million in non cash expenses during 2010 related to the consolidation of redundant plant operations. Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 Highlights for the year ended December 31, 2010 included the following: revenues grew to $1.44 billion, a 22.2% increase over $1.18 billion in 2009; gross margins decreased to 46.4% in 2010 from 46.9% in 2009; operating income was $370.7 million, a 17.6% increase from $315.2 million for 2009; 22 Table of Contents we incurred a net $15.8 million in expenses related to restructuring and plant closure, acquisitions, litigation settlement, and gain on sale of assets and; cash flow from operations was $325.7 million. The following summarizes the Companys operations: In thousands, except per share data Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 $ % $ % Revenues $ 1,439,388 100.0 $ 1,177,736 100.0 Cost of revenues 733,416 50.9 595,608 50.6 Depreciation 37,025 2.6 29,028 2.5 Restructuring costs 1,520 0.1 704 0.1 Total cost of revenues 771,961 53.6 625,340 53.1 Gross profit 667,427 46.4 552,396 46.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses 261,460 18.2 216,911 18.4 Depreciation 6,941 0.5 5,572 0.5 Amortization 9,919 0.7 5,390 0.5 Total selling, general and administrative expenses 278,320 19.3 227,873 19.3 Acquisition expenses 9,519 0.7 7,333 0.6 Integration expenses 4,112 0.3 1,096 0.1 Restructuring and plant closure costs 6,851 0.5 905 0.1 Litigation settlement 897 0.1 0 0 Gain on sale of assets (2,955 ) 0.2 0 0 Income from operations 370,683 25.8 315,189 26.8 Net interest expense 36,815 2.6 34,132 2.9 Income tax expense 121,396 8.4 101,299 8.6 Net income 210,457 14.6 176,389 15.0 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 2,578 0.2 698 0.1 Net income attributable to Stericycle, Inc. $ 207,879 14.4 $ 175,691 14.9 Earnings per share Diluted $ 2.39 $ 2.03 Revenues: Our revenues increased $261.7 million, or 22.2%, to $1.44 billion in 2010 from $1.18 billion in 2009. Domestic revenues increased $171.0 million, or 18.7%, to $1.08 billion from $912.6 million in 2009 as internal growth for domestic small account customers increased by approximately $46.7 million, approximately 9%, driven by an increase of Steri Safe and Clinical Services revenues. Revenues from domestic large account customers increased approximately $17.5 million, or over 5%, as we increased the total number of accounts and expanded our Sharps Management and Pharmaceutical Waste Disposal programs. Returns and recall management services revenues increased by $55.7 million compared to 2009 resulting from larger recalls in 2010. Domestic acquisitions less than one year old added an additional $51.1 million to the growth in revenues compared to 2009. International revenues in 2010 were $355.8 million, compared to $265.1 million in 2009, an increase of $90.7 million, or 34.2%. Internal growth, currency rate fluctuations and acquisitions impact the comparison of 2010 to 2009. Internal growth was $19.1 million. The effect of exchange rates positively impacted international 2010 revenues by $2.5 million as foreign currencies appreciated against the U.S. dollar. Acquisitions less than one year old favorably impacted revenue growth by $69.1 million. 23 Table of Contents Cost of Revenues: Our 2010 cost of revenues increased $146.6 million, or $23.4%, to $771.9 million compared to $625.3 million in 2009. Domestic cost of revenues increased $86.4 million, or 18.9%, to $544.7 million in 2010 compared to $458.3 million for 2009. International cost of revenues increased $60.2 million, or 36.0%, to $227.2 million in 2010 compared to $167.0 million in 2009. Our gross margin percentage decreased to 46.4% during 2010 from 46.9% during 2009. Domestic gross margin percentage slightly decreased to 49.7% during 2010 from 49.8% in 2009. Our domestic gross profit was unfavorably impacted by $1.5 million in 2010 and $0.7 million in 2009 from restructuring costs for our regulated returns and recall management services business. International gross margin decreased to 36.1% compared to 37.0% in 2009, primarily due to acquisitions with lower margins being consolidated. In general, international gross margins are lower than domestic gross margins because the international operations have less penetration into the small quantity generator market, which has a better gross margin. Historically, the international operations have had most of their revenues from large national healthcare hospitals. As the international revenues increase, consolidated gross margins receive downward pressure due to this business mix shift, which can be offset by additional international small quantity market penetration, integration savings and domestic business expansion. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses: In 2010, our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, excluding acquisition related costs, increased $50.4 million, or 22.1%, to $278.3 million from $227.9 million in 2009. As percentage of revenue, SG&A expenses remained at 19.3% in 2010 and 2009. Depreciation expense as a percentage of revenue was 0.5% in both 2010 and 2009. Amortization expense as a percentage of revenue increased to 0.7% in 2010 from 0.5% in 2009 due to larger quantity of acquisitions and related amortization. Domestically, SG&A increased $31.6 million, or 17.3%, to $214.2 million in 2010 from $182.6 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to pre synergized cost structure of the acquired revenues, higher amortization expense, market penetration for our Pharmaceutical Waste programs, and investments in the Steri Safe services. Internationally, our SG&A increased $18.8 million, or 41.5%, in 2010 to $64.1 million from $45.3 million in 2009. As percentage of revenue, SG&A was 18.0% in 2010 and 17.1% in 2009. The increase in SG&A was partially due to our acquisitions in UK, Brazil, and Japan, which have higher SG&A expenses. Higher amortization expense related to recognized intangible assets from acquisitions and investment in our Clinical Services program also contributed to the increase in SG&A. Income from Operations: Income from operations increased by $55.5 million, or 17.6%, to $370.7 million in 2010 from $315.2 million in 2009. Comparisons of income from operations between 2010 and 2009 are affected by various charges not considered part of our day to day operations. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized $9.5 million in acquisition expenses, $4.1 million expenses related to integration of new acquisitions, $7.6 million of restructuring cost, $0.8 million plant closure expenses, and litigation settlement of $0.9 million, partially offset by a $3.0 million gain on sale of assets related to the MedServe divestiture. These various adjustments resulted in $19.9 million net expense on a pre tax basis. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized $7.3 million in acquisition expenses, $1.1 million expenses related to integration of new acquisitions, and $1.6 million of restructuring costs for our regulated returns and recall management services business. These adjustments resulted in $10.0 million net expenses on a pre tax basis. Domestically, our income from operations increased $45.5 million, or 17.2%, to $310.4 million in 2010 from $264.9 million in 2009. Internationally, our income from operations increased $10.0 million, or 19.9%, to $60.3 million in 2010 from $50.3 million in 2009. 24 Table of Contents Interest Expense and Interest Income: Interest expense increased to $37.1 million during 2010 from $34.4 million during 2009 due to higher borrowings in 2010 and higher interest rates. Interest income was $0.3 million during both 2010 and 2009. Income Tax Expense: Income tax expense for the years 2010 and 2009 reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 36.6% and 36.5%, respectively, for federal and state income taxes. In 2010, we recognized a net $1.2 million benefit related to prior years unrecognized tax benefits. In 2009, we recognized a net $1.8 million benefit related to prior years unrecognized tax benefits. Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Highlights for the year ended December 31, 2009 included the following: revenues grew to $1.18 billion, a 8.7% increase over $1.08 billion in 2008; gross margins increased to 46.9% in 2009 from 44.8% in 2008; operating income was $315.2 million, a 14.9% increase from $274.2 million for 2008; we incurred a net $8.9 million in expenses related to acquisitions and restructuring and; cash flow from operations was $277.2 million.

Domestic revenues increased $81.8 million, or 9.8%, to $912.6 million from $830.8 million in 2008 as internal growth for domestic small account customers increased by approximately $39.6 million, or over 8%, 25 Table of Contents driven by an increase of Steri Safe revenues. Revenues from domestic large account customers increased approximately $12.1 million, or over 4%, as we increased the total number of accounts and expanded our Sharps Management program. Returns and recall management services revenues decreased by $22.3 million compared to 2008 due to lower than expected recall volumes. Domestic acquisitions less than one year old added an additional $52.4 million to the growth in revenues compared to 2008. International revenues in 2009 were $265.1 million, compared to $252.9 million in 2008, an increase of $12.3 million, or 4.9%. Internal growth, currency rate fluctuations and acquisitions impact the comparison of 2009 to 2008. Internal growth was $18.3 million. The effect of exchange rates negatively impacted international 2009 revenues by $38.1 million as foreign currencies depreciated against the U.S. dollar. Acquisitions less than one year old favorably impacted revenue growth by $32.1 million. Cost of Revenues: Our 2009 cost of revenues increased $26.7 million, or $4.5%, to $625.3 million compared to $598.6 million in 2008. Domestic cost of revenues increased $23.3 million, or 5.4%, to $458.3 million in 2009 compared to $435.0 million for 2008. International cost of revenues increased $3.4 million, or 2.1%, to $167.0 million in 2009 compared to $163.6 million in 2008. Our gross margin percentage increased to 46.9% during 2009 from 44.8% during 2008. Domestic gross margin percentage increased 2.2% to 49.8% during 2009 from 47.6% in 2008. Our domestic gross profit for 2009 was unfavorably impacted by $0.7 million of restructuring costs for our regulated returns and recall management services business. Lower gross margin in 2008 was primarily the result of energy and transportation costs increases in 2008, which were partially offset by higher revenues related to energy surcharges. International gross margin improved by 1.7 percentage points in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to integration of acquisitions and related efficiencies. In general, international gross margins are lower than domestic gross margins because the international operations have less penetration into the small quantity generator market, which has a better gross margin. Historically, the international operations have had most of their revenues from large national healthcare hospitals. As the international revenues increase, consolidated gross margins receive downward pressure due to this business mix shift, which can be offset by additional international small quantity market penetration, integration savings and domestic business expansion. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses: In 2009, our SG&A expenses, excluding acquisition related costs, increased $24.7 million, or 12.1%, to $227.9 million from $203.2 million in 2008. Amortization and depreciation expense as a percentage of revenue slightly increased to 0.9% in 2009 from 0.8% in 2008. Domestically, 2009 SG&A increased $21.4 million, or 13.2%, to $182.6 million from $161.2 million in 2008. The increase was primarily due to spending related to acquisitions, market penetration for our Bio Systems&reg; sharps management and Pharmacy Waste Disposal programs and investments in the Steri Safe services. Internationally, our SG&A increased $3.3 million, or 7.9%, in 2009 to $45.3 million from $42.0 million in 2008, mostly due to acquisitions and investment in our Clinical Services program. Income from Operations: Income from operations increased by $41.0 million, or 14.9%, to $315.2 million in 2009 from $274.2 million in 2008. Comparisons of income from operations between 2009 and 2008 are affected by various charges not considered part of our day to day operations. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized $7.3 million in acquisition expenses, $1.1 million expenses related to integration of new acquisitions, and $1.6 million of restructuring costs for our regulated returns and recall management services business. These adjustments resulted in $10.0 million net expenses on a pre tax basis. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded expenses of $5.6 million related a business dispute settlement and related costs, $1.5 million expenses related to integration of new acquisitions, and $0.5 million related to fixed asset write offs. 26 Table of Contents Domestically, our income from operations increased $31.5 million, or 13.5%, to $264.9 million in 2009 from $233.4 million in 2008. Internationally, our income from operations increased $9.5 million, or 23.4%, to $50.3 million in 2009 from $40.8 million in 2008. Interest Expense and Interest Income: Interest expense increased to $34.4 million during 2009 from $33.1 million during 2008 due to higher borrowings in 2009. Interest income was $0.3 million during 2009 and $0.9 million during 2008. Income Tax Expense: Income tax expense for the years 2009 and 2008 reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 36.5% and 37.8%, respectively, for federal and state income taxes. In 2009 we recognized a net $1.8 million benefit related to prior years unrecognized tax benefits. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our $850.0 million senior credit facility maturing in August 2012, our $81.0 million term loan maturing in June 2012, our $100.0 million private placement notes maturing April 2015, our $175.0 million private placement note maturing in October 2017 and our $225.0 million private placement notes maturing in October 2020, all require us to comply with various financial, reporting and other covenants and restrictions, including a restriction on dividend payments. The financial debt covenants are the same for the senior credit facility, the term loan credit agreement and the private placement notes. At December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with all of our financial debt covenants. As of December 31, 2010, we had $175.4 million of borrowings outstanding under our $850.0 million senior unsecured credit facility, which includes foreign currency borrowings of $57.4 million. We also had $184.0 million committed to outstanding letters of credit under our senior credit facility. The unused portion of the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2009 was $490.6 million. At December 31, 2010, our interest rates on borrowings under our revolving credit facility were as follows: For short term borrowing (less than one month): Federal funds rate plus 0.5% or prime rate, whichever is higher; and For borrowing greater than one month: LIBOR plus 0.75%. The weighted average rate of interest on the unsecured revolving credit facility was 1.0% per annum. As of December 31, 2010, we had $81.0 million term loan debt outstanding which was entered into during 2010 with several lenders maturing in June 2012. Term loans under the term loan credit agreement bear interest at fluctuating interest rates determined, for any one month or other applicable interest period, by reference to the LIBOR plus the applicable margin provided in the term loan agreement. The applicable margin is based on our consolidated leverage ratio and ranges from 2.75% to 3.50%. As of December 31, 2010, the applicable margin was 3.0%. The weighted average rate of interest on the term loan was 3.3% per annum. We are required to make quarterly principal payments of 2.5% of the original principal amount from the outstanding term loans, and the remainder at maturity. As of December 31, 2010, we had $100.0 million outstanding 5.64% private placement notes which we entered into on April 15, 2008. The notes bear interest at the fixed rate of 5.64% per annum. Interest is payable in arrears semi annually on April 15 and October 15 beginning on October 15, 2009, and principal is payable at the maturity of the notes on April 15, 2015. On October 15 2010, we entered into a Private Placement note purchase agreement to sell $175.0 million of our new 3.89% seven year unsecured senior notes (the Series A notes) and $225.0 million of our new 10 year 4.47% unsecured senior notes (the Series B notes). These notes were outstanding on December 31, 2010. 27 Table of Contents The Series A notes bear interest at the fixed rate of 3.89% per annum, and the Series B notes bear interest at the fixed rate of 4.47% per annum. Interest is payable in arrears semi annually on April 15 and October 15 beginning on April 15, 2011. The principal amount of $175.0 million of the Series A notes will be payable at the maturity of the notes on October 15, 2017, and the principal amount of $225.0 million of the Series B notes will be payable at the maturity of the notes on October 15, 2020. At December 31, 2010, we had $249.0 million in promissory notes issued in connection with acquisitions during 2004 through 2010, $91.4 in foreign subsidiary bank debt outstanding, and $6.3 million in capital lease obligations. Working Capital: At December 31, 2010, our working capital increased to $60.2 million compared to $13.7 million at December 31, 2009. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2010 includes $23.0 million to be used for recalled product reimbursement, offset by an equivalent amount in accrued liabilities. Working capital increased by $35.7 million for net accounts receivables related to higher sales, and by $17.3 million for short term investments. In July 2010, we financed a portion of our Japan acquisition through local borrowings which required us to deposit $15.8 million in one year certificates of deposit with an affiliated bank located in the United States and is classified as part of short term investments on our balance sheet (see Note 4 Fair Value Measurements). Net Cash Provided or Used: Net cash provided by operating activities increased $48.4 million, or 17.5%, to $325.7 million during 2010. Cash provided by operating activities in 2010 includes a prepayment for recalled product reimbursements in excess of amounts paid, which resulted in an increase to accrued liabilities in the amount of $23.0 million. An increase in net income of 18.3%, improved collections as reflected by our Days Sales Outstanding, and an increase in accounts payable contributed to the increase in cash from operating activities. Net cash used in investing activities during 2010 was $247.7 million compared to $350.2 million used in 2009. The decrease was mainly due to $121.5 million decrease in cash for acquisitions in 2010, partially offset by an increase of $15.8 million in purchases of short term investments related to our acquisitions in Japan (see Note 4 Fair Value Measurements). Net cash used in financing activities was $13.6 million during 2010 compared to $81.8 million provided by financing activities in 2009. The change primarily consists of a decrease in net proceeds on long term debt in the amount of $123.7 million. In addition, there was $18.6 million more of share repurchases in 2010. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and cash commitments as of December 31, 2010: Payments due by period (dollars in thousands) Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 andAfter Long term debt(1) $ 1,608,893 $ 297,572 $ 497,824 $ 283,680 $ 529,817 Capital lease obligations(1) 6,872 2,634 2,785 680 773 Operating leases 182,179 46,788 62,894 35,947 36,550 Purchase obligations 8,304 2,218 3,686 1,600 800 Other long term liabilities(1)(2) 6,428 1,518 1,865 1,251 1,794 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,812,676 $ 350,730 $ 569,054 $ 323,158 $ 569,734 (1) The long term debt, capital leases, and other long term liabilities items include both the future principal payment amount as well as an amount calculated for expected future interest payments. Long term debt that has floating interest rate requires the use of management judgment to estimate the future rate of interest. 28 Table of Contents (2) Other long term liabilities include amounts related to covenants not to compete agreements and exclude payments for unrecognized tax benefits. Based on the contingent and uncertain nature of our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make an estimate of the period of potential settlement, if any, with the applicable taxing authorities. At December 31, 2010, we had $184.0 million in stand by letters of credit issued. We anticipate that our operating cash flow, together with borrowings under our senior unsecured credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated future operating expenses, capital expenditures and debt service obligations as they become due during the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. Guarantees: We have guaranteed a loan to JPMorganChase Bank N.A. on behalf of Shiraishi Sogyo Co. Ltd (Shiraishi). Shiraishi is a customer in Japan that is expanding its medical waste management business and has a one year loan with a current balance of $6.1 million with JPMorganChase Bank N.A. that expires in May 2011. We also have extended notes receivable to Shiraishi for approximately $15.2 million in support of its medical waste business. These amounts are collateralized with the assets of Shiraishi and related companies. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are subject to market risks arising from changes in interest rates. Our potential additional interest expense over one year that would result from a hypothetical, instantaneous and unfavorable change of 100 basis points in the interest rate on all of our variable rate obligations would be approximately $3.3 million on a pre tax basis. During the year ending December 31, 2010, we settled our U.S. Treasury Lock hedge related to our private debt placement. The settlement resulted in a cash payment of $4.6 million and is reflected on our Statement of Cash Flows within Financing Activities. This settlement amount will be amortized over the life of the related debt. We have exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. We have subsidiaries in ten foreign countries whose functional currency is the local currency. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could unfavorably impact our consolidated results of operations. We have exposure to commodity pricing for gas and diesel fuel for our trucks and for the purchase of containers and boxes. We do not hedge these items to manage the exposure. 29 Table of Contents
