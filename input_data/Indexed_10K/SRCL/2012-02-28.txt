Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Item 8 of this Report. Introduction We are in the business of managing regulated waste and providing an array of related services. We operate in the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, Portugal, Romania, Spain, and the United Kingdom. For large quantity generators of regulated waste such as hospitals and for pharmaceutical companies and distributors, we offer our institutional regulated waste management services; our Bio Systems&reg; reusable sharps management services to reduce the risk of needle sticks; a variety of products and services for infection control; our patient communication services; and our regulated returns and waste management services for expired or recalled products, pharmaceutical waste disposal services, and hazardous waste disposal. For small quantity generators of regulated waste such as doctors offices and for retail pharmacies, we offer: our medical and regulated waste management services; our Steri Safe&reg; OSHA and HIPAA compliance programs; a variety of products and services for infection control; our patient communication services; and our regulated returns and recall services for expired or recalled products. We operate integrated national regulated waste management networks domestically and internationally. Our national networks include a total of 175 processing or combined processing and collection sites and 154 additional transfer, collection or combined transfer and collection sites. Our regulated waste processing technologies include autoclaving, our proprietary ETD, chemical treatment, and incineration. We serve approximately 522,000 customers worldwide, of which approximately 16,000 are large quantity generators and approximately 506,000 are small quantity generators. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements), the following ones may involve a higher degree of judgment on our part and greater complexity of reporting. Revenue Recognition: Revenues for our regulated waste management services, other than our Steri Safe service, are recognized at the time of waste collection. Our Steri Safe revenues are recognized evenly over the contractual service period. Payments received in advance are deferred and recognized as services are provided. Revenues from regulated returns and recall management services and patient communication services are recorded at the time services are performed. Revenues from product sales are recognized at the time the goods are shipped to the customer. We do not have any contracts in a loss position. Losses would be recorded when known and estimable for any contracts that should go into a loss position. Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets: Goodwill associated with the excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired is not amortized. We have determined that our permits have indefinite lives and, accordingly, are not amortized (see Note 11 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). Our balance sheet at December 31, 2011 contains goodwill of $1.9 billion. In accordance with accounting standards, we evaluate on at least an annual basis, using the fair value of reporting units, whether goodwill is 20 Table of Contents impaired. If we were to determine that a significant impairment has occurred, we would be required to incur non cash charges of the impaired portion of goodwill that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the impairment charge occurs. During the quarter ended June 30, 2011 we performed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation for our three reporting units, Domestic Regulated Waste Management Services, Domestic Regulated Returns and Recall Management Services, and International. We calculate the fair value of our reporting units using two methods, one a market approach and the other an income approach. Both the market and income approaches indicated no impairment to goodwill to any of our three reporting units. Market Approach: Our market approach begins by calculating the market capitalization of the Company using the average stock price for the prior 30 days and the outstanding share count at June 30, 2011. We then look at the Companys Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA), adjusted for stock compensation expense and other items, such as a gain on sale of divested assets, for the prior twelve months. The calculated market capitalization is divided by the modified EBITDA to arrive at a valuation multiple. The fair value of each reporting unit is then calculated by taking the product of the valuation multiple and the trailing twelve month modified EBITDA of that reporting unit. The fair value was then compared to the reporting units book value and determined to be in excess of the book value. We believe that starting with the fair value of the company as a whole is a reasonable measure as that fair value is then allocated to each reporting unit based on that reporting units individual earnings. A sustained drop in our stock price would have a negative impact to our fair value calculations. A temporary drop in earnings of a reporting unit would have a negative impact to our fair value calculations. The results of our goodwill impairment test using the market approach indicated the fair value of our reporting units exceeded book value by a substantial amount, in excess of 100% of book value. Income Approach: The income approach uses expected future cash flows of each reporting unit and discounts those cash flows to a present value. Expected future cash flows are calculated using management assumptions of internal growth, capital expenditures, and cost efficiencies. Future acquisitions are not included in the expected future cash flows. We use a discount rate based on our Company calculated Weighted Average Cost of Capital which is adjusted for each of our reporting units based on risk size premium and foreign country premium. Significant assumptions used in the income approach include realization of future cash flows and the discount rate used to present value those cash flows. The results of our goodwill impairment test using the income approach indicated the fair value of our reporting units exceeded book value by a substantial amount; in excess of 100%. Our permits are tested for impairment annually at December 31 or more frequently if circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. We use either a discounted income or cost savings model as the current measurement of the fair value of the permits. The fair value is based upon, among other things, certain assumptions about expected future operating performance, internal and external processing costs, and an appropriate discount rate determined by management. Our estimates of discounted income may differ from actual income due to, among other things, inaccuracies in economic estimates. In 2011, we wrote off $2.8 million for the permit intangibles of three facilities due to rationalizing our operations. Under current acquisition accounting, a fair value must be assigned to all acquired assets based on a theoretical market participant regardless of the acquirers intended use for those assets. This accounting treatment can lead to the recognition of losses if a company disposes of acquired assets. Other identifiable intangible assets, such as customer relationships, tradenames, and covenants not to compete, are currently amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives. We have determined that our regulated waste customer relationships have between 14 year and 40 year lives based on the specific type of relationship. Although the contracted regulated waste management business is highly competitive, we have been able to maintain high customer retention through excellent customer service. 21 Table of Contents The valuation of our contractual customer relationships was derived using a discounted income approach valuation model. These assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may be less than its undiscounted estimated future cash flows. There have been no indicators of impairment of these intangibles (see Note 11 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Share Repurchases: Purchase price over par value for share repurchases are allocated to additional paid in capital until the additional paid in capital reaches zero, with any remainder being allocated to retained earnings. Income Taxes: We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We compute our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. Significant judgments are required in order to determine the realizability of these deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we evaluate all significant available positive and negative evidence, including historical operating results, estimates of future taxable income and the existence of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Changes in the expectations regarding the realization of deferred tax assets could materially impact income tax expense in future periods. To provide for uncertain tax positions, we maintain a reserve for tax benefits assumed that do not meet a threshold of more likely than not to be sustained. Management believes the amount provided for uncertain tax positions is adequate. Accounts Receivable: Accounts receivable consists of amounts due to us from our normal business activities and are carried at their estimated collectible amounts. Accounts receivable balances are determined to be delinquent when the amount is past due based on the contractual terms with the customer. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected uncollectibility of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified among uncollected accounts. Accounts receivable are charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts when we have determined that the receivable will not be collected. No single customer accounts for more than 2% of our accounts receivable. Insurance: Our insurance for workers compensation, vehicle liability and physical damage, and employee related health care benefits is obtained using high deductible insurance policies. A third party administrator is used to process all such claims. We require all workers compensation, vehicle liability and physical damage claims to be reported within 24 hours. As a result, we accrue our workers compensation, vehicle and physical damage liability based upon the claim reserves established by the third party administrator at the end of each reporting period. Our employee health insurance benefit liability is based on our historical claims experience rate. Our earnings would be impacted to the extent that actual claims vary from historical experience. We review our accruals associated with the exposure to these liabilities for adequacy at the end of each reporting period. Litigation: We operate in a highly regulated industry and deal with regulatory inquiries or investigations from time to time that may be instituted for a variety of reasons. We are also involved in a variety of civil litigation from time to time. Settlements from litigation would be recorded when known, probable and estimable. Stock Option Plans: We have issued stock options to employees and directors as an integral part of our compensation programs. Stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment, including estimating expected volatility of our stock, expected term of the award, and the risk free rate. Our stocks expected volatility is based upon historical experience. The expected term of the awards is based upon a measure of historical volatility of our stock price. The risk free interest rate assumption is based upon the U.S. Treasury yield rates of a comparable period. If factors change and we employ different assumptions, stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past. 22 Table of Contents New Accounting Pronouncements: For information about recently issued accounting pronouncements see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Fair Value Considerations: Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels. The impact of our creditworthiness has been considered in the fair value measurements noted below. In addition, the fair value measurement of a liability must reflect the nonperformance risk of an entity. At December 31, 2011, we had $22.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $0.4 million of short term investments that we recorded at fair value using Level 1 inputs and $9.9 million of contingent consideration related to acquisitions that we recorded at fair value using Level 3 inputs. At December 31, 2011, we had no derivative instruments. Restructuring Costs: In December 2010, we reorganized the structure of our international management group in order to leverage strong local management, resulting in employee severance and other charges. During the third quarter of 2011 we expanded this program to include consolidation of administrative facilities in the United Kingdom and reorganization of our international legal structure. We recognized $2.3 million in expense during 2011, of which $2.2 million was recognized on our Consolidated Statement of Income within Selling, general and administrative expense. We had an accrual balance of $0.9 million at December 31, 2011, which we expect to pay out primarily in the first quarter of 2012 with some immaterial additional expense. In addition to the restructuring charges, we recognized $2.8 million and $0.9 million in non cash expenses during 2011 and 2010, respectively, related to the rationalization of domestic plant operations. Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010 Highlights for the year ended December 31, 2011 included the following: revenues grew to $1.68 billion, a 16.4% increase over $1.44 billion in 2010; gross margins decreased to 45.4% in 2011 from 46.4% in 2010; operating income was $424.3 million, a 14.5% increase from $370.7 million for 2010; we incurred a net $15.7 million in expenses related to restructuring and plant closure, acquisitions, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, and litigation settlement; we incurred $4.3 million in integration expenses related to acquisitions; cash flow from operations was $306.1 million. In analyzing our companys performance it is necessary to understand that our various regulated waste services share a common infrastructure and customer base. We market our regulated waste services by offering various pricing options to meet our customers preferences, and customers move between these different billing paradigms. For example, our regulated waste customers may contract with us for Medical Waste Disposal services that are billed based on the weight of waste collected, processed and disposed during a particular period and, in a subsequent period, the same customer could move to our standard service Steri Safe OSHA Compliance Program, which packages the same regulated waste services with some training and education services for a contracted subscription fee. Another example is a customer that purchases our Medical Waste Disposal and Sharps Disposal Management services which provides the customer with the same regulated waste services under a different pricing and billing arrangement. We do not track the movement of customers between the various types of regulated waste services we offer. Although we can identify directional trends in 23 Table of Contents our services, because the regulated waste services are similar in nature and the inherent inaccuracies in disaggregation, we believe that aggregating these revenues communicates the appropriate metric. We analyze our revenue growth by identifying changes related to internal growth, acquired growth, and changes due to currency exchange fluctuations. The following summarizes the Companys operations: In thousands, except per share data Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 $ % $ % Revenues $ 1,676,048 100.0 $ 1,439,388 100.0 Cost of revenues 874,115 52.1 733,416 50.9 Depreciation 41,135 2.5 37,025 2.6 Restructuring costs 54 0.0 1,520 0.1 Total cost of revenues 915,304 54.6 771,961 53.6 Gross profit 760,744 45.4 667,427 46.4 Selling, general and administrative expenses 291,468 17.4 261,460 18.2 Depreciation 8,642 0.5 6,941 0.5 Amortization 16,269 1.0 9,919 0.7 Total selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding items below) 316,379 18.9 278,320 19.3 Acquisition expenses 16,704 1.0 9,519 0.7 Change in fair value of contingent consideration (7,221 ) 0.4 0 0.0 Integration expenses 4,346 0.3 4,112 0.3 Restructuring and plant closure costs 5,021 0.3 6,851 0.5 Litigation settlement 1,185 0.1 897 0.1 Gain on sale of business 19 0.0 (2,955 ) 0.2 Income from operations 424,311 25.3 370,683 25.8 Net interest expense 48,632 2.9 36,815 2.6 Income tax expense 134,981 8.1 121,396 8.4 Net income 237,343 14.2 210,457 14.6 Less: net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 2,592 0.2 2,578 0.2 Net income attributable to Stericycle, Inc. $ 234,751 14.0 $ 207,879 14.4 Earnings per share Diluted $ 2.69 $ 2.39 Revenues: Our revenues increased $236.7 million, or 16.4%, to $1.68 billion in 2011 from $1.44 billion in 2010. Domestic revenues increased $128.5 million, or 11.9%, to $1.21 billion from $1.08 billion in 2010 as internal growth for domestic small account customers increased by approximately $48.8 million, approximately 8%, driven by an increase of Steri Safe revenues. Revenues from domestic large account customers increased approximately $19.4 million, or over 5%, as we increased the total number of accounts and expanded our Sharps Management and Pharmaceutical Waste Disposal programs. Internal revenues for returns and recall management services decreased by $19.9 million compared to 2010 because 2010 had more large recalls which resulted in higher revenues. Internal revenues exclude acquisitions less than one year old. Total domestic regulated waste and returns and recall management acquisitions less than one year old contributed approximately $80.2 million to the increase in domestic revenues in 2011. 24 Table of Contents International revenues in 2011 were $463.9 million, compared to $355.8 million in 2010, an increase of $108.1 million, or 30.4%. Internal growth, currency rate fluctuations and acquisitions impact the comparison of 2011 to 2010. Internal growth was $18.9 million. The effect of exchange rates positively impacted international 2011 revenues by $11.2 million as foreign currencies appreciated against the U.S. dollar. Acquisitions and divestitures less than one year old contributed an additional $78.0 million in international revenues. Cost of Revenues: Our 2011 cost of revenues increased $143.3 million, or $18.6%, to $915.3 million compared to $771.9 million in 2010. Our domestic cost of revenues increased $68.0 million, or 12.5%, to $612.7 million in 2011 compared to $544.7 million for 2010 as a result of costs related to a proportional increase in revenues from acquisitions and internal growth. Our international cost of revenues increased $75.4 million, or 33.2%, to $302.6 million in 2011 compared to $227.2 million in 2010 as a result of costs related to a proportional increase in revenues, partially driven by the impact of exchange rates. Our gross margin percentage decreased to 45.4% during 2011 from 46.4% during 2010 due to inclusion of lower margin acquired revenues. Domestic gross margin percentage slightly decreased to 49.5% during 2011 from 49.7% in 2010. Our domestic gross profit was unfavorably impacted by $1.5 million in 2010 from restructuring costs for our regulated returns and recall management services business. International gross margin decreased to 34.8% compared to 36.1% in 2010, primarily due to acquisitions with lower margins being consolidated. In general, international gross margins are lower than domestic gross margins because the international operations have less penetration into the small quantity generator market, which has a higher gross margin. Historically, the international operations have had most of their revenues from large hospitals. As the international revenues increase, consolidated gross margins receive downward pressure due to this business mix shift, which may be offset by additional international small quantity market penetration, integration savings and domestic business expansion. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses: In 2011, our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, excluding acquisition costs and other items, increased $38.1 million, or 13.7%, to $316.4 million from $278.3 million in 2010. As a percentage of revenue, these costs decreased by 0.4% in 2011 compared to 2010. Depreciation expense as a percentage of revenue was 0.5% in both 2011 and 2010. Amortization expense as a percentage of revenue increased to 1.0% in 2011 from 0.7% in 2010 due to larger quantity of acquisitions and related amortization. Domestically, SG&A increased $19.5 million, or 9.1%, to $233.7 million in 2011 from $214.2 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to SG&A expenses related to the acquired revenues and higher amortization expense. As a percentage of revenue, these costs decreased 0.5% in 2011 compared to 2010. Internationally, our SG&A increased $18.6 million, or 29.0%, in 2011 to $82.7 million from $64.1 million in 2010. Increased SG&A was due to increased number of international acquisitions and investment in our Clinical Services program, partially offset by restructuring of the international management structure and the continued integration of acquisitions. Higher amortization expense related to recognized intangible assets from acquisitions. As percentage of revenue, these costs decreased 0.2% in 2011 compared to 2010. Income from Operations: Income from operations increased by $53.6 million, or 14.5%, to $424.3 million in 2011 from $370.7 million in 2010. Comparisons of income from operations between 2011 and 2010 are affected by various charges not considered part of our day to day operations. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recognized $16.7 million in acquisition expenses, $4.3 million related to the integration of new acquisitions, $5.1 million of restructuring and plant closure costs, and $1.2 million in litigation settlement, partially offset by $7.2 million change in fair value of contingent consideration. These various adjustments resulted in $20.1 million net expense on a pre tax basis. 25 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized $9.5 million in acquisition expenses, $4.1 million expenses related to integration of new acquisitions, $7.6 million of restructuring cost, $0.8 million plant closure expenses, and litigation settlement of $0.9 million, partially offset by a $3.0 million gain on sale of assets related to the MedServe divestiture. These various adjustments resulted in $19.9 million net expense on a pre tax basis. Domestically, our income from operations increased $41.3 million, or 13.3%, to $351.7 million in 2011 from $310.4 million in 2010. Internationally, our income from operations increased $12.3 million, or 20.4%, to $72.6 million in 2011 from $60.3 million in 2010. Interest Expense and Interest Income: Interest expense increased to $49.4 million during 2011 from $37.1 million during 2010 due to higher borrowings in 2011 and higher interest rates. Interest income was $0.8 million during 2011 and $0.3 million during 2010. Income Tax Expense: Income tax expense increased to $135.0 million during 2011 from $121.4 million during 2010. In 2011 and 2010, we recognized a net $1.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively; of tax benefits related to prior years unrecognized tax positions which positively impacted our diluted earnings per share by $0.01 in both 2011 and 2010. The effective tax rates for the years 2011 and 2010 were approximately 36.3% and 36.6%, respectively. Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 Highlights for the year ended December 31, 2010 included the following: revenues grew to $1.44 billion, a 22.2% increase over $1.18 billion in 2009; gross margins decreased to 46.4% in 2010 from 46.9% in 2009; operating income was $370.7 million, a 17.6% increase from $315.2 million for 2009; we incurred a net $15.8 million in expenses related to restructuring and plant closure, acquisitions, litigation settlement, and gain on sale of assets; we incurred $4.1 million in integration expenses related to acquisitions; cash flow from operations was $325.7 million. 26 Table of Contents The following summarizes the Companys operations: In thousands, except per share data Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 $ % $ % Revenues $ 1,439,388 100.0 $ 1,177,736 100.0 Cost of revenues 733,416 50.9 595,608 50.6 Depreciation 37,025 2.6 29,028 2.5 Restructuring costs 1,520 0.1 704 0.1 Total cost of revenues 771,961 53.6 625,340 53.1 Gross profit 667,427 46.4 552,396 46.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses 261,460 18.2 216,911 18.4 Depreciation 6,941 0.5 5,572 0.5 Amortization 9,919 0.7 5,390 0.5 Total selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding items below) 278,320 19.3 227,873 19.3 Acquisition expenses 9,519 0.7 7,333 0.6 Integration expenses 4,112 0.3 1,096 0.1 Restructuring and plant closure costs 6,851 0.5 905 0.1 Litigation settlement 897 0.1 0 0 Gain on sale of business (2,955 ) 0.2 0 0 Income from operations 370,683 25.8 315,189 26.8 Net interest expense 36,815 2.6 34,132 2.9 Income tax expense 121,396 8.4 101,299 8.6 Net income 210,457 14.6 176,389 15.0 Less: net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 2,578 0.2 698 0.1 Net income attributable to Stericycle, Inc. $ 207,879 14.4 $ 175,691 14.9 Earnings per share Diluted $ 2.39 $ 2.03 Revenues: Our revenues increased $261.7 million, or 22.2%, to $1.44 billion in 2010 from $1.18 billion in 2009. Domestic revenues increased $171.0 million, or 18.7%, to $1.08 billion from $912.6 million in 2009 as internal growth for domestic small account customers increased by approximately $46.7 million, approximately 9%, driven by an increase of Steri Safe and Clinical Services revenues. Revenues from domestic large account customers increased approximately $17.5 million, or over 5%, as we increased the total number of accounts and expanded our Sharps Management and Pharmaceutical Waste Disposal programs. Returns and recall management services revenues increased by $55.7 million compared to 2009 resulting from larger recalls in 2010. Domestic acquisitions less than one year old added an additional $51.1 million to the growth in revenues compared to 2009. International revenues in 2010 were $355.8 million, compared to $265.1 million in 2009, an increase of $90.7 million, or 34.2%. Internal growth, currency rate fluctuations and acquisitions impact the comparison of 2010 to 2009. Internal growth was $19.1 million. The effect of exchange rates positively impacted international 2010 revenues by $2.5 million as foreign currencies appreciated against the U.S. dollar. Acquisitions less than one year old favorably impacted revenue growth by $69.1 million. Cost of Revenues: Our 2010 cost of revenues increased $146.6 million, or $23.4%, to $771.9 million compared to $625.3 million in 2009. Domestic cost of revenues increased $86.4 million, or 18.9%, to $544.7 million in 2010 compared to $458.3 million for 2009. International cost of revenues increased $60.2 million, or 36.0%, to $227.2 million in 2010 compared to $167.0 million in 2009. 27 Table of Contents Our gross margin percentage decreased to 46.4% during 2010 from 46.9% during 2009. Domestic gross margin percentage slightly decreased to 49.7% during 2010 from 49.8% in 2009. Our domestic gross profit was unfavorably impacted by $1.5 million in 2010 and $0.7 million in 2009 from restructuring costs for our regulated returns and recall management services business. International gross margin decreased to 36.1% compared to 37.0% in 2009, primarily due to acquisitions with lower margins being consolidated. In general, international gross margins are lower than domestic gross margins because the international operations have less penetration into the small quantity generator market, which has a better gross margin. Historically, the international operations have had most of their revenues from large hospitals. As the international revenues increase, consolidated gross margins receive downward pressure due to this business mix shift, which can be offset by additional international small quantity market penetration, integration savings and domestic business expansion. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses: In 2010, our SG&A expenses, excluding acquisition costs and other items, increased $50.4 million, or 22.1%, to $278.3 million from $227.9 million in 2009. As percentage of revenue, SG&A expenses remained at 19.3% in 2010 and 2009. Depreciation expense as a percentage of revenue was 0.5% in both 2010 and 2009. Amortization expense as a percentage of revenue increased to 0.7% in 2010 from 0.5% in 2009 due to larger quantity of acquisitions and related amortization. Domestically, SG&A increased $31.6 million, or 17.3%, to $214.2 million in 2010 from $182.6 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to pre synergized cost structure of the acquired revenues, higher amortization expense, market penetration for our Pharmaceutical Waste programs, and investments in the Steri Safe services. Internationally, our SG&A increased $18.8 million, or 41.5%, in 2010 to $64.1 million from $45.3 million in 2009. As percentage of revenue, SG&A was 18.0% in 2010 and 17.1% in 2009. The increase in SG&A was partially due to our acquisitions in UK, Brazil, and Japan, which have higher SG&A expenses. Higher amortization expense related to recognized intangible assets from acquisitions and investment in our Clinical Services program also contributed to the increase in SG&A. Income from Operations: Income from operations increased by $55.5 million, or 17.6%, to $370.7 million in 2010 from $315.2 million in 2009. Comparisons of income from operations between 2010 and 2009 are affected by various charges not considered part of our day to day operations. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized $9.5 million in acquisition expenses, $4.1 million expenses related to integration of new acquisitions, $7.6 million of restructuring cost, $0.8 million plant closure expenses, and litigation settlement of $0.9 million, partially offset by a $3.0 million gain on sale of assets related to the MedServe divestiture. These various adjustments resulted in $19.9 million net expense on a pre tax basis. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized $7.3 million in acquisition expenses, $1.1 million expenses related to integration of new acquisitions, and $1.6 million of restructuring costs for our regulated returns and recall management services business. These adjustments resulted in $10.0 million net expenses on a pre tax basis. Domestically, our income from operations increased $45.5 million, or 17.2%, to $310.4 million in 2010 from $264.9 million in 2009. Internationally, our income from operations increased $10.0 million, or 19.9%, to $60.3 million in 2010 from $50.3 million in 2009. Interest Expense and Interest Income: Interest expense increased to $37.1 million during 2010 from $34.4 million during 2009 due to higher borrowings in 2010 and higher interest rates. Interest income was $0.3 million during both 2010 and 2009. Income Tax Expense: Income tax expense for the years 2010 and 2009 reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 36.6% and 36.5%, respectively, for federal and state income taxes. In 2010, we recognized a net $1.2 million benefit related to prior years unrecognized tax benefits. In 2009, we recognized a net $1.8 million benefit related to prior years unrecognized tax benefits. 28 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources: Our $1.0 billion senior credit facility maturing in September 2016, our $100.0 million private placement notes maturing April 2015, our $175.0 million private placement note maturing in October 2017, and our $225.0 million private placement notes maturing in October 2020, all require us to comply with various financial, reporting and other covenants and restrictions, including a restriction on dividend payments. The financial debt covenants are the same for the senior credit facility and the private placement notes. At December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with all of our financial debt covenants. As of December 31, 2011, we had $527.9 million of borrowings outstanding under our $1.0 billion senior unsecured credit facility, which includes foreign currency borrowings of $72.4 million. We also had $159.1 million committed to outstanding letters of credit under our senior credit facility. The unused portion of the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2011 was $313.0 million. At December 31, 2011, our interest rates on borrowings under our revolving credit facility were as follows: For short term borrowing (less than one month): Federal funds rate plus 0.5%, the prime rate or the Euro Currency rate plus 1%, whichever is higher and a spread of 0.125% plus a 0.25% facility fee. For borrowing greater than one month: LIBOR plus 1.125% plus a 0.25% facility fee. The weighted average rate of interest on the unsecured revolving credit facility was 1.73% per annum, which includes the 0.25% facility fee. As of December 31, 2011, we had $100.0 million outstanding 5.64% private placement notes which we entered into on April 15, 2008. The notes bear interest at the fixed rate of 5.64% per annum. Interest is payable in arrears semi annually on April 15 and October 15 beginning on October 15, 2009, and principal is payable at the maturity of the notes on April 15, 2015. As of December 31, 2011, we had outstanding $175.0 million of seven year unsecured senior notes (the Series A notes) and $225.0 million of 10 year unsecured senior notes (the Series B notes). The Series A notes bear interest at the fixed rate of 3.89% per annum, and the Series B notes bear interest at the fixed rate of 4.47% per annum. Interest is payable in arrears semi annually on April 15 and October 15 beginning on April 15, 2011. The principal amount of $175.0 million of the Series A notes will be payable at the maturity of the notes on October 15, 2017, and the principal amount of $225.0 million of the Series B notes will be payable at the maturity of the notes on October 15, 2020. At December 31, 2011, we had $240.1 million in promissory notes issued in connection with acquisitions during 2004 through 2011, $111.9 million in foreign subsidiary bank debt outstanding, and $4.7 million in capital lease obligations. Working Capital: At December 31, 2011, our working capital increased by $3.5 million to $63.7 million compared to $60.2 million at December 31, 2010. Our current assets increased by $21.9 million in 2011 primarily due to acquired assets of $61.9 million of which $54.4 million was accounts receivable. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2010 included $23.0 million, offset by an equivalent amount in accrued liabilities that was used for recalled product reimbursement during 2011. Our current liabilities increased by $18.4 million in 2011. We acquired $39.1 million in current liabilities of which $27.1 million was accounts payable. Offsetting these acquired liabilities was the decrease in the recalled product reimbursement of $23.0 million. We repaid the outstanding principal on our term loan debt of which $20.2 million was current (see Note 13 Debt), and also $9.9 million of the short term portion of our acquisition notes. Offsetting short term debt decreases was an increase in our short term amounts on our senior credit facility of $30.2 million due to borrowings for acquisitions. The remaining increase to our current liabilities is primarily an increase to accrued taxes and an increase to accrued interest related to higher debt. 29 Table of Contents Net Cash Provided or Used: Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $19.6 million, or 6.0%, to $306.1 million during 2011. Cash provided by operations as a ratio to net income is 129% and 155% for 2011 and 2010, respectively, with Days Sales Outstanding at 53 days when excluding acquired receivables related to our acquisition in Spain, and 59 days when including acquired receivables in 2011 compared to 51 days in 2010. Cash provided by operating activities in 2010 includes a cash inflow for recalled product reimbursements, which resulted in an increase to accrued liabilities in the amount of $23.0 million. Net cash used in investing activities during 2011 was $514.6 million compared to $245.5 million used in 2010. The increase is due to acquisitions, of which the largest was our acquisition of HWS which resulted in $234.4 million cash used. We redeemed $15.8 million of certificates of deposit the quarter ended September 30, 2011. Capital expenditures in 2011 decreased, as a percentage of revenue, to 3.2% from 3.4% in 2010. Net cash provided by financing activities was $148.3 million during 2011 compared to $13.6 million net cash used by financing activities in 2010, a change of $216.5 million related to increased borrowings to finance certain acquisitions, and partially offset by share repurchases of $124.1 million compared to $94.3 million in 2010, an increase of $29.7 million. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and cash commitments as of December 31, 2011: Payments due by period (dollars in thousands) Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017and After Long term debt (1) $ 1,633,140 $ 144,962 $ 258,888 $ 752,824 $ 476,466 Capital lease obligations (1) 5,435 2,572 1,740 647 476 Operating leases 204,858 50,432 70,747 44,020 39,659 Purchase obligations 10,584 4,388 4,795 1,401 0 Other long term liabilities (1)(2) 4,658 1,162 1,229 1,352 915 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,858,675 $ 203,516 $ 337,399 $ 800,244 $ 517,516 (1) The long term debt, capital leases, and other long term liabilities items include both the future principal payment amount as well as an amount calculated for expected future interest payments. Long term debt that has floating interest rate requires the use of management judgment to estimate the future rate of interest. (2) Other long term liabilities include amounts related to covenants not to compete agreements and exclude payments for unrecognized tax benefits. Based on the contingent and uncertain nature of our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make an estimate of the period of potential settlement, if any, with the applicable taxing authorities. At December 31, 2011, we had $159.1 million in stand by letters of credit issued. We anticipate that our operating cash flow, together with borrowings under our senior unsecured credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated future operating expenses, capital expenditures and debt service obligations as they become due during the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. Guarantees: We have guaranteed a loan to JPMorganChase Bank N.A. on behalf of Shiraishi Sogyo Co. Ltd (Shiraishi). Shiraishi is a customer in Japan that is expanding its medical waste management business and has a one year loan with a current balance of $6.4 million with JPMorganChase Bank N.A. that expires in May 2012. We also have extended loans to Shiraishi for approximately $15.2 million in support of its medical waste business. These amounts are collateralized with the assets of Shiraishi and related companies. 30 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are subject to market risks arising from changes in interest rates. Our potential additional interest expense over one year that would result from a hypothetical, instantaneous and unfavorable change of 100 basis points in the interest rate on all of our variable rate obligations would be approximately $6.1 million on a pre tax basis. We have exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. We have subsidiaries in eleven foreign countries whose functional currency is the local currency. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could unfavorably impact our consolidated results of operations. We have exposure to commodity pricing for gas and diesel fuel for our trucks and for the purchase of containers and boxes. We do not hedge these items to manage the exposure. 31 Table of Contents
