Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This narrative will assist readers in their analysis of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and supplemental financial information of the Company. It should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes on pages 73 through 130. Effective October 1, 2004, National Commerce Financial Corporation (NCF) merged with SunTrust. The results of operations for NCF were included with SunTrusts results beginning October 1, 2004. Prior periods do not reflect the impact of the merger. In Managements Discussion and Analysis, net interest income, net interest margin and the efficiency ratio are presented on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis and the ratios are presented on an annualized basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax favored status of income from certain loans and investments. The Company believes this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax exempt sources. The Company also presents diluted earnings per common share excluding merger expense and an efficiency ratio excluding merger expense that exclude merger charges related to the NCF acquisition. The Company believes the exclusion of the merger charges, which represent incremental costs to integrate NCFs operations, is more reflective of normalized operations. Additionally, the Company presents a return on average realized common shareholders equity, as well as a return on average common shareholders equity (ROE). The Company also presents a return on average assets less net unrealized securities gains/losses and a return on average total assets (ROA). The return on average realized common shareholders equity and return on average assets less net unrealized securities gains/losses exclude realized securities gains and losses, The Coca Cola Company dividend, and net unrealized securities gains. Due to its ownership of approximately 48 million shares of common stock of The Coca Cola Company, resulting in an unrealized net gain of $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2006, the Company believes ROA and ROE excluding these impacts from the Companys securities portfolio is the more comparative performance measure when being evaluated against other companies. SunTrust presents a tangible efficiency ratio and a tangible equity to tangible assets ratio which exclude the cost of and the other effects of intangible assets resulting from merger and acquisition (M&A) activity. The Company believes these measures are useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible asset costs and merger and acquisition activity (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare the Companys efficiency and capital adequacy to other companies in the industry. The measures are utilized by management to assess the efficiency of the Company and its lines of business as well as the capital adequacy of the Company. The Company provides reconcilements on pages 67 and 68 for all non US GAAP measures. Certain reclassifications may be made to prior period financial statements and related information to conform them to the 2006 presentation. SunTrust reported net income available to common shareholders of $2,109.7 million, or $5.82 per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2006. For the fourth quarter of 2006, SunTrust reported net income available to common shareholders of $498.6 million or $1.39 per diluted common share. These results have been revised from the earnings results the Company reported in its January 19, 2007 earnings release in which the Company reported net income available to common shareholders of $2,134.8 million, or $5.88 per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2006 and net income available to common shareholders of $523.6 million, or $1.46 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2006. The reduction in earnings relates to a $40 million increase in the provision for loan losses associated with the previously disclosed large commercial credit. Subsequent to year end, the Company continued to work with the borrower associated with this large commercial credit to identify all possible sources of repayment. As of December 31, 2006 and at the 17 time of the 2006 earnings release, the Company had recorded a specific reserve which reflected managements best estimate of the expected loss based on information available at that time. In February 2007, certain events occurred which resulted in a reduction of managements estimate of the net realizable amount of the loan. On February 23, 2007, the borrower signed a definitive agreement to sell the majority of its assets, primarily customer contracts, to an unrelated third party at a value that was less than previously estimated due in large part to a reduction in the borrowers revenues after December 31, 2006. As a result of the sale of the majority of the borrowers assets, the large commercial credit was partially repaid and the remainder of the Companys exposure to this borrower was charged off. This resulted in an additional $40 million in provision for loan losses and a $68.8 million charge off. SunTrust provided the financing to the purchaser. The Company believes the purchaser is financially stable, and the new financing reflects market terms and conditions. The terms of the definitive sale agreement include a component of contingent consideration of approximately $31 million, based on the future performance of the purchased customer contracts. The performance period ends during the third quarter of 2007. The contingent portion of the purchase was structured under a separate note. Since the ultimate amount of repayment on this note is based on the future performance of the purchased customer contracts, the note is classified as non accrual and the Company recorded a specific reserve based on the estimated amount of consideration to be received. Nonperforming loans declined $130.5 million as a result of the definitive agreement and new financing. Management evaluated these events and determined that in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that it was necessary to reflect these revisions to the estimated net realizable amount of the loan in its 2006 financial statements since these subsequent events occurred prior to the filing of the Companys 2006 Annual Report on Form 10 K. The revision to managements estimate subsequent to year end does not constitute a control deficiency. Rather, it is a reflection of the extremely fluid nature of the workout activities associated with this large commercial credit and specific events which took place subsequent to year end. All of the financial information included in the Companys 2006 Annual Report on Form 10 K has been updated to reflect these revisions. INTRODUCTION SunTrust is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, and operates primarily within Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Within the geographic footprint, SunTrust strategically operates under five business segments. These business segments are: Retail, Commercial, Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB), Wealth and Investment Management, and Mortgage. Despite a challenging operating environment in 2006, which included fierce deposit competition and a prolonged flat to inverted yield curve, SunTrust was able to grow diluted earnings per common share by 6.4% over 2005. Loans, deposits and our overall customer base continued to grow in 2006, which reflects our intense focus on sales and client service. As the year progressed and market conditions became increasingly difficult, we were able to overcome the negative impact the yield curve had on net interest income with strong fee income growth and by ratcheting up expense control. The Company also instituted an efficiency and productivity program in the second half of 2006 which we expect to yield significant benefits over the next several years. The efficiency and productivity initiatives, coupled with our sales and service focus and strong credit culture, provide momentum going into 2007 and beyond. The following is a summary of the Companys 2006 financial performance: Total revenue FTE increased $407.3 million, or 5.2%, compared to 2005. Noninterest income sources contributed $313.3 million, or 76.9% of the increase, led by strong mortgage production and servicing income while net interest income FTE contributed $93.9 million, or 23.1% of the increase. 18 Net interest income FTE increased $93.9 million, or 2.0%; however the net interest margin declined 17 basis points to 3.00%. The margin decline was the result of the flat to inverted yield curve experienced throughout 2006 which compressed interest rate spreads on earning assets. The average earning asset yield increased 92 basis points compared to 2005 while the average interest bearing liability cost increased 128 basis points, resulting in a 36 basis point decline in interest rate spread. Additionally, there was a shift in the mix of deposits to higher cost products, with certificates of deposits increasing, while other deposit products, specifically DDA, money market, and savings, declined. Noninterest income improved $313.3 million, or 9.9%, compared to 2005. The increase was driven by strong mortgage production and servicing income and gain on the sale of the Bond Trustee business. Noninterest expense increased $189.1 million, or 4.0%, compared to 2005. The increase was driven by higher personnel costs due to increased headcount, normal merit raises, and higher benefits cost. Net charge offs as a percentage of average loans was 0.21% for 2006 and included the charge off of a large commercial loan that was determined to be nonperforming in the third quarter of 2006. This credit was the primary driver of an $85.6 million, or 48.4%, increase in provision for loan losses compared to 2005. Nonperforming assets increased $259.6 million compared to December 31, 2005 due primarily to an increase in residential real estate nonperforming loans, which was driven mainly by the maturation of this portfolio, and more specifically in well collateralized or insured conforming and Alt A first mortgage loans. 19 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS TABLE 1 Analysis of changes in Net Interest Income1 2006 Compared to 2005 Increase (Decrease) Due to 2005 Compared to 2004 Increase (Decrease) Due to (Dollars in millions on a taxable equivalent basis) Volume Rate Net Volume Rate Net Interest Income Loans: Real estate 1 4 family $382.6 $180.5 $563.1 $375.0 $69.4 $444.4 Real estate construction 188.4 136.5 324.9 226.1 97.4 323.5 Real estate home equity lines 77.3 214.6 291.9 202.9 167.1 370.0 Real estate commercial 57.6 117.5 175.1 129.2 116.2 245.4 Commercial FTE2 51.8 346.8 398.6 167.0 387.2 554.2 Business credit card 5.5 (1.2 ) 4.3 4.4 (0.2 ) 4.2 Consumer direct (80.0 ) 57.3 (22.7 ) 73.6 41.2 114.8 Consumer indirect (25.1 ) 26.1 1.0 1.8 (26.7 ) (24.9 ) Nonaccrual and restructured 4.4 (1.0 ) 3.4 1.5 (7.3 ) (5.8 ) Securities available for sale: Taxable (98.3 ) 108.1 9.8 87.2 132.7 219.9 Tax exempt 2 5.0 (0.9 ) 4.1 15.0 (1.0 ) 14.0 Funds sold and securities purchased underagreements to resell (8.6 ) 22.4 13.8 0.4 24.2 24.6 Loans held for sale 166.3 76.0 242.3 170.7 33.7 204.4 Interest bearing deposits 2.5 2.5 0.1 0.6 0.7 Interest earning trading assets 23.7 37.4 61.1 27.8 12.8 40.6 Total interest income 753.1 1,320.1 2,073.2 1,482.7 1,047.3 2,530.0 Interest Expense NOW accounts 139.0 139.0 21.5 76.3 97.8 Money market accounts (19.2 ) 214.8 195.6 26.1 213.9 240.0 Savings (9.6 ) 31.6 22.0 (7.3 ) 8.9 1.6 Consumer time 101.0 158.8 259.8 108.5 64.3 172.8 Other time 147.3 106.8 254.1 107.1 38.8 145.9 Brokered deposits 321.9 204.2 526.1 177.9 88.7 266.6 Foreign deposits 84.6 150.6 235.2 17.4 124.6 142.0 Funds purchased 20.3 74.1 94.4 1.0 79.6 80.6 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase 19.9 116.6 136.5 4.9 118.1 123.0 Other short term borrowings (52.1 ) 47.0 (5.1 ) 22.9 41.9 64.8 Long term debt (143.9 ) 265.6 121.7 140.0 144.0 284.0 Total interest expense 470.2 1,509.1 1,979.3 620.0 999.1 1,619.1 Net change in net interest income $282.9 ($189.0 ) $93.9 $862.7 $48.2 $910.9 1 Changes in net interest income are attributed to either changes in average balances (volume change) or changes in average rates (rate change) for earning assets and sources of funds on which interest is received or paid. Volume change is calculated as change in volume times the previous rate, while rate change is change in rate times the previous volume. The rate/volume change, change in rate times change in volume, is allocated between volume change and rate change at the ratio each component bears to the absolute value of their total. 2 Interest income includes the effects of taxable equivalent adjustments (reduced by the nondeductible portion of interest expense) using a federal income tax rate of 35% and, where applicable, state income taxes to increase tax exempt interest income to a taxable equivalent basis. Net Interest Income/Margin Net interest income for 2006 was $4,748.4 million, an increase of $93.9 million, or 2.0%, from 2005. Net interest income benefited from strong earning asset growth, in particular, loans and loans held for sale. The net interest margin decreased 17 basis points to 3.00% in 2006 due to spread compression from the continued flat to inverted yield curve. An overall decline in low cost deposits, as well as a shift in the deposit mix to higher cost certificates of deposit also contributed to the decrease. Continuation or acceleration of this trend in customer preferences for higher yielding deposits and a prolonged flat to inverted yield curve, or other external factors, could have a further negative impact on net interest margin in future periods. The Company has incorporated initiatives to mitigate further margin compression with an emphasis on growing lower cost deposits. While both short term and long term interest rates have risen for the last year, the yield curve has flattened considerably. The Federal Reserve Bank Fed Funds rate averaged 4.97% for 2006, an increase 20 of 175 basis points over the 2005 average, and one month LIBOR increased 167 basis points to average 5.13% in 2006. In contrast, the five year swap rate averaged 5.23%, an increase of 75 basis points over the 2005 average, and the ten year swap rate increased 60 basis points over the same time period to an average rate of 5.33%. As a result, incremental asset growth, in particular mortgage loans and mortgage loans held for sale, were funded at tighter spreads due to higher short term borrowing costs. The 2006 earning asset yield increased 92 basis points from 2005, while total interest bearing liability costs increased 128 basis points from the prior year. Loan yield improved 95 basis points and securities available for sale yield increased 43 basis points from the prior year. Average earning assets were up $11.8 billion, or 8.0%, and average interest bearing liabilities increased $11.2 billion, or 9.3%, for 2006 compared to 2005. Average loans increased $10.9 billion, or 10.0%, primarily due to mortgage loans, average securities available for sale decreased $2.0 billion, or 7.7%, and average loans held for sale increased $2.6 billion, or 31.2%, compared to 2005. The decline in securities available for sale was a result of the 2006 repositioning initiative to improve the portfolio yield and delever the balance sheet. Further details of the portfolio repositioning are provided in the Securities Available for Sale section beginning on page 32. The Company continued to take steps to obtain alternative lower cost funding sources, such as developing initiatives to grow customer deposits. Campaigns to attract client deposits were implemented in 2005 and continued in the fourth quarter of 2006 as evidenced by the $3.8 billion increase in average consumer and commercial deposits compared to 2005. The net growth in consumer and commercial deposits was entirely in certificates of deposit as consumers have focused on higher paying deposits in the current rate environment. Low cost deposits (noninterest bearing deposits, certain NOW accounts, and savings) declined due to lower cost deposits migrating to higher cost certificates of deposits as well as customers seeking alternative investments offered by the Company such as off balance sheet money market mutual funds. Interest income that the Company was unable to recognize on nonperforming loans had a negative impact of one basis point on the net interest margin in both 2006 and 2005. 21 TABLE 2 Consolidated Daily Average Balances, Income/Expense and Average Yields Earned and Rates Paid 2006 2005 2004 (Dollars in millions; yields on taxable equivalent basis) AverageBalances Income/Expense Yields/Rates AverageBalances Income/Expense Yields/Rates AverageBalances Income/Expense Yields/Rates Assets Loans:1 Real estate 1 4 family $33,523.5 $2,022.6 6.03 % $26,972.2 $1,459.4 5.41 % $19,961.9 $1,015.0 5.08 % Real estate construction 12,333.9 923.8 7.49 9,621.6 598.9 6.22 5,728.3 275.4 4.81 Real estate home equity lines 13,565.2 1,032.3 7.61 12,361.1 740.4 5.99 8,502.6 370.4 4.36 Real estate commercial 12,803.7 866.6 6.77 11,865.6 691.4 5.83 9,427.9 446.0 4.73 Commercial FTE2 33,836.1 2,087.4 6.17 32,852.2 1,688.7 5.14 28,962.4 1,134.5 3.92 Business credit card 315.3 19.1 6.09 226.7 14.9 6.58 160.5 10.7 6.69 Consumer direct 4,460.8 313.6 7.03 5,690.7 336.3 5.91 4,375.4 221.5 5.06 Consumer indirect 8,376.6 477.6 5.70 8,833.4 476.7 5.40 8,802.4 501.6 5.70 Nonaccrual and restructured 430.1 16.6 3.85 318.5 13.2 4.14 293.1 19.0 6.48 Total loans 119,645.2 7,759.6 6.49 108,742.0 6,019.9 5.54 86,214.5 3,994.1 4.63 Securities available for sale: Taxable 23,430.9 1,146.8 4.89 25,557.9 1,137.0 4.45 23,429.8 917.1 3.91 Tax exempt2 954.5 55.8 5.85 868.7 51.7 5.95 617.1 37.7 6.11 Total securities available for sale 24,385.4 1,202.6 4.93 26,426.6 1,188.7 4.50 24,046.9 954.8 3.97 Funds sold and securities under agreements to resell 1,158.6 57.0 4.92 1,404.8 43.2 3.08 1,376.9 18.6 1.35 Loans held for sale 11,082.8 728.0 6.57 8,447.8 485.7 5.75 5,427.1 281.3 5.18 Interest bearing deposits 93.4 3.3 3.59 25.0 0.9 3.47 18.1 0.2 0.98 Interest earning trading assets 2,063.3 129.5 6.28 1,593.6 68.4 4.29 885.3 27.8 3.14 Total earning assets 158,428.7 9,880.0 6.24 146,639.8 7,806.8 5.32 117,968.8 5,276.8 4.47 Allowance for loan and lease losses (1,061.3 ) (1,041.8 ) (989.5 ) Cash and due from banks 3,834.8 4,313.4 3,732.9 Premises and equipment 1,915.8 1,846.6 1,672.7 Other assets 14,619.1 13,585.9 8,060.4 Noninterest earning trading assets 957.5 795.5 936.8 Unrealized gains onsecurities available for sale 1,620.5 1,949.4 2,372.2 Total assets $180,315.1 $168,088.8 $133,754.3 Liabilities and Shareholders Equity Interest bearing deposits: NOW accounts $17,214.4 $307.8 1.79 % $17,213.7 $168.9 0.98 % $13,777.5 $71.0 0.52 % Money market accounts 24,507.9 634.5 2.59 25,589.2 438.9 1.72 22,864.7 198.9 0.87 Savings 5,371.1 79.1 1.47 6,320.0 57.1 0.90 7,225.4 55.5 0.77 Consumer time 15,622.7 614.6 3.93 12,526.4 354.8 2.83 8,333.5 182.0 2.18 Other time 11,146.9 492.9 4.42 7,390.7 238.7 3.23 3,843.3 92.8 2.42 Total interest bearing consumerand commercial deposits 73,863.0 2,128.9 2.88 69,040.0 1,258.4 1.82 56,044.4 600.2 1.07 Brokered deposits 17,425.7 880.5 5.05 10,182.2 354.5 3.48 4,273.5 87.9 2.06 Foreign deposits 9,064.5 455.3 5.02 6,869.3 220.1 3.20 5,767.9 78.1 1.35 Total interest bearing deposits 100,353.2 3,464.7 3.45 86,091.5 1,833.0 2.13 66,085.8 766.2 1.16 Federal funds purchased 4,439.5 222.9 5.02 3,888.3 128.5 3.31 3,810.5 47.9 1.26 Securities sold under agreementsto repurchase 7,087.0 320.1 4.52 6,443.0 183.7 2.85 5,986.2 60.6 1.01 Other short term borrowings 1,507.1 90.0 5.96 2,663.5 94.9 3.57 1,709.9 30.2 1.77 Long term debt 18,600.7 1,033.9 5.56 21,713.9 912.2 4.20 18,075.4 628.3 3.48 Total interest bearing liabilities 131,987.5 5,131.6 3.89 120,800.2 3,152.3 2.61 95,667.8 1,533.2 1.60 Noninterest bearing deposits 23,312.3 24,315.0 21,047.1 Other liabilities 7,468.6 6,447.3 5,569.9 Shareholders equity 17,546.7 16,526.3 11,469.5 Total liabilities and shareholders equity $180,315.1 $168,088.8 $133,754.3 Interest Rate Spread 2.35 % 2.71 % 2.87 % Net Interest Income FTE3 $4,748.4 $4,654.5 $3,743.6 Net Interest Margin4 3.00 % 3.17 % 3.17 % 1 Beginning in 2006 and for each of the six years ended December 31, the interest income includes loan fees of $115.1 million, $123.6 million, $121.6 million, $123.8 million, $122.6 million, and $148.7 million, respectively. Nonaccrual loans are included in average balances and income on such loans, if recognized, is recorded on a cash basis. 2 Interest income includes the effects of taxable equivalent adjustments using a federal income tax rate of 35% for all years reported and where applicable, state income taxes, to increase tax exempt interest income to a taxable equivalent basis. Beginning in 2006 and for each of the six years ended December 31, the net taxable equivalent adjustment amounts included in the above table were $88.0 million, $75.5 million, $58.4 million, $45.0 million, $39.5 million, and $40.8 million, respectively. 3 Derivative instruments used to help balance the Companys interest sensitivity position decreased net interest income by $105.6 million in 2006, increased net interest income by $104.4 million in 2005, $151.5 million in 2004, $64.0 million in 2003, decreased net interest income $50.4 million in 2002, and $37.4 million in 2001. 4 The net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized net interest income FTE by average total earning assets. During the second quarter of 2006, the net interest margin calculation was revised as a result of the Company segregating certain noninterest earning trading assets that had previously been included with interest earning trading assets. All prior periods presented were restated to reflect this refinement. Management believes this refined method to be a more reflective measure of net interest margin due to the interest earning nature of these assets. 22 2003 2002 2001 (Dollars in millions; yields on taxable equivalentbasis) Average Balances Income/ Expense Yields/ Rates Average Balances Income/ Expense Yields/ Rates Average Balances Income/ Expense Yields Rates Assets Loans:1 Real estate 1 4 family $15,689.7 $901.6 5.75 % $14,965.0 $1,029.8 6.88 % $16,173.6 $1,210.3 7.48 % Real estate construction 4,149.5 190.9 4.60 3,749.3 203.5 5.43 3,632.0 270.0 7.43 Real estate home equity lines 6,098.0 267.3 4.38 4,193.7 212.9 5.08 2,400.7 190.8 7.95 Real estate commercial 9,203.7 454.6 4.94 8,705.8 511.1 5.87 7,796.4 579.9 7.44 Commercial FTE2 28,616.2 1,060.2 3.70 27,522.5 1,196.4 4.35 29,126.6 1,833.1 6.29 Business credit card 129.7 9.0 6.91 97.6 7.4 7.65 81.0 6.8 8.44 Consumer direct 3,675.7 186.2 5.07 4,382.4 255.5 5.83 4,448.7 331.9 7.46 Consumer indirect 8,103.3 548.5 6.77 7,115.7 559.5 7.86 5,933.6 502.5 8.47 Nonaccrual and restructured 472.1 14.1 2.98 538.4 15.6 2.89 430.4 15.8 3.68 Total loans 76,137.9 3,632.4 4.77 71,270.4 3,991.7 5.60 70,023.0 4,941.1 7.06 Securities available for sale: Taxable 20,994.4 676.2 3.22 16,890.3 818.6 4.85 15,904.8 1,033.9 6.50 Tax exempt2 374.1 24.1 6.46 408.3 28.0 6.85 448.7 35.7 7.95 Total securities available for sale 21,368.5 700.3 3.28 17,298.6 846.6 4.89 16,353.5 1,069.6 6.54 Funds sold and securitiesunder agreements to resell 1,387.0 15.7 1.13 1,390.4 24.5 1.76 1,250.3 51.2 4.09 Loans held for sale 8,587.7 448.3 5.22 4,410.8 280.4 6.36 2,949.9 211.5 7.17 Interest bearing deposits 10.5 0.1 1.39 404.7 7.0 1.73 167.6 5.8 3.43 Interest earning trading assets 603.3 17.0 2.81 794.8 24.5 3.09 1,289.8 41.3 3.20 Total earning assets 108,094.9 4,813.8 4.45 95,569.7 5,174.7 5.41 92,034.1 6,320.5 6.87 Allowance for loan and lease losses (950.8 ) (924.3 ) (876.3 ) Cash and due from banks 3,432.1 3,343.2 3,383.4 Premises and equipment 1,588.7 1,621.2 1,599.7 Other assets 6,655.0 5,373.4 4,043.3 Noninterest earning trading assets 1,162.5 801.1 Unrealized gains onsecurities available for sale 2,343.0 2,731.8 2,700.0 Total assets $122,325.4 $108,516.1 $102,884.2 Liabilities and Shareholders Equity Interest bearing deposits: NOW accounts $11,702.0 $50.7 0.43 % $10,315.4 $74.5 0.72 % $8,471.3 $101.2 1.20 % Money market accounts 22,218.5 203.5 0.92 20,470.9 326.8 1.60 15,830.1 527.6 3.33 Savings 6,259.3 46.7 0.75 6,310.0 85.1 1.35 6,066.6 171.5 2.83 Consumer time 7,975.4 201.7 2.53 9,342.4 347.1 3.72 9,092.6 468.8 5.16 Other time 3,461.6 80.0 2.31 3,722.8 102.1 2.74 3,823.9 200.6 5.25 Total interest bearing consumerand commercial deposits 51,616.8 582.6 1.13 50,161.5 935.6 1.87 43,284.5 1,469.7 3.40 Brokered deposits 3,662.0 111.2 3.04 2,537.2 130.1 5.13 2,617.7 115.3 4.40 Foreign deposits 6,933.3 77.8 1.12 3,190.4 51.6 1.62 5,175.4 227.5 4.39 Total interest bearing deposits 62,212.1 771.6 1.24 55,889.1 1,117.3 2.00 51,077.6 1,812.5 3.55 Federal funds purchased 6,025.0 66.2 1.10 3,902.0 62.2 1.59 4,768.5 190.8 4.00 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase 5,641.9 40.0 0.71 6,474.2 78.3 1.21 6,515.1 221.4 3.40 Other short term borrowings 2,211.7 33.5 1.52 924.8 14.1 1.52 1,593.8 63.4 3.98 Long term debt 12,657.1 537.2 4.24 11,960.0 619.6 5.18 12,497.2 739.0 5.91 Total interest bearing liabilities 88,747.8 1,448.5 1.63 79,150.1 1,891.5 2.39 76,452.2 3,027.1 3.96 Noninterest bearing deposits 17,826.9 15,268.1 13,491.1 Other liabilities 6,667.7 5,372.2 4,867.1 Shareholders equity 9,083.0 8,725.7 8,073.8 Total liabilities and shareholders equity $122,325.4 $108,516.1 $102,884.2 Interest Rate Spread 2.82 % 3.02 % 2.91 % Net Interest Income FTE3 $3,365.3 $3,283.2 $3,293.4 Net Interest Margin4 3.11 % 3.44 % 3.58 % 1 Beginning in 2006 and for each of the six years ended December 31, the interest income includes loan fees of $115.1 million, $123.6 million, $121.6 million, $123.8 million, $122.6 million, and $148.7 million, respectively. Nonaccrual loans are included in average balances and income on such loans, if recognized, is recorded on a cash basis. 2 Interest income includes the effects of taxable equivalent adjustments using a federal income tax rate of 35% for all years reported and where applicable, state income taxes, to increase tax exempt interest income to a taxable equivalent basis. Beginning in 2006 and for each of the six years ended December 31, the net taxable equivalent adjustment amounts included in the above table were $88.0 million, $75.5 million, $58.4 million, $45.0 million, $39.5 million, and $40.8 million, respectively. 3 Derivative instruments used to help balance the Companys interest sensitivity position decreased net interest income by $105.6 million in 2006, increased net interest income by $104.4 million in 2005, $151.5 million in 2004, $64.0 million in 2003, decreased net interest income $50.4 million in 2002, and $37.4 million in 2001. 4 The net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized net interest income FTE by average total earning assets. During the second quarter of 2006, the net interest margin calculation was revised as a result of the Company segregating certain noninterest earning trading assets that had previously been included with interest earning trading assets. All prior periods presented were restated to reflect this refinement. Management believes this refined method to be a more reflective measure of net interest margin due to the interest earning nature of these assets. 23 TABLE 3 Noninterest Income Year Ended December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 Service charges on deposit accounts $763.7 $772.5 $700.0 $643.1 $612.9 $510.2 Trust and investment management income 686.9 673.7 586.8 502.4 504.5 486.1 Retail investment services 234.0 213.3 192.8 161.8 136.7 107.8 Other charges and fees 462.1 456.5 390.5 326.3 296.9 240.3 Card fees 247.6 210.8 153.4 119.6 120.0 113.6 Investment banking income 230.6 216.5 206.7 192.5 177.0 108.5 Trading account profits and commissions 113.0 145.1 127.8 109.9 103.2 95.7 Mortgage production related income 217.4 144.9 57.8 150.1 92.3 82.2 Mortgage servicing related income (expense) 121.7 41.9 11.1 (177.5 ) (110.1 ) (6.1 ) Net gain on sale of Bond Trustee business 112.8 Net gain on sale of RCM assets 23.4 Other noninterest income 329.1 263.6 219.2 150.9 130.9 160.5 Total noninterest income beforesecurities (losses)/gains 3,518.9 3,162.2 2,646.1 2,179.1 2,064.3 1,898.8 Securities (losses)/gains (50.5 ) (7.2 ) (41.7 ) 123.9 204.5 153.1 Total noninterest income $3,468.4 $3,155.0 $2,604.4 $2,303.0 $2,268.8 $2,051.9 Noninterest Income Noninterest income for 2006 was $3,468.4 million, an increase of $313.4 million, or 9.9%, compared to 2005. The primary drivers of the increase were increases in mortgage production and servicing income, card fees, retail investment services, investment banking income, trust and investment management income, and the $112.8 million net gain on the sale of the Bond Trustee business. These increases were partially offset by declines in trading account profits and commissions, service charges on deposits, higher net securities losses in 2006 and the sale of Receivables Capital Management, which resulted in a net gain of $23.4 million in 2005. Combined mortgage related income increased $152.3 million, or 81.5%, compared to 2005. The increase was driven by higher loan production, increased secondary marketing deliveries, and higher servicing income. Mortgage production for 2006 was $55.4 billion, up $7.7 billion, or 16.2%, compared to 2005. Loan sales to investors were $40.9 billion, an increase of $13.2 billion, or 47.6%, compared to 2005. The increase in mortgage servicing income was driven by a larger servicing portfolio and the realization of the value embedded in mortgage servicing rights through the securitization and or sale of a portion of the servicing rights. The sale/securitization of servicing rights resulted in a gain of $66.3 million in 2006. These positive drivers of mortgage servicing income were partially offset by a $29.1 million, or 17.5% increase in mortgage servicing rights amortization due to a larger servicing portfolio. Total loans serviced for third parties were $91.5 billion and $68.9 billion as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Card fees, which include fees from business credit cards and debit card fees from consumers and businesses, increased $36.8 million, or 17.5%, compared to 2005. The increase was primarily due to an increase in interchange fee income due to increased transaction volume. The higher transaction volumes were due to increased debit card penetration (number of account holders who have debit cards) which continued to trend upward as consumers increased the use of this form of payment. Service charges on deposit accounts decreased $8.8 million, or 1.1%, due to a decline in consumer NSF fees as well as customer migration from fee based checking products to free checking account products. Retail investment services increased $20.7 million, or 9.7%, compared to 2005. The increase was attributable to improvements in annuity, managed account and new business revenues. Investment banking income increased $14.1 million, or 6.5%, compared to 2005. The increase was driven by strong debt capital markets revenue in the securitization, structured leasing and loan 24 syndication businesses. Trading account profits and commissions declined $32.1 million, or 22.1%, primarily due to negative interest rate related marks on securitization residuals and economic hedges outside of the Corporate and Investment Banking line of business. Trading activities in the CIB line of business represented only a third of the overall decline, primarily due to a decline in fixed income sales and trading resulting from the flat to inverted yield curve experienced throughout 2006. Trust and investment management income increased $13.2 million, or 2.0%, compared to 2005. An overall increase in assets under management and improved market conditions resulted in higher income. Assets under management increased 4.3% compared to December 31, 2005 due to net new business and an increase in equity market valuations. Trust and investment management income and assets under management were impacted by the sale of the Bond Trustee business in the third quarter of 2006. Approximately $21 billion in non managed corporate trust assets were transferred to U.S. Bank in the third quarter. For the first nine months of 2006, prior to the sale, the Bond Trustee business generated approximately $17 million of revenue, a majority of which was classified as trust and investment management income. The sale of the business, which generated a pre tax gain of $112.8 million, was part of an effort by the Company to modify its business mix by focusing on its high growth core business lines and market segments. Other noninterest income increased $65.5 million or 24.8% primarily as a result of gains recognized on the sale/securitization of student loans, higher Affordable Housing revenue, and higher revenue related to structured transactions. Net securities losses increased $43.3 million compared to 2005 driven by $116.1 million of securities losses incurred in 2006 as a result of restructuring the securities portfolio. These losses were partially offset by gains realized on equity positions sold by the Company in 2006. Further discussion of the bond portfolio restructuring is provided in the Securities Available for Sale section of Managements Discussion and Analysis.

The increase was driven by a $191.1 million, or 7.5%, increase in total personnel expense. The increase was primarily due to merit 25 increases, contract programming, higher pension expense, and increased headcount, while revenue based incentive costs were relatively flat. Headcount increased 887 full time equivalent positions from December 31, 2005 to September 30, 2006, however, declined 694 positions from September 30, 2006 to December 31, 2006. This 2.0% decline in total headcount in the fourth quarter is an example of positive results from cost savings initiatives implemented in the second half of 2006. Net occupancy expense increased $22.1 million, or 7.1%, compared to 2005. The increase was driven by higher rent related to new offices and branches, as the Company continues to invest in the retail distribution network, higher leasehold improvements, and utility costs. Outside processing and software increased $36.2 million, or 10.1%, compared to 2005 due to higher processing costs associated with higher transaction volumes and higher software maintenance costs. Marketing and customer development expense increased $16.5 million, or 10.5%, primarily due to the Companys marketing campaigns focused on customer acquisition and deposit promotion. Amortization of intangible assets decreased $15.8 million, or 13.3%, compared to 2005 due to lower core deposit intangible amortization. Noninterest expense was further impacted by a $16.7 million, or 19.7%, increase in credit and collection services primarily due to higher loan closing costs from increased volumes. The Company incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of $11.7 million in 2006 as part of its capital restructuring initiative. Merger expense of $98.6 million was incurred in 2005 related to the NCF integration process. In January 2007, the Company announced an efficiency and productivity program that emphasizes an increased focus on sustainable efficiency and productivity improvements. The Company anticipates cost savings of $400 million by the end of 2009 through initiatives identified in corporate real estate, supplier management, off shoring, and process/organizational reviews. The $400 million of anticipated cost savings does not include the cost of incremental investments for these initiatives. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes includes both federal and state income taxes. In 2006, the provision was $869.0 million, compared to $879.2 million in 2005. The provision represents an effective tax rate of 29.1% for 2006 compared to 30.7% for 2005. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to an adjustment to the Companys state income tax liabilities based on the filing of its 2005 income tax returns and the resolution of certain tax positions.

The new methodology segregates the portfolio into 17 sub portfolios and incorporates a weighted average of expected loss derived from an internal risk rating system. Beginning in 2004 the allocation also includes the acquired portfolio of NCF. 2 In 2003 and prior periods, the allocation reflected an apportionment of the ALLL that had been categorized as environmental factors, which is now included in the Companys homeogeneous loan pool estimates. Loans Total loans as of December 31, 2006 were $121.5 billion, an increase of $6.9 billion, or 6.0%, from December 31, 2005. The growth rate was impacted by the sale from the portfolio of approximately $1.8 billion in residential real estate loans and the sale or securitization of $2.1 billion of consumer direct student loans in 2006. Residential mortgages increased $4.0 billion, or 13.2%, compared to December 31, 2005. This growth was due to continued demand for portfolio products. Additionally impacting loan growth was strong demand for construction lending resulting in a $2.8 billion, or 25.8%, increase in construction loans compared to December 31, 2005. The majority of the Companys construction portfolio is residential real estate related which typically requires minimum pre sales and equity from the borrower. The construction lending portfolio has minimal exposure to speculative condo investor activity. Commercial loans increased $0.8 billion, or 2.5%, from December 31, 2005, driven by increased corporate demand and growth in lease financing. 27 Loans held for sale, which predominantly consists of warehoused mortgage loans, were $11.8 billion, a decrease of $1.9 billion, or 13.9%, from December 31, 2005. The decrease was attributable to loan sales exceeding the origination of loans held for sale due in part to the interest rate and housing market environments in 2006. Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses SunTrust continuously monitors the quality of its loan portfolio and maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) sufficient to absorb probable losses inherent in its loan portfolio. The Company is committed to the early recognition of problem loans and to an appropriate and adequate level of allowance. At year end 2006, the Companys total allowance was $1.0 billion, which represented 0.86% of period end loans. In addition to the review of credit quality through ongoing credit review processes, the Company employs a variety of modeling and estimation tools for measuring credit risk that are used to construct an appropriate ALLL. The Companys allowance framework has three basic elements: a formula based component for pools of homogeneous loans; specific allowances for loans reviewed for individual impairment; and an unallocated component that is based on other inherent risk factors and imprecision associated with modeling and estimation processes. This framework enables the Company to better align loss estimation practices with the different types of credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio. The first element the general allowance for homogeneous loan pools is determined by applying allowance factors to pools of loans within the portfolio that have similar characteristics in terms of line of business and product type. The general allowance factors are determined using a baseline factor that is developed from an analysis of historical charge off experience and expected losses. Expected losses are based on estimated probabilities of default and losses given default derived from an internal risk rating process. These baseline factors are developed and applied to the various loan pools. Adjustments are made to the baseline factor for specific loan pools based on an assessment of internal and external influences on credit quality that are not fully reflected in the historical loss or risk rating data. These influences may include elements such as changes in credit underwriting or recent observable asset quality trends. Finally, the baseline factors are adjusted using a number of models which are intended to compensate for internal and external portfolio influences that may not be captured in the adjusted baseline factors. The Company continually evaluates its allowance methodology seeking to refine and enhance this process as appropriate, and it is likely that the methodology will evolve over time. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the general allowance calculations totaled $937.1 million and $929.3 million, respectively. The increase was due to loan growth and higher allowance factors associated with residential mortgage products, partially offset by lower allowance factors associated with Corporate Banking products. The second element of the ALLL analysis involves the estimation of allowances specific to individual impaired loans. In this process, specific allowances are established for nonaccruing commercial and residential loans greater than $2 million based on a thorough analysis of the most probable sources of repayment, including discounted future cash flows, liquidation of collateral, or the market value of the loan itself. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the specific allowance related to impaired loans totaled $17.4 million and $13.8 million, respectively. The third element of the allowance is the unallocated reserve that addresses inherent losses that are not otherwise evaluated in the first two elements. The qualitative factors of this third allowance element are subjective and require a high degree of management judgment. These factors include the inherent imprecision in mathematical models, recent economic uncertainty, losses incurred from recent events, and lagging or incomplete data. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the allowance estimated in the third element totaled $90.0 million and $85.0 million, respectively. 28 The Companys charge off policy meets or exceeds regulatory minimums. Losses on unsecured consumer loans are recognized at 90 days past due compared to the regulatory loss criteria of 120 days. Secured consumer loans, including residential real estate, are typically charged off between 120 and 180 days, depending on the collateral type, in compliance with FFIEC guidelines. Commercial loans and real estate loans are typically placed on non accrual when principal or interest is past due for 90 days or more unless the loan is both secured by collateral having realizable value sufficient to discharge the debt in full and the loan is in the legal process of collection. Accordingly, secured loans may be charged down to the estimated value of the collateral with previously accrued unpaid interest reversed. Subsequent charge offs may be required as a result of changes in the market value of collateral or other repayment prospects. The ratio of the allowance for loan and lease losses to total nonperforming loans decreased to 196.4% as of December 31, 2006 from 346.9% as of December 31, 2005. The decline in this ratio was due to a $235.5 million increase in nonperforming loans driven primarily by a $183.4 million increase in residential mortgage nonperforming loans. The increase in residential mortgage nonperforming loans was driven mainly by maturation of this portfolio, predominantly in well collateralized or insured conforming and alternative mortgage products that have an average loan to value below 80%. In addition to reserves held in the ALLL, the Company had $2.5 million and $3.6 million in other liabilities as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively that represents a reserve against certain unfunded commitments, including letters of credit. 29 TABLE 8 Summary of Loan and Lease Losses Experience Year Ended December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Balance beginning of period $1,028.1 $1,050.0 $941.9 $930.1 $867.1 $874.5 Allowance from acquisitionsand other activity net 173.8 9.3 15.5 (10.2 ) Provision for loan losses 262.5 176.9 135.5 313.6 469.8 275.2 Charge offs Commercial (183.5 ) (112.0 ) (114.6 ) (197.7 ) (297.0 ) (220.0 ) Real estate: Home equity lines (28.8 ) (24.5 ) (12.6 ) (5.8 ) (5.0 ) (2.8 ) Construction (2.3 ) (6.0 ) (4.1 ) (0.8 ) (0.8 ) (0.3 ) Residential mortgages (29.6 ) (22.8 ) (20.2 ) (16.3 ) (11.7 ) (8.0 ) Commercial real estate (8.1 ) (3.1 ) (5.5 ) (5.6 ) (17.8 ) (5.9 ) Consumer loans: Direct (22.0 ) (37.2 ) (25.1 ) (28.6 ) (28.4 ) (24.6 ) Indirect (82.3 ) (109.6 ) (133.9 ) (139.5 ) (129.4 ) (64.4 ) Total charge offs (356.6 ) (315.2 ) (316.0 ) (394.3 ) (490.1 ) (326.0 ) Recoveries Commercial 30.0 36.3 49.9 39.8 28.8 25.4 Real estate: Home equity lines 6.9 6.2 3.3 1.4 1.4 0.8 Construction 2.0 0.8 0.1 0.4 0.4 0.4 Residential mortgages 7.9 8.1 6.4 3.6 2.3 1.4 Commercial real estate 6.2 2.6 1.4 1.4 3.9 1.8 Consumer loans: Direct 12.1 13.5 10.0 8.5 8.8 8.3 Indirect 45.4 48.9 43.7 28.1 22.2 15.5 Total recoveries 110.5 116.4 114.8 83.2 67.8 53.6 Net charge offs (246.1 ) (198.8 ) (201.2 ) (311.1 ) (422.3 ) (272.4 ) Balance end of period $1,044.5 $1,028.1 $1,050.0 $941.9 $930.1 $867.1 Average loans $119,645.2 $108,742.0 $86,214.5 $76,137.9 $71,270.4 $70,023.0 Year end loans outstanding 121,454.3 114,554.9 101,426.2 80,732.3 73,167.9 68,959.2 Ratios: Allowance to year end loans 0.86 % 0.90 % 1.04 % 1.17 % 1.27 % 1.26 % Allowance to nonperforming loans 196.4 346.9 281.3 268.1 182.0 155.4 Net charge offs to average loans 0.21 0.18 0.23 0.41 0.59 0.39 Provision to average loans 0.22 0.16 0.16 0.41 0.66 0.39 Recoveries to total charge offs 31.0 36.9 36.3 21.1 13.8 16.4 30 TABLE 9 Nonperforming Assets and Accruing Loans Past Due 90 Days or More As of December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 Nonperforming Assets Nonaccrual loans Commercial $106.8 $70.9 $130.9 $165.9 $351.3 $377.6 Real estate Construction 38.6 24.4 32.8 4.4 10.0 4.0 Residential mortgages 286.7 103.3 104.5 85.4 82.5 79.9 Commercial Real Estate 55.4 44.6 36.7 48.6 38.0 62.8 Consumer loans 16.3 28.7 49.3 32.2 29.2 33.8 Total nonaccrual loans 503.8 271.9 354.2 336.5 511.0 558.1 Restructured loans 28.0 24.4 19.1 14.8 Total nonperforming loans 531.8 296.3 373.3 351.3 511.0 558.1 Other real estate owned (OREO) 55.4 30.7 28.6 16.5 18.0 20.7 Other repossessed assets 6.6 7.2 8.8 10.3 13.0 21.0 Total nonperforming assets $593.8 $334.2 $410.7 $378.1 $542.0 $599.8 Ratios Nonperforming loans to total loans 0.44 % 0.26 % 0.37 % 0.44 % 0.70 % 0.81 % Nonperforming assets to total loansplus OREO and other repossessed assets 0.49 0.29 0.40 0.47 0.74 0.87 Accruing Loans Past Due 90 Days or More $351.5 $371.5 $214.3 $196.4 $177.9 $185.5 Provision for Loan Losses The provision for loan losses is the result of a detailed analysis estimating an appropriate and adequate ALLL. The analysis includes the evaluation of impaired loans as prescribed under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) Nos. 114 Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan and 118 Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan Income Recognition and Disclosures, and pooled loans and leases as prescribed under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the provision for loan losses was $262.5 million, an increase of $85.6 million, or 48.4%, from 2005. The increase was due primarily to the recognition of a specific reserve for a large commercial loan placed on nonperforming status in the third quarter of 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2006, net charge offs were $246.1 million, an increase of $47.3 million, or 23.8%, from the $198.8 million of net charge offs recorded in 2005. Net charge offs as a percentage of total loans was 0.21% for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of three basis points compared to 2005. The increase in net charge offs was due to the charge off of a large commercial loan placed on nonperforming status in the third quarter of 2006. The provision for loan losses was $16.4 million greater than net charge offs for 2006, resulting in a corresponding increase in ALLL. The increase was due to loan growth. Nonperforming Assets Nonperforming assets, which consist of nonaccrual loans, restructured loans, other real estate owned (OREO) and other repossessed assets totaled $593.8 million as of December 31, 2006, an increase of $259.6 million, or 77.7%, compared to December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily due to higher residential mortgage and commercial nonperforming loans. Nonperforming residential mortgages increased $183.4 million, or 177.5%, driven mainly by the maturation of this portfolio, predominantly in well collateralized or insured conforming and alternative mortgage products that have an average loan to value below 80%. Commercial nonperforming loans increased $35.9 million, or 50.6%, primarily due to approximately $31 million remaining in nonperforming loans related to financing the purchase of the assets of the borrower associated with the previously disclosed large commercial loan. See pages 17 and 18 for additional details regarding this loan. 31 When a loan is placed on nonaccrual, unpaid interest is reversed against interest income. Interest income on nonaccrual loans, if recognized, is either recorded using the cash basis method of accounting or recognized at the end of the loan after the principal has been reduced to zero, depending on the type of loan. If and when a nonaccrual loan is returned to accruing status, the accrued interest at the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status, and foregone interest during the nonaccrual period, are recorded as interest income only after all principal has been collected for commercial loans. For consumer loans and residential mortgage loans, the accrued interest at the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status, and foregone interest during the nonaccrual period, are recorded as interest income as of the date the loan no longer meets the 90 and 120 days past due criteria, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 cash basis interest income for nonaccrual loans amounted to $16.6 million and $13.2 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, estimated interest income of $41.6 million and $28.3 million, respectively, would have been recorded if all such loans had been accruing interest according to their original contractual terms. Accruing loans past due ninety days or more decreased $20.0 million from December 31, 2005 to $351.5 million as of December 31, 2006. The decrease was primarily driven by sales of delinquent but accruing student loans in 2006.

Securities Available for Sale The investment portfolio is managed as part of the overall asset and liability management process to optimize income and market performance over an entire interest rate cycle while mitigating risk. The Company managed the portfolio in 2006 with the goal of continuing to improve yield while reducing the size to partially fund loan growth and reduce the Companys use of wholesale funding. Consistent with this goal, the Company restructured a portion of the investment portfolio during the latter half of 2006. 32 As part of the restructuring, the Company sold $4.4 billion of shorter term securities across several categories, namely mortgage backed and agency securities, with a 3.62% yield and reinvested approximately $2.4 billion in longer term securities with a 5.55% yield. In addition to reinvesting in these securities, $1.5 billion of receive fixed interest rate swaps on commercial loans were executed at 5.50% to extend the duration of the balance sheet and improve the earning asset yield. Securities losses of $116.1 million were realized in conjunction with the restructuring. These losses represented approximately 2.6% of the securities sold. The underlying securities began gradually incurring unrealized losses approximately two years ago in connection with the increase in interest rates. The Companys analysis indicated that the combination of these steps were sufficient to achieve its current asset liability management objectives. The Company continues to monitor economic and Company specific performance in order to determine if incremental balance sheet management tactics are appropriate. The average yield for 2006 improved to 4.93% compared to 4.50% for 2005. The average yield continued to improve to 5.12% for the fourth quarter of 2006. The Company lengthened the estimated average life of the portfolio from 3.3 years at December 31, 2005 to 4.2 years at December 31, 2006. Likewise, the portfolios average duration increased from 2.8 as of December 31, 2005 to 3.5 as of December 31, 2006. Duration is a measure of the estimated price sensitivity of a bond portfolio to an immediate change in interest rates. A duration of 3.5 suggests an expected price change of 3.5% for a one percent change in interest rates, without considering any embedded call or prepayment options. The size of the securities portfolio decreased $1.4 billion to $25.1 billion, or 13.8%, of total assets at December 31, 2006, down from $26.5 billion or 14.8% of total assets at December 31, 2005. Net securities losses of $50.5 million were realized during 2006, primarily due to the repositioning of the securities portfolio, but were partially offset by gains realized on equity positions sold by the Company in 2006. Net securities losses realized for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $7.2 million compared to net losses of $41.7 million realized for the year ended December 31, 2004. The current mix of securities as of December 31, 2006 is shown in Table 10. The carrying value of the investment portfolio, all of which is classified as securities available for sale, reflected $2.1 billion in net unrealized gains at December 31, 2006, including a $2.3 billion unrealized gain on the Companys investment in common stock of The Coca Cola Company. The net unrealized gain of this common stock investment increased $379.2 million, while the net unrealized loss on the remainder of the portfolio of $221.4 million, or 1.0% of amortized cost, improved $152.1 million compared to December 31, 2005. These changes in market value did not affect the net income of SunTrust, but were included in other comprehensive income. The Company reviews all of its securities with unrealized losses for impairment at least quarterly. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has the ability and intent to hold the remaining securities with unrealized losses to recovery. 33 Deposits TABLE 11 Composition of Average Deposits Year Ended December 31 Percent of Total (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Noninterest bearing $23,312.3 $24,315.0 $21,047.1 18.9 % 22.0 % 24.2 % NOW accounts 17,214.4 17,213.7 13,777.5 13.9 15.6 15.8 Money market accounts 24,507.9 25,589.2 22,864.7 19.8 23.2 26.2 Savings 5,371.1 6,320.0 7,225.4 4.3 5.7 8.3 Consumer time 15,622.7 12,526.4 8,333.5 12.7 11.4 9.6 Other time 11,146.9 7,390.7 3,843.3 9.0 6.7 4.4 Total consumer and commercial deposits 97,175.3 93,355.0 77,091.5 78.6 84.6 88.5 Brokered deposits 17,425.7 10,182.2 4,273.5 14.1 9.2 4.9 Foreign deposits 9,064.5 6,869.3 5,767.9 7.3 6.2 6.6 Total deposits $123,665.5 $110,406.5 $87,132.9 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Average consumer and commercial deposits were $97.2 billion, an increase of $3.8 billion, or 4.1%, compared to 2005. The growth was exclusively in higher cost consumer time and other time deposits. Specifically, consumer time and other time deposits increased $6.9 billion, or 34.4%, and were offset by declines in money market, savings, and noninterest bearing DDA account balances. Money market accounts declined $1.1 billion, or 4.2%, savings accounts declined $0.9 billion, or 15.0%, and noninterest bearing DDA account balances declined $1.0 billion, or 4.1%. The decline in these products was the result of deposit migration to higher cost time deposits as well as customers moving balances to alternative investments such as repurchase agreements or money market mutual funds to take advantage of higher interest rates. Average brokered and foreign deposits were $26.5 billion, an increase of $9.4 billion, or 55.4%, compared to 2005. The increase was due to the Companys reliance on these wholesale funding sources to fund earning asset growth not supported by consumer and commercial deposit growth. Earning asset growth funded by higher cost wholesale borrowing have narrower spreads resulting in lower net interest income than incremental earning asset growth supported by consumer and commercial deposits. Consumer and commercial deposit growth is a key initiative for the Company, as it focuses on deposit gathering opportunities across all lines business throughout the geographic footprint. The Company has already instituted a number of initiatives to attract deposits. These initiatives include the modification of incentive plans to place greater emphasis on deposit and package account sales, enhancing online banking products and partnering with other well known brands in deposit oriented promotions. As of the end of 2006 these initiatives had not yielded meaningful results. CAPITAL RESOURCES The Companys primary regulator, the Federal Reserve, measures capital adequacy within a framework that makes capital requirements sensitive to the risk profiles of individual banking companies. The guidelines weigh assets and off balance sheet risk exposures (risk weighted assets) according to predefined classifications, creating a base from which to compare capital levels. Tier 1 Capital primarily includes realized equity and qualified preferred instruments, less purchase accounting intangibles such as goodwill and core deposit intangibles. Total Capital consists of Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital, which includes qualifying portions of subordinated debt, allowance for loan losses up to a maximum of 1.25% of risk weighted assets, and 45% of the unrealized gain on equity securities. The Company and SunTrust Bank (the Bank) are subject to a minimum Tier 1 Risk Based Capital and Total Capital ratios of 4% and 8%, respectively, of risk weighted assets. To be considered well capitalized, ratios of 6% and 10%, respectively, are needed. Additionally, the Company and the Bank 34 are subject to Tier 1 Leverage ratio requirements, which measures Tier 1 Capital against average assets. The minimum and well capitalized ratios are 3% and 5%, respectively. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had Tier 1, Total Capital, and Tier 1 Leverage ratios of 7.72%, 11.11%, and 7.23%, respectively. This compares to ratios as of December 31, 2005 of 7.01%, 10.57%, and 6.65%, respectively. SunTrust is committed to remaining well capitalized. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 158 Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements, No. 87, 88, 106, and 132 (R). The adoption of this standard resulted in a reduction of total equity of $385.0 million. On December 14, 2006, the federal bank and thrift regulatory agencies announced an interim decision that the adoption of SFAS 158 would not impact banking organizations regulatory capital. See Note 16, Employee Benefits to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. In connection with planned capital restructurings, the Company replaced higher cost capital with $500 million of Series A perpetual preferred stock, $500 million of preferred purchase securities and $1 billion of enhanced trust preferred securities. The perpetual preferred stock has no stated maturity and will not be subject to any sinking fund or other obligation of the Company. See Note 14, Capital to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the perpetual preferred stock. In conjunction with the issuance of the preferred purchase securities, $500 million of 5.588% junior subordinated debentures with a 36 year initial maturity were issued. The junior subordinated debt will be remarketed after five years and the Company can defer interest on the debentures for up to seven years. Also, the Company entered into a forward purchase contract which provides for the issuance of $500 million of preferred stock following the successful remarketing of the junior subordinated debt, but in any case no later than December 15, 2012. The preferred stock will be callable immediately after issuance at the option of the Company. In conjunction with the issuance of the enhanced trust preferred securities, $1 billion of 6.10% junior subordinated debentures were issued that initially mature in 2036. The proceeds from the Series A perpetual preferred stock and preferred purchase securities totaling approximately $1 billion, were used to repurchase $1 billion in outstanding Common Stock of the Company, with $870.7 million repurchased through an accelerated share repurchase initiated in October of 2006. In the fourth quarter of 2006 the Company also exercised its right to call $1 billion of higher cost trust preferred securities and issued the aforementioned $1 billion of lower cost, more efficient enhanced trust preferred securities, lowering the Companys overall cost of capital. In connection with the issuances of the Series A Preferred Stock of SunTrust Banks, Inc., the Fixed to Floating Rate Normal Preferred Purchase Securities of SunTrust Preferred Capital I, and the 6.10% Enhanced Trust Preferred Securities of SunTrust Capital VIII (collectively, the Issued Securities), SunTrust entered into Replacement Capital Covenants (RCCs). The RCCs limit SunTrusts ability to repay, redeem or repurchase the Issued Securities (or certain related securities). Each Replacement Capital Covenant was executed by SunTrust in favor of the holders of certain debt securities, which are initially the holders of SunTrusts 6% Subordinated Notes due 2026 (CUSIP No. 867914AH6). The Replacement Capital Covenants are more fully described in Current Reports on Form 8 K filed on September 12, 2006, November 6, 2006 and December 6, 2006. SunTrust manages capital through dividends and share repurchases authorized by the Companys Board of Directors (the Board). Management assesses capital needs based on expected growth and the current economic climate. In 2006, the Company repurchased 3,175,000 shares for $234.4 million under a Board authorization program compared to 2,775,000 shares for $196.4 million repurchased in 2005. As of December 31, 2006, the Company was authorized to purchase up to an additional 8,360,000 shares under publicly announced plans or programs. This authorization does not include a maximum of 35 $1 billion or 13,333,334 shares authorized by the Board in August of 2006. Under the August authorization, the Company entered into an Accelerated Share Repurchase agreement and has already repurchased 9,926,589 shares for $870.7 million, net of settlement costs. The Company could receive additional shares under the agreement, dependent upon the volume weighted average price per share of SunTrust common stock over a period concluding in March of 2007, subject to a maximum of 2,647,093 shares. The Company chose the Accelerated Share Repurchase agreement rather than repurchase shares under its existing program because an open market repurchase would have taken considerably longer subjecting the Company to potentially higher repurchase prices. Additionally, the Accelerated Share Repurchase agreement provided market visibility of the Companys intent to reduce its share base. The Company declared and paid common dividends totaling $879.6 million in 2006, or $2.44 per common share, on net income available to common shareholders of $2,109.7 million. The dividend payout ratio was 41.7% for 2006 versus 40.0% for 2005.

ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT In the normal course of business, SunTrust is exposed to various risks. To manage the major risks that are inherent to the Company and to provide reasonable assurance that key business objectives will be achieved, the Company has established an enterprise risk governance process and formed the SunTrust Enterprise Risk Program (SERP). Moreover, the Company has policies and various risk management processes designed to effectively identify, monitor and manage risk. Management continually refines and enhances its risk management policies, processes and procedures to maintain effective risk management and governance, including identification, measurement, monitoring, control, mitigation and reporting of all material risks. Over the last few years, the Company has enhanced risk measurement applications and systems capabilities that provide management information on whether the Company is being appropriately compensated for the risk profile it has adopted. The Company balances its strategic goals, including revenue and profitability objectives, with the risks associated with achieving its goals. Effective risk management is an important element supporting business decision making at SunTrust. Enterprise Risk Managements focus is on synthesizing, assessing, reporting and mitigating the full set of risks at the enterprise level, providing senior management with a holistic picture of the organizations risk profile. The Company implemented an enterprise risk management framework that will improve the Companys ability to manage its aggregate risk profile. At the core of the framework are SunTrusts risk vision and mission. Risk Vision: To deliver sophisticated risk management capabilities consistent with those of top tier financial institutions that support the needs of the business, enable risk enlightened management and the optimal allocation of capital. 36 Risk Mission: To promote a strong risk management culture which facilitates accountability, risk informed decisions consistent with the banks strategic objectives and the creation of shareholder value. The Companys Chief Risk Officer (CRO) reports to the Chief Executive Officer and is responsible for the oversight of the risk management organization as well as risk governance processes. The CRO provides overall leadership, vision and direction for the Companys enterprise risk management framework. In addition to the centralized Enterprise Risk Management function, each line of business and corporate function has its own Risk Manager and support staff. These Risk Managers, while reporting directly to their respective line of business or function, facilitate communications with the Companys risk functions and execute the requirements of the enterprise risk management framework and policies. Enterprise Risk Management works in partnership with the Risk Managers to ensure alignment with sound risk management practices as well as industry best practices. Organizationally, the Company measures and manages risk according to three main risk categories: credit risk, market risk (including liquidity risk) and operational risk (including compliance risk). The Chief Credit Officer manages the Companys credit risk program. The Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer manage the Companys market risk program. The Chief Operational Risk Officer manages the Companys operational risk program. These three areas of risk are managed on a consolidated basis under the Companys enterprise risk management framework, which also takes into consideration legal and reputational risk factors. In 2006, SunTrust continued to make significant enhancements to its enterprise risk management function. The Model Validation and Enterprise Risk Measurement groups continued to provide reasonable assurance that risks inherent in model development and usage are properly identified and managed, and they continued to oversee the calculation of economic capital respectively. Risk identification, assessment and mitigation planning were formally incorporated into the strategic planning process. SERP continued to ensure that the approach and plans for risk management are aligned to the vision and mission of Enterprise Risk Management and manage regulatory compliance. In addition, SERPs goal is to ensure the Companys future compliance with the Basel II Capital Accord. Key objectives of SERP include incorporating risk management principles that encompass Company values and standards and are designed to guide risk taking activity, maximizing performance through the balance of risk and reward and leveraging initiatives driven by regulatory requirements to deliver capabilities to better measure and manage risk. As part of its risk governance framework, the Company has also established various risk management related committees. These committees are jointly responsible for ensuring adequate risk measurement and management in their respective areas of authority. These committees include: Asset/Liability Management Committee (ALCO), Corporate Product Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC), Credit Management Committee and SERP Steering Committee. Additionally, the Company has established an Enterprise Risk Committee (ERC), chaired by the CRO, which is responsible for supporting the CRO in measuring and managing the Companys aggregate risk profile. The ERC consists of various senior executives throughout the Company and meets on a monthly basis. The Board of Directors is wholly responsible for oversight of the Companys corporate risk governance process. The Risk Committee of the Board, which was formed in 2005, assists the Board of Directors in executing this responsibility. 37 Credit Risk Management Credit risk refers to the potential for economic loss arising from the failure of SunTrust clients to meet their contractual agreements on all credit instruments, including on balance sheet exposures from loans and leases, contingent exposures from unfunded commitments, letters of credit, credit derivatives, and counterparty risk under interest rate and foreign exchange derivative products. As credit risk is an essential component of many of the products and services provided by the Company to its clients, the ability to accurately measure and manage credit risk is integral to maintain both the long run profitability of its lines of business and capital adequacy of the enterprise. SunTrust manages and monitors extensions of credit risk through initial underwriting processes and periodic reviews. SunTrust maintains underwriting standards in accordance with credit policies and procedures, and Credit Risk Management conducts independent risk reviews to ensure active compliance with all policies and procedures. Credit Risk Management periodically reviews its lines of business to monitor asset quality trends and the appropriateness of credit policies. In particular, total borrower exposure limits are established and concentration risk is monitored. SunTrust has made a major commitment to maintain and enhance comprehensive credit systems in order to be compliant with business requirements and evolving regulatory standards. As part of a continuous improvement process, SunTrust Credit Risk Management evaluates potential enhancements to its risk measurement and management tools, implementing them as appropriate along with amended credit policies and procedures. Borrower/counterparty (obligor) risk and facility risk are evaluated using the Companys risk rating methodology, which has been implemented in the lines of business representing the largest total credit exposures. SunTrust uses various risk models in the estimation of expected and unexpected losses. These models incorporate both internal and external default and loss experience. To the extent possible, the Company collects internal data to ensure the validity, reliability, and accuracy of its risk models used in default and loss estimation. Operational Risk Management SunTrust faces ongoing and emerging risk and regulatory pressure related to the activities that surround the delivery of banking and financial products. Coupled with external influences such as market conditions, fraudulent activities, disasters, security risks, country exposure, and legal risk, the potential for operational and reputational loss has increased significantly. SunTrust believes that effective management of operational risk defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events plays a major role in both the level and the stability of the profitability of the institution. SunTrust established an Operational Risk Management function in 2005 to provide leadership, expertise, and direction to each line of business and functional area in the development and maintenance of an effective, comprehensive program for the management of operational risk. These efforts support SunTrusts goals to achieve performance targets, prevent loss of resources, and meet regulatory requirements for operational risk management. Operational Risk Management implements and monitors a framework to organizationally identify, assess, control, quantify, monitor, and report on operational risks companywide. The goals of this framework are to conduct effective operational risk techniques and strategies, minimize operational losses through enhanced collection and reporting of loss event data, and strengthen SunTrusts performance by optimizing operational capital allocation. 38 Market Risk Management Market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and other relevant market rates or prices. Interest rate risk, defined as the exposure of net interest income and Economic Value of Equity (EVE) to adverse movements in interest rates, is SunTrusts primary market risk, and mainly arises from the structure of the balance sheet (non trading activities). SunTrust is also exposed to market risk in its trading activities, mortgage servicing rights, mortgage warehouse and pipeline, and equity holdings of The Coca Cola Company common stock. The Asset/Liability Management Committee meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of the Company and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk. The policies established by ALCO are reviewed and approved by the Companys Board of Directors. Market Risk from Non Trading Activities The primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk, both within policy limits approved by ALCO and the Board and within narrower guidelines established by ALCO. These limits and guidelines reflect SunTrusts tolerance for interest rate risk over both short term and long term horizons. The major sources of the Companys non trading interest rate risk are timing differences in the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities, growth rates of interest bearing assets and liabilities, changes in relationships between rate indices (basis risk), changes in the shape of the yield curve, and the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options. SunTrust measures these risks and their impact by identifying and quantifying exposures through use of sophisticated simulation and valuation models, as well as a repricing gap analysis. One of the primary methods that SunTrust uses to quantify and manage interest rate risk is simulation analysis, which is used to model net interest income from assets, liabilities, and derivative positions over a specified time period under various interest rate scenarios and balance sheet structures. This analysis measures the sensitivity of net interest income over a relatively short time horizon (two years). Key assumptions in the simulation analysis (and in the valuation analysis discussed below) relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads, the changes in product balances and the behavior of loan and deposit customers in different rate environments. Material assumptions include the repricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of indeterminate, or non contractual, deposits. As the future path of interest rates cannot be known in advance, management uses simulation analysis to project net interest income under various interest rate scenarios including implied forwards and more extreme scenarios. The analyses may include rapid and gradual ramping of interest rates, rate shocks, spread narrowing and widening, and yield curve twists. Usually, each analysis incorporates what management believes to be the most appropriate assumptions about customer behavior in an interest rate scenario, but in some analyses, assumptions are deliberately changed to test the Companys exposure to a specified event or set of events. Specific strategies are also analyzed to determine their impact on net interest income levels and sensitivities. 39 The following table reflects the estimated sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates. The sensitivity is measured as a percentage change in net interest income due to gradual changes in interest rates (25 basis points per quarter) compared to forecasted net interest income under stable rates for the next twelve months. Estimated changes set forth below are dependent on material assumptions such as those previously discussed. Rate Change (Basis Points) Estimated % Change inNet Interest Income Over 12 Months December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 +100 (0.4%) (0.1%) 100 0.9% 0.7% As indicated, a gradual decrease in interest rates would increase net interest income. A gradual increase would tend to reduce net interest income, but by an amount that is within the policy limits. Thus, the Companys interest rate sensitivity position is slightly liability sensitive. While simulations of more rapid changes in interest rates indicate more significant fluctuations in net interest income, the Company is still within the policy limits. SunTrust also performs valuation analysis, which is used for discerning levels of risk present in the balance sheet and derivative positions that might not be taken into account in the net interest income simulation analysis. Whereas net interest income simulation highlights exposures over a relatively short time horizon, valuation analysis incorporates all cash flows over the estimated remaining life of all balance sheet and derivative positions. The valuation of the balance sheet, at a point in time, is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows and derivative cash flows minus the discounted value of liability cash flows, the net of which is referred to as EVE. The sensitivity of EVE to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of the longer term repricing risk and options risk embedded in the balance sheet. In contrast to the net interest income simulation, which assumes interest rates will change over a period of time (ramp), EVE uses instantaneous changes in rates (shock). EVE values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the growth assumptions that are used in the net interest income simulation model. As with the net interest income simulation model, assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are critical in the EVE analysis. Particularly important are the assumptions driving prepayments and the expected changes in balances and pricing of the indeterminate deposit portfolios. Rate Shock (Basis Points) Estimated % Change in EVE December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 +100 (5.5%) (5.9%) 100 3.6% 3.2% While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under an extremely adverse scenario, management believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current fiscal year). Further, EVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. The net interest income simulation and valuation analyses (EVE) do not necessarily include certain actions that management may undertake to manage this risk in response to anticipated changes in interest rates. 40 Trading Activities Most of the Companys trading activities are designed to support secondary trading with customers. Product offerings to customers include debt securities, including loans traded in the secondary market, equity securities, derivatives and foreign exchange contracts, and similar financial instruments. Other trading activities include participating in underwritings, and acting as a market maker in certain equity securities. Typically, the Company maintains a securities inventory to facilitate customer transactions. However, in certain businesses, such as derivatives, it is more common to execute customer transactions with simultaneous risk managing transactions with dealers. Also in the normal course of business, the Company assumes a degree of market risk in arbitrage, hedging, and other strategies, subject to specified limits. The Company has developed policies and procedures to manage market risk associated with trading, capital markets and foreign exchange activities using a value at risk (VaR) approach that combines interest rate risk, equity risk, foreign exchange risk, spread risk and volatility risk. For trading portfolios, VaR measures the maximum fair value the Company could lose on a trading position, given a specified confidence level and time horizon. VaR limits and exposures are monitored daily for each significant trading portfolio. The Companys VaR calculation measures the potential losses in fair value using a 99% confidence level. This equates to 2.33 standard deviations from the mean under a normal distribution. This means that, on average, daily profits and losses are expected to exceed VaR one out of every 100 overnight trading days. The VaR methodology includes holding periods for each position based upon an assessment of relative trading market liquidity. For the foreign exchange, equities, structured trades and derivatives desks, the Company estimates VaR by applying the Monte Carlo simulation platform as designed by RiskMetrics, and for the estimate of the fixed income VaR, the Company uses Bloomberg analytics. For equity derivatives, the Imagine system is used for VaR. The Company uses an internally developed methodology to estimate VaR for the collateralized debt obligations and loan trading desks. The estimated average combined Undiversified VaR (Undiversified VaR represents a simple summation of the VaR calculated across each Desk) was $4.8 million for 2006 and $4.1 million for 2005. Trading assets net of trading liabilities averaged $1.5 billion for 2006 and $1.4 billion for 2005. The estimated combined period end Undiversified VaR was $3.5 million at December 31, 2006 and $4.4 million at December 31, 2005. Trading assets net of trading liabilities were $1.1 billion at December 31, 2006 and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2005. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk of being unable to meet obligations as they come due at a reasonable funding cost. SunTrust manages this risk by structuring its balance sheet prudently and by maintaining borrowing resources to fund potential cash needs. The Company assesses liquidity needs in the form of increases in assets, maturing obligations, or deposit withdrawals, considering both operations in the normal course of business and in times of unusual events. In addition, the Company considers the off balance sheet arrangements and commitments it has entered into, which could also affect the Companys liquidity position. The ALCO of the Company measures this risk, sets policies, and reviews adherence to those policies. The Companys sources of funds include a large, stable deposit base, secured advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and access to the capital markets. The Company structures its balance sheet so that illiquid assets, such as loans, are funded through customer deposits, long term debt, other liabilities and capital. Customer based core deposits, the Companys largest and most cost effective source of funding, accounted for 62.6% of the funding base on average for 2006 compared to 64.3% for 41 2005. The decrease in this ratio was due primarily to loan growth funded with wholesale borrowings. Average customer based core deposits increased $3.8 billion, or 4.1%, compared to 2005. The growth was exclusively in higher cost certificates of deposit. Increases in rates, improved economic activity and confidence in the financial markets may lead to disintermediation of deposits, which may need to be replaced with higher cost borrowings in the future. Total wholesale funding, including net short term unsecured borrowings, net secured wholesale borrowings and long term debt, totaled $56.1 billion at December 31, 2006 compared to $56.3 billion at December 31, 2005. The decrease reflects the maturities of long term debt funding the balance sheet throughout the year. Net short term unsecured borrowings, including wholesale domestic and foreign deposits and fed funds, totaled $30.8 billion at December 31, 2006 compared to $29.9 billion at December 31, 2005. Growth in the loan portfolio exceeded the growth in retail deposits, and the shortfall has been funded using short term unsecured borrowings. Outstanding loans were $121.5 billion and $114.6 billion at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively. The Company maintains access to a diversified base of wholesale funding sources. These non committed sources include fed funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, negotiable certificates of deposit, offshore deposits, FHLB advances, Global Bank Note issuance and commercial paper issuance. As of December 31, 2006, SunTrust Bank had $14.4 billion remaining under its Global Bank Note program. The Global Bank Note program was established to expand funding and capital sources to include both domestic and international investors. In December 2006, SunTrust issued 1 billion of global debt in an effort to diversify its investor base. The floating rate debt was issued at 3 month EURIBOR + 11 basis points and has a maturity of five years. In conjunction with the debt issuance, SunTrust entered into a 1 billion cross currency swap transaction in order to hedge currency fluctuation. Liquidity is also available through unpledged securities in the investment portfolio and capacity to securitize loans, including single family mortgage loans. The Companys credit ratings are important to its access to unsecured wholesale borrowings. Significant changes in these ratings could change the cost and availability of these sources. The Company manages reliance on short term unsecured borrowings as well as total wholesale funding through policies established and reviewed by ALCO. The Company has a contingency funding plan that stresses the liquidity needs that may arise from certain events such as agency rating downgrades, rapid loan growth, or significant deposit runoff. The plan also provides for continual monitoring of net borrowed funds dependence and available sources of liquidity. Management believes the Company has the funding capacity to meet the liquidity needs arising from potential events. Liquidity for SunTrust Banks, Inc. Parent Company only (Parent Company) is measured comparing sources of liquidity in unpledged securities and short term investments relative to its short term debt. As of December 31, 2006, the Parent Company had $2.0 billion in such sources compared to short term debt of $1.4 billion. The Georgia Department of Banking and Finance limits dividends to 50% of prior years net income, without its prior approval. SunTrust Bank (the Bank) has exceeded this limitation since 2000 and has received the necessary approvals for dividends beyond this amount. Additionally, the Bank is limited under Federal regulations based on prior two years net retained earnings plus the current years net retained earnings. During 2007, the subsidiary bank can pay $1.8 billion, plus the current years earnings without prior approval from the appropriate regulatory agency. As detailed in Table 14, the Company had $104.7 billion in unused lines of credit at December 31, 2006 that were not recorded on the Companys balance sheet. Commitments to extend credit are arrangements 42 to lend to a customer who has complied with predetermined contractual obligations. The Company also had $13.0 billion in letters of credit as of December 31, 2006, most of which are standby letters of credit that provide that SunTrust Bank fund if certain future events occur. Of this, approximately $6.3 billion support variable rate demand obligations (VRDOs) remarketed by SunTrust and other agents. VRDOs are municipal securities which are remarketed by the agent on a regular basis, usually weekly. In the event that the securities are unable to be remarketed, SunTrust Bank would fund under the letters of credit. Certain provisions of long term debt agreements and the lines of credit prevent the Company from creating liens on, disposing of, or issuing (except to related parties) voting stock of subsidiaries. Further, there are restrictions on mergers, consolidations, certain leases, sales or transfers of assets, and minimum shareholders equity ratios. As of December 31, 2006, the Company was in compliance with all covenants and provisions of these debt agreements. Table 13 Risk Management Derivative Financial Instruments The Company monitors its sensitivity to changes in interest rates and may use derivative instruments to limit the volatility of net interest income. Derivative instruments decreased net interest income in 2006 $105.6 million and increased net interest income in 2005 $104.4 million. The following tables summarize the derivative instruments entered into by the Company as an end user. See Note 17, Variable Interest Entities, Derivatives and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete description of the derivative instruments and activities for 2006 and 2005.

Other Market Risk Other sources of market risk include the risk associated with holding residential mortgage loans prior to selling them into the secondary mortgage market, commitments to customers to make mortgage loans that will be sold to the secondary mortgage market, and the Companys investment in MSRs. The Company manages the risks associated with the residential mortgage loans classified as held for sale (the warehouse) and its interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) on residential loans intended for sale. The warehouse and IRLCs consist primarily of fixed and adjustable rate single family residential real estate loans. The risk associated with the warehouse and IRLCs is the potential change in interest rates between the time the customer locks in the rate on the anticipated loan and the time the loan is sold on the secondary mortgage market, which is typically 90 150 days. The Company manages interest rate risk predominately with forward sale agreements, where the changes in value of the forward sale agreements substantially offset the changes in value of the warehouse and the IRLCs. Interest rate risk on the warehouse is managed via forward sale agreements in a designated fair value hedging relationship, under SFAS No. 133. IRLCs on residential mortgage loans intended for sale are classified as free standing derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 149 and are not designated as SFAS No. 133 hedge accounting relationships. The value of the MSRs asset is primarily dependent upon the assumed prepayment speed of the mortgage servicing portfolio. MSRs are the discounted present value of future net cash flows that are expected to be received from the mortgage servicing portfolio. Future expected net cash flows from servicing a loan in the mortgage servicing portfolio would not be realized if the loan pays off earlier than anticipated. Accordingly, prepayment risk subjects the MSRs to impairment risk. The Company does not specifically hedge the MSRs asset for the potential impairment risk; however, it does employ a balanced business strategy using the natural counter cyclicality of servicing and production to mitigate impairment risk. The fair value determination, key economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the current fair value of the MSRs as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 is discussed in greater detail in Note 11, Securitization Activity/Mortgage Servicing Rights to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 46 The Company is also subject to risk from changes in equity prices that arise from owning The Coca Cola Company common stock. SunTrust owns 48.2 million shares of common stock of The Coca Cola Company, which had a carrying value of $2.3 billion at December 31, 2006. A 10% decrease in share price of The Coca Cola Company common stock at December 31, 2006 would result in a decrease, net of deferred taxes, of approximately $144 million in accumulated other comprehensive income. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS In the normal course of business, the Company engages in financial transactions that, in accordance with US GAAP, are either not recorded on the Companys balance sheet or may be recorded on the Companys balance sheet at an amount that differs from the full contract or notional amount of the transaction. These transactions are structured to meet the financial needs of clients, manage the Companys credit, market or liquidity risks, diversify funding sources, or optimize capital. As a financial services provider, the Company routinely enters into commitments to extend credit, including, but not limited to, loan commitments, financial and performance standby letters of credit and financial guarantees. While these contractual obligations could potentially result in material current or future effects on financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital resources, or significant components of revenues or expenses, based on historical experience, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval processes accorded to loans made by the Company. See Table 14, Unfunded Lending Commitments, for details on unfunded lending commitments. The Company has undertaken certain guarantee obligations in the ordinary course of business. In following the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, (FIN 45) the Company must consider guarantees that have any of the following four characteristics (i) contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to a guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying factor that is related to an asset, a liability, or an equity security of the guaranteed party; (ii) contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to a guaranteed party based on another entitys failure to perform under an obligating agreement; (iii) indemnification agreements that contingently require the indemnifying party to make payments to an indemnified party based on changes in an underlying factor that is related to an asset, a liability, or an equity security of the indemnified party; and (iv) indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others. The issuance of these guarantees imposes an obligation to stand ready to perform, and should certain triggering events occur, it also imposes an obligation for the Company to make future payments. Note 18, Guarantees, to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes details regarding the Companys guarantee obligations under FIN 45. In the normal course of business, the Company utilizes various derivative and credit related financial instruments to meet the needs of clients and to manage the Companys exposure to interest rate and other market risks. These financial instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and market risk in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet in accordance with US GAAP. SunTrust manages the credit risk of its derivatives by (i) limiting the total amount of arrangements outstanding by an individual counterparty; (ii) monitoring the size and maturity structure of the portfolio; (iii) obtaining collateral based on managements credit assessment of the counterparty; (iv) applying uniform credit standards maintained for all activities with credit risk; and (v) entering into transactions with high quality counterparties that are periodically reviewed by the Companys Credit Management Committee. The Company manages the market risk of its derivatives by establishing and monitoring limits on the types and degree of risk that may be undertaken. The Company continually measures market risk by using a value at risk methodology. Note 17, Variable Interest Entities, Derivatives, and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes 47 additional information regarding derivative financial instruments, and Table 13, Risk Management Derivative Financial Instruments, provides further details with respect to SunTrusts derivative positions. SunTrust assists in providing liquidity to select corporate clients by directing them to a multi seller commercial paper conduit, Three Pillars Funding LLC (Three Pillars). Three Pillars provides financing for direct purchases of financial assets originated and serviced by SunTrusts corporate clients. Three Pillars finances this activity by issuing A 1/P 1 rated commercial paper. The result is a favorable funding arrangement for these clients. Three Pillars has issued a subordinated note to a third party. The holder of this note absorbs the majority of Three Pillars expected losses. The subordinated note investor, therefore, is Three Pillars primary beneficiary, and thus the Company is not required to consolidate Three Pillars. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, Three Pillars had assets not included on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets of approximately $5.4 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively, consisting of primarily secured loans and marketable asset backed securities. Activities related to the Three Pillars relationship generated net fee revenue for the Company of approximately $31.0 million, $25.2 million, and $24.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. These activities include: client referrals and investment recommendations to Three Pillars, the issuing of letters of credit, which provides partial credit protection to the commercial paper holders, and providing a majority of the temporary liquidity arrangements that would provide funding to Three Pillars in the event it can no longer issue commercial paper or in certain other circumstances. As of December 31, 2006, off balance sheet liquidity commitments and other credit enhancements made by the Company to Three Pillars, which represent the Companys maximum exposure to potential loss, totaled $8.0 billion and $697.8 million, respectively, compared to $7.2 billion and $707.1 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2005. The Company manages the credit risk associated with these commitments by subjecting them to the Companys normal credit approval and monitoring processes. The Company has significant variable interests in certain other securitization vehicles that are VIEs that are not consolidated because the Company is not the primary beneficiary. In such cases, the Company does not absorb the majority of the entities expected losses nor does it receive a majority of the expected residual returns. At December 31, 2006 total assets of these entities not included on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet were approximately $2.2 billion. At December 31, 2006, the Companys maximum exposure to loss related to these VIEs was approximately $32.2 million, which represents the Companys investment in preference shares. At December 31, 2005, the Company was considered the primary beneficiary of one of these securitization vehicles and therefore, was required to consolidate its assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2005, the assets of the consolidated entity totaled $317.0 million. The Companys maximum exposure to loss for this VIE was $38.1 million as of December 31, 2005. During 2006, the Company sold a majority of the equity in this securitization vehicle and is no longer considered the primary beneficiary. As part of its community reinvestment initiatives, the Company invests in multi family affordable housing properties throughout its footprint as a limited and or general partner. The Company receives affordable housing federal and state tax credits for these limited partner investments. Partnerships assets of approximately $756.9 million and $803.0 million in partnerships where SunTrust is only a limited partner were not included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Companys maximum exposure to loss for these investments totaled $330.6 million and $357.9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Companys maximum exposure 48 to loss related to its affordable housing limited partner investments consists of the limited partnership equity investments, unfunded equity commitments, and debt issued by the Company to the limited partnerships. SunTrust is the managing general partner of a number of private investment limited partnerships which have been established to provide alternative investment strategies for its clients. In reviewing the partnerships for consolidation, SunTrust determined that these were voting interest entities and accordingly considered the consolidation guidance contained in Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights. Under the terms of SunTrusts non registered investment limited partnerships, the limited partnerships have certain rights, such as the right to remove the general partner, or kick out rights, as indicated in EITF Issue No. 04 5. Therefore, SunTrust, as the general partner, is precluded from consolidating the limited partnerships.

CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS In the normal course of business, the Company enters into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include obligations to make future payments on debt and lease arrangements, contractual commitments for capital expenditures, and service contracts. Table 15 summarizes the Companys significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2006, except for pension and postretirement benefit plans, included in Note 16, Employee Benefit Plans, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additional information with respect to the obligations is presented in tables included in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Diluted earnings per average common share were $1.39 and $1.43 for the fourth quarter of 2006 and 2005, respectively. The fourth quarter of 2006 results included a $7.2 million after tax loss on extinguishment of debt and $7.7 million preferred stock dividend related to the Companys capital restructuring initiatives, while the fourth quarter of 2005 included $4.1 million of after tax merger expense related to the Companys acquisition of NCF on October 1, 2004. These results have been revised from the earnings results the Company reported in its January 19, 2007 earnings release in which the Company reported net income available to common shareholders of $523.6 million, or $1.46 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2006. The reduction in earnings relates to a $40 million increase in the provision for loan losses associated with the previously disclosed large commercial credit. See pages 17 and 18 for further details. Fully taxable equivalent net interest income was $1,185.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, a decrease of $21.9 million, or 1.8%, from the fourth quarter of 2005. The decline was mainly the result of the flat to inverted yield curve that has persisted throughout 2006, as well as the continued shift in deposit mix away from lower cost deposit products to certificates of deposit. Average loans increased $7.5 billion, or 6.6%, while average loans held for sale were relatively flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2005. The net interest margin decreased 18 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2005 to the fourth quarter of 2006, primarily due to higher short term borrowing costs and tighter spreads resulting from the continued flat to inverted yield curve. An overall decline in lower cost deposits, as well as a shift in deposit mix to higher cost certificate of deposits also contributed to the decline. Provision for loan losses was $115.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, an increase of $67.7 million from the fourth quarter of 2005. The provision for loan losses was $42.8 million less than net charge offs for the fourth quarter of 2006, resulting in a corresponding decrease to the ALLL in the fourth quarter of 2006. This decrease was primarily due to the charge off in the fourth quarter of the large commercial loan that was placed on nonaccrual in the third quarter of 2006 resulting in a reduction in the specific reserve related to this loan. Total noninterest income was $882.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, an increase of $84.7 million, or 10.6%, from the fourth quarter of 2005. The increase was driven by higher net securities gains and higher income from structured transactions. The increase in net securities gains was a result of gains realized on equity positions sold by the Company in the fourth quarter of 2006 partially offset by a $24.3 million loss incurred in the fourth quarter of 2006 as a result of restructuring the bond portfolio. Additionally, growth in retail investment services income, other charges and fees, investment banking income, card fees and mortgage production related income was offset by declines in service charges on deposits, trust and investment management income, trading account profits and commissions, and mortgage servicing related income. Total noninterest expense was $1,233.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, an increase of $26.9 million, or 2.2%, from the fourth quarter of 2005. The increase was primarily attributed to increased personnel expense, higher outside processing and software, the loss on extinguishment of debt and divestiture related expenses associated with several Affordable Housing properties designated for sale in the fourth quarter of 2006. These increases were offset by lower amortization of intangible assets and marketing and customer development, as well as the absence of merger expense in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to $6.5 million incurred during the fourth quarter of 2005. The provision for income taxes was $188.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to $211.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2005. The provision represents an effective tax rate of 27.1% for the 50 fourth quarter of 2006, compared to 29.0% for the fourth quarter of 2005. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of an annual adjustment of the estimated current taxes payable to the actual current taxes payable reflected on the Companys 2005 federal and state tax returns filed in September and October of 2006.

Nonaccrual loans are included in average balances and income on such loans, if recognized, is recorded on a cash basis. 2 Interest income includes the effects of taxable equivalent adjustments using a federal income tax rate of 35% and, where applicable, state income taxes to increase tax exempt interest income to a taxable equivalent basis. The net taxable equivalent adjustment amounts included in the above table aggregated $23.9 million, and $20.0 million in the quarters ended December 31, 2006, and December 31, 2005, respectively. 3 Derivative instruments used to help balance the Companys interest sensitivity position decreased net interest income $36.0 million and increased net interest income $10.7 million in the quarters ended December 31, 2006, and December 31, 2005, respectively. 4 The net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized net interest income FTE by average total earning assets. During the second quarter of 2006, the net interest margin calculation was revised as a result of the Company segregating certain noninterest earning trading assets that had previously been included with interest earning trading assets. All prior periods presented were restated to reflect this refinement. Management believes this refined method to be a more reflective measure of net interest margin due to the interest earning nature of these assets. 52 BUSINESS SEGMENTS The Company has five primary lines of business (LOBs): Retail, Commercial, Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB), Wealth and Investment Management, and Mortgage.

On September 29, 2006, SunTrust sold its corporate Bond Trustee business unit with $21.2 billion in assets under administration to U.S. Bank for net proceeds of $112.8 million cash. The sale of the business was part of an effort by the Company to modify its business mix to focus on its high growth core business lines and market segments. Corporate Other and Treasury Corporate Other and Treasury includes the investment securities portfolio, long term debt, end user derivative instruments, short term liquidity and funding activities, balance sheet risk management, and office premises.

Other functions included in Corporate Other and Treasury are operational risk management, credit risk management, credit review, internal audit, legal and compliance, branch operations, corporate strategies, procurement, and the executive management group. Management Reporting Methodology and Reconciling Items The Company continues to augment its internal management reporting methodologies. Currently, the LOBs financial performance is comprised of direct financial results as well as various allocations that 54 for internal management reporting purposes provide an enhanced view of analyzing the LOBs financial performance. The internal allocations include the following: matched maturity funds transfer pricing and a fully taxable equivalent gross up on tax exempt loans and securities to create net interest income, occupancy expense (inclusive of the cost to carry the assets), various support costs such as operational, human resource and corporate finance, certain product related expenses incurred within production support areas, and overhead costs. Beginning January 2006, income tax expense was calculated based on a marginal income tax rate which was modified to reflect the impact of various income tax adjustments and credits that are unique to each business segment. Future enhancements to line of business segment profitability reporting are expected to include: the attribution of economic capital and the use of a provision for loan losses that uses a combination of net charge offs and expected loss in lieu of net charge offs. The implementation of these enhancements to the internal management reporting methodology, may materially affect the net income disclosed for each segment with no impact on consolidated amounts. Whenever significant changes to management reporting methodologies take place, the impact of these changes is quantified and prior period information is reclassified wherever practicable. The Company will reflect these reclassified changes in the current period, and will provide updated historical quarterly, year to date, and annual schedules. Reconciling Items includes capital and various eliminations and management reporting offsets such as the residual offsets derived from matched maturity funds transfer pricing and the difference between provision for loan losses and LOB net charge offs. In the discussion, net of charge offs represent the allocated provision for loan losses for the lines of business. Corporate Other and Treasurys provision for loan losses represents the difference between consolidated provision for loan losses and the aforementioned allocations. The following analysis details the operating results for each line of business for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Prior periods have been restated to conform to the current periods presentation. The following table for SunTrusts reportable segments compares net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 to the same period in 2005 and 2004: TABLE 18 Net Income Twelve Months Ended December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Retail $750.5 $645.3 $475.8 Commercial 432.9 380.9 296.8 Corporate and Investment Banking 213.1 270.8 259.4 Mortgage 248.4 171.9 151.5 Wealth and Investment Management 267.3 187.2 152.6 Corporate Other and Treasury (2.7 ) 75.0 24.1 Reconciling Items 208.0 256.1 212.7 The following table for SunTrusts reportable business segments compares average loans and average deposits for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 to the same period in the last two years: TABLE 19 Average Loans and Deposits Twelve Months Ended December 31 Average Loans Average Deposits (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Retail $30,885 $30,412 $24,379 $68,998 $65,239 $53,119 Commercial 32,439 30,760 23,730 13,787 13,409 11,360 Corporate and Investment Banking 16,507 15,286 13,670 3,117 3,289 3,265 Mortgage 31,233 24,206 18,006 1,811 1,654 1,382 Wealth and Investment Management 8,135 7,810 6,230 9,477 9,528 7,901 Corporate Other and Treasury 473 326 270 26,601 17,436 10,728 55 BUSINESS SEGMENTS RESULTS Retail Retails net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 was $750.5 million, an increase of $105.2 million, or 16.3%. The increase was primarily the result of loan and deposit growth, wider deposit spreads, and lower provision for loan losses, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Fully taxable equivalent net interest income increased $178.0 million, or 8.1%. The increase was attributable to loan and deposit growth, a favorable change in the loan mix and wider deposit spreads. Average loans increased $473.8 million, or 1.6%, primarily driven by growth in home equity products offset by a decline in student loans due to sales and securitizations during 2006. Average deposits increased $3.8 billion, or 5.8%, driven primarily by consumer time deposits. Deposit spreads widened due to deposit rate increases that have been slower relative to market rate increases, as well as the increasing value of lower cost deposits in a higher rate environment. Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge offs for the lines of business, decreased $32.3 million, or 23.4%, primarily due to a decline in consumer indirect auto net charge offs. Total noninterest income increased $26.8 million, or 2.6%. The increase was driven primarily by interchange income due to increased volumes, as well as gains on student loan sales. Total noninterest expense increased $80.4 million, or 3.9%. The increase was driven by increases in interchange expense due to increased volume, as well as personnel and operations expense related to investments in the branch distribution network and technology. Forty four net new branches were added during 2006. Commercial Commercials net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 was $432.9 million, an increase of $52.0 million, or 13.7%. The increase was primarily driven by net interest income and noninterest income growth and lower provision for loan losses, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Fully taxable equivalent net interest income increased $44.8 million, or 5.0%. The increase was driven by loan and deposit growth, as well as wider deposit spreads. Average loans increased $1.7 billion, or 5.5%, with the strongest growth in construction lending. Average deposits increased $378.5 million, or 2.8%, driven by an increase in institutional and government deposits and partially offset by decreases in demand deposits and money market accounts. Deposit spreads increased due to the increasing value of lower cost deposits in a higher rate environment. Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge offs for the lines of business, decreased $15.7 million, or 61.7%. The decrease was driven primarily by lower net charge offs in the Core Commercial and the Real Estate Finance Group sub lines of business. Total noninterest income increased $23.9 million, or 9.4%. The increase resulted from higher Affordable Housing revenues, deposit sweep income, as well as increased revenue from capital markets and card products. Total noninterest expense increased $18.5 million, or 3.0%. Increases in personnel and operations expense were partially offset by a decrease in Affordable Housing expense. 56 Corporate and Investment Banking Corporate and Investment Bankings net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 was $213.1 million, a decrease of $57.7 million, or 21.3%. Adjusting net income by $16.6 million for the March 2005 divestiture of Receivables Capital Management (RCM) factoring assets, net income increased 15.2%. Strong growth in Debt Capital Markets was primarily offset by increased provision for loan losses, as well as a decrease in loan spreads. Fully taxable equivalent net interest income decreased $31.5 million, or 11.9%, primarily due to narrowing of market spreads on loans to the large corporate sector. Average loans increased $1.2 billion, or 8.0%, primarily in Financial Institutions, Energy and US Diversified Groups. This increase was due to stronger corporate demand and revolver usage, as well as strong growth in our leasing products. Average deposits decreased $172.2 million, or 5.2%, led by a reduction in certain bid category products that the line of business elected not to bid on due to their high cost in relation to alternative funding sources. Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge offs for the lines of business, increased $99.1 million to $113.9 million. The increase was primarily due to the charge off recognized in the fourth quarter of 2006 associated with the previously disclosed large commercial loan placed on nonperforming status in the third quarter of 2006. Total noninterest income increased $30.5 million, or 4.8%. Adjusting for the divestiture of RCM, noninterest income grew 10.0%. Debt Capital Markets revenue increased $64.2 million, or 27.7%, mainly related to securitizations, derivatives and structured leasing, as well as strong revenue performance in merchant banking and leasing. Total noninterest expense increased $3.4 million, or 0.7%, primarily driven by increased compensation related to increased capital markets revenue, as well as increased expense related to merchant banking activities. Mortgage Mortgages net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 was $248.4 million, an increase of $76.5 million, or 44.5%. Income from sales of servicing assets, higher income from loans and deposits, better net secondary marketing performance, and higher origination and servicing fees, net of increased expense, were partially offset by increased mortgage servicing rights amortization. Fully taxable equivalent net interest income increased $55.7 million, or 10.2%, primarily due to loan and deposit growth partially offset by lower spreads on loans held for sale. Average loans, primarily residential mortgage and residential construction loans, increased $7.0 billion, or 29.0%, contributing $85.0 million to the higher net interest income. Average loans held for sale increased $1.7 billion, or 22.6%. However, due to compressed spreads resulting from higher short term interest rates, net interest income on loans held for sale declined $43.6 million. Average deposits were up $0.2 billion, or 9.5%, due to escrow balances associated with higher servicing balances along with a higher credit for funds rate, and contributed $24.5 million to the overall increase. Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge offs for the lines of business, increased $3.1 million, or 55.8%, due to the maturation of the mortgage portfolio. Total noninterest income increased $140.1 million, or 58.6%. Production income was up $70.5 million driven by higher volumes. Production of $55.4 billion was up $7.7 billion, or 16.2%. Loan sales to investors were $40.9 billion, an increase of $13.2 billion, or 47.6%. Servicing income was up 57 $80.0 million due to gains from the sale of mortgage servicing assets of $66.3 million and increased fees from higher servicing balances. Higher mortgage servicing rights amortization partially offset these increases. Other noninterest income was down $10.4 million due to higher secondary marketing reserves, partially offset by higher insurance income. At December 31, 2006, total loans serviced were $130.0 billion, up $24.4 billion, or 23.1% from $105.6 billion in the prior year. Total noninterest expense increased $75.6 million, or 14.5%. Increased volume and investments in production and servicing capabilities were the primary drivers of the higher expense level. Wealth and Investment Management Wealth and Investment Managements net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 was $267.3 million, an increase of $80.1 million, or 42.8%. Excluding the net gain on the sale of the Bond Trustee business, net income increased 5.5%. Increases in both net interest income and noninterest income were partially offset by higher expenses. Fully taxable equivalent net interest income increased $24.3 million, or 7.1%, attributable to a combination of increased loan volumes and wider deposit spreads. Average loans increased $0.3 billion, or 4.2%, primarily due to growth in commercial real estate and commercial loans. Average deposits decreased $0.1 billion, or 0.5%, due to declines in demand deposits and money market accounts, partially offset by increases in consumer time deposits. Deposit spreads widened due to deposit rate increases that have been slower relative to market rate increases as well as the increasing value of lower cost deposits in a higher rate environment. Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge offs for the lines of business, decreased $5.2 million, or 58.4%. Total noninterest income increased $154.9 million, or 16.4%, primarily due to the $112.8 million pre tax gain on the sale of the Bond Trustee business. The remainder of the increase was largely driven by growth in trust and retail investment services income. Trust income increased due to growth in assets under management from improved sales and market conditions. Retail investment services income increased due to growth in variable annuities, managed account and new business revenue. Total noninterest expense increased $60.1 million, or 6.2%. Growth was primarily driven by higher structural and staff expense. Corporate Other and Treasury Corporate Other and Treasurys net loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 was $2.7 million, mainly due to a decline in fully taxable equivalent net interest income and increased securities losses partially offset by a decrease in merger expense. Fully taxable equivalent net interest income decreased $136.3 million. The main drivers were a $1.9 billion decrease in average securities available for sale, a decrease in income on receive fixed/pay floating interest rate swaps used to extend the duration of the commercial loan portfolio resulting from narrower spreads between the receive fixed/pay floating rates, an increase in short term borrowing costs due to an increase in the size of these borrowings needed to fund earning asset growth, as well as a significant rise in short term interest rates over the past year. Total average assets decreased $2.1 billion, or 6.5%, mainly due to a $1.9 billion reduction in the size of the investment portfolio that resulted from the investment portfolio restructuring in the second half of 2006. Total average deposits increased $9.2 billion, or 52.6%, mainly due to growth in brokered and foreign deposits of $9.3 billion. 58 Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge offs for the lines of business, decreased $1.7 million, or 29.7%. Total noninterest income decreased $67.5 million, or 80.2%, mainly due to an increase in net securities losses of $44.8 million related to the portfolio restructuring in 2006 and a $14.0 million decrease in derivative income on economic hedges. Total noninterest expense decreased $55.5 million, or 63.1%, mainly due to a reduction in merger expense. EARNINGS AND BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS 2005 VS. 2004 Consolidated Overview Net income totaled $2.0 billion or $5.47 per diluted share for 2005, up 26.3% and 5.4%, respectively, from 2004. The following are some of the key drivers of the Companys 2005 financial performance as compared to 2004: Total revenue FTE increased $1.5 billion, or 23.0%, compared to 2004. The acquisition of NCF, successful implementation of sales initiatives and intense sales focus drove increases in both net interest income and noninterest income. Net interest income FTE increased $910.9 million, or 24.3%, and the net interest margin remained stable at 3.17% for 2005. The increase in net interest income was driven by strong loan and deposit growth driven by the acquisition of NCF and higher home equity, residential real estate, and middle market commercial loan volumes. The average earning asset yield increased 85 basis points compared to 2004 while the average interest bearing liability cost increased 101 basis points. This reduction in interest rate spread was primarily due to increases in short term funding rates throughout 2005. Noninterest income improved $550.6 million, or 21.1%, compared to 2004. The increase was driven by the acquisition of NCF, higher transaction volumes, record mortgage production, and a $23.4 million gain on the sale of Receivables Capital Management. Noninterest expense increased $793.7 million, or 20.4%, compared to 2004. The increase was driven by the acquisition of NCF including a $70.2 million increase in merger expense to integrate the operations of NCF and consisted primarily of consulting fees for systems and other integration initiatives, employee related charges and marketing expenditures. Additionally impacting noninterest expense was higher personnel costs due to increased headcount, normal merit raises, and increased incentive costs associated with higher business volumes. Credit quality continued to improve throughout 2005. Nonperforming assets declined $76.5 million, or 18.6%, compared to December 31, 2004 and net charge offs as a percentage of average loans declined five basis points to 0.18% compared to 2004. Business Segments The following analysis details the operating results for each line of business for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. These periods have been restated to conform to the 2006 presentation. Retail Retails net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 was $645.3 million, an increase of $169.4 million, or 35.6%, compared to the same period in 2004. This increase was primarily attributable to the NCF acquisition, higher net interest income and higher noninterest income partially offset by higher noninterest expense. 59 Fully taxable equivalent net interest income increased $397.7 million, or 22.1%. The NCF acquisition contributed approximately $137 million of the increase. The remainder of the increase was attributable to loan and deposit growth and widening deposit spreads due to deposit rate increases that have been slower relative to market rate increases. Average loans increased $6.0 billion, or 24.7%, while average deposits increased $12.1 billion, or 22.8%. The NCF acquisition was the primary driver of these increases, contributing approximately $5 billion in loans and approximately $11 billion in deposits. The remaining loan growth was driven primarily by equity lines and student lending while the remaining deposit growth was driven by demand deposits (DDA), NOW accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge offs for the lines of business, decreased $3.7 million, or 2.6%, primarily due to a decline in consumer indirect auto loans net charge offs. Noninterest income increased $188.7 million, or 22.6%. The addition of NCF contributed approximately $133 million of this increase. The remaining increase was driven primarily by interchange income due to increased debit and credit card transaction volumes. Noninterest expense increased $333.5 million, or 19.4%. This increase was driven by the addition of NCF and personnel expense due to merit increases and headcount increases driven by branch expansion. Commercial Commercials net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 was $380.9 million, an increase of $84.1 million, or 28.3%, compared to the same period in 2004. NCF accounted for approximately $30 million of the increase. The remaining increase was due to improvement in net interest income and higher noninterest income, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Fully taxable equivalent net interest income increased $210.2 million or 30.6%. Net interest income growth was driven by loan and deposit growth and higher deposit spreads. Average loans increased $7.0 billion, or 29.6%, and average deposits increased $2.0 billion, or 18.0%. NCF accounted for approximately $114 million of the net interest income growth, approximately $5 billion of the loan growth and approximately $1 billion of the deposit growth. The remaining loan growth was driven by stronger demand for commercial and commercial real estate loans. The remaining deposit growth was attributable to increased client liquidity. Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge offs for the lines of business, increased $.92 million when compared to the same period in 2004, despite approximately a $7 million increase from NCF and a $3.2 million increase from Affordable Housing. Noninterest income increased $18.7 million, or 7.9%. NCF accounted for approximately $5 million of the increase. Affordable Housing contributed $6.7 million of the increase, driven by higher tax credits from new properties and additional investments, as well as higher partnership revenue. The remaining increase was due to increases in capital markets activities, loan fees, and deposit sweep income. Partially offsetting these increases, was a decrease in service charges on deposits due to higher compensating balances and increased client earnings credit rates. Noninterest expense increased $121.2 million, or 24.0%. NCF accounted for approximately $64 million of the increase. An additional $34.1 million of the increase was attributable to Affordable Housing activities, primarily impairment and other charges related to Affordable Housing properties. The remaining increase was primarily related to personnel expenses. 60 Corporate and Investment Banking Corporate and Investments Bankingss net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 was $270.8 million, an increase of $11.5 million, or 4.4%, compared to the same period in 2004. Improvements in net interest income and investment banking income were the primary contributors to the increase. Fully taxable equivalent net interest income increased $8.3 million, or 3.2%. Average loans increased $1.6 billion, or 11.8%, and average deposits increased $24.3 million, or 0.7%. Core commercial loan and lease growth was due to increased corporate demand and increased merger and acquisition activity. Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge offs for the lines of business, decreased $1.6 million, or 9.7% when compared to the same period in 2004. Noninterest income increased $6.9 million, or 1.1%, driven by increased trading and advisory fees in investment grade bond issuances, merger and acquisition, leasing, and fixed income/equity derivatives. This was partially offset by reduced activity in equity offerings, securitizations, and credit trading. Noninterest expense decreased $2.0 million, or 0.4%. This decrease was driven by the RCM divestiture in the first quarter of 2005 and lower leveraged lease expense. This was partially offset by increased personnel expense associated with increased fee income. Mortgage Mortgages net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 was $171.9 million, an increase of $20.3 million, or 13.4%, compared to the same period in 2004. Income from higher loan production, net interest income from loan growth, and higher fees were the primary contributors to the increase. This was partially offset by higher volume and growth related expenses. Fully taxable equivalent net interest income increased $58.4 million, or 11.9%. Average loans, primarily residential mortgage and residential construction loans, increased $6.2 billion, or 34.4% and contributed $65.1 million to the higher net interest income. Average deposits increased $272.0 million, or 19.7%, contributing $18.6 million to the increase in net interest income. Average mortgage loans held for sale were up $2.7 billion or 55.6%. However, rising short term interest rates resulted in compressed spreads, causing a decline in net interest income of $14.9 million. Additional funding costs for higher non earning assets primarily due to the NCF acquisition reduced net interest income $10.6 million. Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge offs for the lines of business, increased $2.0 million or 55.3% when compared to the same period in 2004 Noninterest income increased $122.9 million, or 105.6%, primarily due to higher loan origination and servicing income and the addition of NCF. Production for 2005 of $47.7 billion was up $16.9 billion or 54.9%. Loan sales to investors were $27.7 billion, an increase of $11.6 billion or 71.6%. Servicing income was up $30.2 million primarily due to higher servicing fees from higher servicing balances, and to a lesser extent, a decline in MSR amortization. As of December 31, 2005, total loans serviced were $105.6 billion up $25.7 billion, or 32.1% from $79.9 billion at December 31, 2004. Other noninterest income increased $6.6 million primarily due to volume related fees. Noninterest expense increased $149.9 million, or 40.3%, due to higher personnel expense and other volume and growth related expenses, along with the addition of NCF. The higher personnel expense resulted from growth in the sales force, higher volume related commissions, and higher benefit costs. 61 Wealth and Investment Management Wealth and Investment Managements net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 was $187.2 million, an increase of $34.6 million, or 22.7%, compared to the same period in 2004. Organic growth was the primary contributor to the increase, with NCF, Seix Investment Advisors (Seix) and Zevenbergen Capital Investments, LLC (ZCI) also aiding results. Seix, a fixed income division of Trusco, was formed following the acquisition of Seix Investment Advisors, Inc. in the second quarter of 2004. ZCI is a 55% owned subsidiary of Trusco and was consolidated in the fourth quarter of 2004. The remainder of the growth was primarily driven by increased net interest income and noninterest income, partially offset by higher personnel and operations expense and amortization of intangibles. Fully taxable equivalent net interest income increased $99.9 million, or 41.1%. NCF contributed approximately $25 million to the increase. Average loans increased $1.6 billion, or 25.4%, including approximately $754 million attributable to NCF. Average deposits increased $1.6 billion, or 20.6%, including approximately $484 million attributable to NCF. Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge offs for the lines of business, increased $5.1 million when compared to the same period in 2004, primarily due to NCF. Noninterest income increased $122.8 million, or 15.0%. NCF accounted for approximately $59 million of the increase while Seix and ZCI accounted for approximately $30 million. The remainder of the increase was primarily due to growth in recurring trust revenue and retail investment income. Assets under management increased approximately $9.4 billion, or 7.5%, due to new business and an increase in equity markets. As of December 31, 2005, assets under management were approximately $135.3 billion compared to $125.9 billion as of December 31, 2004. Assets under management include individually managed assets, the STI Classic Funds, institutional assets managed by Trusco Capital Management, and participant directed retirement accounts. SunTrusts total assets under advisement were approximately $242.5 billion, which include the aforementioned assets under management, $45.5 billion in non managed trust assets, $33.4 billion in retail brokerage assets, and $28.3 billion in non managed corporate trust assets. Noninterest expense increased $150.5 million, or 18.2%. NCF, Seix and ZCI were the largest contributors of the increase. The balance of the increase was driven by higher personnel expense due to merit increases and selective hiring, and higher operations expense in an effort to build out the business. Corporate Other and Treasury Corporate Other and Treasurys net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 was $75.0 million, an increase of $50.9 million from the same period in 2004. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of NCF and reduced securities losses. Fully taxable equivalent net interest income increased $22.8 million, or 251.9%. NCF represented approximately $10 million of the increase. Additionally, net internal funding credits on other liabilities and other assets increased a combined $30.1 million and was partially offset by a $20.4 million decrease in income on interest rate swaps accounted for as cash flow hedges of floating rate commercial loans. Total average assets increased $2.2 billion, or 7.2%, and total average liabilities increased $12.1 billion, or 29.4%. NCF added approximately $4 billion in total average assets which was partially offset by a reduction in the investment portfolio. The increase in liabilities was mainly due to growth in brokered and foreign deposits of $6.9 billion. Provision for loan losses increased $3.0 million, or 107.3%, due to the acquisition of NCF and an increase in charge offs at BankCard. 62 Noninterest income increased $90.9 million. NCF added approximately $44 million in noninterest income. Additionally, securities losses decreased by $32.3 million. Noninterest expense increased $33.9 million, or 62.8%. NCF added approximately $118 million of noninterest expense in addition to the $74.8 million increase in merger expense representing costs to integrate the operations of NCF. Additionally, increases in corporate overhead expenses of $98.1 million were partially offset by increased expense recovery from the lines of business in the amount of $256.6 million. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Companys significant accounting policies are described in detail in Note 1, Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements and are integral to understanding Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition. Management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require managements judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies and they have a significant impact on the financial statements. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, or reducing a liability. The Companys accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with US GAAP, and they conform to general practices within the applicable industries. The Company has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The following is a description of the Companys current accounting policies that are considered to involve significant management judgment. Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses The allowance for loan and lease losses represents the Companys estimate of probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio. The ALLL is increased by the provision for loan losses and reduced by loans charged off, net of recoveries. The ALLL is determined based on managements assessment of reviews and evaluations of larger loans that meet the Companys definition of impairment and the size and current risk characteristics of pools of homogeneous loans (i.e., loans having similar characteristics) within the portfolio. Impaired loans, except for smaller balance homogeneous loans, include loans classified as nonaccrual where it is probable that SunTrust will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When a loan is deemed impaired, the amount of specific allowance required is measured by a careful analysis of the most probable source of repayment, including the present value of the loans expected future cash flows, the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs of disposition, or the loans estimated market value. In these measurements, management uses assumptions and methodologies that are relevant to estimating the level of impaired and unrealized losses in the portfolio. To the extent that the data supporting such assumptions has limitations, managements judgment and experience play a key role in enhancing the ALLL estimates. General allowances are established for loans and leases grouped into pools that have similar characteristics, including smaller balance homogeneous loans. The ALLL Committee estimates probable losses by evaluating several factors: historical loss experience, current internal risk ratings based on the Companys internal risk rating system, internal portfolio trends such as increasing or decreasing levels of delinquencies, concentrations, and external influences such as changes in economic or industry conditions. 63 The Companys financial results are impacted by the changes and absolute level of the ALLL. This process involves managements analysis of complex internal and external variables, and it requires that management exercise judgment to estimate an appropriate ALLL. As a result of the uncertainty associated with this subjectivity, the Company cannot assure the precision of the amount reserved, should it experience sizeable loan or lease losses in any particular period. For example, changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers, economic conditions, historical loss experience, or the condition of various markets in which collateral may be sold could require the Company to significantly decrease or increase the level of the ALLL and the associated provision for loan losses. Such an adjustment could materially affect net income. For additional discussion of the allowance for loan and lease losses see the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Provision for Loan Losses sections beginning on page 28. Estimates of Fair Value Fair value is defined as the amount at which an asset or liability could be sold in a transaction between willing parties, that is, other than in a forced or liquidation sale, in a normal business transaction. The estimation of fair value is significant to a number of SunTrusts assets and liabilities, including loans held for sale, financial instruments, MSRs, other real estate owned, other repossessed assets, goodwill, retirement and postretirement benefit obligations, as well as assets and liabilities associated with derivative financial instruments. These are all recorded at either fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value. Fair value is based on market prices for the same instrument or for similar instruments adjusted for any differences in terms. If market prices are not available, then fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow analyses. In instances where required by US GAAP, the Company uses discount rates in its determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities such as retirement and other postretirement benefit obligations and MSRs. Discount rates used are those considered to be commensurate with the risks involved. A change in these discount rates could increase or decrease the values of those assets and liabilities. The Company provides disclosure of the key economic assumptions used to measure MSRs and a sensitivity analysis to adverse changes to these assumptions in Note 11, Securitization Activity/Mortgage Servicing Rights, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The fair values of MSRs are based on discounted cash flow analyses. A detailed discussion of key variables, including the discount rate, used in the determination of retirement and other postretirement obligations is in the Pension Accounting section. Fair values for investment securities and most derivative financial instruments are based on independent, third party market prices. If market prices are not available, fair values are based on the market prices of similar instruments. The fair values of loans held for sale are based on observable current market prices. The fair values of OREO and other repossessed assets are typically determined based on appraisals by third parties, less estimated selling costs. Estimates of fair value are also required in performing an impairment analysis of goodwill. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis, or more often if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value an additional analysis must be performed to determine the amount, if any, by which goodwill is impaired. In determining the fair value of SunTrusts reporting units, management uses discounted cash flow models which require assumptions about growth rates of the reporting units and the cost of equity. 64 Pension Accounting Several variables affect the annual pension cost and the annual variability of cost for the SunTrust retirement programs. The main variables are: (1) size and characteristics of the employee population, (2) discount rate, (3) expected long term rate of return on plan assets, (4) recognition of actual asset returns and (5) other actuarial assumptions. Below is a brief description of these variables and the effect they have on SunTrusts pension costs. Size and Characteristics of the Employee Population Pension cost is directly related to the number of employees covered by the plans, and other factors including salary, age, and years of employment. The number of employees eligible for pension benefits has increased over prior years, especially with the addition of NCF employees at the end of 2004. Discount Rate The discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit obligations. The discount rate for each plan is determined by matching the expected cash flows of each plan to a yield curve based on long term, high quality fixed income debt instruments available as of the measurement date, December 31. This assumption is updated every year for each plan. The discount rate for each plan is reset annually on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions. If the Company were to assume a 0.25% increase/decrease in the discount rate for all retirement and other postretirement plans, and keep all other assumptions constant, the benefit cost would decrease/ increase by approximately $14 million. Expected Long term Rate of Return on Plan Assets Based on historical experience and market projection of the target asset allocation set forth in the investment policy for the SunTrust and NCF Retirement Plans, the pre tax expected rate of return on plan assets was 8.50% and 8.50% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. This expected rate of return is not expected to change significantly each year. Annual differences, if any, between expected and actual returns are included in the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount. The Company generally amortizes any unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in excess of a 10% corridor, as defined in SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, (SFAS No. 87) in net periodic pension expense over the average future service of active employees, which is approximately eight years. See Note 16, Employee Benefit Plans, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on changes in the pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. If the Company were to assume a 0.25% increase/decrease in the expected long term rate of return for the retirement and other postretirement plans, holding all other actuarial assumptions constant, the benefit cost would decrease/increase by approximately $6 million. Recognition of Actual Asset Returns SFAS No. 87 allows for the use of an asset value that smoothes investment gains and losses over a period up to five years. However, SunTrust has elected to use a preferable method in determining pension expense. This method uses the actual market value of the plan assets, and therefore, immediately recognizes prior gains and losses. Therefore, SunTrust will have more variability in the annual pension cost, as the asset values will be more volatile than companies who elected to smooth their investment experience. 65 Other Actuarial Assumptions To estimate the projected benefit obligation, actuarial assumptions are required about factors such as mortality rate, turnover rate, retirement rate, disability rate and the rate of compensation increases. These factors dont tend to change significantly over time, so the range of assumptions, and their impact on pension cost, is generally limited. SunTrust periodically reviews the assumptions used based on historical and expected future experience. Due to the adoption of SFAS No. 158, to estimate the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2006, the Company projected forward the benefit obligations from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2006, adjusting for benefit payments, expected growth in the benefit obligations, changes in key assumptions and plan provisions, and any significant changes in the plan demographics that occurred during the year, including (where appropriate) subsidized early retirements, salary changes different from expectations, entrance of new participants, changes in per capita claims cost, Medicare Part D subsidy, and retiree contributions. Income Taxes The Company is subject to the income tax laws of the various jurisdictions where it conducts business and estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to these various tax jurisdictions. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the reasonableness of the Companys effective tax rate based upon its current estimate of net income, tax credits, and the applicable statutory tax rates expected for the full year. The estimated income tax expense is reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due or to be received from taxing jurisdictions either currently or in the future and is reported in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. SunTrust assesses the appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent and other pertinent information and maintains tax accruals consistent with its evaluation. Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws, the status of examinations by the taxing authorities, and newly enacted statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance that could impact the relative merits of tax positions. These changes, when they occur, impact accrued taxes and can materially affect the Companys operating results. For additional information, see Note 15, Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
