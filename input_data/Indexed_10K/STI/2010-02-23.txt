This narrative will assist readers in their analysis of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and supplemental financial information. It should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes. When we refer to SunTrust, the Company, we, our and us in this narrative, we mean SunTrust Banks, Inc. and Subsidiaries (consolidated). Effective May 1, 2008, we acquired GB&T and the results of operations for GB&T were included with our results beginning on that date. Periods prior to the acquisition date do not reflect the impact of the merger. In the MD&A, net interest income, net interest margin, and the efficiency ratio are presented on an FTE basis and the quarterly ratios are presented on an annualized basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax favored status of income from certain loans and investments. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax exempt sources. We also present diluted earnings per common share excluding goodwill and intangible impairment charges. We believe the exclusion of the impairment charges is more reflective of normalized operations and allows better comparability with peers throughout the industry. Additionally, we present a return on average realized common shareholders equity, as well as an ROE. We also present a ROA less net realized and unrealized securities gains/losses and an ROA. The return on average realized common shareholders equity and ROA less net realized and unrealized securities gains/losses exclude realized securities gains and losses and the Coke dividend, from the numerator, and net unrealized securities gains from the denominator. We present a tangible efficiency ratio and a tangible equity to tangible assets ratio, which excludes the effect of intangible assets costs. We believe these measures are useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible asset costs (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare our efficiency and capital adequacy to other companies in the industry. We also present a tangible book value per common share ratio which excludes the after tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets. These measures are utilized by management to assess our financial performance and capital adequacy. We provide reconcilements in Tables 21 and 22 in the MD&A for all non U.S. GAAP measures. Certain reclassifications may be made to prior period financial statements and related information to conform them to the 2009 presentation.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW While many economists have declared the recession to be over or at least abating by the end of 2009, the economic environment during 2009 adversely impacted our financial performance and will likely continue to impact our performance into 2010, particularly related to credit which tends to lag economic cycles. We recognize that the beginning of a recovery is just that, a beginning, and history tells us that, looking over the long term, it will take time before economic stabilization meaningfully translates into bottom line results for traditional banks. Asset quality, revenues and ultimately earnings improvement will need time to gain traction and the timing will be largely dependent upon the strength and sustainability of the economic recovery, both of which remain uncertain at the end of 2009. Regardless of when economists determine the end of the recession, the economy remains weak, as evidenced by many key economic indicators. Notably, the national unemployment rate rose steadily during the year to finish at 10.0% as of December 31, which is up from a high of 7.4% at the end of 2008. More specifically, the unemployment rate exceeds 10% within many of our markets. Furthermore, it is believed that the national unemployment rate will remain elevated during much of 2010. Additionally, home prices remain depressed and continued to decline throughout the year in some of our more significant markets. 21 Table of Contents The Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and U.S. government undertook steps during the year to strengthen the capital of financial institutions, stimulate lending, and inject liquidity into the financial markets. Among the steps taken by the government agencies, the TLGP was extended into late 2009, billions of MBS were purchased in the open market, trillions of debt obligations were issued, and benchmark interest rates were kept at record low levels throughout the year. As 2009 came to a close, the U.S. government and bank regulators were discussing how to reduce their involvement as a financial intermediary in the markets due to the markets having exhibited some signs of stability. Most notably, the government is assessing when to discontinue some of its support programs including its ongoing purchases of mortgage backed assets. This reduction in support could cause mortgage interest rates to rise which would result in a potential reduction in mortgage originations, decrease in value of mortgage loans and securities, and an overall slowing of the housing market. Concurrently, the financial services industry is entering a new phase in its relationship with regulatory authorities as the regulators debate new regulations and requirements that would affect our business, some in a negative way. See additional discussion of risks associated with potential new regulations in Item 1, Business, under the heading Government Supervision and Regulation and Item 1A., Risk Factors in this 10 K. During 2009, the federal bank regulatory agencies completed a review, called the SCAP, commonly referred to as the stress test, of the capital needs through the end of 2010 of the nineteen largest U.S. bank holding companies. The Federal Reserve announced the results of the SCAP on May 7, 2009. The Federal Reserve advised us that, based on the SCAP review, we presently have and are projected to continue to have Tier 1 capital well in excess of the amount required to be well capitalized through the forecast period under both the baseline scenario and the more adverse than expected scenario (more adverse) as estimated by the U.S. Treasury. The SCAPs more adverse scenario represents a hypothetical scenario that involves a recession that is longer and more severe than consensus expectations and results in higher than expected credit losses, but is not a forecast of expected losses or revenues. The Federal Reserve advised us that based on the more adverse scenario that it required us to adjust the composition of our Tier 1 capital by increasing the Tier 1 common equity portion by $2.2 billion. The common equity increase prescribed by the Federal Reserve is necessary to maintain Tier 1 common equity at 4% of risk weighted assets under the more adverse scenario, as specified by a new regulatory standard that was introduced as part of the stress test. This increase satisfied the regulatory request that we have an increased mix of common equity as a percentage of Tier 1 capital, to serve as a buffer against higher losses than generally expected, and allow us to remain well capitalized and able to lend to creditworthy borrowers should such losses materialize. Our 2009 actual credit losses were significantly less than the projections utilized in the SCAP process. During the second quarter, in response to the SCAP, we successfully completed our capital plan and initiatives, generating $2.3 billion of capital and exceeding the target of $2.2 billion established by the Federal Reserve. The transactions utilized to raise the capital included the issuance of common stock, the repurchase of certain preferred stock and hybrid debt securities, and the sale of Visa Class B shares. These capital raising transactions increased Tier 1 common equity by $2.1 billion and were the driving factor in the increase in our Tier 1 common equity ratio to 7.67% at December 31, 2009 compared to 5.83% at December 31, 2008. During the second quarter, we completed all required capital initiatives and believe that relative to the more adverse scenario, additional capital will be achieved through lower credit losses than projected by SCAP. As a result of the successful capital plan and initiatives, we have the ability and desire to repay the U.S. government for funds borrowed in the form of preferred stock issued by us under the CPP. However, our repayment of TARP funds is predicated on approval by our primary regulator, the Federal Reserve. See additional discussion of SCAP and the capital plan and initiatives in the Capital Resources section of this MD&A. Despite the challenging economic environment, we continue to operate from a position of strength and are focused on growing revenue, improving expense efficiency, increasing the profitability of the balance sheet, investing for the future, and prudently managing credit. To this end, we remain acutely focused on clients, improving service quality and front line execution, controlling expenses, and managing risk. During the year, revenue was soft, loan demand was down, credit costs were higher, and asset quality was weak. We are seeing sustained economic weakness that has reduced demand for loans as clients have focused on capital preservation and debt reduction, while accessing the debt markets in lieu of bank loans. However, we have also experienced positive operating trends in many of our businesses that included strong deposit growth, improved funding mix, significant expansion of net interest margin, positive fee income growth in certain areas, continued strong expense management, and credit trends that improved during the last half of 2009. Specifically, in the last quarter of 2009, we experienced declining net charge offs and early stage delinquencies, stabilizing nonperforming loans, and a lesser increase in the ALLL. We believe our strong foundation coupled with our client focused execution, risk mitigation capabilities, and the long term economic prospects of our markets position us to deliver improving financial performance as the operating environment improves. The difficult economic environment during 2009 negatively impacted our financial performance as we realized a net loss available to common shareholders of $1.7 billion, or $3.98 per common share. The net loss during the year was primarily a result of goodwill impairment taken during the first quarter and increased provisioning for credit losses during the year. The first quarter non cash goodwill impairment charge attributable to common shareholders was $714.8 million, after tax, or $1.64 per common share, while the provision for credit losses increased by $993.6 million, after tax, or $2.28 per common share. 22 Table of Contents While 2009 was a year of poor credit performance as most notably evidenced by our higher allowance for loan losses, provision for credit losses, net charge offs, and nonperforming assets, asset quality trends improved in the final quarter of 2009 when compared to the previous quarter as evidenced by the decline in credit losses and early stage delinquencies and stabilization of nonperforming loans. In addition, our reserve build decreased during each consecutive quarter during the year with the fourth quarter allowance for loan losses having increased by only 3.2% from the prior quarter. However, absolute asset quality issues remain centered in the residential real estate related portfolios, including residential mortgages, home equity products, and residential construction. In addition, we experienced some weakness in our commercial client base, particularly those in more cyclically sensitive industries, and in our small business portfolio, and we expect that we will continue to see stress in asset quality in the commercial portfolio. The $1.7 billion increase in net charge offs during the year was primarily related to residential mortgages, large corporate borrowers in economically cyclical industries, and the resolution of loan workouts related to the home builder portfolio. Our nonperforming loans grew by $1.5 billion during 2009, which is a result of the economic environment causing increased client defaults on their loans and extended disposition times on our consumer loans secured by residential real estate. Given the extended timelines to foreclose, especially in Florida, we expect that our nonperforming loan levels will remain elevated throughout 2010. However, during the second half of 2009, the level of increases in nonperforming loans moderated as compared to the increases seen during the first six months of the year. This moderation in nonperforming loans, the first since the credit crisis began in 2007, was mainly due to a reduction in nonaccrual commercial loans as the result of charge offs recognized during the second half of the year and the transfer of certain commercial loans out of nonaccrual due to improved performance. We have implemented numerous loss mitigation efforts and are working to effectively manage elevated levels of nonperforming loans. While not a primary driver of the improvement, our proactive mortgage loan modification programs have had a positive influence on these delinquency and nonperforming loan trends. We have seen a $1.2 billion increase in accruing restructured loans during 2009, which is due to us taking proactive steps to responsibly modify loans in order to mitigate loss exposure related to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. We are aggressively pursuing modifications when there is a reasonable chance that the modification will allow the client to continue to remain in their home. Although, when there has been a loss of income such that the client cannot reasonably support even a modified loan, we are strongly encouraging short sales and deed in lieu arrangements and relocation to more affordable housing. See additional discussion of credit and asset quality in the Loans, Allowance for Credit Losses, Provision for Credit Losses, and Nonperforming Assets sections of this MD&A. Despite the net losses in 2009, our capital and liquidity positions are stronger at the end of 2009 compared to prior year as evidenced by the growth during the year in our capital and liquidity ratios and growth in deposits. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio improved to 7.67% from 5.83% at December 31, 2008. In addition, our Tier 1 capital ratio increased to 12.96% which is a 209 basis point increase from 10.87% at December 31, 2008. These improvements were the result of the capital raising transactions during the second quarter of 2009, as well as lower risk weighted assets from a reduction in loans and unfunded commitments. We also have substantial available liquidity as the inflows of high quality deposits have largely been retained in cash and invested in high quality government backed securities. See additional discussion of our capital and liquidity position in the Capital Resources and Liquidity Risk sections of this MD&A. During the year, we experienced a significant increase in consumer and commercial deposits as evidenced by an 11.7% increase in average deposits compared to the prior year. Growth has occurred in all deposit products with money market and DDAs comprising the majority of the increase. This record level of deposits was driven by the industry wide trend of clients seeking the security of bank deposits; however, we believe our improved products and pricing, enhanced client service, and the Live Solid. Bank Solid. brand advertising specifically assisted us in attracting new clients and expanding existing relationships. Further, through an intense focus on improved execution, we have been successful in improving client satisfaction, acquisition, and retention. Additionally, as a result of the increase in these core deposits, we have been able to reduce our exposure to foreign deposits and higher cost brokered deposits by $2.5 billion, or 31.0%, since December 31, 2008 as well as higher cost long term debt by $9.3 billion, or 34.8%, over this same period. While we witnessed solid growth in core deposits during 2009, it has moderated during the latter part of the year, causing us to believe that it may further moderate going forward as the economy improves. Despite the moderation in total deposit growth, the mix of deposits continues to shift towards lower cost transaction accounts. During the year, average loans declined $4.4 billion, or 3.5%, and total loans at December 31, 2009 were down 10.5% from prior year. Our aggressive effort to reduce exposure to construction lending, as evidenced by the 44.7% decline in average balances versus the previous year, was a primary driver of the decline in average loans during the year. In addition, we reduced our exposure to residential real estate loans as evidenced by the $3.0 billion, or 9.4%, decrease in average residential real estate loans in 2009. The decline in the remaining loan categories is primarily due to weak loan demand as a result of the economic environment, which has caused clients to be focused on capital preservation and an allocation of excess funds for debt reduction. The trend of declining line of credit utilization among our mid size and larger corporate clients continued due to improved access to capital markets and lower working capital needs. We remain focused on extending credit to qualified borrowers as businesses and consumers work through the current economic downturn. Despite the reduction in our overall loan portfolio, new loan originations, commitments, and renewals of commercial and consumer loans were approximately $90 billion during 2009, with residential mortgage originations leading the way. 23 Table of Contents We increased our securities available for sale holdings during the year, resulting in a 44.6% increase in the year end balance compared to prior year end. This increase was led by the increase in our holdings of U.S. Treasury and agency securities by over $7 billion in light of the increased liquidity from higher deposits and lower loan balances. In addition, agency MBS increased by over $1 billion. This increase was related to sales during the year where we had the opportunity to manage the portfolios duration by selling bonds at a gain and repositioning the MBS portfolio into securities that we believe have higher relative value. As a result of the securities sales, we realized $98.0 million in net gains during the year. FTE net interest income was $4.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $4.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. FTE total revenue was down 9.9% to $8.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 as a result of soft revenue generation in certain areas and substantially lower securities gains compared to the prior year. Net interest margin in 2009 decreased six basis points when compared to the prior year primarily as a result of decreased loan pricing that outpaced the decreased deposit pricing during the year. Total noninterest expense increased by $683.4 million, or 11.6%, in 2009, primarily driven by the $751.2 million non cash goodwill impairment charge recognized during the year. Provision for credit losses was $4.1 billion for the year ended 2009, an increase of $1.6 billion from the prior year. The provision for loan losses was $769.0 million higher than net charge offs of $3.2 billion for the year. The ALLL increased $769.0 million, or 32.7%, from December 31, 2008 and was 2.76% of total loans not carried at fair value compared to 1.86% as of December 31, 2008. Net charge offs to average loans were 2.67% for the year ended 2009 compared to 1.25% for 2008. Nonperforming assets rose during the year to $6.1 billion at year end compared to $4.5 billion at the end of last year. The average shareholders equity to average total assets ratio and the tangible equity to tangible assets ratio both improved from 10.58% and 8.46% at December 31, 2008 to 12.70% and 9.66%, respectively, at December 31, 2009. We recorded $265.8 million in dividends and accretion during 2009 related to preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury under the CPP compared to $26.6 million during 2008.

Nonaccrual loans are included in average balances and income on such loans, if recognized, is recorded on a cash basis. 2Interest income includes the effects of taxable equivalent adjustments using a federal income tax rate of 35% and, where applicable, state income taxes to increase tax exempt interest income to a taxable equivalent basis. The net taxable equivalent adjustment amounts included in the above table aggregated $123.3 million, $117.5 million, and $102.7 million for the three years ended December 31, respectively. 3 The Company obtained derivative instruments to manage the Companys interest sensitivity position that increased net interest income $488.2 million and $180.7 million in the periods ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively and decreased net interest income $25.6 million in the period ended December 31, 2007. 4The net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income FTE by average total earning assets. 25 Table of Contents Table 2 Analysis of Changes in Net Interest Income 1 2009 Compared to 2008 Increase(Decrease) Due to 2008 Compared to 2007 Increase(Decrease) Due to (Dollars in millions on a taxable equivalent basis) Volume Rate Net Volume Rate Net Interest Income Loans: Real estate 1 4 family ($183.4 ) ($98.8 ) ($282.2 ) ($12.3 ) ($19.3 ) ($31.6 ) Real estate construction (204.7 ) (173.1 ) (377.8 ) (177.6 ) (257.6 ) (435.2 ) Real estate home equity lines 24.4 (298.0 ) (273.6 ) 85.2 (376.5 ) (291.3 ) Real estate commercial 83.0 (233.2 ) (150.2 ) 75.9 (173.8 ) (97.9 ) Commercial FTE2 (88.9 ) (181.1 ) (270.0 ) 236.9 (349.9 ) (113.0 ) Credit card 5.4 33.5 38.9 14.5 2.4 16.9 Consumer direct 28.7 (75.8 ) (47.1 ) 21.8 (72.5 ) (50.7 ) Consumer indirect (42.4 ) 0.7 (41.7 ) (47.5 ) 11.8 (35.7 ) Nonaccrual and restructured 20.4 (9.6 ) 10.8 22.4 (14.3 ) 8.1 Securities available for sale: Taxable 323.7 (264.7 ) 59.0 117.3 (25.4 ) 91.9 Tax exempt 2 (2.1 ) (6.2 ) (8.3 ) (0.3 ) 1.2 0.9 Funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell (7.3 ) (15.6 ) (22.9 ) 12.5 (36.2 ) (23.7 ) Loans held for sale 6.8 (64.0 ) (57.2 ) (327.0 ) (52.1 ) (379.1 ) Interest bearing deposits (0.6 ) (0.6 ) 0.1 (0.6 ) (0.5 ) Interest earning trading assets (125.0 ) (64.0 ) (189.0 ) (203.0 ) (149.8 ) (352.8 ) Total interest income (161.4 ) (1,450.5 ) (1,611.9 ) (181.1 ) (1,512.6 ) (1,693.7 ) Interest Expense NOW accounts 27.2 (181.0 ) (153.8 ) 23.3 (244.2 ) (220.9 ) Money market accounts 89.0 (294.5 ) (205.5 ) 95.7 (197.9 ) (102.2 ) Savings (0.4 ) (5.7 ) (6.1 ) (8.7 ) (30.6 ) (39.3 ) Consumer time (2.0 ) (158.1 ) (160.1 ) (7.6 ) (117.5 ) (125.1 ) Other time 32.3 (128.7 ) (96.4 ) 6.0 (113.7 ) (107.7 ) Brokered deposits (150.1 ) (87.2 ) (237.3 ) (251.1 ) (218.6 ) (469.7 ) Foreign deposits (38.3 ) (39.9 ) (78.2 ) (63.5 ) (155.0 ) (218.5 ) Funds purchased (13.9 ) (34.3 ) (48.2 ) (27.9 ) (87.1 ) (115.0 ) Securities sold under agreements to repurchase (26.9 ) (47.7 ) (74.6 ) (44.6 ) (150.1 ) (194.7 ) Interest bearing trading liabilities (11.6 ) 4.5 (7.1 ) 12.3 (0.7 ) 11.6 Other short term borrowings (5.7 ) (34.7 ) (40.4 ) 22.8 (88.7 ) (65.9 ) Long term debt (124.5 ) (231.5 ) (356.0 ) 109.8 (71.1 ) 38.7 Total interest expense (224.9 ) (1,238.8 ) (1,463.7 ) (133.5 ) (1,475.2 ) (1,608.7 ) Net change in net interest income $63.5 ($211.7 ) ($148.2 ) ($47.6 ) ($37.4 ) ($85.0 ) 1Changes in net interest income are attributed to either changes in average balances (volume change) or changes in average rates (rate change) for earning assets and sources of funds on which interest is received or paid. Volume change is calculated as change in volume times the previous rate, while rate change is change in rate times the previous volume. The rate/volume change, change in rate times change in volume, is allocated between volume change and rate change at the ratio each component bears to the absolute value of their total. 2Interest income includes the effects of taxable equivalent adjustments (reduced by the nondeductible portion of interest expense) using a federal income tax rate of 35% and, where applicable, state income taxes to increase tax exempt interest income to a taxable equivalent basis. Net Interest Income/Margin FTE net interest income was $4,589.0 million during 2009, a decrease of $148.2 million, or 3.1%, from 2008. Net interest margin decreased six basis points from 3.10% in 2008 to 3.04% in 2009, while average earning assets decreased $1.8 billion, or 1.2%. Earning asset yields declined 100 basis points from 5.53% to 4.53%, and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities over the same period decreased 103 basis points. Throughout 2009, we experienced an upward net interest margin trend, from 2.87% in the first quarter to 3.27% in the fourth quarter. The combination of liabilities re pricing at lower rates and an increase in client deposits, as well as improved deposit mix, enabled a reduction in higher cost sources of funding while loans and earning assets declined more rapidly, offsetting some of the benefit. Loan and deposit pricing are the primary opportunities to generate additional margin expansion in 2010, while the primary risks relate to the possibility that nonperforming assets will rise and loan demand will remain sluggish. Our current expectation for net interest margin in the near term is for some compression. A full quarters impact of holding $5 billion in U.S. Treasury securities and the first quarter consolidation of selected off balance sheet entities, are expected to have a small negative impact on margin which may be partially offset by improvements in deposit pricing. Additionally, we expect to experience a seasonal decline in deposits. 26 Table of Contents Average earning assets decreased $1.8 billion, or 1.2%, from 2008. Average loans decreased $4.4 billion, or 3.5%. The decline is attributable to a $4.8 billion, or 44.7%, reduction in real estate construction loans, a $3.0 billion, or 9.4%, reduction in real estate 1 4 family residential loans, and a $1.7 billion, or 4.4%, reduction in commercial loans. The decreases in real estate construction, 1 4 family residential loans and commercial loans were partially offset by increases in the commercial real estate loan portfolio of $1.6 billion, or 11.5%, as well as a $3.0 billion, or 104.8%, increase in nonperforming and restructured loans. To offset the decline in loans, average securities available for sale increased $6.7 billion, or 50.6%, from 2008 due to a $4.6 billion increase in MBS and a $2.1 billion increase in U.S. Treasury and agency securities. Yields on average earning assets declined 100 basis points from 2008 to 2009 driven by declines in market interest rates. Our loan portfolio yielded 4.66% for the year 2009, down 95 basis points from 2008. A large percentage of our commercial loans are variable rate indexed to one month LIBOR. In order to manage interest rate risk, we utilized receive fixed/pay floating interest rate swaps to hedge interest income in a declining rate environment. That interest rate risk management strategy along with increased swap related notional balances ($8.6 billion of additional floating rate commercial loans were swapped to fixed rate) and lower rates in 2009 resulted in swap income increasing from $229.0 million in 2008 to $539.5 million in 2009. While the underlying loans swapped to fixed are classified as both commercial real estate and commercial, all of the swap income is recorded as interest on commercial loans. The classification of all swap income in the commercial loan category, combined with the increased notional value of received fixed swaps and the declining balance of commercial loans, produced a significantly smaller decline in reported commercial loan yields as compared to underlying rate indices. In addition, loan related interest income was augmented in 2009 by our loan pricing initiatives. Average interest earning trading assets declined by $3.8 billion, or 49.3%. Despite the decline in trading assets, we continue to use this portfolio as part of our overall asset/liability management; however, the size and nature of trading assets will fluctuate over various economic cycles. Average LHFS were $5.2 billion during 2009, an increase of 2.4% from the prior year. The increase in LHFS occurred as a result of increased mortgage loan production. Average consumer and commercial deposits increased $11.8 billion, or 11.7%, in 2009 compared to 2008. This growth consisted of increases of $5.3 billion, or 20.0%, in money market accounts, $3.3 billion, or 15.8%, in demand deposits, $2.5 billion, or 12.0%, in NOW accounts, and $819.1 million, or 2.8%, in time deposits. Deposit growth was the result of marketing campaigns, competitive pricing, and clients increased preference for the security of insured deposit products. However, a portion of the deposit growth is related to the industry wide flight to the safety of insured deposits and reduced client demand for sweep accounts due to the low interest rate environment. The overall growth in consumer and commercial deposits allowed for a reduction in other funding sources, including $4.8 billion of brokered deposits, $3.8 billion of foreign deposits, and $2.8 billion of long term debt. Overall, average interest bearing liabilities declined $7.0 billion, or 5.4%. We continue to pursue deposit growth initiatives to increase our presence in specific markets within our footprint. Competition for deposits remains strong, and as a result, deposit pricing pressure remains across our footprint. Despite these challenging market conditions, we have used a combination of regional and product specific pricing initiatives to balance margin and volume, while still growing our average deposit balances. We continue to believe that we are also benefiting from a number of actions taken to improve marketplace awareness and client service. The Live Solid. Bank Solid. branding campaign continues to be very well received and we believe it is helping drive client acquisition. We also continue to refine pricing tactics to be competitive while maintaining deposit rates that are attractive to our clients. Notwithstanding these deposit generation successes, some of the deposit growth is due to seasonality and the economic environment. Deposit balances are expected to decline modestly in the first quarter related to seasonality, and further over time as the economy improves. During 2009, the interest rate environment was characterized by lower rates, yet a steeper yield curve versus 2008. More specifically, the Fed funds target rate averaged 0.25%, a decrease of 183 basis points, the Prime rate averaged 3.25%, a decrease of 183 basis points, one month LIBOR averaged 0.33%, a decrease of 235 basis points, five year swaps averaged 2.65%, a decrease of 104 basis points, and ten year swaps averaged 3.44%, a decrease of 80 basis points. Rates paid on deposits, our most significant funding source, tend to track movements in one month LIBOR, while our fixed rate loan yields tend to track movements in the five year swap rate. However, due to the competition and customer demands surrounding deposits, deposit pricing has reached an effective floor in some products, as evidenced by the 92 basis point decline in the average rate paid on interest bearing consumer and commercial deposits versus the 235 basis point decline noted in one month LIBOR. Foregone interest income from nonperforming loans reduced net interest margin by 21 basis points for 2009 as average nonaccrual loans increased $2.3 billion, or 82.7% from 2008.

In addition, mark to market valuation losses on our public debt and related hedges carried at fair value were recognized in 2009 while mark to market valuation gains were recognized in 2008. The decrease in noninterest income was partially offset by higher mortgage related income as a result of increased mortgage production in 2009 and an impairment charge recorded on our MSRs carried at LOCOM during 2008 which was partially recovered in 2009. Additionally, in 2008, we recorded valuation losses related to our expected purchase of ARS and mark to market write downs related to illiquid securities and warehouse loans carried at market that partially offset the overall decline in noninterest income. Combined mortgage related income increased $746.4 million compared to 2008. Mortgage servicing related income increased $541.7 million compared to 2008, primarily due to a $199.2 million recovery of impairment on the MSRs carried at LOCOM in 2009 compared to $370.0 million in impairment charges recorded during 2008 on our MSRs portfolio. This increase was partially offset by higher amortization of MSRs due to an increase in prepayments, as well as a decline in the fair value of MSRs. Mortgage production related income increased $204.7 million, or 119.4%, compared to 2008, primarily due to a $13.7 billion, or 37.6%, increase in production volume that was partially offset by a $346.1 million increase in mortgage repurchase related losses compared to 2008. The increase in production volume during 2009 was due in large part to increased refinancing activity, which we do not expect to remain at this level in the near term. Mortgage repurchase related losses increased from $98.2 million in 2008 to $444.3 million in 2009 as a result of increased repurchase requests from government sponsored agencies. As discussed in more detail in Note 18, Reinsurance Arrangements and Guarantees, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we provide standard representations and warranties when loans are sold to third party investors. If it is later determined that such representations have been breached, the investor will request that we either purchase the nonperforming loan or reimburse the investor for the loss incurred. Although mortgage repurchase reserves are established at the time of sale, actual credit losses have exceeded the original estimates and we are recognizing higher losses. We update our loss estimate by analyzing the population of loans sold by vintage and product in relation to our recent experience and expected repurchase levels and as a result, the reserve for the repurchase of mortgage loans has increased. A shift in the volume of repurchase requests occurred during the course of 2009 from loans originated and sold prior to 2007. During the latter half of 2009, the majority of our repurchase requests pertained to loans originated and sold in 2007. We believe ultimate losses on newer vintages, specifically 2008 and later, may be lower than older vintages. The elimination of Alt A loan products, tighter credit and underwriting guidelines, and enhanced processes have reduced the risk profile and, therefore, the repurchase risk exposure of loans originated and sold since 2008. In addition, loans sold in recent years have lower original loan to values and are subject to less home price depreciation which should reduce loss severities. While mortgage repurchase related losses are expected to remain elevated during 2010, the shift towards loans originated and sold 28 Table of Contents in more recent years gives us reason to believe that successful repurchase requests by investors and loss severities will decline. The level of losses and reserves during 2010 are dependent primarily upon the continued shift in request volume to newer vintages and no significant deterioration in the overall asset quality of the previously sold loans as indicated by borrower payment performance. Net securities gains of $1.1 billion for 2008 included a $732.2 million gain on the sale and contribution of a portion of our investment in Coke common stock in addition to a $413.1 million gain on the sale of MBS held in conjunction with our risk management strategies associated with economically hedging the value of MSRs. These gains were partially offset by the recognition through earnings of $83.8 million in charges related to certain ABS that were determined in 2008 to be other than temporarily impaired. For additional information on transactions related to our holdings in Coke common stock, refer to Investment in Common Shares of The Coca Cola Company within this MD&A. During 2009, we recorded net securities gains of $98.0 million which included a $90.2 million gain on the sale of approximately $9.2 billion of agency MBS. These sales were associated with repositioning the MBS portfolio into securities we believe have higher relative value. Net securities gains also included $20.0 million of credit related OTTI losses on securities with a fair value of approximately $310.6 million, consisting primarily of purchased and retained private residential MBS. In May 2009, we sold 3.2 million of our Visa Class B shares and entered into a derivative related to such shares. We recognized a gain of $112.1 million in connection with these transactions. During the first quarter of 2008, Visa completed its IPO, and upon the closing, approximately 2 million of our Class B shares were mandatorily redeemed for $86.3 million, which was recorded as a gain in noninterest income. See Note 18, Reinsurance Arrangements and Guarantees, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Visa transaction. Gain on sale of businesses consists of an $89.4 million gain on the sale of our remaining interest in Lighthouse Investment Partners during the first quarter of 2008, an $81.8 million gain on the sale of TransPlatinum, our fuel card and fleet management subsidiary, in the third quarter of 2008, a $29.6 million gain on the sale of First Mercantile, a retirement plan services subsidiary, during the second quarter of 2008, and a $2.7 million loss on the sale of a majority interest in ZCI during the fourth quarter of 2008. Trust and investment management income decreased $105.8 million, or 17.9%, compared to 2008, primarily due to lower fee income attributable to the decline in the equity markets, lower interest rates, and a decline in income associated with the sale of First Mercantile on May 30, 2008. Retail investment services income decreased $71.3 million, or 24.7%, compared to 2008, due to lower annuity sales and reduced brokerage activity and client asset balances. Service charges on deposit accounts decreased $55.7 million, or 6.2%, compared to 2008, as a result of a reduction in consumer spending and lower non sufficient fund fees. We expect to comply with regulatory changes made by the Federal Reserve and are monitoring potential legislative proposals which, should they become effective, have the potential to affect our ability to generate certain types of fee income in future periods. Trading account profits/(losses) and commissions decreased $78.9 million compared to 2008, primarily due to $153.0 million in mark to market losses on our public debt and related hedges carried at fair value during 2009 compared with gains of $431.7 million in 2008. The losses during 2009 were caused by an improvement in our credit spreads. These losses were partially offset by $255.9 million in market valuation losses recorded during 2008 on our investments in certain illiquid ABS compared to small gains in 2009 as our exposure to these investments has been substantially reduced through sales, maturities, and write downs. Additionally, during 2008, we recorded a $177.7 million loss related to our expected repurchase of certain ARS. Capital markets related trading income increased during 2009, compared to the same periods in 2008, due to improved equity derivatives and bond trading offset by decreased fixed income derivative performance. Investment banking income increased $35.5 million, or 15.0%, compared to 2008, due to improved bond origination fees, loan syndication fees, equity underwriting, and direct financing revenues. Other income decreased $76.2 million, or 31.8%, compared to 2008. The decline was primarily due to losses recognized on certain private equity investments and leases in 2009 compared to gains in 2008 and a recovery from the resolution of a litigation matter recognized in 2008. During 2008, we completed sale/leaseback transactions, consisting of 152 branch properties and various individual office buildings. In total, we sold and concurrently leased back $201.9 million in land and buildings with associated accumulated depreciation of $110.3 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized $37.0 million of the gain immediately while the remaining $160.3 million in gains were deferred and will be recognized ratably over the expected term of the respective leases, predominantly as an offset to net occupancy expense. 29 Table of Contents Table 4 Noninterest Expense Year Ended December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Employee compensation $2,257.5 $2,327.2 $2,329.0 Employee benefits 542.4 434.0 441.2 Total personnel expense 2,799.9 2,761.2 2,770.2 Amortization/impairment of goodwill/intangible assets 806.8 121.3 96.7 Outside processing and software 579.3 492.6 410.9 Net occupancy expense 356.8 347.3 351.2 Regulatory assessments 302.2 54.9 22.4 Credit and collection services 259.4 156.4 112.5 Other real estate expense 243.7 104.7 15.8 Equipment expense 171.9 203.2 206.5 Marketing and customer development 151.5 372.2 195.0 Mortgage reinsurance 114.9 179.9 0.2 Operating losses 99.5 446.2 134.0 Postage and delivery 83.9 90.1 93.2 Communications 67.4 69.4 79.0 Consulting and legal 57.5 58.6 101.2 Other staff expense 50.8 70.3 132.5 Operating supplies 41.0 44.3 48.7 Net loss on debt extinguishment 39.4 11.7 9.8 Visa litigation 7.0 (33.5 ) 76.9 Merger expense 13.4 Other expense 329.5 314.8 364.4 Total noninterest expense $6,562.4 $5,879.0 $5,221.1 Noninterest Expense Noninterest expense increased by $683.4 million, or 11.6%, in 2009 compared to 2008. The increase was primarily due to the $751.2 million non cash goodwill impairment charge recorded in the first quarter of 2009 compared to a $45.0 million impairment charge related to a specific customer intangible asset recognized in the second quarter of 2008. Excluding the impact of the goodwill and customer intangible impairment charges, noninterest expense decreased by $22.8 million, or 0.4%, in 2009 compared to 2008. This slight decrease in noninterest expense (excluding impairment charges) resulted from a decline in credit related expenses and marketing and customer development. Offsetting these decreases in 2009 were increases in personnel expense, outside processing and software, regulatory assessments, Visa litigation expense, debt extinguishment costs, and other economically cyclical expenses. Amortization/impairment of intangible assets increased $685.5 million in 2009. The primary driver of the increase was a non cash goodwill impairment charge of $751.2 million recorded in the first quarter of 2009 related to the Household Lending, Commercial Real Estate, and Affordable Housing businesses. The impairment resulted from continued deterioration in real estate markets and the macro economy, which placed downward pressure on the fair value of our mortgage and commercial real estate related businesses, and caused the significant decline in our market capitalization during the first quarter. The impairment charge had no impact on our regulatory capital and tangible equity ratios. In the second quarter of 2008, we recorded an impairment charge of $45.0 million related to a specific customer intangible asset. Credit related costs include operating losses, credit and collection services, other real estate expense and mortgage reinsurance expense. These expenses decreased $169.7 million, or 19.1%, from 2008. Operating losses decreased $346.7 million, or 77.7%, compared to 2008 primarily due to a change in classification related to borrower misrepresentation and claim denials. Prior to the first quarter of 2009, borrower misrepresentation and mortgage insurance claim denials were charged to operating losses. Beginning in 2009, we began recording these losses as charge offs first against the previously established reserves for fraud losses and then against the ALLL, where the estimated reserves related to these loans are now included. See additional discussion related to these losses in the Allowance for Credit Losses section of this MD&A. Included in 2008 was a $206.9 million reserve recorded for borrower misrepresentations and insurance claim denials. Other real estate expense increased $139.0 million, or 132.8%, in 2009 compared to 2008. This increase was due to a $129.1 30 Table of Contents million increase in valuation related losses on OREO properties and a $40.4 million increase in property expenses, partially offset by net gains of $30.4 million on the sale of properties. Mortgage reinsurance reserve expense, which pertains to our mortgage reinsurance subsidiary, Twin Rivers, decreased from $179.9 million in 2008 to $114.9 million in 2009 as a result of losses reaching or approaching our loss limits within the insurance contracts in 2009. Twin Rivers loss exposure arises from third party mortgage insurers transferring a portion of their first loss exposure when losses by mortgage origination year exceed certain thresholds. Credit and collection services expense increased $103.0 million, or 65.9%, in 2009 compared to 2008 due to increased collection and loss mitigation activity. Marketing and customer development expense decreased $220.7 million, or 59.3%, in 2009, compared to the same period in 2008. The decrease was due to a reduction in corporate advertising and donations expense as a result of the $183.4 million contribution of Coke stock to the SunTrust Foundation made in the third quarter of 2008 and the related impact of reducing our ongoing contributions. Most of the remaining decrease related to a decline in customer development and promotion expenses. Personnel expenses in 2009 increased by $38.7 million, or 1.4%, from the same period in 2008. The slight increase in personnel expense is attributable to pension costs increasing from $23.9 million in 2008 to $140.9 million in 2009 resulting from an increase in the pension obligation due to 2009 market valuation assumptions. The increase in pension costs were offset by a decline in salaries expense of $69.7 million from 2008 to 2009 reflecting a reduction of approximately 1,332 full time equivalent employees since December 31, 2008 to 28,001 as of December 31, 2009. Personnel expense was also impacted by an increase in incentive compensation primarily related to improved performance in certain businesses. Outside processing and software increased $86.7 million, or 17.6%, compared to 2008 primarily due to our contracting with a third party in the third quarter of 2008 to provide certain check and related processing operations. Regulatory assessments expense grew from $54.9 million in 2008 to $302.2 million in 2009 as a result of higher FDIC insurance premium rates and increased deposit balances, as the FDIC sought to replenish the insurance fund. Also contributing to the increase in 2009 was the FDIC special assessment recorded in the second quarter of 2009. The special assessment was a charge that the FDIC levied on all banks to assist in replenishing their reserves. Our portion of that assessment was $78.2 million. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we prepaid three years of expected FDIC premiums in accordance with a newly enacted regulatory requirement. The total premium of $925 million will be amortized into expense over the next three years. The assessment will also increase in 2011 as a result of a three basis point increase which is effective January 1, 2011. Other future assessments or taxes may occur on financial institutions as a result of legislative developments and the support of the current administration. Visa litigation expense increased by $40.5 million in 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. This increase is related to a $53.5 million reversal, during 2008, of a portion of the accrued liability associated with the Visa litigation as a result of the funding by Visa of the litigation escrow account, partly offset by accruals based on the resolution of certain Visa related matters. Net loss on debt extinguishment increased from $11.7 million in 2008 to $39.4 million in 2009. The increase resulted primarily from early termination fees for FHLB advances repaid during the fourth quarter of 2009 resulting in a $23.5 million loss, net of gains on the early extinguishment of other long term debt. These advance terminations were part of the initiative we took to take advantage of the strong liquidity position we currently benefit from to repay wholesale funding and improve margin. Other noninterest expense increased $14.7 million, or 4.7%, in 2009 compared to 2008. The increase was due primarily to write downs of $46.8 million related to affordable housing properties in 2009 as compared to $19.9 million of related charges in 2008. Also contributing to the increase was a $10.7 million increase in unfunded commitment expenses compared to 2008, primarily related to increased loss exposure to unfunded commitments extended to a few large corporate clients and some migration in risk ratings. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009, we began recording expense related to unfunded commitment reserves in the provision for credit losses instead of noninterest expense. The expense which was included in the provision for credit losses during the fourth quarter of 2009 amounted to $57.2 million. Partially offsetting the increase were gains from the current year sale of corporate assets and the successful resolution of specific contingent items in 2009. Other operating expenses remain well controlled as a result of our ongoing commitment to improving efficiency. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes includes both federal and state income taxes. In 2009, the provision for income taxes was a benefit of $898.8 million, compared to a tax benefit of $67.3 million in 2008. The provision represents a negative 36.5% effective tax rate for 2009 compared to a negative 9.2% effective tax rate for 2008. The 2009 effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the pre tax loss and further increased by net favorable permanent tax items such as tax exempt interest income, federal tax credits and the release of unrecognized tax benefits related to the completion of audit examinations by 31 Table of Contents several taxing authorities during 2009. The tax benefit was reduced by a goodwill impairment, a significant portion of which was non tax deductible. The 2008 effective tax rate included a discrete tax benefit related to the release of the deferred tax liability of approximately $65.8 million (net of valuation allowance) in connection with the contribution of 3.6 million shares of Coke common stock to the SunTrust Foundation.

The new presentation presents exposure to industries as a result of repayment risk of the loan and allows for better comparability with industry peers who use a similar presentation. As a result of the new presentation, December 31, 2008 balances have been modified from the prior year presentation to reflect industry repayment risk. Groupings are loans in aggregate greater than $1 billion as of December 31. 32 Table of Contents Loans Total loans as of December 31, 2009 were $113.7 billion, a decrease of $13.3 billion, or 10.5%, from December 31, 2008. The quarterly decline in total loans was $3.1 billion (December 31, 2008 to March 31, 2009); $1.1 billion (March 31, 2009 to June 30, 2009); $6.3 billion (June 30, 2009 to September 30, 2009); and $2.8 billion (September 30, 2009 to December 31, 2009). The decrease was primarily driven by reduced loan demand in the commercial portfolio, as well as a reduction in our exposure to residential real estate, especially construction related. The portfolio is diversified by product, client, and geography throughout our footprint, and has relatively low exposure to unsecured consumer loan products. Residential mortgages were $30.8 billion, or 27.1% of the total loan portfolio, as of December 31, 2009, down $1.3 billion, or 4.0%, from December 31, 2008. The residential mortgage portfolio is comprised of core mortgages (prime first liens), prime second lien mortgages, home equity loans, lot loans, and Alt A first and second mortgages. There are virtually no option (negative amortizing) ARMs or subprime loans in the core portfolio. The core mortgage portfolio was $23.9 billion, or 21.0% of total loans, as of December 31, 2009, and includes $16.6 billion in jumbo mortgages, of which $13.9 billion are ARMs. The remaining $7.3 billion of non jumbo loans includes $3.5 billion in ARMs and $0.9 billion in agency eligible fixed rate loans. The agency eligible fixed rate loans are effectively guaranteed by FNMA through a long term standby commitment in which FNMA has committed to purchase at par those loans that become delinquent. The core first mortgage portfolio included $12.1 billion in interest only ARMs; however, the interest only period is typically ten years, unlike many interest only products in the market which have short interest only periods with early reset dates. The weighted average LTV at origination of the core mortgage portfolio was approximately 75%. The core mortgage portfolio includes approximately $1.0 billion of commercial purpose loans secured by residential real estate. Prime second lien mortgages were $2.9 billion, or 2.6% of total loans, as of December 31, 2009 with $2.7 billion insured through third party pool level insurance. We consider the insurance to be integral to the loan and include probable insurance proceeds in our analysis of the collectability of the loans. Total claims paid during 2009 and 2008 under the mortgage insurance arrangements were $111.7 million and $43.8 million, respectively. Under the insurance arrangement, we are exposed to cumulative losses by vintage pool from 5% to 8%, as well as cumulative losses exceeding 10%. Due to deterioration in delinquency rates, most of the pools have reached the first tier insurance stop loss limit. As of December 31, 2009, we had fully reserved for our exposure in the 5% to 8% loss layer, and we have also reserved for estimated losses above the 10% stop loss. In addition, we continue to experience claim denials on certain loans due to borrower misrepresentation and loan documentation issues, which may impact the recognition of uninsured losses. See Allowance for Credit Losses section of this MD&A for a discussion of losses related to borrower misrepresentation and denied claims. Home equity loans comprise $2.0 billion, or 1.7% of total loans, as of December 31, 2009 and have a 76% weighted average combined LTV at origination. Approximately 67% of the home equity loans are in a second lien position. Lot loans were $1.1 billion, or approximately 1.0% of total loans, as of December 31, 2009. Alt A first lien loans were $0.7 billion, or approximately 0.6% of total loans, as of December 31, 2009. Alt A second lien loans totaled $0.2 billion. Alt A firsts and seconds and lot loans have declined to less than 2% of the total loan portfolio. The home equity line portfolio was $16.0 billion, or 14.0% of total loans, as of December 31, 2009, which is down $501.9 million, or 3.1%, from December 31, 2008. The portfolio has a weighted average combined LTV at origination of approximately 73%. Third party originated home equity lines continued to perform poorly, however, only 10% of home equity line balances were originated through that channel. We have eliminated origination of home equity products through third party channels, eliminated greater than 85% of LTV originations, implemented market specific LTV guidelines in certain declining markets, and have been reducing line commitments in higher risk situations. We continue to enhance our collections and default management processes. From a risk management perspective, there is virtually no line availability remaining in higher risk segments (i.e., lines originated by third parties and lines in Florida exceeding 80% current LTV). Overall, this portfolio displayed stable asset quality metrics; however, the portfolio continues to under perform. The commercial loan portfolio decreased $8.5 billion, or 20.8%, from December 31, 2008 and comprises 28.6% of total loans at December 31, 2009. The reduction in the commercial portfolio resulted primarily from a continued trend of declining line of credit utilization among our mid size and larger corporate clients due to lower working capital needs and enhanced access to the capital markets. The pace of decline did slow during the fourth quarter. The portfolio is diversified by industry, geography, client segment, and collateral; and continues to perform reasonably well overall. The commercial real estate portfolio was $15.1 billion, or 13.3% of total loans, an increase of $117.3 million, or 0.8%, from December 31, 2008. The increase was attributable to the natural migration of loans maturing from the construction real estate loan portfolio into mini perm financing. This portfolio includes both owner occupied and income producing collateral, with almost 60% being owner occupied properties. The commercial real estate portfolio, including both owner occupied and investor owned, is performing satisfactorily overall. Of the total commercial real estate portfolio, approximately 81% are 33 Table of Contents income properties such as office buildings, warehouses and retail buildings. Given conditions in the commercial real estate market, we anticipate continued stress and credit losses in this portfolio; however, we expect it to perform relatively well given its composition and underwriting. The construction portfolio was $6.6 billion, or 5.8% of total loans, at December 31, 2009, a decrease of $3.2 billion, or 32.6%, from December 31, 2008. The construction portfolio consists of $0.8 billion of residential construction to perm loans, $1.2 billion of residential construction loans, $1.9 billion of commercial construction loans, $1.8 billion of acquisition and development loans, and $0.9 billion of undeveloped land loans. We have reduced the level of risk in the construction portfolio by aggressively managing our construction exposure. This reduction is evident from the $7.1 billion, or 51.8%, decline in outstanding balances since December 2007. Commercial related construction loans represent 28.5% of the total construction portfolio and credit performance remains acceptable overall. Performance of residential construction related loans remained weak; however, during the fourth quarter 30 days + delinquencies declined. We continue to be proactive in our credit monitoring and management processes to provide early warning for problem loans in the portfolio. For example, we use an expanded liquidity and contingency analysis to provide a thorough view of borrower capacity and their ability to service obligations in a steep market decline. We also have strict limits and exposure caps on specific projects and borrowers for risk diversification. Due to the lack of new construction projects and the completion of many that were previously started, the aggregate amount of interest reserves that we are obligated to fund is down from prior periods. The indirect consumer portfolio was $6.5 billion, or 5.7% of total loans, at December 31, 2009, up $23.5 million, or 0.4%, from December 31, 2008. The increase is partially attributable to new vehicle sales triggered by the federal government Cash for Clunkers incentive program. This portfolio is experiencing a reduced level of charge offs compared to 2008 and is benefiting from lower fuel prices, stabilized used car values, and natural turnover into newly underwritten vintages. The direct consumer portfolio was $5.1 billion, or 4.5% of total loans, at December 31, 2009, down $21.5 million, or 0.4%, from December 31, 2008. Student loans, which are mostly government supported, made up $3.1 billion, or approximately 61% of the direct consumer portfolio. This portfolio also includes loans and lines to individuals for personal or family uses. The increase in LHFS of $637.7 million, or 15.8%, is due primarily to higher levels of mortgage loan originations.

Previously, this calculation included nonperforming loans measured at fair value or the lower of cost or market. The Company believes this is an improved method of calculation due to the fact that the allowance for loan losses relates solely to the loans measured at amortized cost. Nonperforming loans measured at fair value or the lower of cost or market that have been excluded from the 2007 calculation were $171.5 million, which increased the calculation approximately 12 basis points as of December 31, 2007. Amounts excluded in years prior to 2007 were immaterial and resulted in no basis point change in the respective calculation. 3 Prior to 2009, borrower misrepresentation fraud and denied insurance claim losses were recorded as operating losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss). These credit related operating losses totaled $160.3 million and $78.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Prior to 2007, credit related operating losses were immaterial. During 2009, credit related operating losses charged off against previously established reserves within other liabilities totaled $194.9 million. 4 Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009, SunTrust recorded the provision for unfunded commitments of $57.2 million within the provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss). Including the provision for unfunded commitments for the fourth quarter of 2009, the provision for credit losses was $4.1 billion for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009. Considering the immateriality of this provision prior to the fourth quarter of 2009, the provision for unfunded commitments remains classified within other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss). 5 This ratio is calculated using the allowance for loan and lease losses. 35 Table of Contents Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses consists of the ALLL as well as the reserve for unfunded commitments. We continuously monitor the credit quality of our loan portfolio and maintain an ALLL sufficient to absorb current probable and estimable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. We are committed to the timely recognition of problem loans and maintaining an appropriate and adequate ALLL. In addition to the review of credit quality through ongoing credit review processes, we employ a variety of modeling and estimation techniques to measure credit risk and construct an appropriate ALLL. Numerous asset quality measures, both quantitative and qualitative, are considered in estimating the ALLL. Our ALLL Committee has the responsibility of affirming the allowance methodology and assessing significant risk elements in order to determine the appropriate level of allowance for the inherent losses in the loan portfolio at the point in time being reviewed. The multiple factors evaluated include internal risk ratings, net charge off trends, collateral values and geographic location, borrower FICO scores, delinquency rates, nonperforming and restructured loans, origination channel, product mix, underwriting practices, and economic trends. These credit quality factors are incorporated into various loss estimation models and analytical tools utilized in our ALLL process and or are qualitatively considered in evaluating the overall reasonableness of the ALLL. The factors that have the greatest quantitative impact on the estimated ALLL tend to be internal risk rating trends, recent net charge off trends, delinquency rates, and loss severity levels (i.e., collateral values). Other factors such as nonperforming or restructured loans tend to have a more isolated impact on subsets of loans in the loan pools. Also impacting the ALLL is the estimated incurred loss period, which tends to be approximately one year for consumer related loans and between one and one quarter to three years for wholesale related loans. During periods of economic stress, the incurred loss period tends to contract. The ALLL process excludes loans measured at fair value as subsequent mark to market adjustments related to loans measured at fair value include a credit risk component. Starting in third quarter 2009, the ALLL includes results from a recently enhanced residential mortgage loss forecast model. The model utilizes more granular loan specific information, as well as home price index changes at the Metropolitan Statistical Area level to estimate incurred losses and loss severities. The enhanced modeling capabilities, as well as declines in the home price index, resulted in increases to average loss severity estimates related to residential mortgage loans, which partially contributed to the increase in the ALLL. At December 31, 2009, the ALLL was $3,120.0 million, which represented 2.76% of period end loans not carried at fair value. This compares with an ALLL of $2,351.0 million, or 1.86% of period end loans not carried at fair value, as of December 31, 2008. The year over year increase of $769.0 million in the ALLL is comprised of quarterly increases of $384.0 million (December 31, 2008 to March 31, 2009); $161.0 million (March 31, 2009 to June 30, 2009); $128.0 million (June 30, 2009 to September 30, 2009); and $96.0 million (September 30, 2009 to December 31, 2009) which reflects a declining trend in ALLL increases as a result of stabilizing leading asset quality indicators. The year over year increase in ALLL reflects, among other items, the current economic downturn, decreasing home prices, and higher losses in the residential and commercial real estate related portions of the loan portfolio. Future changes in the ALLL will depend significantly on credit quality indicators, which are highly influenced by the broader economy. The majority of the increase in the allowance for loan losses pertained to the residential real estate related portion of the loan portfolio and specific reserves for residential developers. In the first quarter of 2009, we began classifying losses associated with borrower misrepresentation and insurance claim denials in the ALLL. Previously, these fraud related losses were recorded in operating losses within noninterest expense. These losses are now being recorded in the ALLL since we believe that borrower credit related issues due to the deteriorating economic environment have become the predominant contributor to the losses. Realized losses on these loans are reflected as charge offs. Our ALLL framework has two basic elements: specific allowances for loans individually evaluated for impairment and a component for pools of homogeneous loans not individually evaluated. The first element of the ALLL analysis involves the estimation of allowance specific to individually evaluated impaired loans including accruing and nonaccruing restructured commercial and consumer loans. In this process, specific allowance is established for larger commercial impaired loans based on an analysis of the most probable sources of repayment, including discounted cash flows, liquidation of collateral, or the market value of the loan itself. Restructured consumer loans are also evaluated in this element of the estimate. As of December 31, 2009, the specific allowance related to commercial impaired loans individually evaluated and restructured consumer loans totaled $538.0 million, compared to $201.8 million as of December 31, 2008; $292.2 million of this increase is driven by the loan modification efforts on consumer and residential loans. Specific reserves associated with larger commercial loans individually evaluated increased $44.0 million to $193.0 million at December 31, 2009. This increase is primarily driven by deterioration in loans to residential builders. The second element of the ALLL, the general allowance for homogeneous loan pools not individually evaluated, is determined by applying allowance factors to pools of loans within the portfolio that have similar risk characteristics. The general allowance factors are determined using a baseline factor that is developed from an analysis of historical net charge off experience and expected losses. Expected losses are based on estimated probabilities of default and loss given default derived from our internal risk rating process. These baseline factors are developed and applied to the various loan pools. Adjustments may be made to baseline reserves for some of the loan pools based on an assessment of internal and external influences on credit quality not fully reflected in the historical loss or risk rating data. These influences may include elements such as changes in credit underwriting, concentration risk, macroeconomic conditions, and or recent observable asset quality trends. 36 Table of Contents We continually evaluate our ALLL methodology seeking to refine and enhance this process as appropriate, and it is likely that the methodology will continue to evolve over time. As of December 31, 2009, the general allowance totaled $2,582.0 million. This compares to a general allowance totaling $2,149.2 million as of December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily driven by declining home prices and the associated deterioration in credit quality of the residential mortgage and home equity lines of credit portfolios. Increases to the commercial related reserves were driven by higher expected loss factors. Our charge off policy meets or exceeds regulatory minimums. Losses on unsecured consumer loans are recognized at 90 days past due compared to the regulatory loss criteria of 120 days. Secured consumer loans, including residential real estate, are typically charged down to net realizable value at 120 and 180 days delinquent, depending on the collateral type, in compliance with FFIEC guidelines. Commercial loans and real estate loans are typically placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest is past due for 90 days or more unless the loan is both secured by collateral having value sufficient to discharge the debt in full and the loan is in the legal process of collection. Accordingly, secured loans may be charged down or reserves established to the estimated value of the collateral with previously accrued unpaid interest reversed. Subsequent reserves and or charge offs may be required as a result of changes in the market value of collateral or other repayment prospects. Initial reserves and or charge off amounts are based on valuation estimates derived from either appraisals, broker price opinions, or other market information. Generally, updated appraisals are received within 90 days of the foreclosure process. However, collateral values are updated and reviewed periodically based on market information from multiple sources. Net charge offs during 2009 were $3.2 billion, an increase of $1.7 billion from 2008. Net charge offs to average loans ratio was 2.67% and 1.25% as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in net charge offs reflects the effects of the housing crisis and related economic downturn. The largest increases were seen in residential mortgage ($700.6 million), commercial ($377.8 million), real estate construction ($307.7 million) and home equity lines ($251.5 million). We do not originate subprime consumer real estate loans; however lower residential real estate values and recessionary economic conditions have affected borrowers of higher credit quality. Construction net charge offs increased due to the resolution of loan workouts in the residential builder construction portfolio. The increase in commercial net charge offs was driven by relatively fewer, but larger credits in unrelated, economically cyclical industries as well as small businesses. During the fourth quarter of 2009, net charge offs declined across most loan categories, except residential construction, which increased as a result of continued workout activities. Overall, our outlook is for elevated net charge offs in the near term, particularly related to residential mortgages associated with loans migrating to foreclosure, with the possibility that improvement could begin in the second half of 2010 depending on the strength and pace of economic recovery. The ratio of the ALLL to total nonperforming loans decreased to 58.9% as of December 31, 2009 from 61.7% as of December 31, 2008. The decline in this ratio was due to a $1.5 billion increase in nonperforming loans compared to 2008, driven primarily by increases in residential mortgage and real estate construction nonperforming loans, partially offset by the $769.0 million increase in the ALLL. The increase in nonperforming loans was driven primarily by deteriorating economic conditions and declining home values in most markets that we serve as well as home builders and commercial loans in economically sensitive businesses. We write down residential nonperforming loans to the expected value of the underlying collateral, less estimated selling costs as measured at the time the loan is 180 days past due. Declines, if any, in the collateral value of the nonperforming loans subsequent to the initial charge off are captured in the ALLL and then recognized as additional charge offs upon foreclosure. The charge off is applied against the ALLL; therefore, the relationship between ALLL and nonperforming loans becomes less correlated since the carrying value of such charged off nonperforming loans has already recognized losses that are estimated to be realized at that point in time. Another factor that impacts the ALLL to nonperforming loans ratio is that most of the nonperforming loans have some amount of net residual value; therefore, while the entire loan is classified as nonperforming, only the amount of estimated losses that has not already been charged off would be captured in the ALLL. Product mix of nonperforming loans and the related charge off practices are relevant considerations in the evaluation of ALLL coverage of nonperforming loans. The reserve for unfunded commitments was $114.9 million and $27.5 million as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. Lending commitments such as letters of credit and binding unfunded loan commitments are assessed similarly to funded wholesale loans except utilization assumptions are considered. Larger nonperforming unfunded commitments and letters of credit are individually evaluated for loss content. The $87.4 million increase in the reserve for unfunded commitments reflects the deterioration in the overall economy and credit conditions during the year. We do not anticipate this level of growth to continue during 2010 unless the economic environment deteriorates significantly. Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses includes both the provision for loan losses, relating to funded loans, as well as the provision for unfunded commitments. The provision for loan losses is the result of a detailed analysis estimating an appropriate and adequate ALLL. The provision for loan losses during 2009 totaled $4.0 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion, or 61.9%, from 2008. The increase in the provision for loan losses is primarily driven by elevated losses and increases in ALLL due to 37 Table of Contents deteriorating asset quality conditions in the residential related and wholesale portfolios. We expect net charge offs and the provision for loan losses to remain at elevated levels until we experience a sustained improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio. The amount of future growth in the ALLL is highly correlated to unemployment levels, changes in home prices within our markets, especially Florida, as well as sustained improvement in our portfolio specific credit quality indicators. See additional discussion of our expectations for future levels of credit quality in the Allowance for Credit Losses and Nonperforming Assets sections of this MD&A.

Nonperforming Assets Nonperforming assets totaled $6.1 billion as of December 31, 2009, an increase of $1.6 billion, or 36.9%, from December 31, 2008. Nonperforming loans as of December 31, 2009 were $5.4 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion, or 37.1%, from December 31, 2008. Of this total increase, nonperforming residential mortgage loans represented $868.9 million, commercial real estate loans represented $215.2 million, real estate construction loans represented $207.8 million, commercial loans represented $162.0 million, and home equity lines represented $16.4 million. We experienced slight declines in total nonperforming assets and total nonperforming loans over the last six months of 2009 as well as a decline in early stage delinquencies. The slight decline in total nonperforming loans was primarily related to commercial and construction loans, partially offset by increases in residential mortgages and commercial real estate loans. Of the $5.4 billion in nonaccruing loans, approximately 80% is related to residential real estate. Residential mortgages and home equity lines represent 55.6% of total nonaccruals. The increase in nonperforming assets is largely related to the housing correction and related decline in the values of residential real estate. The nonperforming assets are also affected by the time it takes to complete the foreclosure process, especially in judicial jurisdictions. The asset quality of the residential mortgage portfolio showed signs of stabilization and moderating growth in nonperforming loans during the fourth quarter, although on an absolute basis, this portfolio continues to perform poorly. We have noted an increase in the amount of time it takes us to foreclose upon residential real estate collateral in certain states, primarily Florida, which we believe is primarily due to delays in the judicial foreclosure process. We apply rigorous loss mitigation processes to these nonperforming loans to ensure that the asset value is preserved to the greatest extent possible; despite these efforts, it is likely we will realize additional losses on these nonperforming assets in the future. Nonperforming residential mortgages are primarily collateralized by one to four family residential properties. Approximately 84% of the nonperforming loans relate to properties in our footprint; approximately 52% of such nonperforming loans are in Florida. Approximately 75% of the nonperforming residential mortgages have been on nonaccrual status for at least six months. We have reached a point where growth in residential mortgage nonperforming loans has slowed as we are approaching the equilibrium point where the nonperforming loan outflow from foreclosures is offsetting the inflow from new nonperforming loans. Approximately 52% of the nonperforming home equity lines were from lines originated by third parties, lines in Florida with combined LTVs greater than 80%, or lines in other states with combined LTVs greater than 90%. Beginning in 2006, we tightened the underwriting standards applicable to many of the residential loan products offered. Nonaccrual construction loans were $1.5 billion, an increase of $207.8 million, or 16.3%, from December 31, 2008. Approximately 90% of the nonperforming construction loans are secured by residential real estate; specifically, $261 million 38 Table of Contents construction to perm, $429 million residential construction, and $641 million in residential land, acquisition, and development properties. Beginning in September 2007, underwriting standards were tightened for new loan originations in the construction to perm portfolio. At this point, we believe that the residential construction nonperforming loans are at or near their peak. The vast majority of the problem loans in the portfolio have been identified and are in the workout process. As a result, charge offs will remain elevated, but declining, over the next two to three quarters as we continue workout activities. Nonaccrual commercial loans were $484.0 million, up $162.0 million, or 50.3%, from December 31, 2008. The increase was driven primarily by loans to a few larger commercial borrowers in economically cyclical industries together with loans to mid size borrowers. Commercial loan charge offs, early stage delinquency and nonperforming loans declined in the fourth quarter. We continue to see some stress in more cyclically sensitive industries and in our small business portfolio. Nonaccrual commercial real estate loans increased by $215.2 million, or 121.9%, to $391.8 million compared to December 31, 2008. The increase occurred in a variety of property types, including office and hotel. The composition of commercial real estate nonaccruals is split almost equally between owner occupied and investor owned loans. Early stage delinquencies (30 89 days past due) were stable to declining in almost all of our non residential secured consumer portfolios. The exception was in the consumer direct portfolio, which is largely comprised of federally guaranteed or privately insured student loans, and which drove the increase. Excluding student loans, the early stage delinquency ratio for the consumer direct portfolio was 1.07%. Total early stage delinquencies declined to 1.37% as of December 31, 2009 from 1.52% as of September 30, 2009 and 1.81% as of December 31, 2008. In order to maximize the collection of loan balances, we evaluate accounts that experience financial difficulties on a case by case basis to determine if their terms should be modified. We are aggressively pursuing modifications when there is a reasonable chance that the modification will allow the client to continue servicing the debt. For residential real estate secured loans, if the client demonstrates a loss of income such that the client cannot reasonably support even a modified loan, we strongly encourage short sales and deed in lieu arrangements. Accruing loans with modifications that are deemed to be economic concessions resulting from borrower difficulties are reported as TDRs. Nonaccruing loans that are modified and demonstrate a history of repayment performance in accordance with their modified terms are reclassified to accruing restructured typically after six months of repayment performance. Nonaccruing restructured loans were $912.5 million and $268.1 million as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. Accruing restructured loans were $1.6 billion at December 31, 2009, an increase of $1.2 billion, or 254.7%, from December 31, 2008. Of these TDRs, 97% are first and second lien residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit, and not commercial or commercial real estate loans. At December 31, 2009, specific reserves included in the ALLL for all consumer real estate TDRs (accruing and nonaccruing) were $345.0 million. In addition, we have already recorded approximately $140 million in charge offs on the nonaccruing TDRs and also have $86.0 million in mark to market adjustments on TDRs carried at fair value. These loans are primarily residential related and are being restructured in a variety of ways to help our clients remain in their homes and mitigate potential additional loss to us. The primary restructuring methods offered to our clients are reductions in interest rates and extensions in terms. The increase in loan modifications also impacted the moderation in nonperforming loan growth and early stage delinquencies. Within the accruing TDR portfolio, 85% of loans are current on principal and interest and 70% of the total TDR portfolio is current. Not all restructurings will ultimately result in the complete collection of principal and interest, as modified. We anticipate that some of the restructured loans will default, which could result in incremental losses to us, which has been factored into our overall ALLL estimate. The level of re defaults will be affected by future economic conditions. Generally, once a consumer loan becomes a TDR, it is probable that the loan will likely continue to be reported as TDR until it ultimately pays off in most circumstances. Interest income on nonaccrual loans, if recognized, is recorded using the cash basis method of accounting. During 2009 and 2008, this amounted to $36.2 million and $25.4 million, respectively. For 2009 and 2008, estimated interest income of $354.1 million and $233.3 million, respectively, would have been recorded if all such loans had been accruing interest according to their original contractual terms. Interest income on restructured loans that have met their performance criteria and have been returned to accruing status is recognized according to the terms of the restructuring. During 2009, this amounted to $52.2 million. For 2009, estimated interest income of $75.2 million would have been recorded if all loans returned to accruing status had been accruing interest according to their original contractual terms. During 2008, the difference between income under original contractual terms and the modified terms for restructured loans was insignificant. As of December 31, 2009, accruing loans past due ninety days or more increased by $467.6 million, or 45.3%, from December 31, 2008 to $1.5 billion. Included in this accruing loan population are $978.9 million and $493.7 million of loans at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively, that have been sold to GNMA and are fully insured by the FHA and the VA. When loans are sold to GNMA, we retain an option to repurchase the loans when they become delinquent. As such, we are required to record these loans on our balance sheet when our option becomes exercisable. Also included in the accruing loans past due ninety days or more as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 were $366.7 million and $367.6 million, respectively, of student loans which were federally guaranteed at various levels between 97% and 100%. 39 Table of Contents OREO as of December 31, 2009 was $619.6 million, an increase of $119.1 million, or 23.8%, from December 31, 2008. The growth consists of a $225.7 million increase in construction related properties primarily driven by residential construction of $147.5 million and commercial properties of $78.2 million, acquired through foreclosure offset by a net decrease of $106.6 million in residential homes. The amount of inflows and outflows has increased over the past several quarters as nonperforming loans migrate through the resolution process. Most of our OREO properties are located in Georgia, Florida, and North Carolina. Residential properties and land comprise 50% and 36%, respectively, of OREO; the remainder relates to residential construction and other properties. Upon foreclosure, these properties were re evaluated and if necessary, written down to their then current estimated net realizable value (estimated sales price less selling costs); further declines in home prices could result in additional losses on these properties. We are actively managing these foreclosed assets to minimize future losses. See additional discussion of OREO related costs in the Noninterest Expense section of this MD&A. SELECTED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE Certain financial instruments such as trading securities, derivatives, and securities available for sale are required to be carried at fair value. Companies are also permitted to elect to carry specific financial instruments at fair value to avoid some of the complexities of hedge accounting and more closely align the economics of their business with their results of operations without having to explain a mixed attribute accounting model. Based on our balance sheet management strategies and objectives, we have elected to carry certain other financial assets and liabilities at fair value. These instruments include all, or a portion, of the following: debt, residential mortgage loans, brokered deposits, and trading loans. We record changes in these instruments fair values through earnings and economically hedge and or trade these assets or liabilities in order to manage the instruments fair value volatility and economic value. Following is a discussion of all financial assets and financial liabilities that are currently carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2009 and 2008. Table 11 Trading Assets and Liabilities As of December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Trading Assets Debt securities: U.S. Treasury and federal agencies $1,150.3 $3,127.6 $4,194.4 U.S. states and political subdivisions 58.5 159.1 171.2 Corporate debt securities 464.7 585.8 607.0 Commercial paper 0.6 399.6 2.4 Residential mortgage backed securities agency 94.2 58.6 127.5 Residential mortgage backed securities private 13.9 38.0 600.4 Collateralized debt obligations 174.9 261.5 2,245.1 Other debt securities 25.9 813.2 149.8 Total debt securities 1,983.0 5,443.4 8,097.8 Equity securities 163.0 116.8 242.7 Derivative contracts 2,610.3 4,701.8 1,977.4 Other 223.6 134.3 200.5 Total trading assets $4,979.9 $10,396.3 $10,518.4 Trading Liabilities Debt securities: U.S. Treasury and federal agencies $192.9 $440.4 $332.7 Corporate and other debt securities 144.1 146.8 188.1 Total debt securities 337.0 587.2 520.8 Equity securities 7.8 13.3 71.9 Derivative contracts 1,844.1 2,640.3 1,567.7 Total trading liabilities $2,188.9 $3,240.8 $2,160.4 40 Table of Contents Trading Assets and Liabilities Trading assets decreased $5.4 billion, or 52.1%, since December 31, 2008. The majority of the decrease consisted of a $3.5 billion reduction in trading debt securities, which was primarily driven by the sale in the first quarter of 2009 of approximately $2.0 billion of our agency trading portfolio that consisted of FHLB floating rate notes. The sale of these securities was completed primarily to reduce low yielding securities and improve margin. CP decreased $399.0 million from $399.6 million at December 31, 2008 to $0.6 million at December 31, 2009. The decrease is primarily due to the discontinuation of the Federal Reserve Bank of Bostons ABCP MMMF Liquidity Facility program that was implemented in 2008 which allowed eligible depository institutions, bank holding companies, and affiliated broker/dealers to purchase certain ABCP from certain MMMF. Other debt securities decreased $787.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. Of this decrease, $603.4 million was the result of the temporary suspension and wind down of the TRS business. See Note 11, Certain Transfers of Financial Assets, Mortgage Servicing Rights and Variable Interest Entities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our TRS business. Derivative assets and liabilities also decreased in 2009 by $2.1 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively, of which $1.5 billion and $655.1 million, respectively, was driven by the movements in fair values of interest rate based derivatives including $184.1 million in terminated interest rate swaps on FHLB advances that were repaid in the first quarter of 2009. In addition, $249.5 million of the decrease in derivative assets was due to the decline in fair value of our cash flow hedges related to the probable forecasted sale of Coke common shares, which change in fair value also increased the derivative liabilities by $45.9 million. The termination of TRS transactions resulted in the decrease of derivative assets and liabilities during 2009 of $171.0 million and $166.6 million, respectively. The remaining decrease in derivative assets and liabilities was primarily due to the partial termination of cross currency swaps hedging foreign denominated debt and the changes in fair value of those hedge positions still outstanding. Certain ABS were purchased during the fourth quarter of 2007 from affiliates and certain ARS were purchased primarily in the fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009. The securities acquired during the fourth quarter of 2007 included SIVs (that are collateralized by various domestic and foreign assets), residential MBS (including Alt A and subprime collateral), CDO, and commercial loans, as well as super senior interests retained from Company sponsored securitizations. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized approximately $24.2 million in net market valuation gains related to these ABS. Through sales, maturities and write downs, we reduced our exposure to these distressed assets by approximately $3.3 billion since the acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2007, reducing the exposure at December 31, 2009 to approximately $159.3 million. During 2009, we received approximately $6.5 million in sales proceeds and $108.5 million in payments related to securities acquired during the fourth quarter of 2007. We continue to actively evaluate our holdings of these securities with the objective of opportunistically lowering our exposure to them. In addition, we expect paydowns to continue on many of the residential MBS. All but a small amount of the remaining acquired asset portfolio consists of SIVs undergoing enforcement proceedings and, therefore, any significant reduction in the portfolio will largely depend on the status of those proceedings. During the second quarter of 2009, one of our three remaining SIVs liquidated as a result of the completion of enforcement proceedings; this liquidation resulted in proceeds of $18.6 million and a realized gain of $1.8 million, due to the liquidation value being slightly above our recorded fair value, that was recorded in trading account profits/(losses) and commissions in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss) for the year ended December 31, 2009. During 2009, we received approximately $65.0 million in partial payments on the remaining SIVs undergoing enforcement. While further losses are possible, our experience during 2008 and 2009 reinforces our belief that we have appropriately written these assets down to fair value as of December 31, 2009. The estimated market value of these securities is based on market information, where available, along with significant, unobservable third party data. As a result of the high degree of judgment and estimates used to value these illiquid securities, the market values could vary significantly in future periods. See Difficult to Value Financial Assets and Liabilities included in this MD&A for more information. The amount of ARS recorded in trading assets at fair value totaled $176.4 million at December 31, 2009 and $133.1 million at December 31, 2008. The majority of these ARS are preferred equity securities, and the remaining securities consist of ABS backed by trust preferred bank debt or student loans. In September 2008, we purchased, at amortized cost plus accrued interest, a Lehman Brothers security from the RidgeWorth Prime Quality Money Market Fund (the Fund). The Fund received a cash payment for the accrued interest along with a $70 million note that we issued. RidgeWorth, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, is the investment adviser to the Fund. The Lehman Brothers security went into default when Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in September 2008. We took this 41 Table of Contents action in response to the unprecedented market events during the third quarter and to protect investors in the Fund from losses associated with this specific security. When purchased by the Fund, the Lehman Brothers security was rated A 1/P 1 and was a Tier 1 eligible security. During 2008, we recorded a pre tax market valuation loss of $63.8 million as a result of the purchase. During 2009, we sold this security, recognizing a gain for the year of $2.8 million. We evaluated this transaction under the applicable accounting guidance and concluded that we were not the primary beneficiary and therefore consolidation of the Fund was not appropriate.

Securities Available for Sale The securities available for sale portfolio is managed as part of the overall asset and liability management process to optimize income and market performance over an entire interest rate cycle while mitigating risk. The size of the securities portfolio, at fair value, was $28.5 billion as of December 31, 2009, an increase of $8.8 billion, or 44.7%, from December 31, 2008. The carrying value of securities available for sale reflected $1.8 billion in net unrealized gains as of December 31, 2009, comprised of a $1.7 billion unrealized gain from our remaining 30.0 million shares of Coke common stock and $0.1 billion in net unrealized gains on the remainder of the portfolio. The average yield on securities available for sale on a FTE basis for 2009 declined to 4.23% compared to 5.99% in 2008 primarily as a result of the net purchase of lower yielding MBS issued by federal agencies in late December of 2008 as well as the net purchase of lower yielding U.S. Treasury and federal agency debentures throughout 2009, improving the portfolios quality and liquidity in anticipation of the repayment of TARP upon regulatory approval. In 2009, we sold approximately $9.2 billion of agency MBS recognizing a $90.2 million gain on those sales. These sales were associated with repositioning the MBS portfolio into securities we believe have higher relative value. 42 Table of Contents The portfolios effective duration increased to 3.0% as of December 31, 2009 from 2.8% as of December 31, 2008. Effective duration is a measure of price sensitivity of a bond portfolio to an immediate change in market interest rates, taking into consideration embedded options. An effective duration of 3.0% suggests an expected price change of 3.0% for a one percent instantaneous change in market interest rates. The credit quality of the securities portfolio remained strong with approximately 95% of the total securities available for sale portfolio rated AAA, the highest possible rating by nationally recognized rating agencies. During 2009, we recognized $20.0 million of credit related OTTI within net securities gains in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss) and $92.8 million of non credit related OTTI within OCI. This total OTTI loss of $112.8 million relates to securities with a fair value of approximately $310.6 million as of December 31, 2009, consisting primarily of purchased and retained private residential MBS. These impaired securities were valued using third party pricing data, including broker indicative bids, or expected cash flow models. See Note 5, Securities Available for Sale, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. The amount of ARS recorded in the available for sale securities portfolio totaled $156.4 million as of December 31, 2009 and $48.2 million as of December 31, 2008. Included in ARS are tax exempt municipal securities in addition to student loan ABS. Difficult to Value Financial Assets and Liabilities The broad credit crisis that was triggered by the 2007 subprime loan melt down intensified throughout 2008 and, as the broader economy continued to worsen, the credit and liquidity markets became dysfunctional. The second half of 2008 was marked by turmoil in the financial sector, with the failure or government induced acquisitions of several large banks and investment banks, increased unemployment, and further declines in real estate values. Additional liquidity adjustments were made on many securities, and wider spreads caused valuing our level 3 financial instruments to become even more difficult. Initially in 2009, we saw continued volatility with the credit crisis further eroding liquidity and investor confidence; however, we began to experience the return of some stability in certain financial markets throughout the majority of 2009. In spite of some improvement in the market, record high mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures led to further downward pressure on certain private residential mortgage backed products. As a result, loss projections used by investors to estimate cash flows of these products more than doubled during the year, particularly for 2007 vintage private MBS. Fair value is the estimated price using market based inputs or assumptions that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Current market conditions have led to diminished, and in some cases, non existent trading in certain of the financial asset classes that we own. We are required to consider observable inputs, to the extent available, in the fair value estimation process, unless that data results from forced liquidations or distressed sales. When available, we will obtain third party broker quotes or use observable market assumptions, as these levels of evidence are the strongest support for fair value, absent current market activity in that specific security or a similar security. Despite our best efforts to maximize the use of relevant observable inputs, the current market environment has generally diminished the observability of trades and assumptions that have historically been available. As such, the degree to which significant unobservable inputs have been utilized in our valuation procedures has increased over the past two years, largely with respect to certain types of loans and securities. This decrease in observability of market data began in the third quarter of 2007 and continued to persist in certain markets in 2009. However, we have begun to observe increased trading activity in certain markets, such as corporate debt markets (both primary and secondary) and the market for Small Business Administration instruments, which has provided corroborating evidence for our estimates of fair value. The lack of liquidity, as evidenced by significant decreases in the volume and level of activity in certain markets, creates additional challenges when estimating the fair value of certain financial instruments. Generally, the assets and liabilities most affected by the lack of liquidity are those classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. This lack of liquidity has caused us to evaluate the performance of the underlying collateral and use a discount rate commensurate with the rate a market participant would use to value the instrument in an orderly transaction, but that also acknowledges illiquidity premiums and required investor rates of return that would be demanded under current market conditions. The discount rate considered the capital structure of the instrument, market indices, and the relative yields of instruments for which third party pricing information and or market activity was available. In certain instances, the interest rate and credit risk components of the valuation indicated a full return of expected principal and interest; however, the lack of liquidity resulted in wide ranges of discounts in valuing level 3 securities. The current illiquid markets are requiring discounts of this degree to drive a market competitive yield, as well as account for the anticipated extended tenor. The discount rates selected derived reasonable prices when compared to (i) observable transactions, when available, (ii) other securities on a relative basis, (iii) the bid/ask spread of non binding broker indicative bids and or (iv) our professional judgment. For certain securities, particularly non investment grade MBS, a reasonable market discount rate could not be determined using those methodologies and, therefore, dollar prices were established based on market intelligence. Pricing services and broker quotes were obtained when available to assist in estimating the fair value of level 3 instruments. The number of quotes we obtained varied based on the number of brokers following a particular security, but we generally 43 Table of Contents attempt to obtain two to four quotes to determine reasonableness and comparability on a relative basis; however, the ability to obtain reasonable and reliable broker quotes or price indications continues to be challenging. We gained an understanding of the information used by third party pricing sources to develop their estimated values. The information obtained from third party pricing sources was evaluated and relied upon based on the degree of market transactions supporting the price indications and the firmness of the broker quotes. In most cases, the current market conditions caused the broker quotes to be indicative and the price indications and broker quotes to be supported by very limited to no recent market activity. In those instances, we weighted the third party information according to our judgment of it being a reasonable indication of the instruments fair value. Generally, pricing services values and broker quotes obtained on level 3 instruments were indications of value based on price indications, market intelligence, and proprietary cash flow modeling techniques, but could not otherwise be supported by recent trades due to the illiquidity in the markets. These values were evaluated in relation to other securities, and other broker indications, as well as our independent knowledge of the securitys collateral. We believe that we evaluated all available information to estimate the value of level 3 instruments. The continued decline in the amount of third party information available necessitates the further use of internal models when valuing level 3 instruments. All of the techniques used and information obtained in the valuation process provides a range of estimated values, which were evaluated and compared in order to establish an estimated value that, based on managements judgment, represented a reasonable estimate of the instruments fair value. It was not uncommon for the range of value of these instruments to vary widely; in such cases, we selected an estimated value that we believed was the best indication of value based on the yield a market participant in this current environment would expect. Beginning in the first quarter of 2008, management established a level 3 valuation working group to evaluate the available information pertaining to certain securities and ultimately develop a consensus estimate of the instruments fair value. The process involves the gathering of multiple sources of information, including broker quotes, values provided by pricing services, trading activity in other similar securities, market indices, and internal cash flow and pricing matrix estimates. Participation in this working group includes the business or functional area that manages the instrument, market risk, and finance, including the independent price verification function. Pricing estimates are derived on most illiquid instruments weekly and at a minimum monthly, and the working group formally reviews the pricing information at least quarterly. These reviews may include assessing an instruments classification in the fair value hierarchy based on the significance of the unobservable assumptions used to estimate the fair value. We used significant unobservable inputs to fair value, on a recurring basis, certain trading assets, securities available for sale, portfolio loans accounted for at fair value, IRLCs, LHFS, MSRs and certain derivatives. The following table discloses assets and liabilities that have been impacted by level 3 fair value determinations.

These nonmarketable securities total approximately $836.9 million at December 31, 2009. Level 3 trading assets total approximately $390.1 million at December 31, 2009. The remaining level 3 securities, both trading assets and available for sale securities, are predominantly private MBS and collateral debt obligations, including interests retained from Company sponsored securitizations or purchased from third party securitizations and investments in SIVs. We have also increased our exposure to bank trust preferred ABS, student loan ABS, and municipal securities due to our purchase of certain ARS as a result of failed auctions. For all of the Level 3 securities, little or no market activity exists for either the security or the underlying collateral and therefore the significant assumptions used to value the securities are not market observable. Approximately half of the collateral in the remaining level 3 securities includes direct or repackaged exposure to residential mortgages which is predominantly secured by 2007 vintage prime first lien mortgage loans, however, there is also exposure to prime first and second lien mortgages, as well as subprime first and second lien mortgages that were originated from 2003 through 2007. Level 3 trading liabilities consists of the Coke derivative valued at approximately $45.9 million at December 31, 2009. ARS purchased since the auction rate market began failing in February 2008 have been considered level 3 securities due to the significant decrease in the volume and level of activity in these markets which has necessitated the use of significant unobservable inputs into our valuations. We classify ARS as securities available for sale or trading securities. As of December 31, 2009, the fair value of ARS purchased is approximately $176.4 million in trading assets and $156.4 million in available for sale securities. ARS include municipal bonds, nonmarketable preferred equity securities, and ABS collateralized by student loans or trust preferred bank obligations. Under a functioning market, ARS could be remarketed with tight interest rate caps to investors targeting short term investment securities that repriced generally every 7 to 28 days. Unlike other short term instruments, these ARS do not benefit from backup liquidity lines or letters of credit and, therefore, as auctions began to fail, investors were left with securities that were more akin to longer term, 20 30 year, illiquid bonds, with the anticipation that auctions will continue to fail in the foreseeable future. The combination of materially increased tenors, capped interest rates and general market illiquidity has had a significant impact on the risk profiles of these securities and has resulted in the use of valuation techniques and models that rely on significant inputs that are largely unobservable. We saw a reduction in our level 3 portfolios during 2009 due to sales, paydowns, transfers of assets from level 3 to level 2, and or continued deterioration in values of certain securities, in particular, private MBS. At December 31, 2009, we hold assets in two SIVs that are in receivership and are carried at a fair value of approximately $126.1 million. Our holdings of SIV assets decreased by $61.9 million during 2009, due to settlements or partial paydown of approximately $83.6 million, offset by gains of approximately $21.7 million. The gain resulted primarily from the improvement in the cash positions of the SIVs as well as modest improvements in the value of the underlying assets. Our level 3 portfolio has experienced a significant number and amount of downgrades during this time of economic turmoil. While our level 3 municipal securities and equity securities are of high credit quality, certain vintages of private MBS have suffered from deterioration in credit quality leading to downgrades. At December 31, 2009, our private MBS contained approximately $314 million of 2007 vintage securities available for sale and trading securities and approximately $19 million of 1999 2006 vintage securities available for sale and trading securities that had been downgraded to non investment grade levels by at least one nationally recognized rating agency. The vast majority of these securities had high investment grade ratings at the time of origination or purchase. All of these securities that are classified as available for sale are also included as part of our quarterly OTTI evaluation process. See Note 5, Securities Available for Sale, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding impairment recognized through earnings on private MBS during the year ended December 31, 2009. Residual and other retained interests classified as securities available for sale or trading securities are valued based on internal models that incorporate assumptions, such as prepayment speeds, estimated credit losses, and discount rates which are generally not observable in the current markets. Generally, we attempt to obtain pricing for our securities from a third party pricing provider or third party brokers who have experience in valuing certain investments. This pricing may be used as either direct support for our valuations or used to validate outputs from our own proprietary models. We evaluate third party pricing to determine the reasonableness of the information relative to changes in market data such as any recent trades we executed, market information received from outside market participants and analysts, and or changes in the underlying collateral performance. When actual trades are not available to corroborate pricing information received, we will use industry standard or proprietary models to estimate fair value, and will consider assumptions such as relevant market indices that correlate to the underlying collateral, prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severity rates, and discount rates. Due to the continued illiquidity and credit risk of level 3 securities, these market values are highly sensitive to assumption changes and market volatility. In many instances, pricing assumptions for level 3 securities may fall within 45 Table of Contents an acceptable range of values. In those cases, we attempt to consider all information to determine the most appropriate price within that range. Improvements may be made to our pricing methodologies on an ongoing basis as observable and relevant information becomes available to us. Sales, trading and settlement activity were scarce in 2009 for many of our level 3 securities; however, we maintained consistency in our pricing methodology and processes, and incorporated any relevant changes to the valuation assumptions needed to ensure a supportable fair value for these illiquid securities, based on market conditions at December 31, 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized through earnings $21.6 million in net losses related to trading assets and securities available for sale classified as level 3. While we believe we have utilized all pertinent market data in establishing an appropriate fair value for our securities, current market conditions result in wide price ranges used to evaluate market value. While it is difficult to accurately predict the ultimate cash value of these securities, we believe the amount that would be ultimately realized if the securities were held to settlement or maturity will generally be greater than the current fair value of the securities classified as level 3. This assessment is based on the current performance of the underlying collateral, which is experiencing elevated losses but generally not to the degree that correlates to current market values, which is pressured downward in this market due to liquidity issues and other broad macroeconomic conditions. It is reasonably likely that this market volatility will continue as a result of a variety of external factors, including but not limited to economic conditions, the sale of assets under government sponsored programs, the restructuring of SIVs, and third party sales of securities, some of which could be large scale. During the year ended December 31, 2009, our level 3 assets were temporarily increased due to the purchase of approximately $1.3 billion of Three Pillars CP which was then transferred out of level 3 to level 2 due to increased market trading levels subsequent to our purchases which ultimately reduced our outstanding amount to zero as of December 31, 2009. We continued to see a reduction in other level 3 trading assets and securities available for sale as the net result of purchases, sales, issuances, settlements, maturities, and paydowns. Included in this net reduction were purchases of level 3 ARS totaling $234.3 million, of which $86.7 million was classified as trading securities and $147.6 million was classified as securities available for sale. No other significant purchases of level 3 trading assets or available for sale securities were added. We also redeemed stock in the FHLB of approximately $150.8 million which is classified as level 3 available for sale securities. A modest amount of available for sale securities were transferred into level 3 consisting of municipal bonds for which no observable activity exists. We also transferred U.S. Treasury and federal agency trading securities out of level 3 consisting of Small Business Administration securities for which the volume and level of observable trading activity had significantly decreased in prior quarters, but for which we began to observe limited increases in such activity during the three months ended March 31, 2009 and significant increases in such activity during the rest of 2009. This level of activity provided us with sufficient market evidence of pricing, such that we did not have to make any significant adjustments to observed pricing, nor was our pricing based on unobservable data. As such, this portfolio was transferred out of level 3. Most derivative instruments are level 1 or level 2 instruments, except for the IRLCs, the Visa litigation related derivative, discussed below, and The Agreements we entered into related to our investment in Coke common stock, which are level 3 instruments. Because the value of The Agreements is primarily driven by the embedded equity collars on the Coke common shares, a Black Scholes model is the appropriate valuation model. Most of the assumptions are directly observable from the market, such as the per share market price of Coke common stock, interest rates, and the dividend rate on Coke common stock. Volatility is a significant assumption and is impacted both by the unusually large size of the trade and the long tenor until settlement. The Agreements carry scheduled terms of approximately six and a half and seven years from the effective date, and as such, the observable and active options market on Coke does not provide for any identical or similar instruments. As a result, we receive estimated market values from a market participant who is knowledgeable about Coke equity derivatives and is active in the market. Based on inquiries of the market participant as to their procedures as well as our own valuation assessment procedures, we have satisfied ourselves that the market participant is using methodologies and assumptions that other market participants would use in arriving at the fair value of The Agreements. At December 31, 2009, The Agreements were in a liability position to us of approximately $45.9 million. Loans and Loans Held for Sale Level 3 loans are primarily non agency residential mortgage loans held for investment or LHFS for which there is little to no observable trading in either the new issuance or secondary loan markets as either whole loans or as securities. Prior to the non agency residential loan market disruption, which began during the third quarter of 2007 and continues, we were able to obtain certain observable pricing from either the new issuance or secondary loan market. However, as the markets deteriorated and certain loans were not actively trading as either whole loans or as securities, we began employing the same alternative valuation methodologies used to value level 3 residential MBS to fair value the mortgage loans. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we transferred $307.0 million and $656.1 million, respectively, of loans that were previously designated as held for sale to held for investment, as they were determined to be no longer 46 Table of Contents marketable. Of these amounts, $272.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, and $83.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 were LHFS reported at fair value and will continue to be reported at fair value as loans held for investment. On May 1, 2008, we acquired 100% of the outstanding common shares of GB&T. We elected to account for $171.6 million of the acquired loans, which were classified as nonaccrual, at fair value. Upon acquisition, the loans had a fair value of $111.1 million. These loans are primarily commercial real estate loans which do not trade in an active secondary market, and as such, are considered level 3 instruments. As these loans are all classified as nonperforming, cash proceeds from the sale of the underlying collateral is the expected source of repayment for the majority of these loans. In order to fair value these loans, we utilized market data, when available, as well as internal assumptions, to derive fair value estimates of the underlying collateral. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded through earnings a gain of $2.4 million on these loans compared to a loss of $4.2 million on these loans during the year ended December 31, 2008. On December 31, 2009, primarily as a result of paydowns, payoffs, and transfers to OREO, the loans had a fair value of $12.2 million. Other Intangible Assets We record MSRs at fair value on both a recurring and non recurring basis. See Note 20, Fair Value Election and Measurement, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the valuation methodology, underlying assumptions and validation procedures performed. Other Assets/Liabilities, net During the second quarter of 2009, in connection with our sale of Visa Class B shares, we entered into a derivative contract whereby the ultimate cash payments received or paid, if any, under the contract are based on the ultimate resolution of litigation involving Visa. The value of the derivative is estimated based on our expectations regarding the ultimate resolution of that litigation, which involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity. As a result, the value of the derivative liability was classified as a level 3 instrument. See Note 18, Reinsurance Arrangements and Guarantees, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. The fair value methodology and assumptions related to our IRLCs is described in Note 20, Fair Value Election and Measurement, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Long Term Debt We elect to carry a portion of our publicly issued, fixed rate debt at fair value. The debt consists of a number of different issuances that carry coupon rates ranging from 5.00% to 7.75%, resulting in a weighted average rate of 5.93%, and maturities from May 1, 2010 through April 1, 2020, resulting in a weighted average life of 4.9 years. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we recognized net losses of $153.0 million and net gains of $431.7 million, respectively, in noninterest income associated with fair value changes in the debt and related derivatives and trading securities that provide an economic offset to the change in the value of the debt. Credit spreads widened throughout 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 in connection with the continued deterioration of the broader financial markets and a number of failures in the financial services industry. However, credit spreads tightened throughout the remainder of 2009 after the SCAP results were published and additional capital was raised. Further fluctuations in our credit spreads are likely to occur in the future based on instrument specific and broader market conditions. To mitigate the prospective impact of spread tightening, we completed the repurchase of approximately $386.6 million of our publicly traded long term debt during the year ended December 31, 2008. No fair value public debt was repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2009. To mitigate the impact of fair value changes on our debt due to interest rate movement, we generally enter into interest rate swaps; however, at times, we may also purchase fixed rate agency MBS to achieve this offset in interest rates. There were no agency MBS held as of December 31, 2009 for this purpose. We have historically used quotes from a third party pricing service as our primary source for valuation and have deemed such quotes as reasonable estimates of fair value by utilizing broker quotes and or institutional trading data, when available, as corroborating evidence. Secondary trading activity had begun to increase in the first quarter of 2009 and we observed continued increases in the volume and level of activity in the secondary markets through the fourth quarter of 2009. In addition, we observed issuances in the primary markets of similar securities. Because we had a sufficient amount of observable market pricing upon which to base our valuation, we utilized that data as the primary source for valuing the fixed rate debt. Given that observable market data was used, we transferred our fixed rate debt out of level 3 as of the end of the second quarter. 47 Table of Contents Overall, the financial impact of the level 3 financial instruments did not have a significant impact on our liquidity or capital. We acquired $3.5 billion of certain ABS from affiliates during the fourth quarter of 2007 using our existing liquidity position, and since purchasing the securities, we have received approximately $2.5 billion in cash consideration from paydowns, settlements, sales, and maturities of these securities. Some fair value assets are pledged for corporate borrowings or other liquidity purposes. Most of these arrangements provide for advances to be made based on the market value and not the principal balance of the assets, and therefore whether or not we have elected fair value accounting treatment does not impact our liquidity. If the fair value of assets posted as collateral declines, we will be required to post more collateral under our borrowing arrangements which could negatively impact our liquidity position on an overall basis. For purposes of computing regulatory capital, mark to market adjustments related to our own creditworthiness for debt accounted for at fair value are excluded from regulatory capital. INVESTMENT IN COMMON SHARES OF THE COCA COLA COMPANY Background We have owned common shares of Coke since 1919, when one of our predecessor institutions participated in the underwriting of Cokes IPO and received common shares of Coke in lieu of underwriting fees. These shares have grown in value over the past 90 years and have been classified as available for sale securities, with unrealized gains, net of tax, recorded as a component of shareholders equity. Because of the low accounting cost basis of these shares, we have accumulated significant unrealized gains in shareholders equity. As of December 31, 2009, as a result of the transactions undertaken in 2008 discussed herein, we owned 30 million Coke shares with an accounting cost basis of $69,295 and a fair market value of approximately $1.7 billion. We commenced a comprehensive balance sheet review initiative in early 2007 in an effort to improve liquidity and capital efficiency. As part of this initiative, we began to formally evaluate the capital efficiency of our holdings of Coke common shares, as we were prohibited from including the market value of our investment in Coke common shares in Tier 1 capital in accordance with Federal Reserve capital adequacy rules. Executed Multi Step Strategy As we reported in connection with our financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2007, we sold 4.5 million Coke common shares, or approximately 9% of our holdings at that time, in an open market sale. At that time, we also announced publicly that we were evaluating various strategies to address our remaining Coke common shares. In the second and third quarters of 2008, we completed the following three part strategy with respect to our remaining 43.6 million common shares of Coke: (i) a market sale of 10 million shares, (ii) a charitable contribution of approximately 3.6 million shares to the SunTrust Foundation and (iii) the execution of The Agreements on 30 million shares. Our primary objective in executing these transactions was to optimize the benefits we obtained from our long term holding of this asset, including the capital treatment by bank regulators. I. Market Sale During the second quarter of 2008, we sold 10 million Coke common shares in the market. These sales, which resulted in an increase of approximately $345.0 million to Tier 1 capital, generated approximately $549.0 million in net cash proceeds and an after tax gain of approximately $345.0 million that was recorded in our financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2008. This transaction resulted in foregone annual dividend income of approximately $15.0 million, after tax, and gave rise to a current tax liability with a marginal rate of just over 37%. II. Contribution to the SunTrust Foundation In July 2008, we contributed approximately 3.6 million Coke common shares to the SunTrust Foundation, which was reflected as a contribution expense of $183.4 million in our financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2008. As the gain from this contribution is non taxable, the only impact to our net income was the release of the deferred tax liability of approximately $65.8 million (net of valuation allowance). This contribution increased Tier 1 capital in the third quarter by approximately $65.8 million. This gain and resultant increase to Tier 1 capital were reflected in our third quarter results, as we had not made any commitments or entered into any other transactions as of June 30, 2008 that would have required us to record this contribution in the second quarter. This contribution will result in foregone annual dividend income of approximately $5 million, after tax. We expect this contribution to act as an endowment for the SunTrust Foundation to make grants to charities operating within our footprint for years to come and reduce our ongoing charitable contribution expense. This transaction was treated as a discrete item for income tax provision purposes and significantly lowered the effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2008. 48 Table of Contents III. The Agreements The final piece of the strategy related to the remaining 30 million Coke common shares and was executed in July 2008. We entered into The Agreements, which were comprised of two variable forward agreements and share forward agreements effective July 15, 2008 with a major, unaffiliated financial institution (the Counterparty) collectively covering our 30 million Coke shares. Under The Agreements, we must deliver to the Counterparty at settlement of the variable forward agreements either a variable number of Coke common shares or a cash payment in lieu of such shares. The Counterparty is obligated to settle The Agreements for no less than approximately $38.67 per share, or approximately $1.16 billion in the aggregate (the Minimum Proceeds). The share forward agreements give us the right, but not the obligation, to sell to the Counterparty, at prevailing market prices at the time of settlement, any of the 30 million Coke common shares that are not delivered to the Counterparty in settlement of the variable forward agreements. The Agreements effectively ensure that we will be able to sell our 30 million Coke common shares at a price no less than approximately $38.67 per share, while permitting us to participate in future appreciation in the value of the Coke common shares up to approximately $66.02 per share and approximately $65.72 per share, under each of the respective Agreements. During the terms of The Agreements, and until we sell the 30 million Coke common shares, we generally will continue to receive dividends as declared and paid by Coke and will have the right to vote such shares. However, the amounts payable to us under The Agreements will be adjusted if actual dividends are not equal to amounts expected at the inception of the derivative. Contemporaneously with entering into The Agreements, the Counterparty invested in senior unsecured promissory notes issued by SunTrust Bank and SunTrust Banks, Inc. (collectively, the Notes) in a private placement in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Minimum Proceeds. The Notes carry stated maturities of approximately ten years from the effective date and bear interest at one month LIBOR plus a fixed spread. The Counterparty pledged the Notes to us and we pledged the 30 million Coke common shares to the Counterparty, securing each entitys respective obligations under The Agreements. The pledged Coke common shares are held by an independent third party custodian and the Counterparty is prohibited under The Agreements from selling, pledging, assigning or otherwise using the pledged Coke common shares in its business. We generally may not prepay the Notes. The interest rate on the Notes will be reset upon or after the settlement of The Agreements, either through a remarketing process or based upon dealer quotations. In the event of an unsuccessful remarketing of the Notes, we would be required to collateralize the Notes and the maturity of the Notes may accelerate to the first anniversary of the settlement of The Agreements. However, we presently believe that it is substantially certain that the Notes will be successfully remarketed. The Agreements carry scheduled settlement terms of approximately seven years from the effective date. However, we have the option to terminate The Agreements earlier with the approval of the Federal Reserve. The Agreements may also terminate earlier upon certain events of default, extraordinary events regarding Coke and other typical termination events. Upon such early termination, there could be exit costs or gains, such as certain breakage fees including an interest rate make whole amount, associated with both The Agreements and the Notes. Such costs or gains may be material but cannot be determined at the present time due to the unlikely occurrence of such events and the number of variables that are unknown. However, the payment of such costs, if any, will not result in us receiving less than the Minimum Proceeds from The Agreements. We expect to sell all of the Coke common shares upon settlement of The Agreements, either under the terms of The Agreements or in another market transaction. See Note 17, Derivative Financial Instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of the transactions. The Federal Reserve determined that we may include in Tier 1 capital, as of the effective date of The Agreements, an amount equal to the Minimum Proceeds minus the deferred tax liability associated with the ultimate sale of the 30 million Coke common shares. Accordingly, The Agreements resulted in an increase in Tier 1 capital during the third quarter of approximately $728 million. 49 Table of Contents DEPOSITS Table 14 Composition of Average Deposits Year Ended December 31 Percent of Total (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 Noninterest bearing $24,249.2 $20,949.0 $21,677.2 20.3 % 18.0 % 18.1 % NOW accounts 23,600.6 21,080.7 20,042.8 19.8 18.2 16.7 Money market accounts 31,863.5 26,564.8 22,676.7 26.7 22.9 18.9 Savings 3,664.2 3,770.9 4,608.7 3.1 3.2 3.8 Consumer time 16,718.1 16,770.2 16,941.3 14.0 14.5 14.2 Other time 13,068.4 12,197.2 12,073.5 11.0 10.5 10.1 Total consumer and commercialdeposits 113,164.0 101,332.8 98,020.2 94.9 87.3 81.8 Brokered deposits 5,648.3 10,493.2 16,091.9 4.7 9.0 13.4 Foreign deposits 433.9 4,250.3 5,764.5 0.4 3.7 4.8 Total deposits $119,246.2 $116,076.3 $119,876.6 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Average consumer and commercial deposits increased during 2009 by $11.8 billion, or 11.7%, compared to 2008 with the growth concentrated in noninterest bearing DDA, NOW, and money market accounts. The increase was partially offset by declines in savings and consumer time account balances. During 2009, deposits increased and our deposit mix improved as a result of our marketing efforts, pricing discipline with respect to interest bearing deposits, improving operational execution, as well as an industry wide flight to the safety of insured deposits. Consumer and commercial deposit growth is one of our key initiatives, as we focus on deposit gathering opportunities across all lines of business throughout the geographic footprint. All 16 regions within which we operate exhibited deposit growth during 2009. Deposit growth was accomplished through a judicious use of competitive rates in select products and select geographies. Other initiatives to attract deposits included innovative product and features offerings, enhanced programs and initiatives like regional pricing, new and retention oriented money offers, more customer targeted offers, and advanced analytics that leverage product offerings with customer segmentation. We continued to leverage the Live Solid. Bank Solid. branding and marketing campaign to improve our visibility in the marketplace. It is designed to speak to what is important to clients in the current environment and to inspire customer loyalty and capitalize on some of the opportunities presented by the new banking landscape. Notwithstanding these deposit generation successes, some of the deposit growth is due to seasonality and the economic environment. Deposit balances are expected to decline modestly in the first quarter related to seasonality, and further over time as the economy improves. Average brokered and foreign deposits decreased by $8.7 billion, or 58.8%, during 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease was due to our ability to grow deposits and, in turn, reduce our reliance upon wholesale funding sources. As of December 31, 2009, securities pledges as collateral for deposits totaled $9.0 billion. In November 2008, the FDIC created the TLGP to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks, thrifts, and certain holding companies via its DGP, and by providing full coverage of non interest bearing deposit transaction accounts and capped NOW accounts, regardless of dollar amount via its TAGP. As of October 31, 2009, banks are no longer eligible to issue additional debt under the TLGP. We have opted not to participate in the TAGP beyond December 31, 2009. OTHER SHORT TERM BORROWINGS AND LONG TERM DEBT Other short term borrowings decreased $3.1 billion, or 60.1%, from December 31, 2008 to $2.1 billion at December 31, 2009. During November and December of 2008, we purchased $2.5 billion in three month funding under the TAF in support of the Federal Reserves initiative. During the first quarter of 2009, our core deposit growth allowed us to discontinue the use of this source of short term funding which was the primary cause for the overall decrease during the year. Long term debt decreased $9.3 billion, or 34.8%, from December 31, 2008 to $17.5 billion at December 31, 2009. The change in long term debt was primarily the result of the repayment of $7.4 billion of FHLB advances, $3.4 billion of which were at fair value. Repayment was assisted by the growth during the year of our core deposit portfolio. Additionally, we repurchased approximately $500 million of Parent Company junior subordinated notes and approximately $300 million of Parent Company debt matured during 2009. In the first quarter of 2009, we issued $576.0 million of unsecured senior floating rate notes maturing in 2012 under the terms of the TLGP. 50 Table of Contents CAPITAL RESOURCES Table 15 Capital Ratios As of December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Tier 1 capital1 $18,068.8 $17,613.7 $11,424.9 Total capital 22,895.2 22,743.4 16,994.1 Risk weighted assets 139,379.5 162,046.4 164,931.9 Tier 1 capital1 $18,068.8 $17,613.7 $11,424.9 Less: Qualifying trust preferred securities 2,356.4 2,847.3 2,133.4 Preferred stock 4,917.3 5,221.7 500.0 Allowable minority interest 103.6 101.8 105.0 Tier 1 common equity $10,691.5 $9,442.9 $8,686.5 Risk based ratios: Tier 1 common equity 7.67 % 5.83 % 5.27 % Tier 1 capital 12.96 10.87 6.93 Total capital 16.43 14.04 10.30 Tier 1 leverage ratio 10.90 10.45 6.90 Total shareholders equity to assets 12.94 11.90 10.12 1Tier 1 capital includes trust preferred obligations of $2.4 billion at the end of 2009, $2.8 billion at the end of 2008, and $2.1 billion at the end of 2007. Tier 1 capital also includes qualifying minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries of $103.6 million at the end of 2009, $101.8 million at the end of 2008, and $105.0 million at the end of 2007. Our primary regulator, the Federal Reserve, measures capital adequacy within a framework that makes capital requirements sensitive to the risk profiles of individual banking companies. The guidelines weigh assets and off balance sheet risk exposures (risk weighted assets) according to predefined classifications, creating a base from which to compare capital levels. Tier 1 capital primarily includes realized equity and qualified preferred instruments, less purchase accounting intangibles such as goodwill and core deposit intangibles. Total capital consists of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, which includes qualifying portions of subordinated debt, allowance for loan losses up to a maximum of 1.25% of risk weighted assets, and 45% of the unrealized gain on equity securities. Both the Company and the Bank are subject to a minimum Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios of 4% and 8%, respectively, of risk weighted assets. To be considered well capitalized, ratios of 6% and 10%, respectively, are required. Additionally, the Company and the Bank are subject to Tier 1 leverage ratio requirements, which measures Tier 1 capital against average assets. The minimum and well capitalized ratios are 3% and 5%, respectively. The Tier 1 common equity, Tier 1 capital, and total capital ratios improved from 5.83%, 10.87%, and 14.04%, respectively, at December 31, 2008 to 7.67%, 12.96%, and 16.43%, respectively, at December 31, 2009. The primary drivers of the increase were the successful completion of our capital plan during the second quarter of 2009 and a $22.7 billion, or 14.0%, reduction in risk weighted assets. The reduction in risk weighted assets was due primarily to the $13.3 billion decline in loans held for investment. Also contributing to the reduction was a reduction in unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit during the year. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Reserve Banks, the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency completed, in May 2009, the SCAP review of the potential capital needs through the end of 2010 of the nineteen largest U.S. bank holding companies. The Federal Reserve advised us that based on the SCAP review, we presently have and are projected to continue to have Tier 1 capital well in excess of the amount required to be well capitalized through the forecast period under both the baseline scenario and the more adverse than expected scenario (more adverse) as prepared by the U.S. Treasury. The SCAPs more adverse scenario represented a hypothetical scenario that involves a recession that is longer and more severe than consensus expectations and results in higher than expected credit losses, but is not a forecast of expected losses or revenues. The Federal Reserve advised us in May 2009, based on the more adverse scenario, that we needed to adjust the composition of our Tier 1 capital by increasing the Tier 1 common equity portion by $2.2 billion. The additional common equity was necessary to maintain Tier 1 common equity at 4% of risk weighted assets under the more adverse scenario, as specified by a new regulatory standard that was introduced as part of the stress test. They also intend the additional common equity to serve as a buffer against higher losses than generally expected and to allow such bank holding companies to remain well capitalized and able to lend to creditworthy borrowers should such losses materialize. Our 2009 actual credit losses were significantly less than the projections utilized in the SCAP process. As a result of the Federal Reserve establishing this capital target, we successfully completed a capital plan during the second quarter of 2009 that adjusted the composition of our Tier 1 capital by increasing the portion that is composed of Tier 1 common equity. The capital plan consisted of various transactions that generated an additional $2.3 billion in Tier 1 common 51 Table of Contents equity; $2.1 billion of which was raised in the second quarter. The transactions utilized to increase our Tier 1 common equity consisted of the issuance of common stock, gains realized upon the purchase of certain of our preferred stock and hybrid debt securities, and the sale of Visa Class B shares. The common stock offering raised $1.8 billion in Tier 1 common equity, the purchase of hybrid debt securities created an addition to Tier 1 common equity of $120.8 million, and the gain in connection with sale of the Visa Class B shares resulted in an addition to Tier 1 common equity of $70.1 million. While increasing our total and Tier 1 capital, the results of the common stock offering also diluted our common share count and related book value per share. The 142 million new shares issued in the common offering significantly contributed to the $13.45 decrease from prior year end, to $35.29, in our book value per common share and the $6.10 decrease from prior year end in our tangible book value per common share to $22.59 at December 31, 2009. We declared and paid common dividends totaling $82.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, or $0.22 per common share, compared to $1.0 billion, or $2.85 per common share, during 2008. In addition, we declared dividends payable during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 of $14.1 million and $22.3 million, respectively, on our Series A preferred stock. Further, during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we declared dividends payable of $242.7 million and $22.8 million, respectively, to the U.S. Treasury on the Series C and D Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury. During the year, we reduced the common share dividend to $0.01 per share, per quarter where it remained as of the most recent common share dividend declaration in December 2009. It is not likely that we will increase our dividend until we have returned to profitability and obtained the consent of our applicable regulators as further described below. In connection with the issuances of the Series A Preferred Stock of SunTrust Banks, Inc., the Fixed to Floating Rate Normal Preferred Purchase Securities of SunTrust Preferred Capital I, the 6.10% Enhanced Trust Preferred Securities of SunTrust Capital VIII, and the 7.875% Trust Preferred securities of SunTrust Capital IX (collectively, the Issued Securities), we entered into RCCs. The RCCs limit our ability to repay, redeem or repurchase the Issued Securities (or certain related securities). We executed each of the RCC in favor of the holders of certain debt securities, who are initially the holders of our 6% Subordinated Notes due 2026. The RCCs are more fully described in Current Reports on Form 8 K filed on September 12, 2006, November 6, 2006, December 6, 2006, and March 4, 2008. In connection with the issuance of the Series C and D Preferred Stock of SunTrust Banks, Inc. we agreed to certain terms affecting repurchase, redemption, and repayment of the preferred stock and restriction on payment of common stock dividends, among other terms. We are subject to certain restrictions on our ability to increase the dividend as a result of participating in the U.S. Treasurys CPP. Generally, we may not pay a regular quarterly cash dividend more than $0.77 per share of common stock prior to November 14, 2011, unless either (i) we have redeemed the Series C and Series D Preferred Stock, (ii) the U.S. Treasury has transferred the Series C and Series D Preferred Stock to a third party, or (iii) the U.S. Treasury consents to the payment of such dividends in excess of such amount. Additionally, if we increase our quarterly dividend above $0.54 per share prior to the tenth anniversary of our participation in the CPP, then the exercise price and the number of shares to be issued upon exercise of the warrants issued in connection with our participation in the CPP will be proportionately adjusted. The amount of such adjustment will be determined by a formula and depends in part on the extent to which we raise our dividend. The formulas are contained in the warrant agreements. There also exists limits on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to SunTrust Banks, Inc. (the Parent Company). Substantially all of our retained earnings are undistributed earnings of the Bank, which are restricted by various regulations administered by federal and state bank regulatory authorities. There was no capacity for payment of cash dividends to the Parent Company under these regulations at December 31, 2009. Included with the issuance of the Series C and D preferred stock was issuance of ten year warrants to the Treasury to purchase approximately 11.9 million and 6.0 million shares of our common stock at initial exercise prices of $44.15 and $33.70. The preferred stock and related warrants were issued at a total discount of approximately $132 million, which will be accreted into U.S. Treasury preferred dividend expense using the effective yield method over a five year period from each respective issuance date. The terms of the warrants as well as the restrictions related to the issuance of the preferred stock is more fully described in Current Reports on Form 8 K filed on November 17, 2008 and January 2, 2009. ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT In the normal course of business, we are exposed to various risks. To manage the major risks that we face and to provide reasonable assurance that key business objectives will be achieved, we have established an enterprise risk governance process and the SunTrust Enterprise Risk Program. Moreover, we have policies and various risk management processes designed to effectively identify, monitor and manage risk. We continually refine and enhance our risk management policies, processes and procedures to maintain effective risk management and governance, including identification, measurement, monitoring, control, mitigation and reporting of all material risks. Over the last several years, we have enhanced risk measurement applications and systems capabilities that provide management information on whether we are being appropriately compensated for the risk profile we have adopted. We balance our strategic goals, including revenue and profitability objectives, with the risks associated with achieving our goals. Effective risk management is an important element supporting our business decision making. 52 Table of Contents Corporate Risk Managements focus is on synthesizing, assessing, reporting and mitigating the full set of risks at the enterprise level, and providing senior management with a holistic picture of the organizations risk profile. We have implemented an enterprise risk management framework that has improved our ability to manage our aggregate risk profile. At the core of the framework is our risk vision and risk mission. Risk Vision: To deliver sophisticated risk management capabilities that are consistent with those of top tier financial institutions and that support the needs of SunTrust business units. Risk Mission: To measure, monitor and manage risk throughout SunTrust to ensure that risk at the transaction, portfolio and institution levels is viewed consistently in order to optimize risk adjusted return decision making. The Board of Directors is wholly responsible for oversight of our corporate risk governance process. The Risk Committee of the Board assists the Board of Directors in executing this responsibility. The CRO reports to the Chief Executive Officer and is responsible for the oversight of the Corporate Risk Management organization as well as the risk governance processes. The CRO provides overall leadership, vision and direction for our enterprise risk management framework. In addition, the CRO provides regular risk assessments to the Risk Committee of the Board and to the full Board of Directors, and provides other information to Executive Management and the Board, as requested. The risk governance framework incorporates a variety of senior management risk related committees. These committees are responsible for ensuring effective risk measurement and management in their respective areas of authority. These committees include: CRC, ALCO, PRAC, and the SunTrust Enterprise Risk Program Steering Committee. The CRC is chaired by the CRO and supports the CRO in measuring and managing our aggregate risk profile. The CRC consists of various senior executives and meets on a monthly basis. Organizationally, we measure and oversee risk according to the three traditional risk disciplines of credit risk, market risk (including liquidity risk) and operational risk (including compliance risk). Credit risk programs are overseen by the Chief Wholesale Credit Officer and the Chief Retail Credit Officer. Market risk programs are overseen by the Chief Market Risk Officer. Operational risk programs are overseen by the Chief Operational Risk Officer. The three risk disciplines are overseen on a consolidated basis under our enterprise risk management framework, which also takes into consideration legal and reputation risk factors. The SunTrust Enterprise Risk Program continues to ensure that the approach and plans for risk management are aligned to the vision and mission of Corporate Risk Management. In addition, the SunTrust Enterprise Risk Programs goal is to ensure our future compliance with the Basel II Capital Accord. Key objectives of the SunTrust Enterprise Risk Program include incorporating risk management principles that encompass our values and standards and that are designed to guide risk taking activity, maximizing performance through the balance of risk and reward and leveraging initiatives driven by regulatory requirements to deliver capabilities to better measure and manage risk. Credit Risk Management Credit risk refers to the potential for economic loss arising from the failure of clients to meet their contractual agreements on all credit instruments, including on balance sheet exposures from loans and leases, investment securities, contingent exposures from unfunded commitments, letters of credit, credit derivatives, and counterparty risk under derivative products. As credit risk is an essential component of many of the products and services we provide to our clients, the ability to accurately measure and manage credit risk is integral to maintain both the long run profitability of our lines of business and our capital adequacy. The Credit Risk Management group manages and monitors extensions of credit risk through initial underwriting processes and periodic reviews which then maintain underwriting standards in accordance with credit policies and procedures. The Corporate Risk Review unit conducts independent risk reviews to ensure active compliance with all policies and procedures. Credit Risk Management periodically reviews our lines of business to monitor asset quality trends and the appropriateness of credit policies. In addition, total borrower exposure limits are established and concentration risk is monitored. Credit risk is partially mitigated through purchase of credit loss protection via third party insurance and use of credit derivatives such as credit default swaps. Borrower/counterparty (obligor) risk and facility risk are evaluated using our risk rating methodology, which has been implemented in all lines of business. We use various risk models in the estimation of expected and unexpected losses. These models incorporate both internal and external default and loss experience. To the extent possible, we collect internal data to ensure the validity, reliability, and accuracy of our risk models used in default and loss estimation. 53 Table of Contents We have made a commitment to maintain and enhance comprehensive credit systems in order to meet business requirements and comply with evolving regulatory standards. As part of a continuous improvement process, Credit Risk Management evaluates potential enhancements to our risk measurement and management tools, implementing them as appropriate along with amended credit policies and procedures. Operational Risk Management We face ongoing and emerging risks and regulations related to the activities that surround the delivery of banking and financial products. Coupled with external influences such as market conditions, fraudulent activities, disasters, security risks, country risk, and legal risk, the potential for operational and reputational loss has increased significantly. We believe that effective management of operational risk defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events plays a major role in both the level and the stability of the profitability of the institution. Our Operational Risk Management function oversees an enterprise wide framework intended to identify, assess, control, quantify, monitor, and report on operational risks company wide. These efforts support our goals in seeking to minimize operational losses and strengthen our performance by optimizing operational capital allocation. Operational Risk Management is overseen by our Chief Operational Risk Officer, who reports directly to the CRO. The corporate governance structure also includes a risk manager and support staff embedded within each line of business and corporate function. These risk managers also report indirectly to the Chief Operational Risk Officer and are responsible for execution of the Operational Risk Management program within their areas. Market Risk Management Market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, and other relevant market rates or prices. Interest rate risk, defined as the exposure of net interest income and MVE to adverse movements in interest rates, is our primary market risk, and mainly arises from the structure of the balance sheet. We are also exposed to market risk in our trading activities, Coke common stock, MSRs, loan warehouse and pipeline, and debt carried at fair value. The ALCO meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing our open positions and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk. The policies established by ALCO are reviewed and approved by our Board. Market Risk from Non Trading Activities The primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk, both within policy limits approved by the Board and within narrower guidelines established by ALCO. These limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both short term and long term horizons. The major sources of our non trading interest rate risk are timing differences in the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities, changes in the shape of the yield curve, and the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options. We measure these risks and their impact by identifying and quantifying exposures through the use of sophisticated simulation and valuation models. One of the primary methods that we use to quantify and manage interest rate risk is simulation analysis, which is used to model net interest income from assets, liabilities, and derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios and balance sheet structures. This analysis measures the sensitivity of net interest income over a two year time horizon. Key assumptions in the simulation analysis (and in the valuation analysis discussed below) relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads, the changes in product balances and the behavior of loan and deposit clients in different rate environments. This analysis incorporates several assumptions, the most material of which relate to the repricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate or non contractual maturities. As the future path of interest rates cannot be known in advance, we use simulation analysis to project net interest income under various interest rate scenarios including implied forward and deliberately extreme and perhaps unlikely scenarios. The analyses may include rapid and gradual ramping of interest rates, rate shocks, basis risk analysis, and yield curve twists. Each analysis incorporates what management believes to be the most appropriate assumptions about client behavior in an interest rate scenario. Specific strategies are also analyzed to determine their impact on net interest income levels and sensitivities. 54 Table of Contents The sensitivity analysis included below is measured as a percentage change in net interest income due to an instantaneous 100 basis point move in benchmark interest rates. Estimated changes set forth below are dependent upon material assumptions such as those previously discussed. The net interest income profile reflects a fairly neutral interest rate sensitivity position with respect to an instantaneous 100 basis point change in rates. Economic Perspective Rate Change (Basis Points) Estimated % Change inNet Interest Income Over 12 Months December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 +100 0.0% 3.5% 100 0.1% (0.1%) The recognition of interest rate sensitivity from an economic perspective (above) is different from a financial reporting perspective (below) due to certain interest rate swaps that are used as economic hedges for fixed rate debt. The above profile includes the recognition of the net interest payments from these swaps, while the profile below does not include the net interest payments. The swaps are accounted for as trading assets and therefore, the benefit to income due to a decline in short term interest rates will be recognized as a gain in the fair value of the swaps and will be recorded as an increase in trading account profits/(losses) and commissions from a financial reporting perspective. Financial Reporting Perspective Rate Change (Basis Points) Estimated % Change inNet Interest Income Over 12 Months December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 +100 0.5% 4.2% 100 (0.3%) (1.3%) The difference from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009 seen above in both the economic and financial reporting perspectives related to a 100 basis point shock is primarily due to the significant decline in our higher cost fixed rate funding and brokered deposits year over year as well as a reduction in floating rate assets. We also perform valuation analysis, which is used for discerning levels of risk present in the balance sheet and derivative positions that might not be taken into account in the net interest income simulation analysis. Whereas net interest income simulation highlights exposures over a relatively short time horizon, valuation analysis incorporates all cash flows over the estimated remaining life of all balance sheet and derivative positions. The valuation of the balance sheet, at a point in time, is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows and derivative cash flows minus the discounted value of liability cash flows, the net of which is referred to as MVE. The sensitivity of MVE to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of the longer term repricing risk and options risk embedded in the balance sheet. Similar to the net interest income simulation, MVE uses instantaneous changes in rates. MVE values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the growth assumptions that are used in the net interest income simulation model. As with the net interest income simulation model, assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are critical in the MVE analysis. Particularly important are the assumptions driving prepayments and the expected changes in balances and pricing of the indeterminate deposit portfolios. As of December 31, 2009, the MVE profile indicates modest changes with respect to an instantaneous 100 basis point change in rates. Rate Shock (Basis Points) Estimated % Change in MVE December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 +100 (4.2%) (4.2%) 100 2.3% 1.8% While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under an extremely adverse scenario, we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact. Since MVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in MVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current fiscal year). Further, MVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in 55 Table of Contents yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. The net interest income simulation and valuation analyses do not include actions that management may undertake to manage this risk in response to anticipated changes in interest rates. Trading Activities Trading instruments are used as part of our overall balance sheet management strategies and to support client requirements through our broker/dealer subsidiary. Product offerings to clients include debt securities, loans traded in the secondary market, equity securities, derivatives and foreign exchange contracts, and similar financial instruments. Other trading activities include acting as a market maker in certain debt and equity securities and related derivatives. Typically, we maintain a securities inventory to facilitate client transactions. Also in the normal course of business, we assume a limited degree of market risk in hedging strategies. We have developed policies and procedures to manage market risk associated with trading, capital markets and foreign exchange activities using a VAR approach that determines total exposure arising from interest rate risk, equity risk, foreign exchange risk, spread risk, and volatility risk. For trading portfolios, VAR measures the estimated maximum loss from a trading position, given a specified confidence level and time horizon. VAR exposures and actual results are monitored daily for each trading portfolio. Our VAR calculation measures the potential losses using a 99% confidence level with a one day holding period. This means that, on average, losses are expected to exceed VAR two or three times per year. We had zero backtest exceptions to our overall VAR during the last twelve months. The following table displays high, low, and average VAR for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Average VAR $20.7 $28.5 High VAR $27.6 $42.3 Low VAR $14.8 $16.5 The lower average VAR during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 is primarily due to sales, paydowns and maturities of acquired illiquid assets. Trading assets net of trading liabilities averaged $4.7 billion and $7.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Trading assets net of trading liabilities were $2.8 billion and $7.2 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Declines in average and ending trading assets net of trading liabilities is primarily due to balance sheet management activities and the reduction in acquired illiquid assets. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk of being unable to meet obligations as they come due at a reasonable funding cost. We mitigate this risk by attempting to structure our balance sheet prudently and by maintaining diverse borrowing resources to fund potential cash needs. For example, we structure our balance sheet so that we fund less liquid assets, such as loans, with stable funding sources, such as retail deposits, long term debt, wholesale deposits, and capital. We assess liquidity needs arising from asset growth, maturing obligations, and deposit withdrawals, considering operations in both the normal course of business and times of unusual events. In addition, we consider our off balance sheet arrangements and commitments that may impact liquidity in certain business environments. Our ALCO measures liquidity risks, sets policies to manage these risks, and reviews adherence to those policies at its monthly meetings. For example, we manage the use of short term unsecured borrowings as well as total wholesale funding through policies established and reviewed by ALCO. In addition, the Risk Committee of our Board sets liquidity limits and reviews current and forecasted liquidity positions at each of its regularly scheduled meetings. We have contingency funding plans that assess liquidity needs that may arise from certain stress events such as credit rating downgrades, rapid asset growth, and financial market disruptions. Our contingency plans also provide for continuous monitoring of net borrowed funds dependence and available sources of contingent liquidity. These sources of contingent liquidity include capacity to borrow at the Federal Reserve discount window and from the FHLB system and the ability to sell, pledge or borrow against unencumbered securities in the Banks investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2009, the potential liquidity from these three sources totaled $31.6 billion an amount we believe exceeds any contingent liquidity needs. Uses of Funds. Our primary uses of funds include the extension of loans and credit, the purchase of investment securities, working capital, and debt and capital service. In addition, contingent uses of funds may arise from events such as financial market disruptions or credit rating downgrades. Factors that affect our credit ratings include, but are not limited to, the credit risk profile of our assets, the adequacy of our loan loss reserves, earnings, the liquidity profile of both the Bank and the Parent Company, the economic environment, particularly related to our markets, and the adequacy of our capital base. 56 Table of Contents The Bank and the Parent Company experienced credit rating downgrades from Moodys, S&P, and Fitch during the first half of 2009. As of December 31, 2009, the senior, long term debt ratings for the Bank were A2, A and A from Moodys, S&P and Fitch, respectively. The comparable senior, long term debt ratings for the Parent Company as of December 31, 2009 were Baa1, BBB+ and A . The Banks corresponding short term ratings were P 1, A 2, and F1 (Moodys, S&P and Fitch), while the Parent Companys short term ratings were P 2, A 2 and F1, respectively. S&Ps April downgrade of the Banks short term credit rating from A 1 to A 2 materially impacted some of our business activities. The activities most affected were two off balance sheet businesses: our ABCP conduit, Three Pillars, and our VRDO remarketing operation, both of which depend upon the support of investors who primarily purchase obligations rated A 1 or equivalent. The Bank and the Parent Company have purchased certain amounts of Three Pillars overnight CP at estimated market rates, on a discretionary and non contractual basis (See Note 11, Certain Transfers of Financial Assets, Mortgage Servicing Rights and Variable Interest Entities, in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). We did not own any of the outstanding Three Pillars CP as of December 31, 2009. We conduct remarketing of municipal securities known as VRDOs. The terms of the VRDOs allow investors to put or tender the securities for repayment prior to maturity. The Bank backs most of these securities with letters of credit that provide liquidity in the event of this early repayment. After the S&P downgrade in April, a substantial portion of our VRDO investors tendered their bonds for repayment, which required the Bank to provide liquidity by funding the letters of credit backing the tendered VRDOs. The Banks contingency funding plans anticipated this potential use of liquidity, and the Bank secured ample liquidity for the VRDO program as the funded loans came on to our balance sheet. As the year came to a close, this use of Bank liquidity declined as investor demand for remarketed VRDOs increased and VRDO clients were able to find alternative sources of funding. The Bank and the Parent Company borrow in the money markets using instruments such as Fed funds, Eurodollars, or CP. Lenders in these unsecured instruments extend credit lines to borrowers based in large part upon the borrowers credit ratings from the three large nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations. After the S&P downgrade in April, the Bank experienced a decrease in its available credit lines which reduced its depth of access and slightly increased its cost of borrowing in these instruments. The Banks conservative liquidity profile and prudent liquidity management greatly mitigated the impact of the downgrade on its daily money markets funding activities and costs. During the fourth quarter, the Parent Company had no CP outstanding and the Bank was a net lender into short term money markets. On February 1, 2010, S&P downgraded our senior, long term debt Bank and Parent Company ratings from A and BBB+, respectively, to BBB+ and BBB, respectively. Our short term ratings remained unchanged at A 2. S&P cited expectations of continued stress in and high exposure to residential mortgages, especially in Florida, as the primary factor in its decision to downgrade our long term ratings. However, concurrent with the downgrade, S&P changed the outlook on our credit ratings to stable noting our strong franchise, good liquidity and funding profile, and commercial loan portfolio performance that was in line with their expectations. Our business activities have not been materially impacted as a result of this recent downgrade by S&P. Sources of Funds. Our primary sources of funds include a large, stable retail deposit base. Core deposits, primarily gathered from our retail branch network, are our largest and most cost effective source of funding. During 2009, the Bank experienced strong core deposit growth. Core deposits totaled $116.3 billion as of December 31, 2009, up from $105.3 billion as of December 31, 2008. The Bank used core deposit growth to replace short term wholesale funding, contributing to the Banks strong liquidity position. We also maintain access to a diversified base of wholesale funding sources. These uncommitted sources include Fed funds purchased from other banks, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, negotiable certificates of deposit, offshore deposits, FHLB advances, global bank notes, and CP. Aggregate wholesale funding totaled $28.2 billion as of December 31, 2009 reduced from $44.0 billion as of December 31, 2008. Net short term unsecured borrowings, which includes wholesale domestic and foreign deposits and Fed funds purchased, totaled $8.9 billion as of December 31, 2009, down from $14.2 billion as of December 31, 2008. An additional source of wholesale liquidity is our access to the capital markets. The Parent Company maintains an SEC shelf registration statement from which it may issue senior or subordinated notes, and various capital securities such as common or preferred stock. The current shelf allows the Parent Company to issue up to $3 billion of such securities. The Bank maintains a Global Bank Note program under which it may issue senior or subordinated debt with various terms. As of December 31, 2009, the Bank had capacity to issue $30.9 billion of notes under the Global Bank Note program. Borrowings under these programs are designed to appeal primarily to domestic and international institutional investors. Institutional investor demand for these securities is dependent upon numerous factors, including but not limited to our credit ratings and investor perception of financial market conditions and the health of the banking sector. Our capacity under these programs refers to authorization granted by our Board, and does not refer to a commitment to purchase by any investor. 57 Table of Contents Parent Company Liquidity. We measure Parent Company liquidity by comparing sources of liquidity from short term assets, such as unencumbered and other investment securities and cash, relative to short term liabilities, which include overnight sweep funds, seasoned long term debt, and CP. As of December 31, 2009, the Parent Company had $2.6 billion in such sources compared to short term debt of $1.6 billion. As of December 31, 2009, the Parent Company also had approximately $5 billion in U.S. Treasury securities that were purchased in the fourth quarter of 2009 in anticipation of repayment of TARP. We also manage the Parent Companys liquidity by structuring its maturity schedule to minimize the amount of debt maturing within a short period of time. Approximately $300 million of Parent Company debt matured in October 2009 and $300 million is scheduled to mature during 2010. Much of the Parent Companys liabilities are long term in nature, coming from the proceeds of our capital securities and long term senior and subordinated notes. The primary uses of Parent Company liquidity include debt service, dividends on capital instruments, the periodic purchase of investment securities, and loans to our subsidiaries. We believe the Parent Company holds ample cash to satisfy these working capital needs. We fund corporate dividends primarily with dividends from our banking subsidiary. We are subject to both state and federal banking regulations that limit our ability to pay common stock dividends in certain circumstances. In the context of the recent economic recession and credit market turmoil, we reduced our quarterly common stock dividend. Effective for the quarterly dividend paid in September 2009, the common stock dividend was $0.01 per share. It is not likely that we will increase our quarterly dividend until we have returned to profitability and obtained the consent from our applicable regulators. Recent Market and Regulatory Developments. Financial market conditions remained under a state of stress during much of 2009. As a result, the federal banking regulatory agencies reviewed the nineteen largest U.S. banks pursuant to the SCAP, which is discussed in greater detail in the Capital Resources section of this MD&A. Pursuant to the SCAP results, we executed several transactions as part of a formalized capital plan approved by the Federal Reserve that increased Tier 1 common equity by $2.3 billion and incidentally raised liquidity at both the Parent Company and the Bank. The transactions included the sale of $1.8 billion of common stock, a $750 million cash tender for certain hybrid debt securities, and the sale of various corporate assets. The sale of additional shares of common stock, through both at the market and marketed offerings, provided substantial additional long term liquidity to the Parent Company. The purchase of hybrid debt securities used approximately $525.0 million of Parent Company liquidity since these hybrid securities were obligations of the Parent Company. The net effect of these capital actions was to increase Parent Company liquidity by approximately $1.3 billion. Moreover, the aforementioned asset sales also generated $0.1 billion of liquidity at the Bank. Other Liquidity Considerations. As detailed in Table 16, we had an aggregate potential obligation of $72.1 billion to our clients in unused lines of credit at December 31, 2009. Commitments to extend credit are arrangements to lend to clients who have complied with predetermined contractual obligations. We also had $9.0 billion in letters of credit as of December 31, 2009, most of which are standby letters of credit, which require that we provide funding if certain future events occur. Our lines and letters of credit have declined since December 31, 2008 due to our decision to reduce exposure to certain higher risk areas, as well as due to clients decision not to renew their lines and letters of credit as a result of their decreased need for these facilities as they pay down their debt and reduce their need for working capital. Approximately $5.5 billion of these letters as of December 31, 2009 supported VRDOs, as previously discussed. In addition, at December 31, 2009, lines of credit totaling approximately $3.8 billion supported CP issued by Three Pillars to investors not affiliated with us or Three Pillars. No amounts are currently outstanding related to Three Pillars lines of credit. For more information about Three Pillars, see Note 11, Certain Transfers of Financial Assets, Mortgage Servicing Rights and Variable Interest Entities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In the third quarter of 2009, the FDIC, in response to the need to replenish DIF balances that declined as a result of recent bank failures, announced details of a plan to restore DIF balances. The restoration plan, as subsequently approved, required all FDIC insured banks to prepay their risk based assessments for the years 2010, 2011, and 2012. The assessments, usually due quarterly, were instead required to be estimated for the three future years and paid prior to December 31, 2009. In conjunction with the adoption of this rule, the FDIC also approved a three basis point increase in assessment rates effective on January 1, 2011. Our estimate of three future years of assessments under this restoration plan was $924.8 million with the estimated assessment for 2010 calculated at current rates. We paid that assessment to the FDIC on December 29, 2009 and concurrently recorded a prepaid asset in that amount within other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We anticipate funding any differences between our prepayment and actual amounts due each quarter using our existing available liquidity. Certain provisions of long term debt agreements and the lines of credit prevent us from creating liens on, disposing of, or issuing (except to related parties) voting stock of subsidiaries. Further, there are restrictions on mergers, consolidations, certain leases, sales or transfers of assets, and minimum shareholders equity ratios. As of December 31, 2009, we were and expect to remain in compliance with all covenants and provisions of these debt agreements. As of December 31, 2009, our cumulative UTBs amounted to $160.6 million. Interest related to UTBs was $39.3 million as of December 31, 2009. These UTBs represent the difference between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax 58 Table of Contents returns and the benefits recognized and measured in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance for income taxes. The UTBs are based on various tax positions in several jurisdictions and, if taxes related to these positions are ultimately paid, the payments would be made from our normal, operating cash flows, likely over multiple years.

Other Market Risk Other sources of market risk include the risk associated with holding residential and commercial mortgage loans prior to selling them into the secondary market, commitments to clients to make mortgage loans that will be sold to the secondary market, and our investment in MSRs. We manage the risks associated with the residential and commercial mortgage loans classified as held for sale (i.e., the warehouse) and our IRLCs on residential loans intended for sale. The warehouses and IRLCs consist primarily of fixed and adjustable rate single family residential and commercial real estate loans. The risk associated with the warehouses and IRLCs is the potential change in interest rates between the time the customer locks in the rate on the anticipated loan and the time the loan is sold on the secondary market, which is typically 60 150 days. We manage interest rate risk predominantly with interest rate swaps, futures, and forward sale agreements, where the changes in value of the instruments substantially offset the changes in value of the warehouse and the IRLCs. The IRLCs on residential mortgage loans intended for sale are classified as free standing derivative financial instruments and are not designated as hedge accounting relationships. MSRs are the present value of future net cash flows that are expected to be received from the mortgage servicing portfolio. The value of MSRs is highly dependent upon the assumed prepayment speed of the mortgage servicing portfolio which is driven by the level of certain key interest rates, primarily the 30 year current coupon par mortgage rate known as the par mortgage rate. Future expected net cash flows from servicing a loan in the mortgage servicing portfolio would not be realized if the loan pays off earlier than anticipated. Given the current economic environment, the level of prepayments has slowed. We historically have not actively hedged MSRs, but have managed the market risk through our overall asset/liability management process with consideration to the natural counter cyclicality of servicing and production that occurs as interest rates rise and fall over time with the economic cycle as well as with securities available for sale. However, as of January 1, 2009, we designated the 2008 MSRs vintage and all future MSRs production at fair value. In addition, as of January 1, 2010, we designated at fair value the remaining MSR portfolio being carried at LOCOM. Upon designating the remaining MSRs at fair value, we recognized a cumulative effect adjustment increase in retained earnings, net of taxes, of $88.5 million. The decision to designate the portfolio at fair value, key economic assumptions, and the sensitivity of the current fair value of the MSRs as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 is discussed in greater detail in Note 11, Certain Transfers of Financial Assets, Mortgage Servicing Rights and Variable Interest Entities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Relative to the fair value portion of our retained MSRs, we designated $187.8 million at January 1, 2009 and added $681.8 million of new production during 2009. We recorded an increase in fair value of $65.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, including decay resulting from the realization of expected monthly net servicing cash flows. The MSRs being carried at fair value total $935.6 million as of December 31, 2009 and are managed within established risk limits 59 Table of Contents and are monitored as part of various governance processes. We recorded losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss) related to fair value MSRs of $21.9 million for year ended December 31, 2009, inclusive of the mark to market adjustments on the related hedges. Relative to the LOCOM portion of our retained MSRs, an impairment recovery gain was recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss) of $199.2 million during 2009. As of December 31, 2009, we held $603.8 million of LOCOM MSRs with a fair value of $748.5 million. As discussed above, this class of MSRs was designated at fair value as of January 1, 2010. We also have market risk from capital stock we hold in the FHLB of Atlanta and Cincinnati and from capital stock we hold in the Federal Reserve Bank. In order to be an FHLB member, we are required to purchase capital stock in the FHLB. In exchange, members take advantage of competitively priced advances as a wholesale funding source and access grants and low cost loans for affordable housing and community development projects, amongst other benefits. As of December 31, 2009, we held a total of $343.3 million of capital stock in the FHLB. During 2009, we reduced our capital stock holdings in the FHLB by $149.9 million. In order to become a member of the Federal Reserve System, regulations require that we hold a certain amount of capital stock as a percentage of the Banks capital. During 2009, we held $360.4 million of Federal Reserve Bank capital stock. For a detailed overview regarding actions taken to address the risk from changes in equity prices associated with our investment in Coke common stock, see Investment in Common Shares of the Coca Cola Company, in this MD&A. We also hold, as of December 31, 2009, a total of approximately $207.7 million of private equity investments that include direct investments and limited partnerships. We hold these investments as long term investments and make additional contributions based on our contractual commitments but have decided to limit investments into new private equity investments. Impairment charges could occur if deteriorating conditions in the market persist, including, but not limited to, goodwill and other intangibles impairment charges and increased charges with respect to OREO. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS See discussion of off balance sheet arrangements in Note 11, Certain Transfers of Financial Assets, Mortgage Servicing Rights and Variable Interest Entities and Note 18, Reinsurance Arrangements and Guarantees, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS In the normal course of business, we enter into certain contractual obligations, including obligations to make future payments on debt and lease arrangements, contractual commitments for capital expenditures, and service contracts. Table 17 summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2009, except for pension and other postretirement benefit plans, included in Note 16, Employee Benefit Plans, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

As of December 31, 2009, our cumulative UTBs amounted to $160.6 million. Interest related to UTBs was $39.3 million as of December 31, 2009. We are under continuous examination by various tax authorities. We are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the periods of cash settlement because it is not possible to reasonably predict, with respect to periods for which the statutes of limitations are open, the amount of tax and interest (if any) that might be assessed by a tax authority or the timing of an assessment or payment. It is also not possible to reasonably predict whether or not the applicable statutes of limitations might expire without us being examined by any particular tax authority. 60 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our significant accounting policies are described in detail in Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements and are integral to understanding MD&A. We have identified certain accounting policies as being critical because (1) they require our judgment about matters that are highly uncertain and (2) different estimates that could be reasonably applied would result in materially different assessments with respect to ascertaining the valuation of assets, liabilities, commitments, and contingencies. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, valuing an asset or liability, or reducing a liability. Our accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and they conform to general practices within the financial services industry. We have established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The following is a description of our current critical accounting policies. Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses The ALLL represents our estimate of probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio. The ALLL is increased by the provision for credit losses and reduced by loans charged off, net of recoveries. The ALLL is determined based on our review and evaluation of larger loans that meet our definition of impairment and the current risk characteristics of pools of homogeneous loans (i.e., loans having similar characteristics) within the loan portfolio and our assessment of internal and external influences on credit quality that are not fully reflected in the historical loss or risk rating data. Larger nonaccrual loans and certain consumer, commercial, and commercial real estate loans whose terms have been modified in a TDR, are individually evaluated to determine the amount of specific allowance required using the most probable source of repayment, including the present value of the loans expected future cash flows, the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs of disposition, or the loans estimated market value. In these measurements, we use assumptions and methodologies that are relevant to estimating the level of impaired and unrealized losses in the portfolio. To the extent that the data supporting such assumptions has limitations, our judgment and experience play a key role in enhancing the specific ALLL estimates. Key judgments used in determining the allowance for credit losses include internal risk ratings, market and collateral values, discount rates, loss rates, and our view of current economic conditions. General allowances are established for loans and leases grouped into pools that have similar characteristics, including smaller balance homogeneous loans. The ALLL Committee estimates probable losses by evaluating quantitative and qualitative factors, including net charge off trends, internal risk ratings, loss forecasts, collateral values, geographic location, borrower FICO scores, delinquency rates, nonperforming and restructured loans, origination channel, product mix, underwriting practices, industry conditions, and economic trends. Our financial results are affected by the changes in and the absolute level of the ALLL. This process involves our analysis of complex internal and external variables, and it requires that we exercise judgment to estimate an appropriate ALLL. As a result of the uncertainty associated with this subjectivity, we cannot assure the precision of the amount reserved, should we experience sizeable loan or lease losses in any particular period. For example, changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers, economic conditions, or the condition of various markets in which collateral may be sold could require us to significantly decrease or increase the level of the ALLL. Such an adjustment could materially affect net income as a result of the change in provision for credit losses. During 2008 and 2009, we experienced increases in delinquencies and net charge offs in residential real estate loans due to the deterioration of the housing market. The ALLL considered these market conditions in deriving the estimated ALLL; however, given the continued economic difficulties, the ultimate amount of loss could vary from that estimate. For additional discussion of the ALLL see the Provision for Credit Losses, Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses, and Nonperforming Assets sections in this MD&A. Estimates of Fair Value Certain of our assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The extent to which we use fair value on a recurring basis was significantly expanded upon the election to begin to carry certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value beginning in 2007. Examples of recurring uses of fair value include derivative instruments, available for sale and trading securities, certain held for investment and held for sale loans, certain issuances of long term debt, certain classes of the MSR asset, and residual interests from Company sponsored securitizations. We also measure certain assets at fair value on a non recurring basis either when such assets are carried at the LOCOM, to evaluate assets for impairment, or for disclosure purposes. Examples of these non recurring uses of fair value include certain LHFS and MSRs accounted for at the LOCOM, OREO, goodwill, intangible assets, nonmarketable equity securities, and long lived assets. Depending on the nature of the asset or liability, we use various valuation techniques and assumptions when estimating fair value. 61 Table of Contents Fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Estimating fair value requires that we make a number of significant judgments. Where observable market prices for identical assets or liabilities are not available, we identify what we believe to be similar assets or liabilities. If observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain for any such similar assets or liabilities, then fair value is estimated using modeling techniques, such as discounted cash flow analyses. These modeling techniques incorporate our assessments regarding assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability, including market based assumptions, such as interest rates, as well as assumptions about the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique, the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset, market liquidity, and the risk of nonperformance. In certain cases, our assessments with respect to assumptions that market participants would make may be inherently difficult to determine and the use of different assumptions could result in material changes to these fair value measurements. Various processes and controls have been adopted to determine that appropriate methodologies, techniques and assumptions are used in the development of fair value estimates. These processes include independent price verification, model validation, and corroborating prices from third parties when possible. The use of significant, unobservable inputs in our models is described in Note 20, Fair Value Election and Measurement, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In certain instances, we use discount rates in our determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities such as retirement and other postretirement benefit obligations, MSRs, and certain financial instruments. Discount rates used are those considered to be commensurate with the risks involved. A change in these discount rates could increase or decrease the values of those assets and liabilities. The fair value of MSRs is based on discounted cash flow analyses. We provide disclosure of the key economic assumptions used to measure MSRs and residual interests and a sensitivity analysis to adverse changes to these assumptions in Note 11, Certain Transfers of Financial Assets, Mortgage Servicing Rights and Variable Interest Entities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. A detailed discussion of key variables, including the discount rate, used in the determination of retirement and other postretirement obligations is contained in the Pension Accounting section below. In estimating the fair values for investment securities and most derivative financial instruments, we believe that observable market prices are the best evidence of exit price. If such market prices are not available on the exact securities that we own, fair values are based on the market prices of similar instruments, third party broker quotes or are estimated using industry standard or proprietary models whose inputs may be unobservable. The distressed market conditions associated with this economic recession have impacted our ability to obtain market pricing data for certain of our investments. Even when market pricing has been available, the reduced trading activity resulting from current market conditions has challenged the observability of these quotations. When fair values are estimated based on internal models, we will consider relevant market indices that correlate to the underlying collateral, along with assumptions such as liquidity discounts, interest rates, prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severity rates, and discount rates. The fair values of loans held for investment recorded at fair value and LHFS are based on observable current market prices in the secondary loan market in which loans trade, as either whole loans or as ABS. When securities prices are obtained in the secondary loan market, we will translate these prices into whole loan prices by incorporating adjustments for estimated credit enhancement costs, loan servicing fees, and various other transformation costs, when material. The fair value of a loan is impacted by the nature of the asset and the market liquidity. When estimating fair value for loans that do not trade in an active market, we will make assumptions about prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severity rates, and liquidity discounts. Absent comparable current market data, we believe that the fair value derived from these various approaches is a reasonable approximation of the prices that we would receive upon sale of the loans. The fair values of OREO and other repossessed assets are typically determined based on recent appraisals by third parties and other market information, less estimated selling costs. Estimates of fair value are also required when performing an impairment analysis of goodwill, intangible assets and long lived assets. For long lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. In determining the fair value, management uses models which require assumptions about growth rates, the life of the asset, and or the market value of the assets. We test long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that our carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill In 2008, our reporting units were comprised of Retail, Commercial, Commercial Real Estate, Mortgage, Corporate and Investment Banking, Wealth and Investment Management, and Affordable Housing. We changed our business segments in 2009. Among other changes, we combined the Consumer Lending business unit with the Mortgage reporting unit and renamed the combined unit as Household Lending; previously Consumer Lending was included in the Retail reporting unit. See Note 22, Business Segment Reporting to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion regarding the changes to our reportable segments. 62 Table of Contents We review the goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment on an annual basis, or more often, if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value of its equity. The goodwill impairment analysis estimates the fair value of equity using discounted cash flow analyses which require assumptions, as well as guideline company and guideline transaction information, where available. The inputs and assumptions specific to each reporting unit are incorporated in the valuations including projections of future cash flows, discount rates, the fair value of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities, and applicable valuation multiples based on the guideline information. We assess the reasonableness of the estimated fair value of the reporting units by giving consideration to our market capitalization over a reasonable period of time; however, due to the significant and unprecedented volatility in market capitalization of the financial institutions sector, supplemental information is applied based on observable multiples from guideline transactions, adjusting to reflect our specific factors, as well as current market conditions. Based on our latest annual impairment analysis of goodwill, we believe that the fair value for all reporting units is substantially in excess of the respective reporting units carrying value, with the exception of Corporate and Investment Banking which had a fair value that exceeded carrying value by 6%. Valuation Techniques In determining the fair value of our reporting units, we primarily use discounted cash flow analyses, which require assumptions about short and long term net cash flow growth rates for each reporting unit, as well as discount rates. In addition, we apply guideline company and guideline transaction information, where available, to aid in the valuation of certain reporting units. The guideline information is based on publicly available information. A valuation multiple is selected based on a financial benchmarking analysis that compares the reporting units benchmark result with the guideline information. In addition to these financial considerations, qualitative factors such as asset quality, growth opportunities, and overall risk are considered in the ultimate selection of the multiple used to estimate a value on a minority basis. A control premium of 30% is applied to the minority basis value to arrive at the reporting units estimated fair value on a controlling basis. The values separately derived from each valuation technique (i.e., discounted cash flow, guideline company, guideline transaction, and asset accumulation) are used to develop an overall estimate of a reporting units fair value. The discounted cash flow approach is generally weighted 70% and the market based approaches are generally weighted 30%. The weightings may be adjusted based on the degree of relevant market based information. The selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value. Judgment is applied in determining the selection and weightings that are most representative of fair value. Growth Assumptions Multi year financial forecasts are developed for each reporting unit by considering several key business drivers such as new business initiatives, client service and retention standards, market share changes, anticipated loan and deposit growth, forward interest rates, historical performance, and industry and economic trends, among other considerations. The long term growth rate used in determining the terminal value of each reporting unit was estimated at 4% in 2009 based on managements assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit, as well as broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product and inflation. Discount Rate Assumptions Discount rates are estimated based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which considers the risk free interest rate, market risk premium, beta, and in some cases, unsystematic risk and size premium adjustments specific to a particular reporting unit. The sum of the reporting units cash flow projections are used to calculate an overall implied internal rate of return. The implied internal rate of return serves as a baseline for estimating the specific discount rate for each reporting unit. The discount rates are also calibrated based on the assessment of the risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit. In 2009, the discount rates ranged from 13% to 27% as a result of the economic environment causing market dislocation and lower valuation multiples. Estimated Fair Value and Sensitivities The estimated fair value of each reporting unit is derived from the valuation techniques described above. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit is analyzed in relation to numerous market and historical factors, including current economic and market conditions, recent, historical, and implied stock price volatility, marketplace dynamics such as level of short selling, company specific growth opportunities, and an implied control premium. The implied control premium is determined by comparing the aggregate fair value of the reporting units to our market capitalization, measured over a reasonable period of time. We assess the reasonableness of the implied control premium in relation to the market and historical factors previously mentioned, as well as recognizing that the size of the implied control premium is not, independently, a determinative measure to assess the estimated fair values of the reporting units. 63 Table of Contents Economic and market conditions can vary significantly which may cause increased volatility in a companys stock price, resulting in a temporary decline in market capitalization. In those circumstances, current market capitalization may not be an accurate indication of a market participants estimate of entity specific value measured over a reasonable period of time. We believe that this volatility may be tied to market sentiment pertaining to the overall banking sector and concerns regarding dilution of common shareholders, rather than the result of company specific adjustments to cash flows, guideline multiples, or asset values which would have influenced the fair value of reporting units. As a result, the use of market capitalization has become a less relevant measure to assess the reasonableness of the aggregate value of the reporting units. Therefore, we supplement the market capitalization information with other observable market information that provided benchmark valuation multiples from transactions over the last year and a half. These multiples allow us to estimate an aggregate purchase value and implied premium based on current market conditions and the estimated net asset fair value for SunTrust. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions; therefore, in some instances changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value. We perform sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values. Ultimately, future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value. Additionally, a reporting units carrying value of equity could change based on market conditions and the risk profile of those reporting units. In those situations where the carrying value of equity exceeds the estimated fair value, an additional goodwill impairment evaluation is performed which involves calculating the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as goodwill is recognized in a business combination. The fair value of the reporting units assets and liabilities, including previously unrecognized intangible assets, is individually determined. Significant judgment and estimates are involved in estimating the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The excess fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of the reporting units net assets is the implied goodwill. The value of the implied goodwill is highly sensitive to the estimated fair value of the reporting units net assets. The fair value of the reporting units net assets is estimated using a variety of valuation techniques including the following: recent data observed in the market, including similar assets cash flow modeling based on projected cash flows and market discount rates market indices estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral price indications from independent third parties Observable market information is utilized to the extent available and relevant. The estimated fair values reflect managements assumptions regarding how a market participant would value the net assets and includes appropriate credit, liquidity, and market risk premiums that are indicative of the current environment. If the implied fair value of the goodwill for the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the goodwill for the respective reporting unit, no goodwill impairment is recorded. If the carrying amount of a reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. Changes in the estimated fair value of the individual assets and liabilities may result in a different amount of implied goodwill, and ultimately the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. Sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the potential ranges of implied goodwill. The size of the implied goodwill is significantly affected by the estimated fair value of loans. The estimated fair value of a loan portfolio is based on an exit price, and the assumptions used are intended to approximate those that a market participant would use in valuing the loans in an orderly transaction, including a market liquidity discount. The significant market risk premium that is a consequence of distressed market conditions is a significant contributor to valuation discounts associated with loans. Future changes in the fair value of a reporting units net assets could result in future goodwill impairment. For example, to the extent that market liquidity returns and the fair value of the individual assets of a reporting unit increases at a faster rate than the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole, that may cause the implied goodwill of a reporting unit to be lower than the carrying value of goodwill, resulting in goodwill impairment. Income Taxes We are subject to the income tax laws of the various jurisdictions where we conduct business and estimate income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to these various tax jurisdictions. The estimated income tax expense/(benefit) is reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss). The evaluation pertaining to the tax expense and related tax asset and liability balances involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity around the ultimate measurement and resolution of these matters. 64 Table of Contents Accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from tax jurisdictions either currently or in the future and are reported in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We assess the appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent and other pertinent information and maintain tax accruals consistent with our evaluation. Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws, the status of examinations by the tax authorities and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance that could impact the relative merits of tax positions. These changes, when they occur, impact accrued taxes and can materially affect our operating results. We regularly evaluate our uncertain tax positions and estimate the appropriate level of UTBs related to each of these positions. During the fourth quarter, we moved from a net deferred tax liability to a net deferred tax asset of $1.7 million. We regularly evaluate the realizability of deferred tax asset positions. In determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary, we consider the level of taxable income in prior years to the extent that carrybacks are permitted under current tax laws, as well as estimates of future pre tax and taxable income and tax planning strategies that would, if necessary, be implemented. We currently maintain a valuation allowance for certain state NOLs generated by our subsidiaries. We expect to realize our remaining deferred tax assets over the allowable carryback and or carryforward periods. Therefore, no valuation allowance is deemed necessary against our federal or remaining state deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2009. However, if an unanticipated event occurred that materially changed pre tax and taxable income in future periods, an increase in the valuation allowance may become necessary. For additional information, refer to Note 15, Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Accounting Several variables affect the annual variability of cost for our retirement programs. The main variables are: (1) size and characteristics of the employee population, (2) discount rate, (3) expected long term rate of return on plan assets, (4) recognition of actual asset returns, (5) other actuarial assumptions and (6) healthcare cost. Below is a brief description of these variables and the effect they have on our pension costs. Size and Characteristics of the Employee Population Pension cost is directly related to the number of employees covered by the plans, and other factors including salary, age, years of employment, and benefit terms. Effective January 1, 2008, retirement plan participants who were employed as of December 31, 2007 ceased to accrue additional benefits under the existing pension benefit formula and their accrued benefits were frozen. Beginning January 1, 2008, participants who had fewer than 20 years of service and future participants accrue future pension benefits under a cash balance formula that provides compensation and interest credits to a Personal Pension Account. Participants with 20 or more years of service as of December 31, 2007 were given the opportunity to choose between continuing a traditional pension benefit accrual under a reduced formula or participating in the new Personal Pension Account. Discount Rate The discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit obligations. The discount rate for each plan is determined by matching the expected cash flows of each plan to a yield curve based on long term, high quality fixed income debt instruments available as of the measurement date, December 31, 2009. The discount rate for each plan is reset annually or upon occurrence of a triggering event on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions. If we were to assume a 0.25% increase/decrease in the discount rate for all retirement and other postretirement plans, and keep all other assumptions constant, the benefit cost would decrease/ increase by approximately $9.3 million. Expected Long term Rate of Return on Plan Assets Based on historical experience, market projections, and the target asset allocation set forth in the investment policy for the Retirement Plans, the pre tax expected rate of return on plan assets was 8.25% for 2008 and 8.0% for 2009. This expected rate of return is dependent upon the asset allocation decisions made with respect to plan assets. Annual differences, if any, between expected and actual returns are included in the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount. We generally amortize any unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in excess of a 10% corridor in net periodic pension expense over the average future service of active employees, which is approximately seven years, or average future lifetime for plans with no active participants that are frozen. See Note 16, Employee Benefit Plans, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on changes in the pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. If we were to assume a 0.25% increase/decrease in the expected long term rate of return for the retirement and other postretirement plans, holding all other actuarial assumptions constant, the benefit cost would decrease/increase by approximately $6.1 million. 65 Table of Contents Recognition of Actual Asset Returns Accounting guidance allows for the use of an asset value that smoothes investment gains and losses over a period up to five years. However, we have elected to use a preferable method in determining pension cost. This method uses the actual market value of the plan assets. Therefore, we will experience more variability in the annual pension cost, as the asset values will be more volatile than companies who elected to smooth their investment experience. Other Actuarial Assumptions To estimate the projected benefit obligation, actuarial assumptions are required about factors such as mortality rate, turnover rate, retirement rate, disability rate, and the rate of compensation increases. These factors do not tend to change significantly over time, so the range of assumptions, and their impact on pension cost, is generally limited. We annually review the assumptions used based on historical and expected future experience. The interest crediting rate applied to each Personal Pension Account was an annual effective rate of 6.64% from January 1, 2009 through June 30, 2009 and 3.0% from July 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009. Healthcare Cost Assumed healthcare cost trend rates also have an impact on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans. Due to changing medical inflation, it is important to understand the effect of a one percent change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates. If we were to assume a one percent increase in healthcare cost trend rates, the effect on the other postretirement benefit obligation and total interest and service cost would be a $12.9 million and $0.7 million increase, respectively. If we were to assume a one percent decrease in healthcare trend rates, the effect on the other postretirement benefit obligation and total interest and service cost would be a $11.3 million and $0.6 million decrease, respectively. To estimate the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2009, we projected forward the benefit obligations from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2009, adjusting for benefit payments, expected growth in the benefit obligations, changes in key assumptions and plan provisions, and any significant changes in the plan demographics that occurred during the year, including (where appropriate) subsidized early retirements, salary changes different from expectations, entrance of new participants, changes in per capita claims cost, Medicare Part D subsidy, and retiree contributions. 66 Table

been recalculated in accordance with updated accounting guidance related to earnings per share, that was effective January 1, 2009 and required retrospective application . 4Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009, SunTrust began recording the provision for unfunded commitments within the provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss). The provision for unfunded commitments for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $57.2 million. Considering the immateriality of this provision, prior to the fourth quarter of 2009, the provision for unfunded commitments remains classified within other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss). 5The common dividend payout ratio is not calculable in a period of net loss. 67 Table of Contents FOURTH QUARTER 2009 RESULTS We reported a net loss available to common shareholders of $316.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, a decrease of $58.5 million, or 15.6%, compared to the same period of the prior year. The net loss per average common share was $0.64 for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to a net loss of $1.07 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2008. The fourth quarter of 2009 results were adversely impacted by credit related charges and cyclical expenses that reflected recessionary pressures as evidenced by soft revenue and weak loan demand from consumer and commercial borrowers. However, compared to recent quarterly trends, the provision for credit losses declined, deposit mix continued to improve while core deposit volumes grew, net interest margin increased, and certain of our businesses experienced revenue growth. For the fourth quarter of 2009, FTE net interest income was $1,206.8 million, essentially flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 due to a decline in average earning assets which resulted from a reduction in client demand for credit, offset by improvement in the net interest margin. Margin expansion was due to lower rates paid for funds as client deposits increased, the mix of deposits improved, and higher cost sources of funding were reduced. Net interest margin grew from 3.14% in the fourth quarter of 2008 to 3.27% for the same period of 2009. For the fourth quarter of 2009, the provision for credit losses was $973.7 million and included $57.2 million in provision for unfunded commitments. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we elected to change our financial statement presentation to include the provision for unfunded commitments in the provision for credit losses. Previously, the unfunded commitment provision was included in noninterest expense. The provision for loan losses was $46.0 million below the provision for loan losses recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008. On an overall basis, the provision for credit losses increased only slightly as the impact of increased charge offs was largely offset by lower increases to the ALLL. Total noninterest income was $742.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, an increase of $24.6 million, or 3.4%, from the fourth quarter of 2008. This increase was primarily driven by lower market related losses on illiquid securities and other instruments carried at fair value, including our public debt. These lower losses in the fourth quarter of 2009 were largely offset by higher estimated losses related to the potential repurchase of mortgage loans resulting in lower mortgage production income. The fourth quarter of 2009 results include $220.2 million in estimated losses related to the potential repurchase of mortgage loans that were previously sold to third parties compared to $60.4 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008. Although mortgage production related income declined $40.2 million, the decline was partially offset by lower market valuation losses and a 17% increase in loan production during the fourth quarter of 2009. Mortgage servicing income increased $382.8 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, as a result of the $370.0 million temporary impairment recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to MSRs that were carried at the LOCOM compared to a recovery of $10.5 million recognized during the current quarter. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we recorded $72.8 million of net gains from the sale of available for sale securities compared to $411.1 million of net gains from the sale of available for sale securities in the fourth quarter of 2008 that were realized in conjunction with risk management strategies associated with hedging the value of MSRs. Trading account profits/(losses) and commissions increased $30.7 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 as market related valuation losses on illiquid securities and other instruments carried at fair value improved. Valuation losses on our public debt and related hedges carried at fair value were $38.1 million, a reduction of $6.2 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Trust and investment management income increased $8.2 million, or 6.5%, on increased performance based fees; however, retail investment income decreased $15.9 million, or 22.7%, due to lower transaction volume. Total noninterest expense was $1,453.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2009, a decrease of $132.6 million, or 8.4%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease was a result of credit related expenses declining significantly and controllable expenses continuing to be tightly managed. Operating losses declined $210.2 million, or 89.0%, as fraud related credit losses were recorded in the provision for credit losses beginning in the first quarter of 2009. Mortgage reinsurance losses declined $89.7 million, or 89.7%, as we reached the limits of our exposure to reinsurance losses (see Note 18, Reinsurance Arrangements and Guarantees, to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Other credit related expenses including collection and credit costs and other real estate expense increased $58.6 million due to property valuation losses and increased loss mitigation efforts. FDIC and regulatory expense increased $40.0 million, or 195.4%, in conjunction with the replenishment of the FDICs insurance fund through increased premiums. Personnel expenses increased $56.1 million, or 8.8%, due to higher pension costs and increased incentives related to improved financial performance in certain lines of business. The fourth quarter of 2009 also included $23.5 million in net losses related to early termination fees for FHLB advances repaid during the quarter, net of gains on the early extinguishment of other long term debt. These advance terminations were part of the initiative we took to take advantage of the strong liquidity position we currently benefit from to repay wholesale funding and improve margin. The income tax benefit for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $263.0 million compared to the income tax benefit of $309.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in the income tax benefit was primarily attributable to the lower level of pre tax losses in fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. 68 Table of Contents BUSINESS SEGMENTS See Note 22, Business Segment Reporting, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our segment structure, basis of presentation and internal management reporting methodologies. The following table for our reportable business segments compares net income/(loss) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 to the same period in 2008 and 2007: Table 19 Net Income/(Loss) by Segment Twelve Months Ended December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Retail and Commercial ($481.3 ) $505.0 $959.0 Corporate and Investment Banking 144.6 188.4 58.3 Household Lending (1,370.9 ) (737.5 ) (13.0 ) Wealth and Investment Management 67.9 174.4 87.1 Corporate Other and Treasury 403.5 860.5 250.6 Reconciling Items (327.5 ) (195.0 ) 292.0 The following table for our reportable business segments compares average loans and average deposits for the year ended December 31, 2009 to the same period in 2008 and 2007: Table 20 Average Loans and Deposits by Segment Twelve Months Ended December 31 Average Loans Average Consumer and Commercial Deposits (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 Retail and Commercial $48,993 $50,651 $51,274 $91,290 $82,339 $81,889 Corporate and Investment Banking 20,921 21,619 16,682 7,008 6,551 3,503 Household Lending 42,738 44,733 43,790 3,161 2,268 2,168 Wealth and Investment Management 8,198 8,174 7,965 11,030 9,506 9,781 Corporate Other and Treasury 203 274 404 744 759 702 BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2009 vs. 2008 Retail and Commercial Banking Retail and Commercial Banking reported a net loss of $481.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, compared to net income of $505.0 million in the same period 2008. The decrease in net income was primarily the result of increases in credit related losses including higher provision for credit losses, higher credit related noninterest expense, and impairment of goodwill related to the Commercial Real Estate and Affordable Housing businesses, and lower net interest income. Net interest income was $2.4 billion, a $210.7 million, or 8.1% decline from the same period in 2008. Average loan balances declined $1.7 billion, or 3.3%, with decreases in commercial real estate and residential mortgage loans partially offset by increases in equity lines, tax exempt loans, and nonaccrual loans. Lower loan volume and decreased spreads primarily due to a change in mix and an increase in nonaccrual loans resulted in an $89.5 million, or 8.6%, decrease in loan related net interest income. Average consumer and commercial deposit balances increased $9.0 billion, or 10.9%, primarily in higher yielding interest bearing deposits as the economic environment has influenced customer product preference. NOW and money market accounts increased a combined $6.4 billion, or 16.9%, while certificates of deposit and IRA accounts increased $1.2 billion, or 4.4%. Low cost demand deposit and savings accounts combined increased $1.4 billion, or 7.6%. While DDA, NOW, and MMA balances increased throughout 2009, certificates of deposit declined in the latter half of 2009 due in part to pricing of these accounts. Despite the year over year deposit growth, deposit related net interest income declined by $104.1 million, or 5.6%, as a result of the change in deposit mix, as well as the lower interest rate environment which drove a decrease in the relative value of demand deposits. Provision for credit losses was $1.2 billion, a $585.4 million increase over the same period in 2008. The provision was predominantly driven by an increase in provision for real estate construction loans and home equity lines reflecting the deterioration in the residential real estate market. Provision for commercial loans also increased, mostly due to net charge offs on smaller commercial clients. 69 Table of Contents Total noninterest income was $1.4 billion, a decrease of $29.3 million, or 2.1%, from the same period in 2008. The decrease was primarily due to a $54.3 million, or 6.8%, decrease in service charges on deposits driven by lower consumer and commercial NSF fees. The decrease in service charges was partially offset by a $37.2 million, or 11.8%, increase in ATM and card fees primarily due to an increase in accounts and transactions. Total noninterest expense was $3.3 billion, up $562.6 million, or 20.6%, over the same period in 2008. FDIC insurance expense increased $135.7 million primarily due to increased premium rates. Credit related expense increased $123.9 million including operating losses, collections services, and other real estate. Also, the first quarter of 2009 included a non cash charge of $299.2 million related to the impairment of goodwill associated with the Commercial Real Estate and Affordable Housing businesses. The economic downturn has negatively impacted commercial real estate asset values and expected earnings; however, we remain committed to the clients, products, and services of these businesses and believe that the longer term growth prospects of these businesses are strong. Corporate and Investment Banking Corporate and Investment Bankings net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 was $144.6 million, a decrease of $43.8 million, or 23.3%, compared to the same period in 2008. The decline was driven by a $242.9 million increase in provision for credit losses which was mostly offset by strong growth in capital markets revenue and net interest income. Net interest income was $389.3 million, an increase of $49.7 million, or 14.7%, from the prior year primarily due to an increase in loan portfolio spreads. Average loan balances decreased $698.2 million, or 3.2%, while the loan related net interest income increased $69.1 million, or 31.6%, due to increased portfolio spreads. Loan balances have decreased 9.8% compared to the third quarter of 2009 as higher revolver utilization by large corporate clients experienced early in the year has declined as borrowers needs diminish and as access to capital markets funding has improved. Net interest income on investments decreased $21.0 million primarily due to decreased volume. Total average customer deposits increased $457.4 million, or 7.0%, mainly due to a $552.0 million increase in demand deposits offset by a $94.8 million decrease in time deposits. Customer deposit related net interest income increased $1.5 million or 1.8%, due to increased average balances partially offset by spread compression related to a decrease in the relative value of demand deposits. Provision for credit losses was $298.2 million, as net charge offs increased $242.9 million from the prior year driven by a small number of large corporate borrowers operating in economically sensitive industries. Total noninterest income was $700.1 million, an increase of $138.3 million, or 24.6%, over the prior year. Capital markets related noninterest income increased $161.6 million, or 51.3%, primarily due to performance in equity derivatives, debt and equity originations, fixed income sales and trading, and syndications. The strong performance in capital markets was partially offset by higher write downs on private equity investments, equipment write downs on terminated leases and market volatility on credit hedges related to the corporate loan book. Total noninterest expense was $559.7 million, an increase of $18.8 million, or 3.5%. The increase was primarily due to higher operating losses, revenue based incentive compensation, and pension expense. Offsetting these higher expenses were lower salaries and other staff expenses, as well as lower outside processing and miscellaneous expenses. Household Lending Household Lending reported a net loss of $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared with a net loss of $737.5 million in 2008. The $633.4 million increase in net loss was driven by higher credit costs and goodwill impairment resulting from deterioration in residential real estate market conditions. Partially offsetting these costs were higher production and servicing income. Net interest income was $780.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, up $53.3 million, or 7.3%, primarily due to higher net interest income on LHFS, credit cards, and student loans offset by lower consumer mortgage net interest income and increased levels of nonaccrual loans. Additionally, the loan related net interest income decline was influenced by the decline in higher yielding second lien loans and lower yields on prime first lien mortgages. Average loans declined $2.0 billion, or 4.5%, while the resulting net interest income declined $39.3 million, or 7.2%. Consumer mortgages and construction to perm loans declined $3.6 billion, or 11.8%, contributing $76.2 million to the decline in loan related net interest income. Additionally, nonaccrual loans increased $1.0 billion, resulting in a net interest income reduction of $38.4 million. Partially offsetting these declines was a $0.8 billion, or 24.2%, increase in student loans and bank card loans, which increased net interest income $80.3 million. LHFS increased $0.2 billion and contributed $70.9 million to the increase in net interest income due to improved funding costs resulting from lower short term rates. Customer deposit related net interest income also increased $12.8 million principally due to higher volume. 70 Table of Contents Provision for credit losses was $1.7 billion, an increase of $790.3 million, or 88.5%, principally due to higher consumer mortgage and home equity line charge offs. Total noninterest income was $727.7 million, a $246.4 million, or 51.2%, increase driven by higher mortgage production and servicing income. Total mortgage production income increased $190.2 million, or 105.4%, principally due to income from higher loan production volume at improved margins partially offset by higher reserves for repurchased loans. Total mortgage loan production for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $50.1 billion, up 37.6% from $36.4 billion the prior year. Total servicing income increased $519.6 million primarily due to a $199.2 million recovery in 2009 on MSRs carried at the LOCOM compared to a $370.0 million impairment charge in 2008. The 2008 MSR impairment was offset by net securities gains of $410.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 from the sale of available for sale securities that were held in conjunction with our risk management strategies associated with economically hedging the value of MSRs. At December 31, 2009 total mortgage loans serviced were $178.9 billion, up $16.9 billion, or 10.4%, from $162.0 billion at December 31, 2008. Total noninterest expense was $1.8 billion, an increase of $254.1 million, or 16.6%. The increase was primarily due to a $451.9 million non cash goodwill impairment charge recorded in first quarter of 2009. Credit related expense including other real estate, credit service, and collection costs also increased $125.4 million, or 61.0%. The increases were partially offset by a $373.7 million decrease in operating losses primarily due to a change in classification related to borrower misrepresentation and claim denials. Beginning in 2009, these losses were recorded as charge offs against the allowance for loan losses and were included in the overall allowance for loan losses. Additionally, personnel expense was up $115.8 million principally due to higher commission expense resulting from higher loan production. Wealth and Investment Management Wealth and Investment Managements net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 was $67.9 million, a decrease of $106.5 million compared to the same period in 2008. The decrease in net income was primarily due to the gains from the sales of First Mercantile and Lighthouse Investment Partners in 2008 and the resulting reduction in noninterest income partially offset by lower noninterest expense in 2009. Net income in 2008 included a $63.8 million market valuation loss on an acquired security primarily in the third quarter and a $45.0 million impairment charge on a client based intangible asset in the second quarter. Net interest income was $304.0 million, a decrease of $21.1 million, or 6.5%, as higher average loan and deposit balances were more than offset by spread compression. Average loans increased slightly while net interest income on loans declined $6.3 million, or 4.6%, due to compressed spreads. Average deposits increased $1.5 billion, or 16.0%, while deposit related net interest income decreased $13.3 million, or 6.6%, due to a change in mix, a decrease in the relative value of demand deposits, and spread compression in NOW and money market accounts. Provision for credit losses were $79.2 million, an increase of $52.3 million primarily due to higher consumer and commercial loan net charge offs. Total noninterest income was $748.6 million, a $200.6 million, or 21.1%, decrease primarily due to an $89.4 million gain on sale of a minority interest in Lighthouse Investment Partners in the first quarter of 2008, $50.1 million net decline due to the sale of First Mercantile in the second quarter of 2008, and lower trust income and retail investment income. Trust income decreased $102.9 million, or 17.5%, primarily due to lower market valuations on managed equity assets, investment advisory fee waivers on managed liquidity funds, migration of money market fund assets into deposits, and the sale of First Mercantile. Retail investment income declined $71.3 million, or 25.5%, due to lower annuity sales and market driven declines in assets in managed accounts. Partially offsetting those declines, trading gains and losses increased $78.4 million primarily due to a $63.8 million market valuation loss on a security purchased from our RidgeWorth subsidiary recorded in the third quarter of 2008. As of December 31, 2009, assets under management were approximately $119.5 billion compared to $113.1 billion as of December 31, 2008. Assets under management include individually managed assets, the RidgeWorth Funds, managed institutional assets, and participant directed retirement accounts. SunTrusts total assets under advisement were approximately $205.4 billion, which includes $119.5 billion in assets under management, $46.0 billion in non managed trust assets, $31.8 billion in retail brokerage assets, and $8.1 billion in non managed corporate trust assets. Total noninterest expense was $863.1 million, down $106.8 million, or 11.0%, primarily due to the sale of First Mercantile in 2008 and a $45.0 million impairment charge on a client based intangible incurred in the second quarter of 2008. Employee compensation declined $63.2 million, or 13.4%, resulting from reduced headcount and lower incentive payments. Discretionary expenses including other staff, advertising, and customer development declined $12.3 million, or 36.4%. Other expense also declined $21.6 million primarily due to the sale of First Mercantile and reduced clearing costs related to retail investment income. These decreases were partially offset by higher operating losses, other real estate expense, indirect support cost, and FDIC expense. 71 Table of Contents Corporate Other and Treasury Corporate Other and Treasurys net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 was $403.5 million, a decrease of $457.0 million, or 53.1%, from the same period in 2008. The decrease was mainly due to a reduction in securities gains due to the sale and contribution of Coke stock in 2008, the FDIC insurance special assessment recognized in 2009, partially offset by an increase in net interest income on receive fixed interest rate swaps. Net interest income was $433.6 million, a $268.4 million increase compared to the same period in 2008, mainly due to a $310.5 million increase in income on receive fixed interest rate swaps employed as part of an overall interest rate risk management strategy. Total average assets increased $6.9 billion, or 35.2%, mainly due to additions to the investment portfolio, primarily lower risk U.S. agency MBS. Total average deposits decreased $8.8 billion, or 61.2%, mainly due to a decrease in brokered and foreign deposits, as we reduced our reliance on wholesale funding sources. Total noninterest income was $202.2 million, a $901.1 million decrease primarily due to a decrease in net securities gains. Securities gains decreased $544.9 million primarily due to a $732.2 million gain on the sale and contribution of Coke stock in 2008. The decrease was offset by a $129.6 million gain, net of credit related OTTI of $10.1 million in 2009, and $55.6 million in market value losses in 2008 primarily related to certain ABS that were classified as available for sale and estimated to be other than temporarily impaired, triggering accounting recognition of the unrealized loss in earnings. Trading gains decreased $227.8 million due to lower gains on our public debt and related hedges carried at fair value as our credit spreads improved during 2009. Additionally, 2009 included a $112.1 million gain on Visa Class B shares, compared to the same period in 2008 which included a $81.8 million gain from the sale of a fuel card and fleet management subsidiary, an $86.3 million gain on our holdings of Visa in connection with its IPO, a $37.0 million gain on sale/leaseback of real estate properties, and $21.1 million of merchant card fee income generated by Transplatinum in 2008. Total noninterest expense decreased $28.1 million compared to the same period in 2008. The decrease was mainly due to the recognition of $183.4 million in expense related to the contribution of Coke shares to the SunTrust charitable foundation in the third quarter of 2008. The decrease was partially offset by a $78.9 million increase in FDIC insurance expense primarily due to the special assessment recorded in the second quarter of 2009. While the special assessment was recorded in the Other line of business, the increase in base FDIC premium expenses was recognized within the lines of business. Also 2009 included a $7.0 million accrual for Visa litigation compared to a $33.5 million reversal of a portion of the Visa litigation in 2008. Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2008 vs. 2007 Retail and Commercial Retail and Commercial net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 was $505.0 million, a decrease of $454.0 million, or 47.3%, compared to the same period in 2007. This decrease was primarily the result of higher provision for credit losses due to home equity line, real estate construction, and commercial loan net charge offs, lower net interest income, and higher credit related noninterest expense, partially offset by strong growth in service charges on deposits. Net interest income decreased $346.1 million, or 11.8%, primarily driven by a continued shift in deposit mix and decreased spreads, as deposit competition and the interest rate environment encouraged clients to migrate into higher yielding interest bearing deposits. Average consumer and commercial deposit balances increased $0.4 billion, or 0.6%. Despite deposit growth, deposit related net interest income declined by $223.1 million, or 10.7%, driven by the change in mix as well as the decrease in the rate environment which drove a decrease in the relative value of demand deposits. NOW and money market accounts increased a combined $2.3 billion, or 6.4%, while combined certificates of deposit and IRA accounts were flat compared to the prior year. Low cost demand deposit and savings accounts combined decreased $1.8 billion, or 8.9%. Average loan balances declined $0.6 billion, or 1.2%, as growth in commercial loans, equity lines, and loans acquired in conjunction with the GB&T transaction were offset by an approximate $1.8 billion decline in average loan balances related to the migration of middle market clients from Retail and Commercial to CIB. Net interest income from loans decreased $101.5 million, or 8.9%, due to the migration of middle market clients from Retail and Commercial to CIB, lower spreads, and the adverse impact of nonperforming loans. Provision for credit losses increased $425.4 million over the same period in 2007. The provision increase was most pronounced in home equity lines reflecting deterioration in the residential real estate market, while provision for credit losses on real estate construction and commercial loans, primarily to commercial clients with annual revenues of less than $5 million, also increased. Total noninterest income increased $81.5 million, or 6.2%, over the same period in 2007. This increase was driven primarily by a $68.9 million, or 9.4%, increase in service charges on both consumer and business deposit accounts, primarily due to growth in the number of accounts, higher NSF rates, and an increase in occurrences of NSF fees. Interchange fees increased $14.0 million, or 8.1%, and ATM revenue increased $9.9 million, or 8.4%. 72 Table of Contents Total noninterest expense increased $33.3 million, or 1.2%, from the same period in 2007. The transfer of middle market to CIB decreased expenses approximately $24.9 million. In addition, the continuing positive impact of expense savings initiatives, lower amortization of intangibles and impairments, was offset by higher credit related expenses including operating losses due to fraud, other real estate, and collections, as well as continued investments in the branch distribution network. Corporate and Investment Banking Corporate and Investment Bankings net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 was $188.4 million, an increase of $130.1 million, or 223.2%, compared to the same period in 2007. Lower market valuation trading losses in structured products were partially offset by an increase in provision for credit losses, lower merchant banking gains, and higher incentive based compensation. Net interest income was $339.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $95.6 million, or 39.2%, from prior year. Average loan balances increased $4.9 billion, or 29.6%, while the corresponding net interest income increased $62.8 million, or 40.2%. The migration of middle market clients from Retail and Commercial to CIB accounted for approximately $1.8 billion of the increase in average loan balances and increased net interest income $25.8 million. The remainder of CIBs average loans increased $3.1 billion, or 19.5%, driven by increased corporate banking loans and lease financing. The corresponding net interest income increased $37.0 million, or 25.5%, due to higher commercial loans and improved spreads. Total average consumer and commercial deposits increased $3.0 billion, or 87.0%, primarily in higher cost interest bearing deposits. Deposit related net interest income increased $18.9 million, or 28.6%, driven by the lower credit for funds on demand deposits partially offset by the increased volumes in higher cost deposit products. Provision for credit losses was $55.3 million, an increase of $17.5 million, or 46.5%, over the prior year, resulting from increased charge offs of middle market clients partially offset by lower charge offs in corporate banking. Noninterest income increased $179.8 million, or 47.1%, primarily due to lower market valuation trading losses in structured products. In addition, increases in direct finance, loan syndications, credit related fees, and fixed income sales and trading were partially offset by a reduction in merchant banking gains and lower revenues in structured leasing and derivatives. Noninterest expense increased $45.3 million, or 9.1%, partially due to the transfer of the middle market business from Retail and Commercial to CIB which accounted for approximately $24.9 million of the increase. For the remainder of CIB, noninterest expense increased $20.4 million, or 4.2%, primarily due to higher incentive based compensation offset by consulting and certain other staff expenses. Household Lending Household Lending reported a net loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 of $737.5 million, compared to a net loss of $13.0 million in 2007, an increase of $724.5 million, principally due to higher credit related costs. Net interest income declined $16.0 million, or 2.2%. Average loans increased $0.9 billion, or 2.2%, while the resulting net interest income declined $33.8 million, or 5.8%. Nonaccrual loans accounted for $47.7 million of the net interest income decline as average nonaccrual loans increased $1.1 billion. Accruing loans declined $0.2 billion, or 0.5%, while net interest income increased $13.9 million, or 2.3%. The increase in net interest income on accruing loans was influenced by higher income from consumer loans that was partially offset by lower income resulting from a change in mortgage loan product mix as declines in construction perm and Alt A balances were replaced with lower yielding prime first lien mortgages. Average LHFS declined $5.5 billion while the resulting net interest income increased $28.6 million primarily due to widening spreads. Average investment securities were up $0.8 billion while net interest income increased $20.7 million. Funding of other real estate and MSRs reduced net interest income $18.2 million. Average consumer and commercial deposits increased $0.1 billion, or 4.7%, although net interest income on deposits and other liabilities decreased $17.2 million primarily due to lower short term interest rates. Provision for credit losses increased $681.1 million to $893.1 million primarily due to higher residential mortgage, home equity and residential construction net charge offs. Total noninterest income increased $82.3 million, or 20.6%, primarily due to reduced net valuation losses, increased production fee income, and securities gains in excess of MSRs impairment, partially offset by higher repurchase reserves and lower gains from the sale of MSRs. Total production income increased $83.2 million, or 85.5%, driven by reduced valuation losses associated with secondary market loans and the recognition of loan origination fees resulting from our election to record certain mortgage loans at fair value beginning in May 2007. The increase in loan production income was partially offset by increased reserves for the repurchase of loans. Mortgage loan production of $36.4 billion was down $21.9 billion, or 37.6%. Mortgage servicing related income declined $426.3 million from $193.6 million in 2007, to a net loss of $232.7 million in 2008. The decline was driven by $370.0 million in impairment of MSRs that were carried at the LOCOM, as well 73 Table of Contents as lower gains from the sale of MSRs. The MSRs impairment was offset by $410.7 million of net gains from the sale of available for sale securities that were held in conjunction with our risk management strategies associated with economically hedging the value of MSRs. Total noninterest expense increased $549.4 million, or 56.0%, driven by increased credit related expenses. Operating losses were up $311.7 million driven by fraud losses primarily related to borrower misrepresentation and insurance claim denials. Reserves for mortgage reinsurance losses increased $179.8 million while other real estate expense and collection services expense increased $110.8 million. Additionally, the recognition of loan origination costs resulting from our election to record certain mortgage loans at fair value beginning in May 2007 increased noninterest expense compared with the prior year, offsetting significant reductions in staff and commissions expense related to lower loan production. Wealth and Investment Management Wealth and Investment Managements net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 was $174.4 million, an increase of $87.3 million compared to same period in 2007. The following transactions represented $141.7 million of the year over year increase: $39.4 million decrease due to the after tax impact of the market valuation loss on Lehman bonds in the third quarter of 2008. $18.4 million increase due to the after tax gain on the sale of First Mercantile in the second quarter of 2008. $27.9 million decrease due to the after tax impairment charge on a client based intangible asset incurred in the second quarter of 2008. $55.4 million increase due to the after tax gain on sale of a minority interest in Lighthouse Investment Partners in the first quarter of 2008. $155.3 million increase due to the after tax impact of the market valuation losses in the fourth quarter of 2007 on purchased securities. $20.1 million decrease due to the after tax gain resulting from the sale upon merger of Lighthouse Partners into Lighthouse Investment Partners in the first quarter of 2007. Net interest income decreased $30.1 million, or 8.5%, primarily due to a decline in deposit related net interest income. Average consumer and commercial deposits declined $0.3 billion, or 2.8%, while net interest income on deposits declined $24.6 million, or 10.9%, due to the decrease in average balance, as well as a lower credit for funds on demand deposits. Average loans increased $0.2 billion, or 2.6%, driven by growth in commercial loans in the professional specialty lending units while net interest income dropped $4.6 million due to a $5.6 million decrease in consumer lending related net interest income. Provision for credit losses increased $18.4 million driven by higher home equity, personal credit line, and consumer mortgage net charge offs. Total noninterest income increased $136.2 million, or 16.8%, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 driven by a decrease in market valuation losses. Additionally, gains on the sale of non strategic businesses were offset by the corresponding loss of revenue and lower market valuations on managed equity assets. A $250.5 million increase due to a market valuation loss in the fourth quarter of 2007 related to securities purchased from our RidgeWorth subsidiary was partially offset by a $63.8 million market valuation loss on Lehman bonds in 2008. A $29.6 million gain on sale of First Mercantile in 2008, and $24.1 million of incremental noninterest income from the sale of our Lighthouse Partners investment also increased income. Retail investment income increased $6.8 million, or 2.5%, due to higher annuity sales and higher recurring managed account fees. Trust income decreased $91.1 million, or 13.4%, primarily due to the aforementioned sales of Lighthouse Partners and First Mercantile, which resulted in a $49.1 million decline in trust income as well as lower market valuations on managed equity assets. As of December 31, 2008, assets under management were approximately $113.1 billion compared to $142.8 billion as of December 31, 2007. Assets under management include individually managed assets, the RidgeWorth Funds, managed institutional assets, and participant directed retirement accounts. Our total assets under advisement were approximately $194.5 billion, which includes $113.1 billion in assets under management, $45.7 billion in non managed trust assets, $31.2 billion in retail brokerage assets, and $4.5 billion in non managed corporate trust assets. Total noninterest expense decreased $47.2 million, or 4.6%. This decline includes a $45.0 million impairment charge on a client based intangible incurred in the second quarter of 2008. Noninterest expense before intangible amortization declined $85.4 million, or 8.6%, driven by lower staff, discretionary, and indirect expenses, as well as lower structural expenses resulting from the sales of Lighthouse Partners and First Mercantile. 74 Table of Contents Corporate Other and Treasury Corporate Other and Treasurys net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 was $860.5 million, an increase of $610.0 million from the same period in 2007. Net interest income increased $313.9 million over the same period in 2007 mainly due to increased gains on interest rate swaps employed as part of an overall interest rate risk management strategy. Total average assets decreased $4.1 billion, or 17.1%, mainly due to the reduction in the size of the investment portfolio in 2007 as part of our overall balance sheet management strategy. Total average deposits decreased $7.9 billion, or 35.5%, mainly due to a decrease in brokered and foreign deposits as we reduced our reliance on wholesale funding sources. Total noninterest income increased $555.4 million compared to the same period in 2007 mainly due to increased gains on securities and the sale of non strategic businesses. Securities gains increased $431.4 million primarily due to the sale of Coke common stock, partially offset by market value losses related to certain ABS that were estimated to be other than temporarily impaired. Trading gains and losses increased $40.2 million as gains on our long term debt carried at fair value were partially offset by losses on certain illiquid assets. Gains on our public debt carried at fair value, net of related hedges in 2008, were $431.7 million as compared to $140.9 million during 2007. The increase was also due to an $86.3 million gain on our holdings of Visa in connection with its IPO and an $81.8 million gain on sale of TransPlatinum were offset by an $81.8 million decrease in gains on the sale/leaseback of real estate properties. Total noninterest expense increased $67.7 million from the same period in 2007. The increase in expense was mainly due to a $183.4 million contribution of Coke common stock to our charitable foundation recognized in marketing and customer development expense. The increase was offset by a $33.5 million reversal of a portion of the Visa litigation expense. 75 Table of Contents Table 21 Reconcilement of Non U.S. GAAP Measures Annual Year Ended December 31 (Dollars in millions, except per share and other data) 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 Net income/(loss) ($1,563.7 ) $795.8 $1,634.0 $2,117.4 $1,987.2 Securities gains/(losses), net of tax 60.8 665.4 150.7 (31.3 ) (4.4 ) Net income/(loss) excluding net securities gains(losses), net of tax (1,624.5 ) 130.4 1,483.3 2,148.7 1,991.6 Coke stock dividend, net of tax (43.8 ) (49.8 ) (54.2 ) (53.3 ) (48.1 ) Net income/(loss) excluding net securities gains/(losses) and the Coke stock dividend, net of tax (1,668.3 ) 80.6 1,429.1 2,095.4 1,943.5 Preferred dividends, Series A (14.1 ) (22.3 ) (30.3 ) (7.7 ) U.S. Treasury preferred dividends and accretion of discount (265.8 ) (26.6 ) Distributed and undistributed earnings allocated to unvested shares 15.9 (6.0 ) Gain on purchase of Series A preferred stock 94.3 Net income/(loss) available to common shareholders excluding net securities gains/(losses) and the Coke stock dividend, net of tax ($1,838.0 ) $25.7 $1,398.8 $2,087.7 $1,943.5 Net income/(loss) available to common shareholders ($1,733.4 ) $741.0 $1,593.0 $2,097.5 $1,975.5 Goodwill/intangible impairment charges other than MSRs attributable to common shareholders, after tax (714.8 ) (27.0 ) Net income/(loss) available to common shareholders excluding goodwill/intangible impairment charges other than MSRs, after tax8 ($1,018.6 ) $768.0 $1,593.0 $2,097.5 $1,975.5 Efficiency ratio1 79.07 % 63.83 % 63.28 % 59.23 % 59.88 % Impact of excluding amortization/impairment of goodwill/intangible assets other than MSRs (9.72 ) (1.32 ) (1.17 ) (1.26 ) (1.52 ) Tangible efficiency ratio2 69.35 % 62.51 % 62.11 % 57.97 % 58.36 % Total average assets $175,442.4 $175,848.3 $177,795.5 $180,315.1 $168,088.8 Average net unrealized securities gains 1,611.9 1,909.5 2,300.8 1,620.5 1,949.4 Average assets less net unrealized securities gains $173,830.5 $173,938.8 $175,494.7 $178,694.6 $166,139.4 Total average common shareholders equity $17,218.6 $17,646.1 $17,428.4 $17,545.6 $16,732.9 Average accumulated other comprehensive income (692.1 ) (1,220.9 ) (1,143.3 ) (976.0 ) (1,220.5 ) Total average realized common shareholders equity $16,526.5 $16,425.2 $16,285.1 $16,569.6 $15,512.4 Return on average total assets (0.89 ) % 0.45 % 0.92 % 1.17 % 1.18 % Impact of excluding net realized and unrealized securities gains/(losses) and the Coke stock dividend (0.07 ) (0.40 ) (0.11 ) (0.01 ) Return on average total assets less net unrealized securities gains/(losses) 3 (0.96 ) % 0.05 % 0.81 % 1.17 % 1.17 % Return on average common shareholders equity (10.07 ) % 4.20 % 9.14 % 11.95 % 11.81 % Impact of excluding net realized and unrealized securities gains/(losses) and the Coke stock dividend (1.05 ) (4.04 ) (0.62 ) 0.58 0.64 Return on average realized common shareholders equity4 (11.12 ) % 0.16 % 8.52 % 12.53 % 12.45 % Total shareholders equity $22,530.9 $22,500.8 $18,169.9 $17,932.2 $17,133.6 Goodwill, net of deferred taxes (6,204.4 ) (6,941.1 ) (6,921.5 ) (6,889.8 ) (6,835.1 ) Other intangible assets including MSRs, net of deferred taxes (1,671.1 ) (978.2 ) (1,308.6 ) (1,182.0 ) (1,123.0 ) MSRs 1,539.4 810.5 1,049.4 810.5 657.6 Tangible equity 16,194.8 15,392.0 10,989.2 10,670.9 9,833.1 Preferred stock (4,917.3 ) (5,221.7 ) (500.0 ) (500.0 ) Tangible common equity $11,277.5 $10,170.3 $10,489.2 $10,170.9 $9,833.1 Total assets $174,164.7 $189,138.0 $179,573.9 $182,161.6 $179,712.8 Goodwill (6,319.1 ) (7,043.5 ) (6,921.5 ) (6,889.8 ) (6,835.1 ) Other intangible assets including MSRs (1,711.3 ) (1,035.4 ) (1,363.0 ) (1,182.0 ) (1,123.0 ) MSRs 1,539.4 810.5 1,049.4 810.5 657.6 Tangible assets $167,673.7 $181,869.6 $172,338.8 $174,900.3 $172,412.3 Tangible equity to tangible assets5 9.66 % 8.46 % 6.38 % 6.10 % 5.70 % Tangible book value per common share6 $22.59 $28.69 $30.11 $28.66 $27.16 Net interest income $4,465.7 $4,619.6 $4,719.5 $4,660.4 $4,579.0 Taxable equivalent adjustment 123.3 117.5 102.7 88.0 75.5 Net interest income FTE 4,589.0 4,737.1 4,822.2 4,748.4 4,654.5 Noninterest income 3,710.3 4,473.5 3,428.7 3,468.4 3,155.0 Total revenue FTE 8,299.3 9,210.6 8,250.9 8,216.8 7,809.5 Securities gains/(losses), net 98.0 1,073.3 243.1 (50.5 ) (7.2 ) Total revenue FTE excluding net securities gains/(losses), net7 $8,201.3 $8,137.3 $8,007.8 $8,267.3 $7,816.7 1Computed by dividing noninterest expense by total revenue FTE. The efficiency ratios are presented on an FTE basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax exempt sources. 2We present a tangible efficiency ratio which excludes the amortization/impairment of intangible assets other than MSRs. We believe this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of these intangible asset costs (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare our efficiency to other companies in the industry. This measure is utilized by us to assess our efficiency and that of our lines of business. 3Computed by dividing net income/(loss), excluding tax effected net securities gains/(losses) and the Coke stock dividend, by average assets less net unrealized gains on securities. We use this information internally to gauge our actual performance in the industry. We believe that the return on average assets less the net unrealized securities gains is more indicative of the our return on assets because it more accurately reflects the return on the assets that are related to our core businesses which are primarily client relationship and client transaction driven. 4Computed by dividing net income/(loss) available to common shareholders, excluding tax effected net securities gains/(losses) and the Coke stock dividend, by average realized common shareholders equity. We believe that the return on average realized common shareholders equity is more indicative of our return on equity because the excluded equity relates primarily to the holding of a specific security. 5We present a tangible equity to tangible assets ratio that excludes the after tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets. We believe this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare our capital adequacy to other companies in the industry. This measure is used by us to analyze capital adequacy. 6We present a tangible book value per common share that excludes the after tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets and also excludes preferred stock from tangible equity. We believe this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity as well as preferred stock (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare our book value on common stock to other companies in the industry. This measure is also used by management to analyze capital adequacy. 7We present total revenue FTE excluding realized securities gains/(losses), net. We believe noninterest income without net securities gains/(losses) is more indicative of our performance because it isolates income that is primarily client relationship and client transaction driven and is more indicative of normalized operations. 8We present net income/(loss) available to common shareholders that excludes the impairment charge on goodwill. We believe this measure is useful to investors, because removing the non cash impairment charge provides a more representative view of normalized operations and the measure also allows better comparability with peers in the industry who also provide a similar presentation when applicable. In addition, management uses this measure internally to analyze performance. 76 Table of Contents Table 22 Reconcilement of Non U.S. GAAP Measures Quarterly Three Months Ended 2009 2008 (Dollars in

$2,287.9 $2,048.2 $2,285.9 1Computed by dividing noninterest expense by total revenue FTE. The efficiency ratios are presented on an FTE basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax exempt sources. 2We present a tangible efficiency ratio which excludes the amortization/impairment of intangible assets other than MSRs. We believe this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of these intangible asset costs (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare our efficiency to other companies in the industry. This measure is utilized by us to assess our efficiency and that of our lines of business. 3Computed by dividing annualized net income/(loss), excluding tax effected net securities gains/(losses) and the Coke stock dividend, by average assets less net unrealized gains on securities. We use this information internally to gauge our actual performance in the industry. We believe that the return on average assets less the net unrealized securities gains is more indicative of the our return on assets because it more accurately reflects the return on the assets that are related to our core businesses which are primarily client relationship and client transaction driven. 4Computed by dividing annualized net income/(loss) available to common shareholders, excluding tax effected net securities gains/(losses) and the Coke stock dividend, by average realized common shareholders equity. We believe that the return on average realized common shareholders equity is more indicative of our return on equity because the excluded equity relates primarily to the holding of a specific security. 5We present a tangible equity to tangible assets ratio that excludes the after tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets. We believe this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare our capital adequacy to other companies in the industry. This measure is used by us to analyze capital adequacy. 6We present a tangible book value per common share that excludes the after tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets and also excludes preferred stock from tangible equity. We believe this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity as well as preferred stock (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare our book value on common stock to other companies in the industry. This measure is also used by management to analyze capital adequacy. 7We present total revenue FTE excluding realized securities gains/(losses), net. We believe noninterest income without net securities gains/(losses) is more indicative of our performance because it isolates income that is primarily client relationship and client transaction driven and is more indicative of normalized operations. 8We present net income/(loss) available to common shareholders that excludes the impairment charge on goodwill. We believe this measure is useful to investors, because removing the non cash impairment charge provides a more representative view of normalized operations and the measure also allows better comparability with peers in the industry who also provide a similar presentation when applicable. In addition, management uses this measure internally to analyze performance. 77 Table of Contents Table 23 Share Repurchases in 2009 Common Stock Series A Preferred Stock Depositary Shares1 Totalnumber ofsharespurchased2 Averagepricepaid pershare Numberof sharespurchasedas part ofpubliclyannouncedplans orprograms Maximumnumber ofshares thatmay yet bepurchasedunder theplans orprograms3 Totalnumber ofsharespurchased Averagepricepaid pershare Number ofsharespurchasedas part ofpubliclyannouncedplans orprograms Maximumnumber ofshares thatmay yet bepurchasedunder theplans orprograms January 1 31 30,000,000 February 1 28 30,000,000 March 1 31 30,000,000 Total first quarter 2009 April 1 30 30,000,000 May 1 31 30,000,000 June 1 30 30,000,000 12,569,104 17.50 12,569,104 10,000,000 4 Total second quarter 2009 12,569,104 17.50 12,569,104 10,000,000 July 1 31 30,000,000 530,470 15.39 530,470 9,469,530 4 August 1 31 30,000,000 September 1 30 30,000,000 Total third quarter 2009 530,470 15.39 530,470 9,469,530 October 1 31 30,000,000 November 1 30 30,000,000 December 1 31 30,000,000 Total fourth quarter 2009 Total year to date 2009 13,099,574 17.41 13,099,574 9,469,530 1On September 12, 2006, SunTrust issued and registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act 20 million Depositary Shares, each representing a 1/4,000th interest in a share of Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A. On June 30, 2009, the Company repurchased a portion of its Series A preferred stock as part of a publicly announced tender offer dated June 1, 2009. The tender offer represented an acceleration of the Companys previously announced capital plan framework to increase its Tier 1 common equity in response to the Federal Reserves Supervisory Capital Assessment Program. The Company repurchased $314.2 million face amount of preferred stock at $17.50 per share ($25 par value), which equates to 12,569,104 Depositary Shares. On July 28, 2009, the Company repurchased an additional $13.3 million face amount of preferred stock at $15.39 per share ($25 par value), which equates to 530,470 Depositary Shares.

SunTrust considers shares so surrendered by participants in SunTrusts employee stock option plans to be repurchased pursuant to the authority and terms of the applicable stock option plan rather than pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, zero shares of SunTrust common stock were surrendered by participants in SunTrusts employee stock option plans. 3On August 14, 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to 30 million shares of common stock and specified that such authorization replaced (terminated) existing unused authorizations. 4The Company may repurchase up to $250 million face amount of various tranches of its hybrid capital securities, including its Series A Preferred Stock. The amount disclosed reflects the maximum number of Series A Preferred Shares which the Company may repurchase under this authority assuming it is used solely to repurchase Series A Preferred Stock.
