changes in market interest rates or capital markets could adversely affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital or liquidity; the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings; depressed market values for our stock may require us to write down goodwill; clients could pursue alternatives to bank deposits, causing us to lose a relatively inexpensive source of funding; consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, which could affect net income; we have businesses other than banking which subject us to a variety of risks; hurricanes and other natural or man made disasters may adversely affect loan portfolios and operations and increase the cost of doing business; negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact business and revenues; the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us; we rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure; we rely on our systems, employees, and certain counterparties, and certain failures could materially adversely affect our operations; we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties; regulation by federal and state agencies could adversely affect the business, revenue, and profit margins; competition in the financial services industry is intense and could result in losing business or margin declines; maintaining or increasing market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services; we may not pay dividends on your common stock; our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends; disruptions in our ability to access global capital markets may negatively affect our capital resources and liquidity; any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our 22 Table of Contents funding from the capital markets; we have in the past and may in the future pursue acquisitions, which could affect costs and from which we may not be able to realize anticipated benefits; we are subject to certain litigation, and our expenses related to this litigation may adversely affect our results; we depend on the expertise of key personnel, and if these individuals leave or change their roles without effective replacements, operations may suffer; we may not be able to hire or retain additional qualified personnel and recruiting and compensation costs may increase as a result of turnover, both of which may increase costs and reduce profitability and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategy;

our stock price can be volatile; our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud; our financial instruments carried at fair value expose us to certain market risks; our revenues derived from our investment securities may be volatile and subject to a variety of risks; and we may enter into transactions with off balance sheet affiliates or our subsidiaries. This narrative will assist readers in their analysis of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and supplemental financial information. It should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes. When we refer to SunTrust, the Company, we, our and us in this narrative, we mean SunTrust Banks, Inc. and Subsidiaries (consolidated). Effective May 1, 2008, we acquired GB&T and the results of operations for GB&T were included with our results beginning on that date. Periods prior to the acquisition date do not reflect the impact of the merger. In the MD&A, net interest income, net interest margin, and the efficiency ratio are presented on an FTE basis and the quarterly ratios are presented on an annualized basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax favored status of income from certain loans and investments. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax exempt sources. We also present diluted earnings per common share excluding goodwill and intangible impairment charges. We believe the exclusion of the impairment charges is more reflective of normalized operations and allows better comparability with peers throughout the industry. Additionally, we present ROE as well as a return on average realized common shareholders equity. We also present ROA as well as ROA less net realized and unrealized securities gains/losses. The return on average realized common shareholders equity and ROA less net realized and unrealized securities gains/losses exclude realized securities gains and losses and the Coke dividend from the numerator, and net unrealized securities gains from the denominator. We present a tangible efficiency ratio and a tangible equity to tangible assets ratio, which excludes the effect of intangible assets costs. We believe these measures are useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible asset costs (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare our efficiency and capital adequacy to other companies in the industry. We also present a tangible book value per common share ratio which excludes the after tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets. These measures are utilized by management to assess our financial performance and capital adequacy. We provide reconcilements in Tables 32 and 33 in the MD&A for all non U.S. GAAP measures. Certain reclassifications may be made to prior period financial statements and related information to conform them to the 2010 presentation. INTRODUCTION We are one of the nations largest commercial banking organizations and our headquarters are located in Atlanta, Georgia. Our principal banking subsidiary, SunTrust Bank, offers a full line of financial services for consumers and businesses through its branches located primarily in Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Within our geographic footprint, we operate under six business segments: Retail Banking, Diversified Commercial Banking, CRE, CIB, Mortgage, and W&IM, with the remainder in Corporate Other and Treasury. In addition to traditional deposit, credit, and trust and investment services offered by the Bank, our other subsidiaries provide mortgage banking, credit related insurance, asset management, securities brokerage, and capital market services. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Economic and regulatory While signs of economic recovery began in 2010, the effects of the recession continued to be felt throughout the year as economic growth was insufficient to abate elevated unemployment and to increase capital spending and consumer consumption. While the unemployment rate eased slightly during 2010, it remains elevated. Individuals and businesses were not the only ones affected during the year, as ongoing deterioration in the fiscal position of certain U.S. states and 23 Table of Contents municipalities was prevalent and threatened the risk of increased local taxes and budget cuts. At the Federal government level, Congress reached a compromise and maintained lower individual tax rates for at least two years. The Federal Reserve has forecast a gradual economic recovery through 2011, and, as a result, the Federal Reserve has reaffirmed that it will maintain key interest rates at record lows for an extended period of time as long as the economic data supports these low rates. Additionally, the Federal Reserve announced towards the end of 2010 that they would further intercede in the financial markets, in the form of additional financial support, if needed. Pursuant to this, the Federal Reserve announced reinvestments of $600 billion of Treasury securities through the middle of 2011 in an attempt to maintain lower interest rates and stimulate additional growth in the economy and to spur expanded consumer and business spending. Despite the slow and uneven economic recovery, the equity markets provided some encouragement for the recovery, advancing more than 10% during 2010. Regulatory and financial reform was a focal point during the year as the financial reform bill, known as the Dodd Frank Act, was signed into law during the third quarter and its implementation will result in significant changes to the financial services industry. The ultimate impact to us and the financial services industry as a whole remains largely to be determined, as the work of translating legislative policies into regulation continues. However, while it is clear that financial regulation will affect our operations, compliance requirements, and, accordingly, our financial results, we believe that it will be manageable. Some of the regulations will likely have little impact on our results. Conversely, other items will have a quantifiable effect in the near term, such as new regulations regarding debit interchange fees. The regulation imposes a limitation on fees and is still in the comment period. We are hopeful that the final regulation takes into account a less narrow interpretation of the costs to operate a debit card business when establishing interchange fees. The reform bill also mandated changes in FDIC assessments and addressed a multitude of other industry supervisory matters. While this legislation dictates a number of regulatory rule changes which have the potential to adversely impact us and others within our industry, we cannot determine at the present time what the absolute impacts will be when the regulations are eventually finalized. In addition to the reform bill, during the year the Federal Reserve implemented changes to Regulation E that restricts our ability to charge our clients overdraft fees for ATM and debit card transactions. We implemented the changes to Regulation E during 2010 and the impact will continue into 2011 as clients continue to decide if they will opt in to overdraft coverage. We are actively evaluating regulatory and legislative developments and will be in a position to comply with new requirements and take appropriate actions as warranted. In addition to the regulatory reform items discussed above, new capital and liquidity requirements were proposed during 2010 that will impact us and our peers as they are phased in over the next several years. The Federal Reserve, under the Collins Amendment of the Dodd Frank Act, and the BCBS, in Basel III, proposed significant changes to the regulatory capital requirements. The Federal Reserve is expected to adopt new capital requirements for certain bank holding companies that are at least as stringent as those already applicable to insured depositary institutions. As a result, certain of our capital instruments that are currently considered Tier 1 capital, will be phased out over a three year period starting on January 1, 2013. We believe this will have about a 170 basis point downward impact to our Tier 1 capital ratio over that three year period if capital doesnt increase over this same time frame as an offset to the impact. The BCBS proposed capital requirements seek to further strengthen financial institutions capital positions by mandating a higher minimum level of common equity to be held, along with a capital conservation buffer to withstand future periods of stress. Our capital position today is particularly strong, especially considering our improving credit risk profile and relatively low market risk. At present, our Tier 1 common equity is in excess of the minimum common equity and additional conservation buffer stipulated by these newly proposed requirements. Regardless, complying with these new capital requirements will likely affect our results, and the extent to which we will be affected will be known with more certainty once additional clarity is provided on the underlying details of these new requirements. These new requirements must be endorsed by the U.S. banking regulators, which is expected, and are anticipated to be phased in through 2019 as they are currently proposed by the BCBS. In addition to the capital proposal, the BCBS also proposed standards that would increase and standardize global liquidity standards. These proposals would require us, and other financial institutions, to comply with two new liquidity measurements; the LCR and NSFR. See Liquidity Risk in this MD&A where these ratios are discussed further. Our regulators have not yet adopted these proposed standards, but the BCBSs recommended adoption dates are for the beginning of 2015 and 2018 for the respective standards. The proposed standards may lead to changes in our funding structure and or investment portfolio, but until the proposed standards are translated into a final regulation we cannot quantify the impact. 24 Table of Contents Financial performance While 2010 will be remembered as a year of challenge and change for our industry, we persevered through the economic and regulatory uncertainties and achieved improved financial performance compared to 2009. We returned to profitability during 2010 with a profit before payment of preferred dividends; Our low cost deposits grew 10%, demonstrating our success in increasing client loyalty and growing market share; Revenue expanded and benefitted from a 34 basis point expansion in net interest margin and solid performance from several of our key businesses; Credit quality improved throughout the year led by declines in net charge offs, delinquencies, and nonperforming assets; Capital ratios remained strong and expanded. Throughout this economic cycle, we maintained our focus on serving our clients and managing our core business to drive better bottom line results. This focus, together with improved credit quality, resulted in net income of $189 million in 2010 compared to a net loss of $1.6 billion in 2009, which included a $751 million non cash goodwill impairment charge as well as recessionary conditions causing elevated credit losses. Net loss available to common shareholders in 2010 was $87 million, or $0.18 per average common diluted share, which compares favorably to the net loss available to common shareholders of $1.7 billion, or $3.98 per average common share in 2009. We are pleased with the diversity of our revenue sources and continued improvement in credit quality that is driving our improved financial performance. Although our results for the year are still not near the level where we would like them to be, we are pleased with the progress that we made over the course of 2010 and our position as we enter 2011. Asset quality improvement was broad based in 2010, with improvements in the provision for credit losses, net charge offs, NPLs, nonperforming assets, and early stage delinquencies. The ALLL remains elevated by historical standards at 2.58% of total loans, but declined 18 basis points compared to December 31, 2009, in part due to a $2.3 billion increase in period end loans coupled with a $146 million decrease in the ALLL due to improving asset quality trends and a reduction in the risk profile of our loan portfolio. While we experienced a reduction during the year in higher risk loan portfolio balances coupled with a broad based improvement in asset quality indicators, we are maintaining reserves that give consideration to the continued economic and real estate value uncertainty, but expect the ALLL to continue to trend downward at a pace consistent with improvements in credit quality. The provision for credit losses decreased $1.4 billion compared to 2009 while net charge offs declined 12% during that time. For the first quarter of 2011, a stable to a modest decline in net charge offs from fourth quarter levels is expected. Total NPLs declined 24% from 2009 as a result of charge offs, transfers to OREO, and reduced inflows into nonaccrual. In addition, OREO declined 4% during the year as we continue to aggressively dispose of properties once we have clear title. We expect NPLs and nonperforming assets to continue to modestly decline in the near term, subject to economic conditions remaining stable or improving. Our accruing restructured loan portfolio, which is primarily related to mortgage and consumer loans, increased 59% from 2009. The increase in accruing restructured loans is due to us taking proactive steps to modify loans in order to mitigate losses related to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. As a result of the modifications, the current portfolio exhibits strong payment performance with 86% current on principal and interest payments at December 31, 2010. Total growth in this portfolio has slowed during the latter half of 2010 as a result of a reduced inflow of newly delinquent loans and fewer modifications of more seriously delinquent loans. A key leading indicator of asset quality, particularly for consumer loans, is early stage delinquencies. This leading indicator of future asset quality has fallen significantly since the beginning of 2009. During this time, the economy and employment conditions have improved somewhat, but remain sluggish overall. As a result, we do not expect further improvement in early stage delinquencies until economic conditions improve. See additional discussion of credit and asset quality in the Loans, Allowance for Credit Losses, and Nonperforming Assets, sections of this MD&A. Our capital remained strong during 2010, as evidenced by the increases in our capital ratios. Our Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.67%, which was an increase from 12.96% at December 31, 2009. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio increased to 8.08% compared to 7.67% at December 31, 2009. Our total capital ratio was stable at 16.54% compared to 16.43% at December 31, 2009. With strong capital, more clarity on capital standards, lower risk, ample liquidity, and improved earnings, we believe that we are well positioned to repay TARP at the appropriate time and in a fashion that makes the most sense from both shareholder and regulatory perspectives. We have been and will continue to invest in our people and businesses to support future growth. At the same time, we recognize the value of returning capital to shareholders, so in that regard, our priorities are repaying TARP and increasing the common dividend. See additional discussion of our liquidity and capital position in the Liquidity Risk and Capital Resources sections of this MD&A. 25 Table of Contents During the year, average loans declined 6% compared to the 2009 average loan balance, with the majority of the decline due to a reduction in our exposure to real estate related assets and commercial loans, as well as due to weak loan demand during the year. While the total average balances have declined, our risk profile during the year has also improved as much of the decline has been in higher risk loans while growth in certain portfolios included the addition of lower risk loans that have attractive return and credit characteristics including an increase in government guaranteed loans. Despite recent soft loan demand we remain focused on extending credit to qualified borrowers as businesses and consumers work through the economic downturn. During 2010, we extended approximately $74.3 billion in new loan originations, commitments, and renewals of commercial and consumer loans to our clients. Consumer and commercial deposits increased during the year and a positive shift in mix to lower cost deposits was prevalent as average balance increases were driven by lower cost noninterest bearing and money market accounts, which increased from 2009 by 8% and 22%, respectively, providing $8.9 billion in combined average growth. Partially offsetting this growth was the decline in higher cost CD balances, which decreased an average of $6.3 billion during 2010. Due to the growth seen during 2010 in core deposits, our liquidity was enhanced. Additionally, this increase in low cost deposits has enabled us to reduce our higher cost funding sources, helping to drive significant reductions in our funding costs and improvement in net interest margin. While we believe that a portion of the low cost deposit growth is attributable to clients holding higher levels of liquidity, we also believe that the growth is a direct result of investments that we have made to enhance our clients banking experience and to drive household market share growth. Our client focused revenue generation strategies, lower cost funding mix, improved asset quality, and continued expense management discipline contributed to improved operating trends as seen in higher net interest margin, higher core fee income, and controlled operating expenses. Total revenue, on an FTE basis, increased 5% compared to the prior year due to increased earning assets, stable fee based revenue, particularly investment banking revenue, and expanded net interest margin. Net interest income, on an FTE basis, increased 8%, compared to 2009. The increase in net interest income is due to lower funding costs, improved funding mix, and a reduction in long term debt. As a result, our net interest margin increased to 3.38% for the year ended December 31, 2010 from 3.04% in 2009. Noninterest income remained stable during 2010, most notably due to increases in trading income offset by lower mortgage production income and lower service charges on deposit accounts. Noninterest expense decreased 10% compared to 2009, driven primarily by a noncash goodwill impairment charge taken during 2009. When excluding that impairment charge, noninterest expense increased 2% in 2010 when compared to 2009. This increase was driven by increases in outside processing and software, marketing expenses, and compensation, as we sought to balance investments in our business with expense discipline. Consistent with our focus to invest in our people and grow the business, the increases in these categories related specifically to hiring in technology, mortgage, and client support areas, investing in client acquisition and risk management technology, and more broadly related to higher transaction volumes and additional investments focused on growth of our business. Partially offsetting these increases were declines in credit related costs of $28 million. We also experienced higher losses on debt extinguishment compared to 2009 as we proactively reduced our dependency on higher cost funding as a result of excess liquidity. See additional discussion of our financial performance in the Consolidated Financial Results section of this MD&A. 26 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS Table 1 Consolidated Daily Average Balances, Income/Expense And Average Yields Earned And Rates Paid 2010 2009 2008 (Dollars in millions; yields on taxable equivalent basis) AverageBalances Income/Expense Yields/Rates AverageBalances Income/Expense Yields/Rates AverageBalances Income/Expense Yields/Rates Assets Loans:1,6 Real estate residential mortgage 1 4 family $29,058 $1,553 5.35 % $29,588 $1,723 5.82 % $31,859 $2,005 6.29 % Real estate construction 3,402 126 3.69 5,991 198 3.31 10,828 576 5.32 Real estate home equity lines 14,912 503 3.37 15,685 523 3.34 15,205 797 5.24 Real estate commercial 14,578 593 4.07 15,573 639 4.11 13,969 790 5.65 Commercial FTE2 32,788 1,828 5.57 36,458 1,820 4.99 38,132 2,090 5.48 Credit card 1,058 89 8.39 984 74 7.47 863 34 4.00 Consumer direct 5,812 251 4.32 5,101 207 4.06 4,542 254 5.60 Consumer indirect 7,530 423 5.62 6,594 418 6.34 7,262 460 6.33 Nonaccrual3 4,787 39 0.81 5,067 36 0.72 2,773 25 0.92 Total loans 113,925 5,405 4.74 121,041 5,638 4.66 125,433 7,031 5.61 Securities available for sale: Taxable 24,994 785 3.14 18,960 790 4.17 12,220 731 5.98 Tax exempt FTE2 783 42 5.34 1,003 55 5.46 1,038 63 6.07 Total securities available for sale FTE 25,777 827 3.21 19,963 845 4.23 13,258 794 5.99 Funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell 969 1 0.08 794 2 0.27 1,318 25 1.91 Loans held for sale 3,295 136 4.14 5,228 233 4.45 5,106 290 5.68 Interest bearing deposits 26 0.17 25 0.91 25 1 3.18 Interest earning trading assets 3,195 90 2.79 3,857 115 2.99 7,609 304 4.00 Total earning assets 147,187 6,459 4.39 150,908 6,833 4.53 152,749 8,445 5.53 Allowance for loan and lease losses (3,045 ) (2,706 ) (1,815 ) Cash and due from banks 4,821 4,844 3,093 Other assets 18,268 17,355 17,270 Noninterest earning trading assets 2,913 3,429 2,642 Unrealized gains on securities available for sale, net 2,231 1,612 1,909 Total assets $172,375 $175,442 $175,848 Liabilities and Shareholders Equity Interest bearing deposits: NOW accounts $24,668 $58 0.24 % $23,601 $99 0.42 % $21,081 $253 1.20 % Money market accounts 38,893 227 0.58 31,864 315 0.99 26,565 520 1.96 Savings 4,028 9 0.22 3,664 10 0.27 3,771 16 0.43 Consumer time 14,232 267 1.87 16,718 479 2.87 16,770 639 3.81 Other time 9,205 189 2.05 13,068 382 2.92 12,197 479 3.92 Total interest bearing consumer and commercial deposits 91,026 750 0.82 88,915 1,285 1.45 80,384 1,907 2.37 Brokered deposits 2,561 110 4.29 5,648 154 2.69 10,493 392 3.73 Foreign deposits 355 0.13 434 1 0.12 4,250 79 1.85 Total interest bearing deposits 93,942 860 0.92 94,997 1,440 1.52 95,127 2,378 2.50 Funds purchased 1,226 2 0.19 1,670 3 0.19 2,622 52 1.96 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase 2,416 4 0.15 2,483 5 0.18 4,961 79 1.59 Interest bearing trading liabilities 833 30 3.58 487 20 4.14 786 27 3.46 Other short term borrowings 3,014 13 0.43 2,704 15 0.54 3,057 55 1.80 Long term debt 16,096 580 3.60 20,119 761 3.78 22,893 1,117 4.88 Total interest bearing liabilities 117,527 1,489 1.27 122,460 2,244 1.83 129,446 3,708 2.86 Noninterest bearing deposits 26,103 24,249 20,949 Other liabilities 4,097 4,387 5,061 Noninterest bearing trading liabilities 1,814 2,060 1,796 Shareholders equity 22,834 22,286 18,596 Total liabilities and shareholders equity $172,375 $175,442 $175,848 Interest Rate Spread 3.12 % 2.70 % 2.67 % Net Interest Income FTE4 $4,970 $4,589 $4,737 Net Interest Margin5 3.38 % 3.04 % 3.10 % 1Interest income includes loan fees of $146 million, $148 million, and $142 million for the three years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

Due to sustained performance, accruing TDRs have been reclassified to the applicable loans category where the related interest income is being classified in all periods presented. 4The Company obtained derivative instruments to manage the Companys interest sensitivity position that increased net interest income $617 million, $488 million and $181 million in the periods ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 5The net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income FTE by average total earning assets. 6Loan categories in this table are presented using pre adoption classifications due to an inability to produce average balances using post adoption classifications. 27 Table of Contents Table 2 Analysis of Changes in Net Interest Income 1 2010 Compared to 2009Increase (Decrease) Due to 2009 Compared to 2008 Increase(Decrease) Due to (Dollars in millions on a taxable equivalent basis) Volume Rate Net Volume Rate Net Interest Income Loans: Real estate 1 4 family ($31 ) ($138 ) ($169 ) ($138 ) ($144 ) ($282 ) Real estate construction (93 ) 21 (72 ) (205 ) (173 ) (378 ) Real estate home equity lines (25 ) 4 (21 ) 24 (298 ) (274 ) Real estate commercial (40 ) (6 ) (46 ) 83 (233 ) (150 ) Commercial FTE2 (193 ) 201 8 (89 ) (181 ) (270 ) Credit card 6 9 15 5 34 39 Consumer direct 30 14 44 29 (76 ) (47 ) Consumer indirect 56 (51 ) 5 (42 ) (42 ) Nonaccrual (2 ) 5 3 17 (6 ) 11 Securities available for sale: Taxable 217 (222 ) (5 ) 324 (265 ) 59 Tax exempt 2 (12 ) (1 ) (13 ) (2 ) (6 ) (8 ) Funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell 1 (2 ) (1 ) (7 ) (16 ) (23 ) Loans held for sale (81 ) (15 ) (96 ) 7 (64 ) (57 ) Interest bearing deposits (1 ) (1 ) Interest earning trading assets (19 ) (7 ) (26 ) (125 ) (64 ) (189 ) Total interest income (186 ) (188 ) (374 ) (119 ) (1,493 ) (1,612 ) Interest Expense NOW accounts 4 (45 ) (41 ) 27 (181 ) (154 ) Money market accounts 61 (148 ) (87 ) 89 (295 ) (206 ) Savings 1 (2 ) (1 ) (6 ) (6 ) Consumer time (63 ) (149 ) (212 ) (2 ) (158 ) (160 ) Other time (97 ) (97 ) (194 ) 32 (128 ) (96 ) Brokered deposits (108 ) 64 (44 ) (150 ) (87 ) (237 ) Foreign deposits (38 ) (40 ) (78 ) Funds purchased (1 ) (1 ) (14 ) (34 ) (48 ) Securities sold under agreements to repurchase (1 ) (1 ) (27 ) (48 ) (75 ) Interest bearing trading liabilities 13 (3 ) 10 (12 ) 5 (7 ) Other short term borrowings 1 (3 ) (2 ) (6 ) (35 ) (41 ) Long term debt (147 ) (35 ) (182 ) (124 ) (232 ) (356 ) Total interest expense (336 ) (419 ) (755 ) (225 ) (1,239 ) (1,464 ) Net change in net interest income $150 $231 $381 $106 ($254 ) ($148 ) 1Changes in net interest income are attributed to either changes in average balances (volume change) or changes in average rates (rate change) for earning assets and sources of funds on which interest is received or paid. Volume change is calculated as change in volume times the previous rate, while rate change is change in rate times the previous volume. The rate/volume change, change in rate times change in volume, is allocated between volume change and rate change at the ratio each component bears to the absolute value of their total. 2Interest income includes the effects of the taxable equivalent adjustments to increase tax exempt interest income to a taxable equivalent basis. Net Interest Income/Margin Net interest income, on an FTE basis, was $5.0 billion during 2010, an increase of $381 million, or 8%, from 2009. This increase was driven mainly by a continued positive trend in net interest margin, which increased 34 basis points to 3.38% in 2010 from 3.04% in 2009. Earning asset yields declined 14 basis points compared to 2009 from 4.53% to 4.39%, but the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased 56 basis points over the same period. The biggest contributors to the net interest margin increase were growth in low cost deposits, lower rates paid on time deposits, and a reduction in higher cost long term debt coupled with a strong focus on loan pricing and higher commercial loan yields due to our commercial loan swap position. These favorable margin contributors were partially offset by a reduction in residential mortgage loan yields and an increase in lower yielding securities. We currently expect margin to be relatively stable in the near term. Risks to this expectation include the potential impacts of a prolonged low rate environment, yield curve flattening, a shift in deposit mix and volume, and loan pricing, while opportunities include continued deposit re pricing, further steepening of the yield curve, and lower nonperforming assets. As 28 Table of Contents a result of the consolidation of off balance sheet entities under new accounting guidance effective January 1, 2010, we realized an additional $45 million in net interest income during the year. The consolidations resulted in the re characterization of fees earned by certain of our newly consolidated entities from noninterest income to net interest income. The effect of this consolidation resulted in a small dilutive impact to net interest margin. Previously, we recorded income on these off balance sheet entities primarily within investment banking income in noninterest income. Average earning assets decreased $3.7 billion, or 2%, from 2009, while average interest bearing liabilities declined $4.9 billion, or 4%. Average loans decreased $7.1 billion, or 6%. The decline in loans was attributable to a $3.7 billion, or 10%, reduction in commercial loans, a $2.6 billion, or 43%, reduction in real estate construction loans, a $995 million, or 6%, reduction in real estate commercial, and a $773 million, or 5%, reduction in real estate home equity loans. These decreases were partially offset by increases of $936 million, or 14%, in consumer indirect loans, driven by purchases of high quality auto loan portfolios and $711 million, or 14%, in consumer direct loans. Average LHFS were $3.3 billion, a decrease of $1.9 billion, or 37%, from 2009. The decrease in LHFS occurred as a result of decreased mortgage loan production refinance activity during the year, as well as a reduction in student loans held for sale due to recently enacted legislation eliminating our ability to originate and sell this product. Reduced demand in borrowing among credit worthy clients coupled with our efforts to reduce higher risk loan portfolios has resulted in an overall decrease in loan balances, which coupled with higher deposit levels, has led us to seek other investment opportunities, causing an increase in average securities AFS. Average securities AFS increased $5.8 billion, or 29%, due to increases of $4.5 billion in U.S. Treasury and agency securities, $930 million in MBS, and $711 million in ABS. These positions were added during a declining rate environment resulting in a 102 basis point decline in the weighted average yield on securities AFS compared to 2009. See additional discussion in the Securities Available for Sale section included in this MD&A for more information on the repositioning of our securities AFS portfolio. Our loan portfolio yielded 4.74% for the year, up 8 basis points from 2009. Since a large percentage of our commercial loans are variable rate indexed to one month LIBOR, we utilize receive fixed/pay floating interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2010, the outstanding notional balance of swaps was $15.9 billion, which qualified as cash flow hedges on variable rate commercial loans compared to $18.6 billion as of December 31, 2009. Swap income increased from $539 million in 2009 to $617 million in 2010, primarily due to increased realized gains on terminated swaps during 2010 and one month LIBOR being lower in 2010 compared to 2009. While the underlying loans swapped to fixed rates are classified as both CRE and commercial, all of the swap income is recorded as interest on commercial loans. The classification of all swap income in the commercial loan category and the declining balance of average commercial loans produced an increase in reported commercial loan yields as compared to a decrease in underlying rate indices. In addition, loan related interest income has been augmented by improved risk based pricing discipline. Average consumer and commercial deposits increased $4.0 billion, or 4%, in 2010 compared to 2009. This growth consisted of increases of $7.0 billion, or 22%, in money market accounts, $1.1 billion, or 5%, in NOW accounts, and $1.9 billion, or 8%, in demand deposits, partially offset by a decline of $6.3 billion, or 21%, in consumer and commercial time deposits. Low cost deposit growth was the result of marketing campaigns, competitive pricing and clients increased preference for more liquid products. However, a portion of the deposit growth is related to reduced client demand for sweep accounts due to the low interest rate environment. The overall growth in consumer and commercial deposits allowed for a reduction in other funding sources, including $4.0 billion of long term debt and $3.1 billion of brokered deposits. Overall, average interest bearing liabilities declined $4.9 billion, or 4%. We continue to pursue deposit growth initiatives to increase our presence in specific markets within our footprint. Competition for deposits remains strong, and as a result, deposit pricing pressure remains across our footprint. Despite these challenging market conditions, we have used a combination of regional and product specific pricing initiatives to balance margin and volume, while still growing our average deposit balances. While we acknowledge some of this growth is seasonal and influenced by the current economic environment, we also believe that the growth is the direct result of investments that we have made to enhance our clients banking experience and to drive household and market share growth. During 2010, the interest rate environment was characterized by flat short term rates and lower medium and long term rates, resulting in a flatter yield curve versus 2009. More specifically, the Fed funds target rate averaged 0.25%, unchanged from last year, the Prime rate averaged 3.25%, unchanged from last year, one month LIBOR averaged 0.27%, a decrease of 6 basis points, three month LIBOR averaged 0.34%, a decrease of 31 basis points, five year swaps averaged 2.10%, a decrease of 55 basis points, and ten year swaps averaged 3.18%, a decrease of 26 basis points. Foregone interest income from NPLs reduced net interest margin by 20 basis points for 2010, compared to 21 basis points in 2009, as average nonaccrual loans decreased $280 million, or 6% from 2009. See additional discussion of our expectations 29 Table of Contents for future levels of credit quality in the Allowance for Credit Losses, and Nonperforming Assets sections of this MD&A. Tables 1 and 2 contain more detailed information concerning average balances, yields earned, and rates paid.

The increase was attributable to increases in investment banking income, trading account profits/(losses) and commissions, and card fees, largely offset by a decline in mortgage production related income and service charges on deposit accounts. Investment banking income increased by $41 million, or 15%, versus the year ended December 31, 2009. Strong loan syndication, bond originations, and mergers and acquisitions revenues drove the increase, which was partially offset by the re characterization of fees earned by certain of our newly consolidated entities from noninterest income to net interest income. Trading account profits/(losses) and commissions improved during the year ended December 31, 2010 by $214 million, primarily due to mark to market valuations on our public debt and related hedges carried at fair value. We recorded valuation gains of $36 million for the year December 31, 2010 on our public debt versus losses of $153 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. These market valuation changes were driven by changes in our credit spreads and changes in interest rates. Additionally, as liquidity returned to the market for certain illiquid assets, including ARS, net market valuation adjustments and net gains on the disposition of such assets improved by $47 million versus the year ended December 31, 2009. Other core trading results were essentially flat year over year. We do not currently believe that the legislative and regulatory changes related to derivatives will have a material impact on our revenue related to trading account activities. Net securities gains increased by $93 million versus the year ended December 31, 2009. The gains were the result of certain portfolio repositioning initiatives undertaken during 2010. See Securities Available for Sale in this MD&A for further discussion of our portfolio repositioning initiatives. Additionally, we recorded $2 million in credit related OTTI losses on securities AFS during the year ended December 31, 2010 versus $20 million in losses during the year ended December 31, 2009. Card fees increased by $52 million, or 16%, versus the year ended December 31, 2009. Card fees increased due to check card interchange fees. Growth was driven by household expansion, higher product penetration, and increasing consumer usage patterns which will help offset the potential impact of lower interchange rates. However, the Federal Reserves recent proposal on debit card interchange could significantly impact this source of revenue going forward. For 2010, we recorded approximately $332 million of interchange income; our current estimate is that provisions of the Dodd Frank Act may cause future annual interchange income to decline by as much as 75% from 2010 levels, beginning in the second half of 2011. However, this estimate is based upon the current proposal and does not take into account any actions that we will pursue to alter our fee structure to clients or to alter the costs of operating the debit card business. 30 Table of Contents Trust and investment management income increased by $17 million, or 3%, versus the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was attributable to higher market valuations on managed equity assets and fixed income asset inflows, partially offset by lower money market mutual fund revenue. Mortgage servicing related income increased $28 million, or 8%, versus the year ended December 31, 2009, due to higher servicing fees, partially offset by the negative impact of increased prepayments during 2010. Mortgage production related income decreased by $249 million, or 66%, versus the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease was due to a $21 billion, or 42%, decline in loan production. The provision for mortgage repurchase related losses for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by 3% to $456 million versus $444 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2010, the reserve for mortgage repurchase losses was $265 million, an increase of $65 million versus the prior year. The increase in the reserve was due to a continued increase in repurchase requests during 2010 and expected elevated levels for the foreseeable future. We expect future repurchase related losses and reserves will be largely driven by the volume of repurchase requests received from the GSEs, which have exhibited considerable month to month volatility. To date, the majority of our repurchase requests have been associated with 2006 and 2007 vintages, which produce higher losses. We expect that normal seasoning patterns for origination vintages, over time, will shift new repurchase requests to newer production vintages which have a lower risk profile. As that occurs, we expect lower aggregate request volumes and lower loss frequencies and severities, as the newer vintages exhibit more favorable characteristics, such as higher FICOs and lower original LTVs, as they were originated during or after periods that experienced the most significant home price depreciation. If our assumptions are correct, we expect a favorable impact on noninterest income from curtailed mortgage repurchases losses in 2011. With respect to non agency loan sales, we have sold $30.3 billion of such loans since 2005, with an insignificant amount of such sales occurring after 2007. Of this amount, we estimate that $16.7 billion is still outstanding. In addition to outstanding loans, our repurchase exposure includes loans no longer outstanding due to foreclosures or short sales. To date, we have received a modest number of repurchase requests regarding such loans, which have not resulted in any material repurchase related losses. While our losses have not been significant, we have been factoring our non agency loss experience into our mortgage repurchase reserve process. However, if such repurchase requests increase materially in the future, we could suffer additional losses. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors to this Annual Report on Form 10 K and Note 18, Reinsurance Arrangements and Guarantees Loan Sales, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Service charges on deposit accounts decreased by $88 million, or 10%, versus the year ended December 31, 2009. The decreases were attributable to the implementation of Regulation E changes and a voluntary decision to eliminate overdraft fees on very small individual transactions, as well as reducing the maximum number of daily overdraft fees. The voluntary changes were in place for the entire third quarter while the Regulation E changes became effective in the middle of the third quarter. Until clients have fully exercised their opt in opportunity and reacted to our client satisfaction initiatives around overdraft fees, we expect service charge income to decline over the next few quarters, with the reduction gradually moderating over time. The effects of adopting Regulation E and our voluntary overdraft changes impacted our fourth quarter results and are expected to have a full year impact within the range of $120 to $170 million. This estimate, however, does not consider any mitigating actions that we may take. Retail investment services income decreased by $13 million, or 6%, versus the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease was attributable to declines to fixed annuity revenue, partially offset by increased recurring brokerage revenue linked to the equity markets and increased transactional revenue from variable annuity and mutual fund sales. Other income increased by $25 million, or 15%, versus the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was largely attributable to a $24 million reduction in net losses recognized on certain private equity investments as compared to the prior year. 31 Table of Contents Table 4 Noninterest Expense Year Ended December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Employee compensation $2,364 $2,258 $2,327 Employee benefits 457 542 434 Personnel expense 2,821 2,800 2,761 Other real estate expense 300 244 105 Credit and collection services 279 259 156 Operating losses 83 99 446 Mortgage reinsurance 27 115 180 Credit related costs 689 717 887 Outside processing and software 638 579 493 Net occupancy expense 361 357 347 Regulatory assessments 265 302 55 Marketing and customer development 177 152 372 Equipment expense 174 172 203 Consulting and legal 84 57 59 Postage and delivery 83 84 90 Net loss on debt extinguishment 70 39 12 Communications 64 67 70 Other staff expense 55 51 70 Amortization of intangible assets 51 56 76 Operating supplies 47 41 44 Impairment of goodwill/intangible assets 751 45 Visa litigation 7 (33 ) Merger expense 13 Other expense 332 330 315 Total noninterest expense $5,911 $6,562 $5,879 Noninterest Expense Noninterest expense decreased by $651 million, or 10%, versus the year ended December 31, 2009. Included in noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 was a $751 million non cash goodwill impairment charge recognized in the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge, noninterest expense increased by $100 million, or approximately 2%, versus the year ended December 31, 2009. The impact of excluding the non cash goodwill impairment charge provides a more meaningful comparison to the results in the current year by removing this nonrecurring item. The increase in 2010 expenses excluding the prior year goodwill impairment charge was reflective of our desire to balance investments in the business with our expense discipline. Specifically, the increase in core noninterest expense was primarily attributable to higher outside processing and software costs, increased marketing and customer development costs, higher consulting and legal expenses, higher personnel expense, and increased net loss on debt extinguishment, partially offset by a decline in regulatory expenses and credit related costs. Credit related costs decreased by $28 million, or 4%, versus the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease was due to decline in mortgage reinsurance losses of $88 million, partially offset by an increase in other real estate expenses of $56 million. Mortgage reinsurance expenses relate to the activities of our mortgage reinsurance guaranty subsidiary, Twin Rivers, whose loss exposure arises from third party mortgage insurers transferring a portion of their first loss exposure when losses by mortgage origination year exceed certain thresholds. Since the first quarter of 2009, our exposure to reinsurance losses has been limited to incremental insurance premium contributions, which has caused the steady decline in this expense as we ceased writing new contracts in 2009. Other real estate expense increased compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in net losses on the sale of OREO properties. Regulatory assessments decreased by $37 million, or 12%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, attributable to the decline in FDIC insurance premiums, primarily due to the payment of the special assessment levied on all banks during the second quarter of 2009, offset by higher deposit balances in 2010. With respect to the current FDIC deposit insurance 32 Table of Contents proposal, the calculation will be based on net assets, not on deposits, which will raise our assessment base beginning in the second quarter of 2011; however, we expect that over time, the higher assessment base will be mitigated as improving operating trends, such as asset quality and earnings, favorably impact future premium calculations. While all of this may lead to some volatility in our quarterly expense, we do not expect a significant increase in our 2011 expense base. Personnel expense increased by $21 million, or 1%, versus the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was attributable to higher salaries, incentive compensation, and contract labor expenses, offset by a reduction in pension and other postretirement benefit expenses as a result of improved performance in the underlying plan assets in 2010. Full time equivalent employees increased by 1,055 compared to December 31, 2009, with the majority of the increase resulting from hiring within our technology, mortgage, retail branches, and client support areas. These increases are a direct result of our commitment to investing in our business. Higher incentive compensation expense resulted from the strong revenue performance of certain business lines during 2010. Outside processing and software costs increased by $59 million, or 10%, versus the year ended December 31, 2009, related to increased transaction volumes along with client acquisition and risk management technology investments made to enhance the client experience. Marketing and customer development costs increased by $25 million, or 16%, versus the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was attributable to higher promotional and advertising spending and more broadly as a result of investments made during the year to aid in the overall growth of our business. Consulting and legal expenses increased by $27 million, or 47%, versus the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was attributable to increases in litigation fees and expenses, coupled with an increase in consulting activities. Net losses on debt extinguishment increased by $31 million versus the year ended December 31, 2009. Net losses on debt extinguishment in the current year were primarily due to early termination fees on the extinguishments of $1.7 billion in FHLB borrowings, in addition to the fees paid to repurchase $750 million of our debt in a tender offer during the third quarter. Net losses in the prior year primarily resulted from early termination fees for FHLB advances repaid during the year, net of gains on extinguishment of other long term debt. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes includes both federal and state income taxes. In 2010, the provision for income taxes was a benefit of $185 million, compared to a benefit of $898 million in 2009. The 2010 effective tax rate was primarily driven by net favorable permanent tax items such as tax exempt interest income and tax credits significantly exceeding the positive pre tax earnings. The 2009 effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the pre tax loss and further increased by net favorable permanent tax items such as tax exempt interest income, federal tax credits and the release of UTBs related to the completion of audit examinations by several taxing authorities; it was, however, reduced by a non tax deductible goodwill impairment. For additional information on the reconciliation of the effective tax rate, refer to Note 15, Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Loans As discussed in Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we recently adopted new accounting guidance that requires additional disclosures about the credit quality of our loan portfolios and the credit reserves held against them. These new disclosures are intended to 1) describe the nature of credit risk inherent in our loan portfolio, 2) determine how we analyze and assess that risk in arriving at an adequate and appropriate ALLL, and 3) explain the changes in the ALLL and reasons for those changes. Additionally, the new disclosures are required to be made on a disaggregated basis by loan portfolio segment and or by type of loan. A portfolio segment is defined as the level at which we develop and document our method for determining our ALLL. Loan types are further categories of our portfolio segments. In conjunction with adopting the new accounting guidance, we have adjusted prior year loan classifications to align with the current year loan classifications. While the reclassification had no effect on the carrying value of our LHFI or LHFS, SEC regulations require us, in some instances, to present five years of comparable data where trend information may be deemed relevant, in which case we have provided the pre adoption loan classifications due to the inability to restate all prior periods under the new loan classifications. 33 Table of Contents Under the post adoption classification, we have included commercial and construction loans secured by owner occupied properties as part of commercial and industrial loans, as the primary source of loan repayment for owner occupied properties is business income and not real estate operations.

Loans Held for Investment LHFI increased by $2.3 billion, or 2%, during the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was attributable to an increase in consumer loans, partially offset by a decrease in commercial loans. Residential loans were relatively flat year over year, although the risk profile of the residential profile improved during the period. Commercial loans decreased by $2.2 billion, or 4%, during the year ended December 31, 2010, which was largely attributable to a decline in commercial construction loans. Commercial construction loans decreased by $2.4 billion, or 48%, primarily as a result of our efforts to reduce risk levels by aggressively managing existing construction exposure and significantly limiting new production. Partially offsetting this decline was growth from our asset backed commercial paper conduit, which we consolidated effective January 1, 2010 as a result of new accounting guidance. Line of credit utilization rates among our corporate clients have stabilized, although they remain low overall. We continue to expect that broad based commercial loan growth will return with an improving economy. However, the evidence to date suggests that growth will occur gradually. As this occurs, we will continue to grow commercial loans in client segments and products that offer opportunities. Residential loans increased by $33 million, or less than 1%, during the year ended December 31, 2010. However, the composition of the residential loan portfolio changed during the year, as we continued to reduce our exposure to higher risk loans. Nonguaranteed residential mortgages declined by $1.9 billion, or 7%, due to paydowns and charge offs. Additionally, we reduced our home equity loan portfolio by $1.0 billion, or 6%, and our residential construction portfolio by $618 million, or 32%, while increasing the amount of government guaranteed mortgages by $3.6 billion, or 376%, as part of our efforts to reduce overall risk and further diversify our loan portfolio. 34 Table of Contents Consumer loans increased by $4.5 billion, or 39%, during the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was primarily attributable to a $1.5 billion increase in guaranteed student loans, which included the $0.5 billion impact of consolidating a student loan trust during the year, and a $2.8 billion increase in indirect consumer loans, which included purchases of $1.7 billion in automobile loans during the year. We have been opportunistic with consumer loan purchases completed to date, as we have found them to have attractive returns and credit characteristics. Loans Held for Sale LHFS decreased by $1.2 billion, or 25%, during year ended December 31, 2010. The decline is attributable to recently enacted legislation that prohibits us from originating federally guaranteed student loans and to lower levels of mortgage loan originations, partially offset by the addition of LHFS related to a CLO entity that was consolidated as of January 1, 2010.

Asset Quality Our overall asset quality has improved significantly since December 31, 2009, as nonperforming assets, nonaccrual loans and net charge offs all declined compared to the prior year. 35 Table of Contents The commercial and industrial loan portfolio continues to perform well, as evidenced by improving trends in our credit quality indicators. Delinquencies, net charge offs, and nonperforming loans all decreased year over year within this portfolio. Under the post adoption classification, our commercial real estate portfolio consists of investor owned properties. We believe that our investor owned portfolio is appropriately diversified by borrower, geography, and property type. We typically underwrite commercial projects to credit standards that are more stringent than historical CMBS guidelines. Given the stresses in the commercial real estate market, we have performed a thorough analysis of our commercial real estate portfolio in order to identify loans with an increased risk of default. Where appropriate, we have taken prudent actions with the client to strengthen our credit position. These actions reflect market terms and structures and are intended to improve the clients financial ability to perform. Impaired loans are assessed relative to the clients and guarantors, if any, abilities to service the debt, the loan terms, and the value of the property. These factors are taken into consideration when formulating our ALLL through our credit risk rating and or specific reserving processes. We believe the current commercial real estate cycle is not over, and we expect some elevated risk and variability in performance through the credit cycle. We continue to believe that this portfolio will perform comparatively well given its composition, the quality of our underwriting, and our ongoing management disciplines. For our commercial construction portfolios, we continue to be proactive in our credit monitoring and management processes to provide early warning for problem loans. For example, we use an expanded liquidity and contingency analysis to provide a thorough view of borrower capacity and their ability to service obligations in a steep market decline. We also have strict limits and exposure caps on specific projects and borrowers for risk diversification. Due to the lack of new construction projects and the completion of many that were previously started, the aggregate amount of interest reserves that we are obligated to fund has declined from prior periods and are not considered material relative to total loans outstanding. We expect quarterly variability in losses as we continue to work through the remaining risk in this runoff portfolio. The residential mortgages portfolio continued to show overall improvement in terms of declines in NPLs and net charge offs, as well as stable but continued elevated delinquencies. Certain products within this portfolio are insured through third party pool level insurance; however, the dollar amount of claims received has declined during 2010 and we expect fewer claim payments going forward as we approach the insurance stop loss limits. Our outlook for the residential mortgage portfolio, based on past delinquency trends, is for reduced frequency of default over the next few quarters. We expect home prices to remain soft overall, trending down in some markets and stable to modestly up in other markets. We believe that lower expected default frequency and moderating loss severity will produce stable to modestly declining nonperforming loan and charge off levels over the near term. Asset quality in the home equity portfolio was slightly improved during the year, while higher risk balances continued to decline. Net charge offs, early stage delinquencies, and nonperforming loans all showed modest year over year declines. Runoff in this portfolio has been concentrated in the higher risk portfolios, where no new production has occurred and little to no line availability exists. The residential construction portfolio also showed improvement in terms of declines in NPLs and net charge offs. Net charge offs are expected to remain elevated and uneven as we work through the remainder of the risk in this portfolio. Further, while there may be some variability, we generally expect this trend of declining nonperforming loans to continue as we aggressively pursue workouts and transition foreclosed assets to OREO, and ultimately, disposition. For the consumer portfolios, asset quality improved during the year. For all consumer portfolios, the net charge off ratio declined in 2010 versus 2009. Likewise, early stage delinquencies declined across all portfolios except student loans, which are largely government guaranteed. Meanwhile, the level of nonperforming consumer loans remained relatively flat. We believe that our loan portfolio is well diversified by product, client, and geography throughout our footprint. However, our loan portfolio may be exposed to certain concentrations of credit risk which exist in relation to individual borrowers or groups of borrowers, certain types of collateral, certain types of industries, certain loan products, or certain regions of the country. See Note 19, Concentrations of Credit Risk, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 36 Table of Contents The following table shows our wholesale lending exposure at December 31, 2010 and 2009 to selected industries.

Additionally, the table above excludes student loans and residential mortgages that were guaranteed by government agencies and for which there was nominal risk of principal loss. Allowance for Credit Losses At December 31, 2010, the allowance for credit losses was $3.0 billion, which includes both the ALLL as well as the reserve for unfunded commitments. See Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 7, Allowance for Credit Losses, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well the Allowance for Credit Losses section within the Critical Accounting 37 Table of Contents Policies in this MD&A for further information regarding our ALLL accounting policy, determination, and allocation. As previously noted, while the reclassification of our loan types had no effect on total loan charge offs and loan recoveries, SEC regulations require us, in some instances, to present five years of comparable data where trend information may be deemed relevant, in which case we have provided the pre adoption charge off and recovery classifications due to the inability to restate prior periods under the new classifications. A rollforward of our allowance for credit losses, along with our summarized credit losses experience, is shown in the tables below: Table 10 Summary of Credit Losses Experience (Post Adoption) For the YearsEnded December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Allowance for Credit Losses Balance beginning of period $3,235 $2,379 Allowance recorded upon VIE consolidation 1 Provision for loan losses 2,708 4,007 Provision for unfunded commitments1 (57 ) 87 Charge offs: Commercial loans (1,087 ) (1,432 ) Residential loans (1,736 ) (1,707 ) Consumer loans (195 ) (259 ) Total charge offs (3,018 ) (3,398 ) Recoveries: Commercial loans 99 84 Residential loans 20 17 Consumer loans 44 59 Total recoveries 163 160 Net charge offs (2,855 ) (3,238 ) Balance end of period $3,032 $3,235 Components: ALLL $2,974 $3,120 Unfunded commitments reserve2 58 115 Allowance for credit losses $3,032 $3,235 Average loans $113,925 $121,041 Year end loans outstanding 115,975 113,675 Ratios: Allowance to year end loans3,4 2.58 % 2.76 % Allowance to nonperforming loans3 72.86 58.86 Allowance to net charge offs3 1.04 x 0.96 x Net charge offs to average loans 2.51 % 2.67 % Provision for loan losses to average loans 2.38 3.31 Recoveries to total charge offs 5.4 4.7 1Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009, SunTrust began recording the provision for unfunded commitments within the provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss). Given the immateriality of this provision, prior to the fourth quarter of 2009, the provision for unfunded commitments remains classified within other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss). 2The unfunded commitments reserve is separately recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 3This ratio is calculated using the ALLL. 4For this ratio, $492 million and $449 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, of LHFI carried at fair value were excluded from year end loans. The ALLL decreased by $146 million, or 5%, during the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in ALLL reflects improvements in asset quality during the year, partially mitigated by the continued uncertainty in the overall economic outlook. The ratio of the ALLL to total NPLs increased to 72.86% as of December 31, 2010 from 58.86% as of December 31, 2009. The increase in this ratio was attributable to the $1.3 billion decrease in NPLs, partially offset by the decline in ALLL. The decrease in NPLs was due to charge offs recognized, the migration of loans to OREO, and reduced inflows into nonaccrual status. See additional discussion regarding NPL trends in the Nonperforming Assets section of the MD&A. 38 Table of Contents The variables most impacting the ALLL continue to be unemployment, residential real estate property values, and the variability and relative strength of the housing market. At this point in the cycle, we expect the ALLL to continue to trend downward at a pace consistent with improvements in credit quality and overall economic conditions. As of December 31, 2010, the allowance to period end loans ratio was 2.58%, down 18 basis points from December 31, 2009. Loan loss reserves are declining on both an absolute and relative basis for three primary reasons. First, higher risk portfolio balances continue to decline. Second, charge offs associated with some of the higher risk portfolios, such as construction, are reducing reserves. Third, emerging risks have moderated. The loan production that has replaced recent runoff and charge offs is higher quality commercial and consumer loans, as well as government guaranteed student and mortgage loans. Government guaranteed loans represented 8% of our total LHFI portfolio at December 31, 2010 versus 3% of the total LHFI portfolio at December 31, 2009. The reserve for unfunded commitments was $58 million as of December 31, 2010, a decrease of $57 million from December 31, 2009. The decrease in the reserve was attributed to improved credit quality related to certain commercial and large corporate borrowers and secondarily as a result of a decrease in off balance sheet exposure. 39 Table of Contents Table 11 Summary of Credit Losses Experience (Pre Adoption) Year Ended December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 Allowance for Credit Losses Balance beginning of period $3,235 $2,379 $1,290 $1,047 $1,032 Allowance associated with loans at fair value1 (4 ) Allowance from acquisitions & other activity, net 1 159 Provision for loan losses 2,708 4,007 2,474 665 263 Provision for unfunded commitments2 (57 ) 87 20 5 (1 ) Charge offs: Commercial (386 ) (613 ) (219 ) (134 ) (179 ) Real estate: Home equity lines (591 ) (715 ) (449 ) (116 ) (29 ) Construction (447 ) (507 ) (194 ) (12 ) (2 ) Residential mortgages3 (1,281 ) (1,236 ) (525 ) (113 ) (30 ) Commercial real estate (92 ) (32 ) (25 ) (2 ) (8 ) Consumer loans: Direct (50 ) (57 ) (42 ) (24 ) (22 ) Indirect (84 ) (152 ) (193 ) (107 ) (82 ) Credit cards (87 ) (86 ) (33 ) (7 ) (5 ) Total charge offs (3,018 ) (3,398 ) (1,680 ) (515 ) (357 ) Recoveries: Commercial 46 40 24 23 29 Real estate: Home equity lines 40 30 16 8 7 Construction 12 8 3 1 2 Residential mortgages 21 18 8 6 8 Commercial real estate (2 ) 4 1 2 6 Consumer loans: Direct 8 8 8 10 12 Indirect 33 49 54 41 45 Credit cards 5 3 2 1 1 Total recoveries 163 160 116 92 110 Net charge offs (2,855 ) (3,238 ) (1,564 ) (423 ) (247 ) Balance end of period $3,032 $3,235 $2,379 $1,290 $1,047 Components: ALLL $2,974 $3,120 $2,351 $1,282 $1,045 Unfunded commitments reserve 58 115 28 8 2 Allowance for credit losses $3,032 $3,235 $2,379 $1,290 $1,047 Average loans $113,925 $121,041 $125,433 $120,081 $119,645 Year end loans outstanding 115,975 113,675 126,998 122,319 121,454 Ratios: Allowance to year end loans4,5 2.58 % 2.76 % 1.86 % 1.05 % 0.86 % Allowance to nonperforming loans4,6 72.9 58.9 61.7 101.9 216.9 Allowance to net charge offs4 1.04 x 0.96 x 1.50 x 3.03 x 4.24 x Net charge offs to average loans 2.51 % 2.67 % 1.25 % 0.35 % 0.21 % Provision to average loans 2.38 3.31 1.97 0.55 0.22 Recoveries to total charge offs 5.4 4.7 6.9 17.8 31.0 1Amount removed from the ALLL related to our election to record $4.1 billion of residential mortgages at fair value. 2Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009, SunTrust began recording the provision for unfunded commitments within the provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss). Given the immateriality of this provision, prior to the fourth quarter of 2009, the provision for unfunded commitments remains classified within other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss). 3Prior to 2009, borrower misrepresentation and denied insurance claim losses were recorded as operating losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss). These credit related operating losses totaled $160 million and $78 million during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Prior to 2007, credit related operating losses were immaterial. During 2009, credit related operating losses charged off against previously established reserves within other liabilities total $195 million. 4This ratio is calculated using the ALLL. 5For this ratio, $492 million, $449 million, $270 million, and $221 million at December 31, 2010, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, of LHFI carried at fair value were excluded from year end loans. 6During the second quarter of 2008, the Company revised its method of calculating this ratio to include, within the period end loan amount, only loans measured at amortized cost. Previously, period end loans included loans measured at fair value or the lower of cost or market. The Company believes this is an improved method of calculation due to the fact that the ALLL relates solely to the loans measured at amortized cost. Loans measured at fair value or LOCOM that have been excluded from the prior period calculation were $172 million, which increased the calculation by approximately 12 basis points as of December 31, 2007. Amounts excluded in years prior to 2007 were immaterial and resulted in no basis point change in the respective calculation. 40 Table of Contents As previously noted, while the reclassification of our loan types had no effect on total loans or total ALLL, SEC regulations require us, in some instances, to present five years of comparable data where trend information may be deemed relevant, in which case we have provided the pre adoption ALLL by loan type classifications due to the inability to restate prior periods under the new classifications.

Charge offs Net charge offs for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $2.9 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively. As a percentage of average annualized loans, net charge offs were 2.51% and 2.67% during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Factors which could affect general asset quality and charge off levels include macro or regional economic volatility, specific borrower performance, and trends within specific sectors, such as construction and commercial real estate. Total charge offs for the year ended December 31, 2010 declined for the majority of our loan portfolios compared to the same period in 2009. However, commercial real estate charge offs increased during the latter half of 2010 as specific loans were resolved. Given continuing stress in this segment, the timing and amount of future commercial real estate charge offs will remain variable. For the first quarter of 2011, a stable to a modest decline in net charge offs from fourth quarter levels is expected. 41 Table of Contents Provision for Credit Losses The total provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan losses as well as the provision for unfunded commitments. The provision for loan losses is the result of a detailed analysis performed to estimate an appropriate and adequate ALLL. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the provision for loan losses decreased by $1.3 billion, or 32%, to $2.7 billion, compared to $4.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in the provision continued a trend of declining loan loss provisions over the last year, reflecting an improvement in overall asset quality and a gradually improving economy. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the provision for unfunded commitments decreased by $144 million to a $57 million benefit, compared to an $87 million provision for the year ended December 31, 2009. The provision decrease for the year is primarily attributable to improved credit quality related to certain commercial and large corporate borrowers and secondarily as a result of a decrease in unfunded commitment exposure. Although net charge offs and provisions have recently declined, and despite indications of an improving economy, we expect net charge offs and the provision for loan losses to remain elevated until we experience a sustained improvement in economic conditions. We believe the amount of future changes in the ALLL remains highly correlated to unemployment levels, changes in home prices within our markets, especially Florida, as well as sustained improvement in our portfolio specific asset quality indicators. See the Allowance for Credit Losses, Charge offs, and Nonperforming Assets sections within this MD&A for additional discussion of our expectations for asset quality. 42 Table of Contents Nonperforming Assets As previously noted, while the reclassification of our loan types had no effect on total NPLs, SEC regulations require us, in some instances, to present five years of comparable data where trend information may be deemed relevant, in which case we have provided the pre adoption NPL classifications due to the inability to restate prior periods under the new classifications.

Insurance proceeds due from the FHA and the VA are recorded as a receivable in other assets until the funds are received and the property is conveyed. 4Includes $979 million of consolidated loans eligible for repurchase from Ginnie Mae and classified as held for sale at December 31, 2009. 5Nonaccruing restructured loans are included in total nonaccrual/NPLs. Nonperforming assets decreased by $1.3 billion, or 22%, during the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease was attributable to a $1.3 billion reduction in NPLs as a result of our problem resolution efforts and the continued trend of lower NPL inflows. Nonperforming commercial loans decreased by $283 million, or 13%, during the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily as a result of a $286 million decrease in commercial construction NPLs and a $148 million decrease in commercial and industrial NPLs, partially offset by a $151 million increase in commercial real estate NPLs. The overall decrease was driven primarily by net charge offs of existing nonperforming commercial loans, partially offset by the migration of delinquent commercial loans to nonaccrual status. We believe that the increase in commercial real estate NPLs is related to a continuation of the current commercial real estate correction, and we expect some variability in the performance as this cycle plays out. Nonperforming residential loans decreased by $991 million, or 31%, during the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily as a result of a $740 million decrease in nonguaranteed residential mortgage NPLs. The decrease was attributable to lower inflows of NPLs, net charge offs, and the sale of certain residential NPLs in the second quarter of 2010. 43 Table of Contents Nonperforming consumer loans decreased by $18 million, or 34%, during the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily as a result of a $20 million decrease in indirect consumer NPLs. The decrease was driven by net charge offs of existing nonperforming consumer loans during the year, partially offset by the migration of delinquent consumer loans to nonaccrual status. OREO decreased by $24 million, or 4%, during the year ended December 31, 2010. The decline consisted of a $7 million decrease in residential construction related properties and a decrease in commercial properties of $20 million, partially offset by a $3 million increase in residential homes. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, sales of OREO resulted in proceeds of $769 million and $544 million, respectively, and net losses on sales of $55 million and net gains on sales of $26 million, respectively, excluding changes in the valuation reserve attributable to lots and land for which current property specific values were not available prior to sale. Sales of OREO and the related gains or losses are highly dependent on our disposition strategy and buyer opportunities. See Note 20, Fair Value Election and Measurement, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Gains and losses on sale of OREO are recorded in other real estate expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss). Geographically, most of our OREO properties are located in Georgia, Florida, and North Carolina. Residential properties and land comprised 52% and 36%, respectively, of OREO; the remainder is related to commercial and other properties. Upon foreclosure, these properties were re evaluated and, if necessary, written down to their then current estimated value, less costs to sell. Further declines in home prices could result in additional losses on these properties. We are actively managing and disposing of these foreclosed assets to minimize future losses. Other repossessed assets decreased by $27 million, or 34%, during the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease is largely attributable to impairment charges and sales of repossessed assets during the year, partially offset by additional repossessions during the year. Accruing loans past due ninety days or more increased by $65 million, or 4%, during the year ended December 31, 2010. Included in the accruing loan population were $884 million and $979 million of residential mortgages at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, which were fully insured by the FHA or the VA. Also included in the population of accruing loans past due ninety days or more were $596 million and $365 million of federally guaranteed student loans at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Interest income on nonaccrual loans, if recognized, is recorded using the cash basis method of accounting. Such interest income recorded was $39 million and $36 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. If all such loans had been accruing interest according to their original contractual terms, estimated interest income of $340 million and $354 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, would have been recorded. Review of Foreclosure Practices We have observed an increase in the amount of time it takes us to foreclose upon residential real estate collateral in certain states, primarily Florida, which we believe is attributable to delays in the foreclosure process. We recently conducted an assessment of our foreclosure process in all states. Our review indicated approximately 4,000 files, or less than 15% of active foreclosure proceedings, contained documents with technical issues in the foreclosure complaint verification, affidavit preparation and notary processes, which we describe in greater detail below. We do not believe that any potential deficiency identified violated applicable law. Below, we explain the issues we identified, what we have done and what we are doing to remediate potential deficiencies identified, and our expectations as to the effect these remedial efforts will have on our financial results. As explained below, we do not expect these concerns to have a material adverse affect upon our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Filing requirements in Florida require a foreclosure complaint to be verified when filed with a court. In this context, verified means that the complaint includes a signed statement to the effect that the signer has read the document and believes the facts alleged in the complaint to be true and correct to the best of the signers knowledge and belief. Similarly, filing requirements in some judicial foreclosure states, including Florida, require an affidavit of indebtedness, or a sworn statement, which includes, among other things, a description of the loan, a statement that the loan is in default, the current principal balance and accrued interest, and an itemization of the amounts owed. In many states, affidavits, as well as certain other documents prepared and submitted in the foreclosure processes, are required to be notarized. Our review identified instances in which the verified complaints may not have been fully reviewed by the signer prior to the filing of the complaint. In those instances, the signer relied upon review work performed by others. Similarly, with a population of affidavits of indebtedness, our review indicated certain circumstances where officers signed affidavits based 44 Table of Contents upon a review performed by a foreclosure processor, rather than based on their review. As to the process of notarizing documents, while signatures were notarized by notaries who worked on the same floor and in the same general area as the signer, and while the notary had personal knowledge and awareness of the person who signed the documents, the process could be improved. We have completed notary training and the process is now more regimented and tightly managed. To address all issues identified, we have elected to replace any documents containing one or more of the issues identified on file with a court in any pending foreclosure action not yet reduced to judgment. All replacement documentation has been and will be prepared in compliance with all applicable rules and required formalities. We estimate this process of resubmitting affidavits will be substantially completed during the first quarter of 2011. Once these affidavits are resubmitted, there may be prolonged adversary proceedings that delay certain foreclosure sales. We are undertaking similar remedial action in non judicial foreclosure states as necessary and appropriate. Given the time required to bring a foreclosure filing to a judicial hearing, which exceeds one year in many jurisdictions, we expect that our remediation efforts will delay only a relatively small number of foreclosure proceedings or sales. Also, we expect the cost of resubmitting legal documents to be modest. However, any delay in the foreclosure process will adversely affect us by increasing our expenses related to carrying such assets, such as taxes, insurance, and other carrying costs, and exposes us to losses as a result of potential additional declines in the value of such collateral. Nevertheless, we believe these additional costs will have an immaterial effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition to our own review, various regulators, including the Federal Reserve, have conducted a review of our mortgage servicing practices, as well as all other large servicers in the U.S. We expect these regulators to ask us and other servicers to consent to an order possibly related to (i) the filing of affidavits without personal knowledge, (ii) the filing of improperly notarized documents, (iii) failing to ensure that the promissory note and all necessary mortgage documents were properly endorsed or assigned and, if necessary, in the possession of the appropriate party at the time foreclosure proceedings were instituted, (iv) failing to devote sufficient financial, staffing, and managerial resources, and (v) failing to develop related processes and operational controls to prevent these problems. We expect that such a consent order will require us to implement substantial additional operational processes and reviews within a certain time frame. We also expect that such regulators may seek civil monetary penalties at a later time. At this time, we do not know the amount of such penalties, the extent of such required actions, or whether other regulators and law enforcement agencies will seek other remedies. Regulators and other law enforcement authorities in certain states and the United States Department of Justice and other federal agencies have stated they are investigating whether mortgage servicers have had irregularities in their foreclosure practices. Those investigations, as well as any other governmental or regulatory scrutiny of our foreclosure processes, could result in fines, penalties or other equitable remedies and result in significant legal costs in responding to governmental investigations and possible litigation. While we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any delay in foreclosure sales, or any issues that may arise as a result of alleged irregularities with respect to previously completed foreclosure activities, we may be subject to additional borrower and non borrower litigation, investor scrutiny as to compliance with contracts, and governmental and regulatory scrutiny related to our past and current foreclosure activities. This scrutiny may extend beyond our pending foreclosure matters to issues arising out of alleged irregularities with respect to previously completed foreclosure activities. We expect that our costs will increase in 2011 as a result of the additional resources necessary to perform the foreclosure process assessment, revise affidavit filings and make any other operational changes. This may result in higher noninterest expense, including higher servicing costs and legal expenses, in our Mortgage line of business. In addition, process changes required as a result of our assessment could increase our default servicing costs over the longer term. Finally, the time to complete foreclosure sales temporarily may increase, and this may result in an increase in nonperforming assets and servicing advances and may impact the collectability of such advances and the value of our mortgage servicing rights asset. Accordingly, delays in foreclosure sales, including any delays beyond those currently anticipated, our process enhancements, and any issues that may arise out of alleged irregularities in our foreclosure processes could increase the costs associated with our mortgage operations. 45 Table of Contents Table 15 Nonperforming Assets (Pre Adoption) As of December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 Nonperforming Assets Nonaccrual/NPLs: Commercial1 $255 $484 $322 $75 $107 Real estate: Construction loans 1,013 1,485 1,277 295 39 Residential mortgages2 1,988 2,716 1,847 841 266 Home equity lines 285 289 272 136 13 Commercial real estate 531 392 177 44 55 Consumer loans 38 37 45 39 24 Total nonaccrual/NPLs 4,110 5,403 3,940 1,430 504 OREO3 596 620 500 184 55 Other repossessed assets 52 79 16 12 7 Total nonperforming assets $4,758 $6,102 $4,456 $1,626 $566 Accruing loans past due 90 days or more4 $1,565 $1,500 $1,032 $611 $352 TDRs: Accruing restructured loans 2,613 1,641 463 30 28 Nonaccruing restructured loans5 1,005 913 268 Ratios: NPLs to total loans 3.54 % 4.75 % 3.10 % 1.17 % 0.41 % Nonperforming assets to total loans plus OREO and other repossessed assets 4.08 5.33 3.49 1.33 0.47 1Includes $4 million, $12 million, and $31 million of loans carried at fair value at December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. 2Includes $24 million, $22 million, and $12 million of loans carried at fair value at December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 respectively. 3Does not include foreclosed real estate related to serviced loans insured by the FHA or the VA. Insurance proceeds due from the FHA and the VA are recorded as a receivable in other assets until the funds are received and the property is conveyed. 4Includes $979 million, $494 million, $236 million, and $162 million of consolidated loans eligible for repurchase from GNMA and classified as held for sale at December 31, 2009, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. 5Nonaccruing restructured loans are included in total nonaccrual/NPLs. Restructured Loans In order to maximize the collection of loan balances, we evaluate troubled loans on a case by case basis to determine if a loan modification would be appropriate. We pursue loan modifications when there is a reasonable chance that an appropriate modification would allow our client to continue servicing the debt. For loans secured by residential real estate, if the client demonstrates a loss of income such that the client cannot reasonably support even a modified loan, we may pursue short sales and or deed in lieu arrangements. For loans secured by income producing commercial properties, we perform a rigorous and ongoing review that is programmatic in nature. We review a number of factors, including cash flows, loan structures, collateral values, and guarantees, to identify loans within our income producing commercial loan portfolio that are most likely to experience distress. Based on our review of these factors and our assessment of overall risk, we evaluate the benefits of proactively initiating discussions with our clients to improve a loans risk profile. In some cases, we may renegotiate terms of their loans so that they have a higher likelihood of continuing to perform. To date, we have restructured loans in a variety of ways to help our clients service their debt and to mitigate the potential for additional losses. The primary restructuring methods being offered to our residential clients are reductions in interest rates and extensions in terms. For commercial loans, the primary restructuring method is the extensions of terms. Accruing loans with modifications deemed to be economic concessions resulting from borrower difficulties are reported as TDRs. Nonaccruing loans that are modified and demonstrate a history of repayment performance in accordance with their modified terms are reclassified to accruing restructured status, typically after six months of repayment performance. See Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 6, Loans, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our accounting policy for TDRs. Accruing restructured loans increased by $972 million, or 59%, during the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in accruing restructured loans was attributed to a general increase in the number of loan modifications, as well as an increase in the number of previously nonaccruing restructured loans meeting sustained repayment performance criteria and therefore 46 Table of Contents transferring to accrual status. Nonaccruing restructured loans increased by $92 million, or 10%, during the year ended December 31, 2010, reflecting the overall increase in loan modifications despite such loans not yet meeting the repayment performance criteria. Interest income on restructured loans that have met sustained performance criteria and have been returned to accruing status is recognized according to the terms of the restructuring. Such interest income recorded was $96 million and $52 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. If all such loans had been accruing interest according to their original contractual terms, estimated interest income of $140 million and $75 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, would have been recorded. Our total TDR portfolio is composed of $3.2 billion in residential loans, which are predominately first and second lien residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit, $437 million in commercial loans, which are predominately income producing properties, and $11 million in direct consumer loans. At December 31, 2010, 70% of our total TDR portfolio was current with respect to principal and interest. The following table displays our residential real estate TDR portfolio by modification type and payment status at December 31, 2010. Table 16 Selected Residential TDR Data Accruing TDRs Nonaccruing TDRs (Dollars in millions) Current Delinquent1 Total Current Delinquent1 Total Rate reduction $375 $48 $423 $26 $68 $94 Rate reduction and term extension 1,722 305 2,027 66 465 531 Other2 42 15 57 3 31 34 Total $2,139 $368 $2,507 $95 $564 $659 1TDRs considered delinquent for purposes of this table were those at least thirty days past due. 2Primarily consists of extensions and deficiency notes. We note that some restructurings may not ultimately result in the complete collection of principal and interest (as modified by the terms of the restructuring), culminating in default, which could result in additional incremental losses. These potential incremental losses have been factored into our overall ALLL estimate. The level of re defaults will likely be affected by future economic conditions. Generally, once a residential loan becomes a TDR, it is probable that the loan will likely continue to be reported as TDR until it is ultimately repaid in full, or foreclosed and sold. At December 31, 2010, specific reserves included in the ALLL for residential TDRs were $428 million. In addition, we have recorded approximately $240 million in charge offs on residential TDRs and recorded $14 million in mark to market losses on residential TDRs carried at fair value, life to date. SELECTED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE Certain financial instruments such as trading securities, derivatives, and securities AFS are required to be carried at fair value. Companies are also permitted to elect to carry specific financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. Reasons that a company may choose to elect fair value include: (i) to more accurately align its financial performance with the economic value of actively traded or hedged assets or liabilities, (ii) to mitigate the non economic earnings volatility caused from financial assets and financial liabilities being carried at different bases of accounting and or (iii) to more accurately portray the active and dynamic management of a companys balance sheet. Based on our balance sheet management strategies and objectives, we have elected to carry certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value; these instruments include all, or a portion, of the following: long term debt, LHFS, brokered deposits, MSRs, trading assets, and a small portion of LHFI. The following is a discussion of the more significant financial assets and financial liabilities that are currently carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009. For a complete discussion of our fair value elections and the methodologies used to estimate the fair values of our financial instruments, refer to Note 20, Fair Value Election and Measurement, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 47 Table of Contents Table 17 Trading Assets and Liabilities As of December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Trading Assets U.S. Treasury securities $187 $499 $143 Federal agency securities 361 474 803 U.S. states and political subdivisions 123 59 2,166 RMBS agency 301 94 59 MBS private 15 6 16 CDO securities 55 175 278 ABS 59 51 172 Corporate and other debt securities 743 466 590 CP 14 1 400 Equity securities 221 256 193 Derivative contracts 2,743 2,610 4,699 Trading loans 1,353 289 877 Total trading assets $6,175 $4,980 $10,396 Trading Liabilities U.S. Treasury securities $439 $190 $395 Federal agency securities 3 46 Corporate and other debt securities 398 144 147 Equity securities 8 13 Derivative contracts 1,841 1,844 2,640 Total trading liabilities $2,678 $2,189 $3,241 Trading Assets and Liabilities Trading assets increased $1.2 billion, or 24%, since December 31, 2009. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in trading loans and corporate debt securities. Trading loans increased during the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily as a result of the resumption of our TRS business. There were no TRS related trading loans outstanding as of December 31, 2009, but as of December 31, 2010, the business had $972 million in outstanding trading loans. The increase in corporate debt securities was due to market movements and normal client business activity. Certain securities were purchased during the fourth quarter of 2007 from affiliates which included SIVs that are collateralized by various domestic and foreign assets, residential MBS, including Alt A and subprime collateral, CDOs, and commercial loans, as well as senior interests retained from Company sponsored securitizations. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized approximately $37 million in net market valuation gains related to these securities. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we received approximately $136 million in cash from paydowns, maturities, calls and restructurings related to these securities, reducing our exposure to these distressed assets to approximately $60 million as of December 31, 2010. In January 2011, we were able to sell all but an insignificant piece of the remaining exposure to these acquired assets. The Company also purchased ARS primarily in the fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009. We discuss FINRAs ARS investigation in Note 21, Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The amount of ARS recorded in trading assets at fair value totaled $147 million as of December 31, 2010 compared to $176 million as of December 31, 2009. The majority of these ARS are preferred equity securities, and the remaining securities are backed by trust preferred bank debt or student loans. Trading liabilities increased $489 million, or 22%, since December 31, 2009 due primarily to an increase in U.S. Treasury and corporate and other debt securities that act as a hedge for some of the trading assets we own. 48 Table of Contents Table 18 Securities Available for Sale As of December 31, 2010 (Dollars in millions) AmortizedCost UnrealizedGains UnrealizedLosses FairValue U.S. Treasury securities $5,446 $115 $45 $5,516 Federal agency securities 1,883 19 7 1,895 U.S. states and political subdivisions 565 17 3 579 RMBS agency 14,014 372 28 14,358 RMBS private 378 3 34 347 CDO securities 50 50 ABS 798 15 5 808 Corporate and other debt securities 464 19 1 482 Coke common stock 1,973 1,973 Other equity securities1 886 1 887 Total securities AFS $24,484 $2,534 $123 $26,895 1At December 31, 2010, other equity securities included $298 million in FHLB of Atlanta stock (par value), $391 million in Federal Reserve Bank stock (par value), and $197 million in mutual fund investments (par value).

The size of the securities portfolio, at fair value, was $26.9 billion as of December 31, 2010, a decrease of $1.6 billion, or 6%, versus December 31, 2009. Changes in the size and composition of the portfolio during the year reflect our efforts to maintain a high quality portfolio and manage our interest rate risk profile. These changes included increasing the size and extending the duration of the U.S. Treasury position, decreasing the agency MBS positions, reducing federal agency securities, reducing the municipal position by selling lower rated securities, and purchasing high quality ABS backed by newly originated consumer automobile loans. For additional information on composition and valuation assumptions related to securities AFS, see the Trading Assets and Securities Available for Sale section of Note 20, Fair Value Election and Measurement, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2010, the carrying value of securities AFS reflected $2.4 billion in net unrealized gains, which were comprised of a $2.0 billion unrealized gain from our remaining 30 million shares of Coke common stock and a $438 million net unrealized gain on the remainder of the portfolio. At December 31, 2009, the carrying value of securities AFS reflected $1.8 billion in net unrealized gains, which were comprised of a $1.7 billion unrealized gain from our remaining 30 million shares of Coke common stock and a $122 million net unrealized gain on the remainder of the portfolio. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we recorded $193 million and $118 million in net realized gains from the sale of securities AFS as a result of the aforementioned repositioning activities. 50 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2010, the average yield on a FTE basis for the securities AFS portfolio declined to 3.21% compared to 4.23% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The yield decline was largely due to security maturities, prepayments, and sales, with the proceeds generally reinvested at current lower yields. Additionally, the portfolios yield was impacted by the purchase of lower yielding U.S. Treasury securities in late 2009. The portfolios effective duration increased to 3.3% as of December 31, 2010 from 3.0% as of December 31, 2009. Effective duration is a measure of price sensitivity of a bond portfolio to an immediate change in market interest rates, taking into consideration embedded options. An effective duration of 3.3% suggests an expected price change of 3.3% for a one percent instantaneous change in market interest rates. The credit quality of the securities portfolio remained strong at December 31, 2010. Excluding the $2.9 billion of fair value represented by equity securities, $23.0 billion, or 96%, of the remaining $24.0 billion in securities AFS carried an actual or implied AAA rating, the highest possible, as designated by at least one NRSRO. The amount of ARS recorded in the securities AFS portfolio totaled $128 million as of December 31, 2010 and $156 million as of December 31, 2009. Included in ARS are tax exempt municipal securities as well as student loan ABS. Due to the high quality and highly liquid nature of the portfolio, we have the flexibility to respond to changes in the economic environment and take actions as opportunities arise to manage our interest rate risk profile and balance liquidity against investment returns. Going forward, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to reduce our risk to a further steepening of the yield curve. Over the longer term, we continue to expect that a growing economy will result in loan balances trending up and deposits trending down. Accordingly, we may eventually decrease the size of our securities portfolio in response to loan growth and or declining deposits. INVESTMENT IN COMMON SHARES OF THE COCA COLA COMPANY Background We have owned common shares of Coke since 1919, when one of our predecessor institutions participated in the underwriting of Cokes IPO and received common shares of Coke in lieu of underwriting fees. These shares have grown in value over the past 91 years and have been classified as securities AFS, with unrealized gains, net of tax, recorded as a component of shareholders equity. Because of the low accounting cost basis of these shares, we have accumulated significant unrealized gains in shareholders equity. As of December 31, 2010, we owned 30 million Coke shares with an accounting cost basis of $69,295 and a fair market value of $2.0 billion. We commenced a comprehensive balance sheet review initiative in early 2007 in an effort to improve liquidity and capital efficiency. As part of this initiative, we began to formally evaluate the capital efficiency of our holdings of Coke common shares, as we were prohibited from including the market value of our investment in Coke common shares in Tier 1 capital in accordance with Federal Reserve capital adequacy rules. As a result of this initiative, at various times during 2007 and 2008 we sold and made a charitable contribution of all but 30 million shares of our Coke stock. Additionally, during the second half of 2008, we executed The Agreements on the remaining 30 million shares that we owned. Our primary objective in executing these transactions was to optimize the benefits we obtained from our long term holding of this asset, including the capital treatment by bank regulators. We entered into The Agreements, which were comprised of two variable forward agreements and share forward agreements effective July 15, 2008 with a major, unaffiliated financial institution (the Counterparty) collectively covering our 30 million Coke shares. Under The Agreements, we must deliver to the Counterparty at settlement of the variable forward agreements either a variable number of Coke common shares or a cash payment in lieu of such shares. The Counterparty is obligated to settle The Agreements for no less than approximately $38.67 per share, or approximately $1.16 billion in the aggregate (the Minimum Proceeds). The share forward agreements give us the right, but not the obligation, to sell to the Counterparty, at prevailing market prices at the time of settlement, any of the 30 million Coke common shares that are not delivered to the Counterparty in settlement of the variable forward agreements. The Agreements effectively ensure that we will be able to sell our 30 million Coke common shares at a price no less than approximately $38.67 per share, while permitting us to participate in future appreciation in the value of the Coke common shares up to approximately $66.02 per share and approximately $65.72 per share, under each of the respective Agreements. 51 Table of Contents During the terms of The Agreements, and until we sell the 30 million Coke common shares, we generally will continue to receive dividends as declared and paid by Coke and will have the right to vote such shares. However, the amounts payable to us under The Agreements will be adjusted if actual dividends are not equal to amounts expected at the inception of the derivative. Contemporaneously with entering into The Agreements, the Counterparty invested in senior unsecured promissory notes issued by the Bank and SunTrust (collectively, the Notes) in a private placement in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Minimum Proceeds. The Notes carry stated maturities of approximately ten years from the effective date and bear interest at one month LIBOR plus a fixed spread. The Counterparty pledged the Notes to us and we pledged the 30 million Coke common shares to the Counterparty, securing each entitys respective obligations under The Agreements. The pledged Coke common shares are held by an independent third party custodian and the Counterparty is prohibited under The Agreements from selling, pledging, assigning or otherwise using the pledged Coke common shares in its business. We generally may not prepay the Notes. The interest rate on the Notes will be reset upon or after the settlement of The Agreements, either through a remarketing process, or based upon dealer quotations. In the event of an unsuccessful remarketing of the Notes, we would be required to collateralize the Notes and the maturity of the Notes may accelerate to the first anniversary of the settlement of The Agreements. However, we presently believe that it is substantially certain that the Notes will be successfully remarketed. The Agreements carry scheduled settlement terms of approximately seven years from the effective date. However, we have the option to terminate The Agreements earlier with the approval of the Federal Reserve. The Agreements may also terminate earlier upon certain events of default, extraordinary events regarding Coke and other typical termination events. Upon such early termination, there could be exit costs or gains, such as certain breakage fees including an interest rate make whole amount, associated with both The Agreements and the Notes. Such costs or gains may be material but cannot be determined at the present time due to the unlikely occurrence of such events and the number of variables that are unknown. However, the payment of such costs, if any, will not result in us receiving less than the Minimum Proceeds from The Agreements. We expect to sell all of the Coke common shares upon settlement of The Agreements, either under the terms of The Agreements or in another market transaction. See Note 17, Derivative Financial Instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of the transactions. The Federal Reserve determined that we may include in Tier 1 capital, as of the effective date of The Agreements, an amount equal to the Minimum Proceeds minus the deferred tax liability associated with the ultimate sale of the 30 million Coke common shares. Accordingly, The Agreements resulted in an increase in Tier 1 capital during the third quarter of 2008 of approximately $728 million.

These favorable trends were major drivers of the growth in net interest margin that we were able to achieve during the year. Average consumer and commercial deposits increased during 2010 by $4.0 billion, or 3.5%, compared to 2009. The growth was concentrated in noninterest bearing DDA, NOW, money market, and savings 52 Table of Contents accounts which increased $10.3 billion, or 12%. The increase was partially offset by declines in consumer time and other time deposit account balances which decreased by $6.3 billion, or 21%. These positive trends resulted from our continued marketing efforts, pricing discipline in the context of a low and declining rate environment, improving operational execution, as well as an industry wide preference for greater liquidity. Consumer and commercial deposit growth remains one of our key initiatives. During 2010, we focused on growing our client base, number of households, and deposit share while managing the rates we pay on our deposits. Overall growth was accomplished through a judicious use of competitive rates in select products and select geographies. We experienced mixed results across our 16 regions due to competitive forces, unusual deposit flows resulting from the FDICs TAGP, and concentrations of time deposit clients. Other initiatives to attract deposits included innovative product and features offerings, enhanced programs and initiatives, customer targeted offers, and advanced analytics that leverage product offerings with customer segmentation. We continued to leverage the Live Solid. Bank Solid. brand to improve our visibility in the marketplace. It is designed to speak to what is important to clients in the current environment and to inspire customer loyalty and capitalize on some of the opportunities presented by the new banking landscape. We continue to manage judiciously through the implications of impending or executed regulatory change and evaluate the impacts to our deposit products and clients. Average brokered and foreign deposits decreased by $3.2 billion, or 52%, during 2010 compared to 2009. This decrease was due to our ability to grow deposits and, in turn, reduce our reliance upon wholesale funding sources. As of December 31, 2010 securities pledged as collateral for deposits totaled $3.9 billion.

The increase was primarily attributable to an incremental $309 million of securities sold under agreement to repurchase and $300 million of dealer collateral held by the Company as of December 31, 2010. Additionally, the $99 million of CP issued during 2010 contributed to the rise in short term borrowings. These increases were slightly offset by a decrease of $482 million in Fed funds purchased overnight to $951 million as of December 31, 2010.

The decline in long term debt was primarily the result of the repayment of $2.7 billion of FHLB advances, $500 million of which was issued during 2010 and $1.1 billion matured during 2010. We terminated $103 million of senior fixed rate debt and $929 million of senior floating rate debt, of which $750 million matured during 2010. Slightly offsetting the termination of the aforementioned senior debt was the increase in senior variable rate debt of $474 million and $290 million related to consolidation of the Student Loan entity and the CLO entity, respectively. The CLO debt is carried at fair value. See Note 11, Certain Transfers of Financial Assets, Mortgage Servicing Rights and Variable Interest Entities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the consolidation. Additionally, we performed a cash tender offer to purchase $750 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding subordinated debt securities carried at fair value that were to mature between 2015 and 2020. Following the tender offer, we repurchased an additional $99 million of these subordinated debt securities in the secondary market. We also repurchased $34 million of Parent Company senior fixed rate debt and $6 million of Parent Company Junior Subordinated variable rate debt. During 2010, $300 million of Parent Company subordinated fixed rate debt recorded at fair value matured. Repayment was assisted by the continued growth during the year of our core deposit portfolio. 54 Table of Contents CAPITAL RESOURCES Table 24 Capital Ratios As of December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Tier 1 capital $18,156 $18,069 $17,614 Total capital 21,967 22,895 22,743 Risk weighted assets 132,819 139,380 162,046 Tier 1 capital $18,156 $18,069 $17,614 Less: Qualifying trust preferred securities 2,350 2,356 2,847 Preferred stock 4,942 4,917 5,222 Allowable minority interest 127 104 102 Tier 1 common equity $10,737 $10,692 $9,443 Risk based ratios: Tier 1 common equity 8.08 % 7.67 % 5.83 % Tier 1 capital 13.67 12.96 10.87 Total capital 16.54 16.43 14.04 Tier 1 leverage ratio 10.94 10.90 10.45 Total shareholders equity to assets 13.38 12.94 11.90 Our primary regulator, the Federal Reserve, measures capital adequacy within a framework that makes capital requirements sensitive to the risk profiles of individual banking companies. The guidelines weigh assets and off balance sheet risk exposures (risk weighted assets) according to predefined classifications, creating a base from which to compare capital levels. Tier 1 capital primarily includes realized equity and qualified preferred instruments, less purchase accounting intangibles such as goodwill and core deposit intangibles. Total capital consists of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, which includes qualifying portions of subordinated debt, ALLL up to a maximum of 1.25% of risk weighted assets, and 45% of the unrealized gain on equity securities. Both the Company and the Bank are subject to a minimum Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios of 4% and 8%, respectively, of risk weighted assets. To be considered well capitalized, ratios of 6% and 10%, respectively, are required. Additionally, the Company and the Bank are subject to Tier 1 leverage ratio requirements, which measures Tier 1 capital against average assets for leverage purposes, which is a regulatory exposure measure with adjustments similar to those used to calculate Tier 1 capital. The minimum and well capitalized ratios are 3% and 5%, respectively. In September 2010, the BCBS announced new regulatory capital requirements (commonly referred to as Basel III) aimed at substantially strengthening existing capital requirements, through a combination of higher minimum capital requirements, new capital conservation buffers and more stringent definitions of capital and exposure. Basel III would impose a new common equity requirement of 7%, comprised of a minimum of 4.5% plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%. The transition period for banks to meet the revised common equity requirement will begin in 2013, with full implementation in 2019. Our current proforma Tier 1 common ratio is in excess of 8%, which is above the 2019 Basel III 7% requirement. The BCBS has also stated that from time to time it may require an additional, counter cyclical capital buffer on top of Basel III standards. We intend to comply with those requirements when announced as they may apply to us. The new rule also proposes the deduction of certain assets in measuring Tier 1 capital. It is anticipated that U.S. regulators will adopt new regulatory capital requirements similar to those proposed by the BCBS and the new requirements are anticipated to be phased in over the period from 2013 to 2015. We will continue to monitor the Federal Reserves implementation of the Basel III standards. The composition of our capital elements is likely to be impacted by the Dodd Frank Act in at least two ways over the next several years. First, the Dodd Frank Act authorizes the Federal Reserve to enact prudential capital requirements which may require greater capital levels than presently required and which may vary among financial institutions based on size, risk, complexity, and other factors. We expect the Federal Reserve to use this authority to implement the Basel III capital requirements, although this authority is not limited to the Basel III requirements. See additional discussion of newly proposed Basel III capital rules in the Executive Overview section of this MD&A. Second, a portion of the Dodd Frank Act (sometimes referred to as the Collins Amendment) directs the Federal Reserve to adopt new capital requirements for certain bank holding companies (including SunTrust Banks, Inc.) which are at least as stringent as those applicable to insured 55 Table of Contents depositary institutions, such as SunTrust Bank. We expect that the Federal Reserve will apply these to us over a 3 year period beginning January 1, 2013 and that, as a result, approximately $2.3 billion in principal amount of Parent Company trust preferred and other hybrid capital securities that will be outstanding at such future time, will no longer qualify for Tier 1 capital treatment at that time. We will consider changes to our capital structure as these new regulations are published and become applicable to us. In connection with the SCAP in 2009, our regulators began focusing on Tier 1 common equity which is the portion of Tier 1 capital that is common equity. Tier 1 common equity and the Tier 1 common equity ratio are not determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are not defined in federal banking regulations. As a result, our calculation of these measures may be different than those of other financial service companies who calculate them. However, Tier 1 common equity and the Tier 1 common equity ratio continue to be factors which regulators examine in evaluating financial institutions; therefore, we present these measures to allow for evaluations of our capital. Our capital levels increased with Tier 1 common equity, Tier 1 capital, and Total capital ratios at 8.08%, 13.67%, and 16.54%, respectively, at December 31, 2010 compared to 7.67%, 12.96%, and 16.43%, respectively, at December 31, 2009. The increase in Tier 1 common equity and Tier 1 capital ratios was due to stable Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common equity and the decline in risk weighted assets. Our Total capital ratio was stable as a result of lower risk weighted assets, offset by the tender for subordinated debt that we completed in the third quarter. See additional discussion related to the repurchase of debt securities in the Liquidity Risk section of this MD&A. Our capital position remains strong relative to current regulatory requirements. Our Tier 1 common ratio also exceeds the guidelines recently published by the BCBS and anticipated to be endorsed by the U.S. regulatory agencies. We declared and paid common dividends totaling $20 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, or $0.04 per common share, compared to $83 million, or $0.22 per common share, during 2009. In addition, we declared dividends payable during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 of $7 million and $14 million, respectively, on our Series A preferred stock. Further, during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we declared dividends payable of $242 million and $243 million, respectively, to the U.S. Treasury on the Series C and D Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury under the TARPs CPP. Given our capital position and our current liquidity, we believe are well positioned to repay TARP when regulatory approval is received. However, the Federal Reserve has required similarly situated financial institutions to raise additional common equity as a prerequisite to repaying TARP, and there can be no assurance that we will not also be required to do so. During 2009, we reduced the common share dividend to $0.01 per share, per quarter where it remained as of the most recent common share dividend declaration in February 2011. It is not likely that we will increase our dividend until we have obtained the consent of our applicable regulators as further described below. The Federal Reserve is currently conducting a comprehensive review process (the Comprehensive Capital Plan Review) to evaluate the repayment of TARP by bank holding companies, as well as other capital related items such as common dividends and share repurchases, which will be completed by late March. Once the review process is completed, we will be in a better position to reevaluate our repayment options and the appropriate timing. We expect that our current Tier 1 common ratio of 8.1%, proforma Basel III Tier 1 common ratio of 8.4%, and our reduced risk profile will serve us well in this process. In connection with the issuances of the Series A Preferred Stock of SunTrust Banks, Inc., the Fixed to Floating Rate Normal Preferred Purchase Securities of SunTrust Preferred Capital I, the 6.10% Trust Preferred Securities of SunTrust Capital VIII, and the 7.875% Trust Preferred securities of SunTrust Capital IX (collectively, the Issued Securities), we entered into RCCs. The RCCs limit our ability to repay, redeem or repurchase the Issued Securities (or certain related securities). We executed each of the RCCs in favor of the holders of certain debt securities, who are initially the holders of our 6% Subordinated Notes due 2026. The RCCs are more fully described in Current Reports on Form 8 K filed on September 12, 2006, November 6, 2006, December 6, 2006, and March 4, 2008. In connection with the issuance of the Series C and D Preferred Stock of SunTrust, we agreed to certain terms affecting repurchase, redemption, and repayment of the preferred stock and restriction on payment of common stock dividends, among other terms. Included with the issuance of the Series C and D preferred stock was issuance of ten year warrants to the U.S. Treasury to purchase approximately 12 million and 6 million shares of our common stock at initial exercise prices of $44.15 and $33.70. The preferred stock and related warrants were issued at a total discount of approximately $132 million, which 56 Table of Contents will be accreted into U.S. Treasury preferred dividend expense using the effective yield method over a five year period from each respective issuance date. The terms of the warrants as well as the restrictions related to the issuance of the preferred stock is more fully described in Current Reports on Form 8 K filed on November 17, 2008 and January 2, 2009. We are subject to certain restrictions on our ability to increase the dividend as a result of participating in the U.S. Treasurys CPP. Generally, we may not pay a regular quarterly cash dividend of more than $0.77 per share of common stock prior to November 14, 2011, unless either (i) we have redeemed the Series C and Series D Preferred Stock, (ii) the U.S. Treasury has transferred the Series C and Series D Preferred Stock to a third party, or (iii) the U.S. Treasury consents to the payment of such dividends in excess of such amount. Additionally, if we increase our quarterly dividend above $0.54 per share prior to the tenth anniversary of our participation in the CPP, then the exercise price and the number of shares to be issued upon exercise of the warrants issued in connection with our participation in the CPP will be proportionately adjusted. The amount of such adjustment will be determined by a formula and depends in part on the extent to which we raise our dividend. The formulas are contained in the warrant agreements. There also exists limits on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Parent Company. Substantially all of our retained earnings are undistributed earnings of the Bank, which are restricted by various regulations administered by federal and state bank regulatory authorities. There was no capacity for payment of cash dividends to the Parent Company under these regulations at December 31, 2010.

SunTrust considers shares so surrendered by participants in SunTrusts employee stock option plans to be repurchased pursuant to the authority and terms of the applicable stock option plan rather than pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, zero shares of SunTrust common stock were surrendered by participants in SunTrusts employee stock option plans. 3On August 14, 2007, the Board authorized the Company to repurchase up to 30 million shares of common stock and specified that such authorization replaced (terminated) existing unused authorizations. This authority was terminated on January 5, 2011. 4The Company may repurchase up to $250 million face amount of various tranches of its hybrid capital securities, including its Series A Preferred Stock. The amount disclosed reflects the maximum number of Series A Preferred Shares which the Company may repurchase at par under this authority assuming it is used solely to repurchase Series A Preferred Stock, although only 6,900,426 shares of Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding as of December 31, 2010. This authority was terminated on January 5, 2011. ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT In the normal course of business, we are exposed to various risks. We have established an enterprise risk governance framework to manage these risks and to provide reasonable assurance that key business objectives will be achieved. Underlying this framework are limits, policies, processes and procedures designed to effectively identify, monitor and manage risk. The Board is wholly responsible for oversight of our corporate risk governance framework. The Risk Committee of the Board assists the Board in executing this responsibility. Administration of the framework and governance process is the responsibility of the CRO, who executes this responsibility through the CRM organization. The CRO reports to the Chief Executive Officer, and provides overall vision, direction and leadership regarding our enterprise risk management framework. In addition, the CRO provides regular risk assessments to Executive Management, the Risk Committee of the Board, Audit Committee of the Board and the full Board, and provides other information to Executive Management and the Board, as requested. 57 Table of Contents The enterprise risk governance framework incorporates a variety of senior management risk related committees. These committees are responsible for ensuring effective risk measurement and management in their respective areas of authority. These committees include: CRC, ALCO, and the EAPMC. The CRC is chaired by the CRO and supports the CRO in measuring and managing our aggregate risk profile. The CRC consists of various senior executives and meets on a monthly basis. The CRO is an active member of the other oversight committees. The CRO and, by extension CRM, establishes sound corporate risk processes that focus on identifying, measuring, monitoring, reporting and managing the risks which face the Company. At its core, CRMs objective is to: Deliver sophisticated risk management capabilities throughout SunTrust that: Identify, measure, analyze, manage and report risk at the transaction, portfolio and corporate levels; Optimize decision making; Promote sound processes and regulatory compliance; Maximize shareholder value; and Help people and institutions prosper. To achieve this objective, we continually refine our risk governance and management limits, policies, processes and procedures to reflect changes in external conditions and or corporate goals and strategies. Similarly, risk management systems, processes and applications are routinely enhanced to support our risk and business objectives. Risk information is available at both an enterprise and a detailed level. Senior management and Board reports provide a holistic picture of the organizations risk profile and trends, whereas detailed information provides insight at a more granular level to line managers. We actively work to balance our strategic goals, including revenue and profitability objectives, with the risks associated with achieving these goals. Effective risk management is an important element supporting our business decision making. Organizationally, CRM measures and manages risk along four dimensions: credit risk, market risk (including liquidity risk), operational risk and compliance/legal risk; reputational risk, which can be influenced by any of the other risk disciplines, is also evaluated. Credit risk programs are overseen by the Chief Wholesale Credit Officer and the Chief Retail Credit Officer; market risk programs are overseen by the Corporate Market Risk Officer; operational risk programs are overseen by the CORO; and Compliance/Legal Risk programs are overseen by the Corporate Compliance and Regulatory Liaison Officer. Other activities overseen by CRM include risk information and reporting; risk analytics, including stress testing and the ALLL; and other assurance and risk administration functions. Credit Risk Management Credit risk refers to the potential for economic loss arising from the failure of clients to meet their contractual agreements on all credit instruments, including on balance sheet exposures from loans and leases, investment securities, contingent exposures from unfunded commitments, letters of credit, credit derivatives, and counterparty risk under derivative products. As credit risk is an essential component of many of the products and services we provide to our clients, the ability to accurately measure and manage credit risk is integral to maintain both the long run profitability of our lines of business and our capital adequacy. The Credit Risk Management group manages and monitors extensions of credit risk through initial underwriting processes and periodic reviews which then maintain underwriting standards in accordance with credit policies and procedures. The Corporate Risk Review unit conducts independent risk reviews to ensure active compliance with all policies and procedures. Credit Risk Management periodically reviews our lines of business to monitor asset quality trends and the appropriateness of credit policies. In addition, total borrower exposure limits are established and concentration risk is monitored. Credit risk is partially mitigated through purchase of credit loss protection via third party insurance and use of credit derivatives such as CDS. Borrower/counterparty (obligor) risk and facility risk are evaluated using our risk rating methodology, which has been implemented in all lines of business. We use various risk models in the estimation of expected and unexpected losses. These models incorporate both internal and external default and loss experience. To the extent possible, we collect internal data to ensure the validity, reliability, and accuracy of our risk models used in default and loss estimation. 58 Table of Contents We have made a commitment to maintain and enhance comprehensive credit systems in order to meet business requirements and comply with evolving regulatory standards. As part of a continuous improvement process, Credit Risk Management evaluates potential enhancements to our risk measurement and management tools, implementing them as appropriate along with amended credit policies and procedures. Operational Risk Management We face ongoing and emerging risks and regulations related to the activities that surround the delivery of banking and financial products. Coupled with external influences such as market conditions, fraudulent activities, disasters, security risks, country risk, and legal risk, the potential for operational and reputational loss has increased significantly. We believe that effective management of operational risk defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events plays a major role in both the level and the stability of the profitability of the institution. Our Operational Risk Management function oversees an enterprise wide framework intended to identify, assess, control, quantify, monitor, and report on operational risks Company wide. These efforts support our goals in seeking to minimize operational losses and strengthen our performance by optimizing operational capital allocation. Operational Risk Management is overseen by our CORO, who reports directly to the CRO. The operational risk governance structure also includes a risk manager and support staff embedded within each line of business and corporate function. These risk managers also report indirectly to the CORO and are responsible for execution of the Operational Risk Management program within their areas. Market Risk Management Market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, and other relevant market rates or prices. Interest rate risk, defined as the exposure of net interest income and MVE to adverse movements in interest rates, is our primary market risk, and mainly arises from the structure of the balance sheet. We are also exposed to market risk in our trading activities, investment portfolio, Coke common stock, MSRs, loan warehouse and pipeline, and debt and brokered deposits carried at fair value. The ALCO meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing our open positions and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk. The policies established by ALCO are reviewed and approved by our Board. Market Risk from Non Trading Activities The primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk, both within policy limits approved by the Board and within narrower guidelines established by ALCO. These limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both short term and long term horizons. The major sources of our non trading interest rate risk are timing differences in the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities, changes in the shape of the yield curve, and the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options. We measure these risks and their impact by identifying and quantifying exposures through the use of sophisticated simulation and valuation models. One of the primary methods that we use to quantify and manage interest rate risk is simulation analysis, which is used to model net interest income from assets, liabilities, and derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios and balance sheet structures. This analysis measures the sensitivity of net interest income over a two year time horizon. Key assumptions in the simulation analysis (and in the valuation analysis discussed below) relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads, the changes in product balances and the behavior of loan and deposit clients in different rate environments. This analysis incorporates several assumptions, the most material of which relate to the repricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate or non contractual maturities. As the future path of interest rates cannot be known in advance, we use simulation analysis to project net interest income under various interest rate scenarios including implied forward and deliberately extreme and perhaps unlikely scenarios. The analyses may include rapid and gradual ramping of interest rates, rate shocks, basis risk analysis, and yield curve twists. Each 59 Table of Contents analysis incorporates what management believes to be the most appropriate assumptions about client behavior in an interest rate scenario. Specific strategies are also analyzed to determine their impact on net interest income levels and sensitivities. The sensitivity analysis included below is measured as a percentage change in net interest income due to an instantaneous 100 basis point move in benchmark interest rates. Estimated changes set forth below are dependent upon material assumptions such as those previously discussed. The net interest income profile reflects a relatively neutral interest rate sensitive position with respect to an instantaneous 100 basis point change in rates. Economic Perspective Rate Change (Basis Points) Estimated % Change inNet Interest Income Over 12 Months December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 +100 0.2% 0.0% 100 (0.9%) 0.1% The recognition of interest rate sensitivity from an economic perspective (above) is different from a financial reporting perspective (below) due to certain interest rate swaps that are used as economic hedges for fixed rate debt. The above profile includes the recognition of the net interest payments from these swaps, while the profile below does not include the net interest payments. The swaps are accounted for as trading assets and therefore, the benefit to income due to a decline in short term interest rates will be recognized as a gain in the fair value of the swaps and will be recorded as an increase in trading account profits/(losses) and commissions from a financial reporting perspective. Financial Reporting Perspective Rate Change (Basis Points) Estimated % Change inNet Interest Income Over 12 Months December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 +100 0.5% 0.5% 100 (1.0%) (0.3%) The difference from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010 seen above in both the economic and financial reporting perspectives related to a 100 basis point shock is primarily due to interest rates being at or near terminally low levels as well as reaching floors of essentially zero percent in downward rate shocks. We also perform valuation analysis, which is used for discerning levels of risk present in the balance sheet and derivative positions that might not be taken into account in the net interest income simulation analysis above. Whereas net interest income simulation highlights exposures over a relatively short time horizon, valuation analysis incorporates all cash flows over the estimated remaining life of all balance sheet and derivative positions. The valuation of the balance sheet, at a point in time, is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows and derivative cash flows minus the discounted present value of liability cash flows, the net of which is referred to as MVE. The sensitivity of MVE to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of the longer term repricing risk and options risk embedded in the balance sheet. Similar to the net interest income simulation, MVE uses instantaneous changes in rates. MVE values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the growth assumptions that are used in the net interest income simulation model. As with the net interest income simulation model, assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are critical in the MVE analysis. Particularly important are the assumptions driving prepayments and the expected changes in balances and pricing of the indeterminate deposit portfolios. As of December 31, 2010, the MVE profile indicates modest changes with respect to an instantaneous 100 basis point change in rates. Rate Shock (Basis Points) Estimated % Change in MVE December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 +100 (3.4%) (4.2%) 100 1.1% 2.3% 60 Table of Contents While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under an extremely adverse scenario, we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact. Since MVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in MVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current fiscal year). Further, MVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. The net interest income simulation and valuation analyses do not include actions that management may undertake to manage this risk in response to anticipated changes in interest rates. Trading Activities Trading instruments are used as part of our overall balance sheet management strategies and to support client requirements through our broker/dealer subsidiary. Product offerings to clients include debt securities, loans traded in the secondary market, equity securities, derivatives and foreign exchange contracts, and similar financial instruments. Other trading activities include acting as a market maker in certain debt and equity securities and related derivatives. Typically, we maintain a securities inventory to facilitate client transactions. Also in the normal course of business, we assume a limited degree of market risk in hedging strategies. Under established policies and procedures we manage market risk associated with trading, capital markets and foreign exchange activities using a VAR approach that determines total exposure arising from interest rate risk, equity risk, foreign exchange risk, spread risk, and volatility risk. For trading portfolios, VAR measures the estimated maximum loss from a trading position, given a specified confidence level and time horizon. VAR exposures and actual results are monitored daily for each trading portfolio. Our VAR calculation measures the potential losses using a 99% confidence level with a one day holding period. This means that, on average, losses are expected to exceed VAR two or three times per year. We had no backtest exceptions to our overall VAR during the last twelve months. The following table displays high, low, and average VAR for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Average VAR $9 $21 High VAR $15 $28 Low VAR $6 $15 Average VAR during the year ended December 31, 2010 was lower compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to sales, paydowns and maturities of illiquid trading assets. This is a result of continuing to manage down illiquid asset holdings where possible, as they are not part of our core business activities. Trading assets net of trading liabilities averaged $3.5 billion and $4.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The decline in average trading balances is primarily a result of balance sheet management activities. Trading assets net of trading liabilities were $3.5 billion and $2.8 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in trading assets net of trading liabilities was primarily due to increases in the TRS portfolio at year end. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk of being unable to meet obligations as they come due at a reasonable funding cost. We mitigate this risk by structuring our balance sheet prudently and by maintaining diverse borrowing resources to fund potential cash needs. For example, we structure our balance sheet so that we fund less liquid assets, such as loans, with stable funding sources, such as retail and wholesale deposits, long term debt and capital. We assess liquidity needs in both the normal course of business and times of unusual events, considering both on and off balance sheet arrangements and commitments that may impact liquidity in certain business environments. We have contingency funding plans that assess liquidity needs that may arise from certain stress events such as credit rating downgrades, rapid asset growth, and financial market disruptions. Our contingency plans also provide for continuous monitoring of net borrowed funds dependence and available sources of contingent liquidity. These sources of contingent liquidity include available cash reserves, capacity to borrow from the FHLB system, the ability to sell, pledge, or borrow against unencumbered securities in the Banks investment portfolio and the capacity to borrow at the Federal Reserve discount window. As of December 31, 2010, the potential liquidity from these four sources totaled $43.0 billion, which we believe exceeds any contingent liquidity needs. 61 Table of Contents Our ALCO measures liquidity risks, sets policies to manage these risks, and reviews adherence to those policies at its monthly meetings. For example, we manage the use of short term unsecured borrowings as well as total wholesale funding through policies established and reviewed by ALCO. In addition, the Risk Committee of our Board sets liquidity limits and reviews current and forecasted liquidity positions at each of its regularly scheduled meetings. Uses of Funds. Our primary uses of funds include the extension of loans and credit, the purchase of investment securities, working capital, and debt and capital service. In addition, contingent uses of funds may arise from events such as financial market disruptions or credit rating downgrades. Factors that affect our credit ratings include, but are not limited to, the credit risk profile of our assets, the adequacy of our ALLL, earnings, the liquidity profile of both the Bank and the Parent Company, the economic environment, and the adequacy of our capital base. During 2010, SunTrust received one notch credit ratings downgrades from each of the four primary NRSROs (Moodys, Standard & Poors, Fitch and DBRS). The incremental impact of these downgrades to our daily business operations was immaterial given that our credit ratings remained investment grade, many peer banks received similar downgrades, our capital ratios remained well above regulatory standards for being well capitalized, and most of our fundamental credit metrics improved during the course of the year. As of December 31, 2010, all of the primary NRSROs maintained a Stable outlook on our credit ratings. Given the Stable outlooks, additional downgrades are possible although not anticipated; see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional information. The Bank and the Parent Company borrow in the money markets using instruments such as Fed funds, Eurodollars, and CP. As of December 31, 2010, the Parent Company had no CP outstanding and the Bank retained a material cash position in the form of excess reserves in its Federal Reserve account. In the absence of robust loan demand, we have chosen to deploy some of this excess liquidity to purchase and retire certain high cost debt securities or other borrowings. During 2010, we repurchased $2.8 billion of Bank and Parent Company debt securities, including senior and subordinated notes, senior notes guaranteed under the FDICs DGP, and FHLB advances. As of December 31, 2010, the Bank had just $34 million of outstanding FHLB advances. Sources of Funds. Our primary source of funds is a large, stable retail deposit base. Core deposits, primarily gathered from our retail branch network, are our largest and most cost effective source of funding. Core deposits totaled $120.0 billion as of December 31, 2010, up from $116.3 billion as of December 31, 2009. The Bank used core deposit growth to replace some of the $4.1 billion of term wholesale funding, which matured during the year ended December 31, 2010, bolstering the quality and depth of the Banks already strong liquidity position. We also maintain access to a diversified collection of wholesale funding sources. These uncommitted sources include Fed funds purchased from other banks, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, negotiable CDs, offshore deposits, FHLB advances, Global Bank Notes, and CP. Aggregate wholesale funding totaled $22.9 billion as of December 31, 2010, down from $28.2 billion as of December 31, 2009. Net short term unsecured borrowings, which includes wholesale domestic and foreign deposits and Fed funds purchased, totaled $7.1 billion as of December 31, 2010, down from $8.9 billion as of December 31, 2009. We also have access to wholesale liquidity via the capital markets. The Parent Company maintains an SEC shelf registration statement from which it may issue senior or subordinated notes and various capital securities such as common or preferred stock. Our Board has authorized the issuance of up to $5.0 billion of such securities. The Bank maintains a Global Bank Note program under which it may issue senior or subordinated debt with various terms. As of December 31, 2010, the Bank had capacity to issue $32.1 billion of notes under the Global Bank Note program. Borrowings under these programs are designed to appeal primarily to domestic and international institutional investors. Institutional investor demand for these securities is dependent upon numerous factors, including but not limited to our credit ratings and investor perception of financial market conditions and the health of the banking sector. Our capacity under these programs refers to authorization granted by our Board, and does not refer to a commitment to purchase by any investor. Parent Company Liquidity. Our primary measure of Parent Company liquidity is the length of time the Parent Company can meet its existing obligations using its present cash balance without the support of dividends from the Bank or new debt issuance. In accordance with risk limits established by ALCO and the Board, we manage the Parent Companys liquidity by structuring its maturity schedule to minimize the amount of debt maturing within a short period of time. Approximately $300 million of Parent Company debt matured during the year ended December, 2010 and none is scheduled to mature during 2011. Much of the Parent Companys liabilities are long term in nature, coming from the proceeds of our capital securities and long term senior and subordinated notes. 62 Table of Contents The primary uses of Parent Company liquidity include debt service, dividends on capital instruments, the periodic purchase of investment securities, and loans to our subsidiaries. We fund corporate dividends primarily with dividends from our banking subsidiary. We are subject to both state and federal banking regulations that limit our ability to pay common stock dividends in certain circumstances. In September 2009 amidst the economic recession and credit market turmoil, we reduced our quarterly common stock dividend to its current level of $0.01 per share. An increase in our quarterly dividend will be dependent upon, among other factors, a sustained return to profitability and the consent of our applicable bank regulators. Recent Developments. Additional regulatory standards for bank liquidity were proposed during 2010. In December of 2010, the BCBS reached final agreement on these proposals to strengthen and standardize global liquidity standards. The proposed standards would require banks to comply with two new liquidity ratios the LCR and the NSFR. The LCR is the ratio of a banks stock of high quality liquid assets to estimated net cash outflows during an acute 30 day stress scenario. The NSFR measures the amount of a banks long term stable funding relative to the liquidity profile of its funded assets and the potential for contingent liquidity needs arising from off balance sheet commitments. The intent of the LCR and NSFR is to promote the retention of significant liquidity reserves and the increased use of stable funding sources such as core deposits and long term debt. Our regulators have not yet adopted these new standards, although we expect the Federal Reserve will issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking later in 2011 that will define how U.S. banks will be required to implement them. The BCBSs recommended adoption dates for these new standards are January 1, 2015 for the LCR and January 1, 2018 for the NSFR. In the meantime, we continue to refine our methodologies for calculating these new liquidity ratios and develop plans for compliance with the new standards. We believe the goals of these standards are consistent with our existing liquidity management framework, policies and practices. It is possible that these liquidity requirements will continue to evolve in the coming months, making it difficult to quantify precisely the costs and other business impacts of these proposed measures at this time. In general, however, these standards may lead to changes in the cost and maturity profile of our funding and or the size and composition of our investment portfolio. We believe the Company will be well positioned to comply with the new standards given our strong core banking franchise and conservative liquidity management practices. Other Liquidity Considerations. As detailed in Table 27, we had an aggregate potential obligation of $63.3 billion to our clients in unused lines of credit at December 31, 2010. Commitments to extend credit are arrangements to lend to clients who have complied with predetermined contractual obligations. As of December 31, 2009, the Bank had unused lines of credit issued in support of Three Pillars as shown in the CP conduit line in Table 27. As of January 1, 2010 we consolidated Three Pillars. Therefore, as of December 31, 2010, the amount of the CP conduit line depicted in Table 27 represents the unused lines of credit that Three Pillars has extended to its clients, as opposed to the lines of credit that the Bank has extended to Three Pillars, which are still legally outstanding. For more information about Three Pillars, see Note 11, Certain Transfers of Financial Assets, Mortgage Servicing Rights and Variable Interest Entities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We also had $6.4 billion in letters of credit as of December 31, 2010, most of which are standby letters of credit, which require that we provide funding if certain future events occur. Approximately $4.0 billion of these letters as of December 31, 2010 supported VRDOs. Our lines and letters of credit have declined since December 31, 2009 due to our decision to reduce exposure to certain higher risk areas, as well as our clients decision not to renew their lines and letters of credit as a result of their decreased need for these facilities as they pay down their debt and reduce their need for working capital. Certain provisions of long term debt agreements and the lines of credit prevent us from creating liens on, disposing of, or issuing (except to related parties) voting stock of subsidiaries. Further, there are restrictions on mergers, consolidations, certain leases, sales or transfers of assets, and minimum shareholders equity ratios. As of December 31, 2010, we were and expect to remain in compliance with all covenants and provisions of these debt agreements. As of December 31, 2010, our cumulative UTBs amounted to $102 million. Interest related to UTBs was $21 million as of December 31, 2010. These UTBs represent the difference between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns and the benefits recognized and measured in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance for income taxes. The UTBs are based on various tax positions in several jurisdictions and, if taxes related to these positions are ultimately paid, the payments would be made from our normal, operating cash flows, likely over multiple years. 63 Table of Contents Other Market Risk Other sources of market risk include the risk associated with holding residential and commercial mortgage loans prior to selling them into the secondary market, commitments to clients to make mortgage loans that will be sold to the secondary market, and our investment in MSRs. We manage the risks associated with the residential and commercial mortgage loans classified as held for sale (i.e., the warehouse) and our IRLCs on residential loans intended for sale. The warehouses and IRLCs consist primarily of fixed and adjustable rate single family residential and commercial real estate. The risk associated with the warehouses and IRLCs is the potential change in interest rates between the time the customer locks in the rate on the anticipated loan and the time the loan is sold on the secondary market, which is typically 60 150 days. We manage interest rate risk predominantly with interest rate swaps, futures, and forward sale agreements, where the changes in value of the instruments substantially offset the changes in value of the warehouse and the IRLCs. The IRLCs on residential mortgage loans intended for sale are classified as free standing derivative financial instruments and are not designated as hedge accounting relationships. MSRs are the present value of future net cash flows that are expected to be received from the mortgage servicing portfolio. The value of MSRs is highly dependent upon the assumed prepayment speed of the mortgage servicing portfolio which is driven by the level of certain key interest rates, primarily the 30 year current coupon par mortgage rate known as the par mortgage rate. Future expected net cash flows from servicing a loan in the mortgage servicing portfolio would not be realized if the loan pays off earlier than anticipated. Prepayment speeds have generally been slowing down given the current economic environment; however, the level of prepayments began to pick up towards the second half of 2010, but the impact from increasing prepayments was offset by additions to the MSR portfolio from new origination activity. We historically have not actively hedged MSRs, but have managed the market risk through our overall asset/liability management process with consideration to the natural counter cyclicality of servicing and production that occurs as interest rates rise and fall over time with the economic cycle as well as with securities AFS. However, as of January 1, 2009, we designated the 2008 MSRs vintage and all future MSRs production at fair value. In addition, as of January 1, 2010, we designated at fair value the remaining MSR portfolio of $604 million being carried at LOCOM. Upon designating the remaining MSRs at fair value, we increased the carrying value of these MSRs by $145 million and recorded an increase in retained earnings, net of taxes, of $89 million. The decision to designate the MSR portfolio at fair value, key economic assumptions, and the sensitivity of the current fair value of the MSRs as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 is discussed in greater detail in Note 9, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Note 11, Certain Transfers of Financial Assets, Mortgage Servicing Rights and Variable Interest Entities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The MSRs being carried at fair value total $1.4 billion and $936 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and are managed within established risk limits and are monitored as part of various governance processes. We originated MSRs with a fair value of $289 million and $682 million, at the time of origination, during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We recorded a decrease in fair value of $513 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, and an increase in fair value of $66 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, including decay resulting from the realization of expected monthly net servicing cash flows. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we recorded a loss in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss) related to fair value MSRs of $69 million (including decay of $240 million) and $22 million (including decay of $95 million), respectively, inclusive of the mark to market adjustments on the related hedges. We also recorded an impairment recovery in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss) of $199 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, related to MSRs carried at LOCOM at the time. We also have market risk from capital stock we hold in the FHLB of Atlanta and from capital stock we hold in the Federal Reserve Bank. In order to be an FHLB member, we are required to purchase capital stock in the FHLB. In exchange, members take advantage of competitively priced advances as a wholesale funding source and access grants and low cost loans for affordable housing and community development projects, amongst other benefits. As of December 31, 2010, we held a total of $298 million of capital stock in the FHLB. During 2010, we reduced our capital stock holdings in the FHLB by $45 million. In order to become a member of the Federal Reserve System, regulations require that we hold a certain amount of capital stock as a percentage of the Banks capital. During 2010, we held $391 million of Federal Reserve Bank capital stock. For a detailed overview regarding actions taken to address the risk from changes in equity prices associated with our investment in Coke common stock, see Investment in Common Shares of the Coca Cola Company, in this MD&A. We 64 Table of Contents also hold, as of December 31, 2010, a total of approximately $215 million of private equity investments that include direct investments and limited partnerships. We hold these investments as long term investments and make additional contributions based on our contractual commitments but have decided to limit investments into new private equity investments. Impairment charges could occur if deteriorating conditions in the market persist, including, but not limited to, goodwill and other intangibles impairment charges and increased charges with respect to OREO. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS See discussion of off balance sheet arrangements in Note 11, Certain Transfers of Financial Assets, Mortgage Servicing Rights and Variable Interest Entities, and Note 18, Reinsurance Arrangements and Guarantees, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS In the normal course of business, we enter into certain contractual obligations, including obligations to make future payments on debt and lease arrangements, contractual commitments for capital expenditures, and service contracts. Table 26 summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010, except for pension and other postretirement benefit plans, included in Note 16, Employee Benefit Plans, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Table 27 illustrates our unfunded lending commitments as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009. Table 26 Contractual Commitments As of December 31, 2010 (Dollars in millions) 1 year or less 1 3 years 3 5 years After 5 years Total Time deposit maturities 1 $12,319 $6,357 $4,754 $110 $23,540 Short term borrowings 1 5,821 5,821 Long term debt 1,2 4,571 2,043 811 6,209 13,634 Operating lease obligations 209 379 327 561 1,476 Capital lease obligations 1 2 2 3 7 14 Purchase obligations 3 143 372 226 304 1,045 Total $23,065 $9,153 $6,121 $7,191 $45,530 1 Amounts do not include accrued interest. 2 Amounts do not include capital lease obligations. 3 Includes contracts with a minimum annual payment of $5 million.

Interest related to UTBs was $21 million as of December 31, 2010. These UTBs represent the difference between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns and the benefits recognized and measured in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance for income taxes. The UTBs are based on various tax positions in several jurisdictions and, if taxes related to these positions are ultimately paid, the payments would be made from our normal, operating cash flows, likely over multiple years. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our significant accounting policies are described in detail in Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements and are integral to understanding our financial performance. We have identified certain accounting policies as being critical because (1) they require judgment about matters that are highly uncertain and (2) different estimates that could be reasonably applied would result in materially different assessments with respect to ascertaining the valuation of assets, liabilities, commitments, and contingencies. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, valuing an asset or liability, or reducing a liability. Our accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and they conform to general practices within the financial services industry. We have established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The following is a description of our current critical accounting policies. Contingencies We face uncertainty with respect to the ultimate outcomes of various contingencies including the Allowance for Credit Losses, mortgage repurchase reserves, and legal and regulatory matters. Allowance for Credit Losses The Allowance for Credit Losses is composed of the ALLL and the reserve for unfunded commitments. The ALLL represents our estimate of probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio. The ALLL is increased by the provision for credit losses and reduced by loans charged off, net of recoveries. The ALLL is determined based on our review and evaluation of larger loans that meet our definition of impairment and the current risk characteristics of pools of homogeneous loans (i.e., loans having similar characteristics) within the loan portfolio and our assessment of internal and external influences on credit quality that are not fully reflected in the historical loss or risk rating data. Large commercial nonaccrual loans and certain commercial, consumer, and residential loans whose terms have been modified in a TDR, are individually evaluated to determine the amount of specific allowance required using the most probable source of repayment, including the present value of the loans expected future cash flows, the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs of disposition, or the loans estimated market value. In these measurements, we use assumptions and methodologies that are relevant to estimating the level of impaired and unrealized losses in the portfolio. To the extent that the data supporting such assumptions has limitations, our judgment and experience play a key role in enhancing the specific ALLL estimates. Key judgments used in determining the ALLL include internal risk ratings, market and collateral values, discount rates, loss rates, and our view of current economic conditions. General allowances are established for loans and leases grouped into pools that have similar characteristics, including smaller balance homogeneous loans. The ALLL Committee estimates probable losses by evaluating quantitative and qualitative factors for each loan portfolio segment, including net charge off trends, internal risk ratings, changes in internal risk ratings, loss forecasts, collateral values, geographic location, delinquency rates, nonperforming and restructured loans, origination channel, product mix, underwriting practices, industry conditions, and economic trends. In addition to these factors, the consumer and residential portfolio segments consider borrower FICO scores and the commercial portfolio segment considers single name borrower concentration. Estimated collateral valuations are based on appraisals, broker price opinions, recent sales of foreclosed properties, automated valuation models, other property specific information, and relevant market information, supplemented by our internal property valuation professionals. The value estimate is based on an orderly disposition and marketing period of the property. In limited instances, we adjust externally provided appraisals for justifiable and well supported reasons, such as an appraiser not being aware of certain property specific factors or recent sales information. Appraisals generally represent the as is value of the property but may be adjusted based on the intended disposition strategy of the property. 66 Table of Contents Our determination of the ALLL for commercial loans is sensitive to the assigned internal risk ratings and inherent loss rates at December 31, 2010. In the event that 10 percent of loans within this portfolio segment experienced downgrades of two internal risk ratings, the ALLL for the commercial portfolio would increase by approximately $150 million at December 31, 2010. In the event that estimated loss severity rates for the entire commercial loan portfolio increased by 10 percent, the ALLL for the commercial portfolio would increase by approximately $129 million at December 31, 2010. Our determination of the allowance for residential and consumer loans is also sensitive to changes in estimated loss severity rates. In the event that estimated loss severity rates for the residential and consumer loan portfolio increased by 10 percent, the ALLL for the residential and consumer portfolios would increase, in total, by approximately $154 million at December 31, 2010. Because several quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in determining the ALLL, these sensitivity analyses do not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the ALLL. They are intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes in risk rating and estimated loss severity rates and do not imply any expectation of future deterioration in the risk ratings or loss rates. Given current processes employed, management believes the risk ratings and inherent loss rates currently assigned are appropriate. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions that could be significant to our financial statements. In addition to the ALLL, we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments, such as letters of credit and binding unfunded loan commitments. Unfunded lending commitments are analyzed and segregated by risk similar to funded loans based on our internal risk rating scale. These risk classifications, in combination with an analysis of historical loss experience, probability of commitment usage, and any other pertinent information, result in the estimation of the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. Our financial results are affected by the changes in and the absolute level of the Allowance for Credit Losses. This process involves our analysis of complex internal and external variables, and it requires that we exercise judgment to estimate an appropriate Allowance for Credit Losses. As a result of the uncertainty associated with this subjectivity, we cannot assure the precision of the amount reserved should we experience sizeable loan or lease losses in any particular period. For example, changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers, economic conditions, or the condition of various markets in which collateral may be sold could require us to significantly decrease or increase the level of the Allowance for Credit Losses. Such an adjustment could materially affect net income as a result of the change in provision for credit losses. During 2009 and 2010, we experienced elevated delinquencies and net charge offs in residential real estate loans due to the deterioration of the housing market. These market conditions were considered in deriving the estimated Allowance for Credit Losses; however, given the continued economic challenges and uncertainties, the ultimate amount of loss could vary from that estimate. For additional discussion of the ALLL see the Allowance for Credit Losses and Nonperforming Assets sections in this MD&A as well as Note 6, Loans, and Note 7, Allowance for Credit Losses, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Mortgage Repurchase Reserve We sell residential mortgage loans to investors through securitizations or whole loan sales in the normal course of our business. In association with these transactions, we provide representations and warranties to the buyers that these loans meet certain requirements. In the last few years, we have seen a significant increase in buyer claims regarding material breaches of these representations and warranties resulting in a significant increase in the repurchase liability. The increase in repurchase losses has primarily related to loans sold from 2005 to 2008. We have received fewer repurchase requests related to loans sold prior to 2005 and after 2008 due to the stronger credit performance of these loans and improvements in credit guidelines and underwriting process implemented progressively, beginning in 2007. The increase in repurchase requests has been driven by loans sold to the GSEs, with a limited number of requests having been received related to non agency investors. We maintain a liability for losses resulting from loan repurchases and indemnifications that is initially based upon the fair value of these guarantees. Subsequently, the liability is reduced in proportion to the reduction in risk as actual losses are incurred, and additions to the liability are made for our estimate of incurred losses. The liability is calculated by sales vintage based on various factors including: existing repurchase demands, the population of loans that have ever been 120 or more days past due, including loans currently delinquent that are expected to migrate to 120 days past due, the probability that a repurchase request related to a defaulted loan will be received, 67 Table of Contents the probability that a loan demanded for repurchase will be repurchased, and historical loss experience. Some of the assumptions used in this process contain a level of uncertainty since these assumptions are largely derived from historical experience that is limited and highly variable. As such, provision expense will vary as the estimates used to measure the liability continue to be updated based on the level of repurchase requests, the latest experience gained on repurchase requests and other relevant facts and circumstances. One of the most critical and judgmental assumptions is the repurchase request rate because it requires us to make assessments regarding the actions that will be taken by third party purchasers in the context of the limited and highly variable history we have experienced with their current volume of requests. Once we estimate the level of requests that we expect to receive by vintage, we apply factors for the probability that a loan will be repurchased as well as the loss severity expected. Based on our experience during 2010, we estimate that our actual repurchase rate relative to our demands will be approximately 50%. With regard to losses experienced on loan repurchases, including make whole settlements, our current experience has averaged approximately 50% of our demands. The experience varies by vintage and will be affected by future housing price changes. We expect future repurchase related losses and reserves will be largely driven by the volume of repurchase requests received from the GSEs, which have exhibited considerable monthly volatility. To date, the majority of our repurchase requests have been associated with 2006 and 2007 vintages, which produce higher losses. However, we expect that normal seasoning patterns for origination vintages, over time, will shift new repurchase requests to newer production vintages which have a lower risk profile. As that occurs, we expect lower aggregate request volumes and lower loss frequencies and severities, as the newer vintages exhibit more favorable characteristics, such as higher FICOs and lower original LTVs, as they were originated during or after periods that experienced the most significant home price depreciation. Assuming a simultaneous 10% adverse change in all three of our key assumptions, our reserve estimate would increase by approximately $75 million. This sensitivity analysis is hypothetical in nature and intended to provide perspective on the potential impact that changes in key assumptions would have upon our estimate. It is highly unlikely that future developments would lead us to change key assumptions by the same relative percentage because they are likely to move independently to some degree. Various factors could potentially impact the accuracy of the assumptions underlying our mortgage repurchase reserve estimate. As previously discussed, the level of repurchase and indemnification requests we receive is dependent upon the actions of third parties and could differ significantly from the assumptions that we have made. Delinquency levels, delinquency roll rates, and our loss severity assumptions are all highly dependent upon economic factors including changes in real estate values and unemployment levels which are, by nature, difficult to predict. Loss severity assumptions could also be negatively impacted by delays in the foreclosure process which is a heightened risk in some of the states where our loans sold were originated. Approximately 15% of the population of loans sold between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2010 were sold to non agency investors, some in the form of securitizations. Due to the nature of these structures and the indirect ownership interests, the potential exists that investors, over time, will become more successful in forcing additional repurchase demands. While we have used the best information available in estimating the mortgage repurchase reserve liability, these and other factors, along with the discovery of additional information in the future could result in changes in our assumptions which could materially impact our results of operations. Legal and Regulatory Matters We are parties to numerous claims and lawsuits arising in the course of our normal business activities, some of which involve claims for substantial amounts, and the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our estimates are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel. In many such proceedings, it is not possible to determine whether a liability has 68 Table of Contents been incurred or to estimate the ultimate or minimum amount of that liability until the matter is close to resolution. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our estimates may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. However, it is the opinion of management that liabilities arising from these claims in excess of the amounts currently accrued, if any, will not have a material adverse impact to the Companys financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. See Note 21, Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Estimates of Fair Value Fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Certain of our assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Examples of recurring uses of fair value include derivative instruments, AFS and trading securities, certain LHFI and LHFS, certain issuances of long term debt, and MSRs. We also measure certain assets at fair value on a non recurring basis either when such assets are carried at the LOCOM, to evaluate assets for impairment, or for disclosure purposes. Examples of these non recurring uses of fair value include certain LHFS, OREO, goodwill, intangible assets, nonmarketable equity securities, and long lived assets. Depending on the nature of the asset or liability, we use various valuation techniques and assumptions when estimating fair value. The objective of fair value is to use market based inputs or assumptions, when available, to estimate the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Where observable market prices from transactions for identical assets or liabilities are not available, we identify what we believe to be similar assets or liabilities. If observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain for any such similar assets or liabilities, we look to other techniques such as obtaining third party quotes or using modeling techniques, such as discounted cash flows, while attempting to utilize market observable assumptions to the extent available. Absent current market activity in that specific security or a similar security, the resulting valuation approach will require making a number of significant judgments in the estimation of fair value. Market conditions during the credit crisis led to limited or nonexistent trading in certain of the financial asset classes that we have owned. The lack of liquidity and low level of activity in these markets creates additional challenges when estimating the fair value of related financial instruments. Generally, the assets and liabilities most affected by the lack of liquidity are those required to be classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. As a result, various processes and controls have been adopted to determine that appropriate methodologies, techniques and assumptions are used in the development of fair value estimates, particularly related to those instruments that require the use of significant, unobservable inputs. We continue to maintain a cross functional approach when estimating the fair value of these difficult to value financial instruments. This includes input from not only the related line of business, but also from risk management and finance, to ultimately arrive at a consensus estimate of the instruments fair value after evaluating all available information pertaining to fair value. This process has involved the gathering of multiple sources of information, including broker quotes, values provided by pricing services, trading activity in other similar securities, market indices, pricing matrices along with employing various modeling techniques, such as discounted cash flow analyses, in arriving at the best estimate of fair value. Modeling techniques incorporate our assessments regarding assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability, including market based assumptions, such as interest rates, as well as assumptions about the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique, the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset, market liquidity, and the risk of nonperformance. In certain cases, our assessments with respect to assumptions that market participants would make may be inherently difficult to determine and the use of different assumptions could result in material changes to these fair value measurements. We used significant unobservable inputs to fair value, on a recurring basis, certain trading assets, securities AFS, portfolio loans accounted for at fair value, IRLCs, LHFS, MSRs and certain derivatives. The following table discloses assets and liabilities that have been impacted by level 3 fair value determinations. 69 Table of Contents Table 28 Level 3 Assets and Liabilities As of December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Trading assets $209 $390 Securities AFS 1,136 1,322 LHFS 7 151 LHFI 492 449 Other intangible assets 1 1,439 936 Other assets 2 18 13 Total level 3 assets $3,301 $3,261 Total assets $172,874 $174,165 Total assets measured at fair value $38,410 $37,915 Level 3 assets as a percent of total assets 1.9 % 1.9 % Level 3 assets as a percent of total assets measured at fair value 8.6 8.6 Long term debt $ $ Trading liabilities 145 46 Other liabilities 2,3 42 48 Total level 3 liabilities $187 $94 Total liabilities $149,744 $151,634 Total liabilities measured at fair value $6,842 $7,161 Level 3 liabilities as a percent of total liabilities 0.1 % 0.1 % Level 3 liabilities as a percent of total liabilities measured at fair value 2.7 1.3 1 MSRs carried at fair value. 2 Includes IRLCs. 3 Includes derivative related to sale of Visa shares during the second quarter of 2009. Overall, the financial impact of the level 3 financial instruments did not have a significant impact on our liquidity or capital. Some fair value assets are pledged for corporate borrowings or other liquidity purposes. Most of these arrangements provide for advances to be made based on the market value and not the principal balance of the assets, and therefore whether or not we have elected fair value accounting treatment does not impact our liquidity. If the fair value of assets posted as collateral declines, we will be required to post more collateral under our borrowing arrangements which could negatively impact our liquidity position on an overall basis. For purposes of computing regulatory capital, mark to market adjustments related to our own creditworthiness for debt and index linked CDs accounted for at fair value are excluded from regulatory capital. The following discussion provides further information on fair value accounting by balance sheet category including the difficult to value assets and liabilities displayed in the table above. Trading Assets and Liabilities and Securities AFS In estimating the fair values for the majority of securities AFS and trading instruments, including residual and certain other retained securitization interests, fair values are based on observable market prices of the same or similar instruments. We also gather third party broker quotes or use industry standard or proprietary models to estimate the fair value of these instruments. For certain securities and trading instruments, the distressed market conditions associated with this economic recession over the past few years have impacted our ability to obtain market pricing data on certain portfolios of securities. Even when market pricing has been available, the reduced trading activity resulting from current market conditions has challenged the observability of these quotations. However, we have seen certain markets begin to recover and have also been able to liquidate many of our level 3 assets through sales, maturities, or other distributions at prices approximating our previous estimates. When fair values are estimated based on internal models, we will consider relevant market indices that correlate to the underlying collateral, along with assumptions such as liquidity discounts, interest rates, prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severity rates, and discount rates. Pricing services and broker quotes were obtained, when available, to assist in estimating the fair value of level 3 instruments. We evaluate third party pricing to determine the reasonableness of the information relative to changes in market data such as any recent trades we executed, market information received from outside market participants and analysts, and or changes in the underlying collateral performance. The number of quotes we obtained varied based on the number of brokers following a particular security, but we generally attempt to obtain two to four quotes to determine reasonableness and comparability on a relative basis. In most cases, the current market conditions caused the broker quotes to be indicative and the price indications and broker quotes to be supported by very limited to no recent market activity. In those instances, we weighted the third party information according to our judgment of it being a reasonable indication of the instruments fair value. 70 Table of Contents When actual trades are not available to corroborate pricing information received, we will use industry standard or proprietary models to estimate fair value, and will consider assumptions such as relevant market indices that correlate to the underlying collateral, prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severity rates, and discount rates. While it is difficult to accurately predict the ultimate cash value of these securities, we believe the amount that would be ultimately realized if the securities were held to settlement or maturity will generally be greater than the current fair value of the securities classified as level 3. This assessment is based on the current performance of the underlying collateral, which is experiencing elevated losses but generally not to the degree that correlates to current market values, which is pressured downward due to liquidity issues and other broad macroeconomic conditions. It is reasonably likely that market volatility for certain instruments will continue as a result of a variety of external factors. This lack of liquidity has caused us to evaluate the performance of the underlying collateral and use a discount rate commensurate with the rate a market participant would use to value the instrument in an orderly transaction, but that also acknowledges illiquidity premiums and required investor rates of return that would be demanded under current market conditions. The discount rate considered the capital structure of the instrument, market indices, and the relative yields of instruments for which third party pricing information and or market activity was available. In certain instances, the interest rate and credit risk components of the valuation indicated a full return of expected principal and interest; however, the lack of liquidity resulted in wide ranges of discounts in valuing certain level 3 instruments. The illiquidity that continues to persist in certain markets are requiring discounts of this degree to drive a market competitive yield, as well as account for the anticipated extended tenor. The discount rates selected derived reasonable prices when compared to (i) observable transactions, when available, (ii) other securities on a relative basis, (iii) the bid/ask spread of non binding broker indicative bids and or (iv) our professional judgment. All of the techniques used and information obtained in the valuation process provides a range of estimated values, which were evaluated and compared in order to establish an estimated value that, based on managements judgment, represented a reasonable estimate of the instruments fair value. It was not uncommon for the range of value of these instruments to vary widely; in such cases, we selected an estimated value that we believed was the best indication of value based on the yield a market participant in this current environment would expect. Due to the continued illiquidity and credit risk of level 3 securities, these market values are highly sensitive to assumption changes and market volatility. Improvements may be made to our pricing methodologies on an ongoing basis as observable and relevant information becomes available to us. See Note 20, Fair Value Election and Measurement, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion regarding level 2 and 3 securities and valuation methodologies for each class of securities. Most derivative instruments are level 1 or level 2 instruments, except for the IRLCs, the Visa litigation related derivative, discussed below, and The Agreements we entered into related to our investment in Coke common stock, which are level 3 instruments. Because the value of The Agreements is primarily driven by the embedded equity collars on the Coke common shares, a Black Scholes model is the appropriate valuation model. Most of the assumptions are directly observable from the market, such as the per share market price of Coke common stock, interest rates, and the dividend rate on Coke common stock. Volatility is a significant assumption and is impacted both by the unusually large size of the trade and the long tenor until settlement. The Agreements carry scheduled terms of approximately six and a half and seven years from the effective date, and as such, the observable and active options market on Coke does not provide for any identical or similar instruments. As a result, we receive estimated market values from a market participant who is knowledgeable about Coke equity derivatives and is active in the market. Based on inquiries of the market participant as to their procedures as well as our own valuation assessment procedures, we have satisfied ourselves that the market participant is using methodologies and assumptions that other market participants would use in arriving at the fair value of The Agreements. At December 31, 2010, the Coke derivative liability was valued at $145 million and was included within the level 3 trading liabilities portfolio. At December 31, 2010, level 3 trading assets and level 3 securities AFS totaled $209 million and $1.1 billion, respectively. Our level 3 securities AFS portfolio included FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank stock, as well as certain municipal bond securities, some of which are only redeemable with the issuer at par and cannot be traded in the market; as such, no significant observable market data for these instruments is available. These nonmarketable securities AFS totaled approximately $728 million at December 31, 2010. The remaining level 3 securities, both trading assets and securities AFS, are predominantly private ABS and MBS and CDOs, including interests retained from Company sponsored securitizations or purchased from third party securitizations. We also have exposure to bank trust preferred ABS, student loan ABS, and municipal securities due to our purchase of certain ARS as a result of failed auctions. For all level 3 securities, little or no market activity exists for either the security or the underlying collateral and therefore the significant assumptions used to value the securities are not market observable. 71 Table of Contents Level 3 trading assets declined by $181 million, or 46%, during the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to sales, paydowns, redemptions, and maturities of securities, partially offset by net unrealized mark to market gains and a small amount of purchases. Level 3 securities AFS declined by $186 million, or 14%, during the year ended December 31, 2010, due to continued paydowns and redemptions by issuers of securities, partially offset by net unrealized mark to market gains and a small amount of ARS purchases. Both level 3 securities AFS and trading assets were also reduced by a transfer of senior level student loan ARS and a CLO preference share position out of level 3 into level 2 totaling $93 million of securities AFS and $34 million of trading assets during the year ended December 31, 2010. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized through earnings $84 million in net gains related to trading assets and liabilities and securities AFS classified as level 3. Loans The fair values of LHFI and LHFS are based on observable current market prices in the secondary loan market in which loans trade, as either whole loans or as ABS. When securities prices are obtained in the secondary loan market, we will translate these prices into whole loan prices by incorporating adjustments for estimated credit enhancement costs, loan servicing fees, and various other transformation costs, when material. The fair value of a loan is impacted by the nature of the asset and the market liquidity. When estimating fair value for loans that do not trade in an active market, we will make assumptions about prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severity rates, and liquidity discounts. Absent comparable current market data, we believe that the fair value derived from these various approaches is a reasonable approximation of the prices that we would receive upon sale of the loans. Level 3 loans are primarily non agency residential mortgage loans for which there are little to no observable trades in either the new issuance or secondary loan markets as either whole loans or as securities. Prior to the disruption in the non agency residential loan market, we were able to obtain certain observable pricing from either the new issuance or secondary loan market. However, as the markets deteriorated and certain loans were not actively trading as either whole loans or as securities, we began employing the same alternative valuation methodologies used to value level 3 residential MBS to fair value the mortgage loans. Transfers of certain mortgage LHFS into level 3 during 2010 were largely due to borrower defaults or the identification of other loan defects impacting the marketability of the loans. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we transferred $160 million of NPLs that were previously designated as LHFI to LHFS; we subsequently sold the transferred NPLs at prices that approximated fair value. These loans were predominantly reported at amortized cost prior to their transfer to LHFS. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we transferred $213 million of loans that were previously designated as LHFS to LHFI, as they were determined to be no longer marketable. Of this amount, $147 million were loans for which fair value accounting had been elected; these loans will continue to be reported at fair value within LHFI. Other Intangible Assets and Other Assets Beginning January 1, 2010, we began recording all MSRs at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of MSRs is based on discounted cash flow analyses and can be highly variable quarter to quarter as market conditions and projected interest rates change. We provide disclosure of the key economic assumptions used to measure MSRs and residual interests and a sensitivity analysis to adverse changes to these assumptions in Note 11, Certain Transfers of Financial Assets, Mortgage Servicing Rights and Variable Interest Entities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This sensitivity analysis does not take into account hedging activities discussed in the Other Market Risk section of this MD&A. The fair values of OREO and other repossessed assets are typically determined based on recent appraisals by third parties and other market information. Our OREO properties are concentrated in Georgia, Florida, and North Carolina, therefore further deterioration in property values in those states or changes to our disposition strategies could cause our estimates of OREO values to decline which would result in further write downs. Estimates of fair value are also required when performing an impairment analysis of goodwill, intangible assets and long lived assets. For long lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. In determining the fair value, management uses models which require assumptions about growth rates, the life of the asset, and or the market value of the assets. We test long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that our carrying amount may not be recoverable. 72 Table of Contents Other Liabilities During the second quarter of 2009, in connection with our sale of Visa Class B shares, we entered into a derivative contract whereby the ultimate cash payments received or paid, if any, under the contract are based on the ultimate resolution of litigation involving Visa. The value of the derivative is estimated based on our expectations regarding the ultimate resolution of that litigation, which involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity. As a result, the value of the derivative liability was classified as a level 3 instrument. At December 31, 2010, the Visa derivative liability was valued at $23 million and was included within other liabilities. See Note 18, Reinsurance Arrangements and Guarantees, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. The fair value methodology and assumptions related to our IRLCs is described in Note 20, Fair Value Election and Measurement, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill In 2009, our reporting units were comprised of Retail, Commercial, CRE, Household Lending, CIB, W&IM, and Affordable Housing. In the first quarter of 2009, we wrote off all of the goodwill of the CRE, Household Lending, and Affordable Housing reporting units in connection with our goodwill impairment analysis. In the second quarter of 2010, we changed our business segments. Among other changes, portions of the CIB segment, such as Middle Market, Asset Based Lending, and Equipment Leasing were moved to the Diversified Commercial Banking segment, resulting in the allocation of approximately $43 million in goodwill from the CIB reporting unit to the Commercial reporting unit, which was renamed the Diversified Commercial Banking reporting unit. The Retail reporting unit was renamed Branch Banking; however, the composition of the reporting unit did not change. Branch Banking is a component of the Retail Banking reportable segment. As of December 31, 2010, the reporting units with goodwill balances are Branch Banking, Diversified Commercial Banking, CIB, and W&IM. See Note 22, Business Segment Reporting, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of the changes to our reportable segments. We review the goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment on an annual basis, or more often, if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value of its equity. The goodwill impairment analysis estimates the fair value of equity using discounted cash flow analyses which require assumptions, as well as guideline company and guideline transaction information, where available. The inputs and assumptions specific to each reporting unit are incorporated in the valuations including projections of future cash flows, discount rates, the fair value of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities, and applicable valuation multiples based on the guideline information. We assess the reasonableness of the estimated fair value of the reporting units by giving consideration to our market capitalization over a reasonable period of time; however, supplemental information is applied based on observable multiples from guideline transactions, adjusting to reflect our specific factors, as well as current market conditions. Based on our annual impairment analysis of goodwill as of September 30, 2010, we believe that the fair value for all reporting units is substantially in excess of the respective reporting units carrying value. Valuation Techniques In determining the fair value of our reporting units, we primarily use discounted cash flow analyses, which require assumptions about short and long term net cash flow growth rates for each reporting unit, as well as discount rates. In addition, we consider guideline company and guideline transaction information, where available, to aid in the valuation of certain reporting units. Growth Assumptions Multi year financial forecasts are developed for each reporting unit by considering several key business drivers such as new business initiatives, client service and retention standards, market share changes, anticipated loan and deposit growth, forward interest rates, historical performance, and industry and economic trends, among other considerations. The long term growth rate used in determining the terminal value of each reporting unit was estimated at 4% in 2009 and 2010 based on managements assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit, as well as broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product and inflation. 73 Table of Contents Discount Rate Assumptions Discount rates are estimated based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which considers the risk free interest rate, market risk premium, beta, and in some cases, unsystematic risk and size premium adjustments specific to a particular reporting unit. The discount rates are also calibrated based on the assessment of the risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit. In the annual analysis as of September 30, 2010, the discount rates ranged from 12% to 16%. Estimated Fair Value and Sensitivities The estimated fair value of each reporting unit is derived from the valuation techniques described above. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit is analyzed in relation to numerous market and historical factors, including current economic and market conditions, marketplace dynamics such as level of short selling, company specific growth opportunities, and guideline company and guideline transaction information. Economic and market conditions can vary significantly which may cause increased volatility in a companys stock price, resulting in a temporary decline in market capitalization. In those circumstances, current market capitalization may not be an accurate indication of a market participants estimate of entity specific value measured over a reasonable period of time. We believe that this volatility may be tied to market sentiment pertaining to the overall banking sector and concerns regarding dilution of common shareholders, rather than the result of company specific adjustments to cash flows, guideline multiples, or asset values which would have influenced the fair value of reporting units. As a result, the use of market capitalization has become a less relevant measure to assess the reasonableness of the aggregate value of the reporting units. Therefore, we supplement the market capitalization information with other observable market information that provided benchmark valuation multiples from transactions over a reasonable period. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions; therefore, in some instances changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value. We perform sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values. Ultimately, future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value. Additionally, a reporting units carrying value of equity could change based on market conditions and the risk profile of those reporting units. If there is a situation where the carrying value of equity exceeds the estimated fair value, an additional goodwill impairment evaluation is performed which involves calculating the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as goodwill is recognized in a business combination. The fair value of the reporting units assets and liabilities, including previously unrecognized intangible assets, is individually determined. Significant judgment and estimates are involved in estimating the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The excess fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of the reporting units net assets is the implied goodwill. The value of the implied goodwill is highly sensitive to the estimated fair value of the reporting units net assets. The fair value of the reporting units net assets is estimated using a variety of valuation techniques including the following: recent data observed in the market, including similar assets cash flow modeling based on projected cash flows and market discount rates market indices estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral price indications from independent third parties Observable market information is utilized to the extent available and relevant. The estimated fair values reflect managements assumptions regarding how a market participant would value the net assets and includes appropriate credit, liquidity, and market risk premiums that are indicative of the current environment. If the implied fair value of the goodwill for the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the goodwill for the respective reporting unit, no goodwill impairment is recorded. If the carrying amount of a reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. Changes in the estimated fair value of the individual assets and liabilities may result in a different amount of implied goodwill, and ultimately the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. Sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the potential ranges of implied goodwill. 74 Table of Contents The size of the implied goodwill is significantly affected by the estimated fair value of loans. The estimated fair value of a loan portfolio is based on an exit price, and the assumptions used are intended to approximate those that a market participant would use in valuing the loans in an orderly transaction, including a market liquidity discount. Future changes in the fair value of a reporting units net assets could result in future goodwill impairment. For example, to the extent there are significant market risk premiums and the fair value of the individual assets of a reporting unit increases at a faster rate than the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole, that may cause the implied goodwill of a reporting unit to be lower than the carrying value of goodwill, resulting in goodwill impairment. Income Taxes We are subject to the income tax laws of the various jurisdictions where we conduct business and estimate income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to these various tax jurisdictions. The estimated income tax expense/(benefit) is reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss). The evaluation pertaining to the tax expense and related tax asset and liability balances involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity around the ultimate measurement and resolution of these matters. Accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from tax jurisdictions either currently or in the future and are reported in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We assess the appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent and other pertinent information and maintain tax accruals consistent with our evaluation. Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws, the status of examinations by the tax authorities and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance that could impact the relative merits of tax positions. These changes, when they occur, impact accrued taxes and can materially affect our operating results. We regularly evaluate our uncertain tax positions and estimate the appropriate level of UTBs related to each of these positions. We regularly evaluate the realizability of deferred tax asset positions. In determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary, we consider the level of taxable income in prior years to the extent that carrybacks are permitted under current tax laws, as well as estimates of future pre tax and taxable income and tax planning strategies that would, if necessary, be implemented. We currently maintain a valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets for certain state carryforwards generated by our subsidiaries. We expect to realize our remaining deferred tax assets over the allowable carryback and or carryforward periods. Therefore, no valuation allowance is deemed necessary against our federal or remaining state deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2010. For additional information, refer to Note 15, Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Accounting Several variables affect the annual variability of cost for our retirement programs. The main variables are: (1) size and characteristics of the employee population, (2) discount rate, (3) expected long term rate of return on plan assets, (4) recognition of actual asset returns, (5) other actuarial assumptions and (6) healthcare cost. Below is a brief description of these variables and the effect they have on our pension costs. Size and Characteristics of the Employee Population Pension cost is directly related to the number of employees covered by the plans, and other factors including salary, age, years of employment, and benefit terms. Effective January 1, 2008, retirement plan participants who were employed as of December 31, 2007 ceased to accrue additional benefits under the existing pension benefit formula and their accrued benefits were frozen. Beginning January 1, 2008, participants who had fewer than 20 years of service and future participants accrue future pension benefits under a cash balance formula that provides compensation and interest credits to a Personal Pension Account. Participants with 20 or more years of service as of December 31, 2007 were given the opportunity to choose between continuing a traditional pension benefit accrual under a reduced formula or participating in the new Personal Pension Account. See Note 16, Employee Benefit Plans, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for plan changes effective January 1, 2011 that will impact plan assumptions during 2011. 75 Table of Contents Discount Rate The discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit obligations. The discount rate for each plan is determined by matching the expected cash flows of each plan to a yield curve based on long term, high quality fixed income debt instruments available as of the measurement date, December 31, 2010. The discount rate for each plan is reset annually or upon occurrence of a triggering event on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions. If we were to assume a 0.25% increase/decrease in the discount rate for all retirement and other postretirement plans, and keep all other assumptions constant, the benefit cost would decrease/ increase by approximately $8 million. Expected Long term Rate of Return on Plan Assets Based on historical experience, market projections, and the target asset allocation set forth in the investment policy for the Retirement Plans, the pre tax expected rate of return on plan assets was 8.0% for 2010. This expected rate of return is dependent upon the asset allocation decisions made with respect to plan assets. Annual differences, if any, between expected and actual returns are included in the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount. We generally amortize any unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in excess of a 10% corridor in net periodic pension expense over the average future service of active employees, which is approximately eight years, or average future lifetime for plans that are frozen or have no active participants. See Note 16, Employee Benefit Plans, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on changes in the pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. If we were to assume a 0.25% increase/decrease in the expected long term rate of return for the retirement and other postretirement plans, holding all other actuarial assumptions constant, the benefit cost would decrease/increase by approximately $6 million. Recognition of Actual Asset Returns Accounting guidance allows for the use of an asset value that smoothes investment gains and losses over a period up to five years. However, we have elected to use a preferable method in determining pension cost. This method uses the actual market value of the plan assets. Therefore, we will experience more variability in the annual pension cost, as the asset values will be more volatile than companies who elected to smooth their investment experience. Other Actuarial Assumptions To estimate the projected benefit obligation, actuarial assumptions are required about factors such as mortality rate, turnover rate, retirement rate, disability rate, and the rate of compensation increases. These factors do not tend to change significantly over time, so the range of assumptions, and their impact on pension cost, is generally limited. We annually review the assumptions used based on historical and expected future experience. The interest crediting rate applied to each Personal Pension Account was an annual effective rate of 4.49% for 2010. Healthcare Cost Assumed healthcare cost trend rates also have an impact on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans. Due to changing medical inflation, it is important to understand the effect of a one percent change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates. If we were to assume a one percent increase in healthcare cost trend rates, the effect on the other postretirement benefit obligation and total interest and service cost would be a $12 million and $1 million increase, respectively. If we were to assume a one percent decrease in healthcare trend rates, the effect on the other postretirement benefit obligation and total interest and service cost would be an $11 million and $1 million decrease, respectively. To estimate the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2010, we projected forward the benefit obligations from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010, adjusting for benefit payments, expected growth in the benefit obligations, changes in key assumptions and plan provisions, and any significant changes in the plan demographics that occurred during the year, including (where appropriate) subsidized early retirements, salary changes different from expectations, entrance of new participants, changes in per capita claims cost, Medicare Part D subsidy, and retiree contributions. 76 Table

Table 30 of the MD&A. 3 Prior period amounts have been recalculated in accordance with updated accounting guidance related to earnings per share, that was effective January 1, 2009 and required retrospective application . 4 Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009, SunTrust began recording the provision for unfunded commitments within the provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss). Considering the immateriality of this provision, prior to the fourth quarter of 2009, the provision for unfunded commitments remains classified within other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss). 5 The common dividend payout ratio is not calculable in a period of net loss. 77 Table of Contents FOURTH QUARTER 2010 RESULTS We reported net income available to common shareholders of $114 million for the fourth quarter of 2010, a $430 million improvement over the same period of the prior year. Earnings per average common share was $0.23 for the fourth quarter of 2010, which compares favorably to the net loss of $0.64 per average common share for the fourth quarter of 2009. The fourth quarter of 2010 results were favorably driven by a lower provision for credit losses, resulting from improved credit quality, and solid revenues. Additionally, net charge offs, NPLs, nonperforming assets and early stage delinquencies declined. Average customer deposits grew, and the favorable deposit mix trends experienced throughout 2010 were sustained during the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2010, net interest income FTE was $1.3 billion, an increase of $87 million, or 7%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Net interest income growth was attributable to lower rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds, the continued shift in the deposit mix toward lower cost accounts, and a significant reduction in long term debt. Net interest margin increased 17 basis points to 3.44% in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to 3.27% for the same period of 2009, primarily driven by a 38 basis point decline in rates paid on interest bearing liabilities, which more than offset a 17 basis point decline in earning asset yields. For the fourth quarter of 2010, the provision for credit losses was $512 million compared to $974 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The decline was due to lower net charge offs and improved credit quality. Total noninterest income was $1.0 billion for the fourth quarter of 2010, an increase of $290 million, or 39%, from the fourth quarter of 2009. This increase was primarily driven by higher capital markets and mortgage related income, as well as higher mark to market valuation impacts, partially offset by lower service charges. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, mortgage production related income increased $109 million primarily due to a $135 million decline in the provision for mortgage repurchase losses. The fourth quarter of 2010 results include $85 million in provision for losses related to the potential repurchase of mortgage loans that were previously sold to third parties, down from $220 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009. Mortgage servicing income increased $21 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, as a result of higher net hedge performance. Trading account profits/(losses) and commissions increased $124 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase was largely driven by a $54 million increase in mark to market valuation gains on public debt carried at fair value, net of hedges, an approximate $30 million related to lower valuation losses on previously securitized and sold loans, and the net impact gains on the sale of, and improved market valuations on, assets carried at fair value. Consumer and commercial fee based income in the fourth quarter of 2010 were essentially flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, as strong investment banking income and card fees were offset by lower service charges on deposits as a result of recently enacted regulations. Other income in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a $13 million gain recognized upon the previously announced sale of the money market mutual fund business. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we recorded $64 million of net gains from the sale of securities AFS compared to $73 million of net gains from the sale of securities AFS in the fourth quarter of 2009 that were realized in conjunction with risk management strategies associated with the repositioning of our investment portfolio. Total noninterest expense was $1.5 billion during the fourth quarter of 2010, an increase of $95 million, or 7%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. The expense increase was primarily due to investments that are expected to enhance future revenue generation capabilities. Employee compensation and benefits increased $44 million, or 6%, from the fourth quarter of 2009. This increase was driven by higher salaries, mostly due to the addition of 1,055 full time equivalent employees. Additionally, higher incentive compensation related to improved financial performance in certain business lines contributed to the increase. Outside processing and software expense increased $25 million, or 17%, over the prior year quarter due to increased expenses associated with client acquisition and risk management technology projects and higher transaction volumes. Marketing and customer development expenses increased $8 million, or 17%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, attributable to increases in promotional and advertising spending, as well as supporting our branding and client service initiatives. Credit related costs were $189 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, up $15 million from the fourth quarter of 2009, driven by higher other real estate losses. The fourth quarter of 2010 also included $4 million in net losses on the extinguishment of debt compared to $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 from early termination fees related to FHLB advances repaid, net of gains on the early extinguishment of other long term debt. These advance terminations were part of the initiative we took to take advantage of the strong liquidity position we currently benefit from to repay wholesale funding and continue to improve net interest margin. The income tax provision for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $45 million compared to the income tax benefit of $263 million for the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase in the income tax provision was primarily attributable to pre tax income recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to a pre tax loss in the same period in 2009. 78 Table of Contents BUSINESS SEGMENTS See Note 22, Business Segment Reporting, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our segment structure, basis of presentation and internal management reporting methodologies.

The increase in net income is primarily due to higher net interest income, lower provision for credit losses, and lower expenses due to the recognition of a non cash goodwill impairment charge in the first quarter of 2009. Net interest income was $2.5 billion, an increase of $189 million, or 8%, primarily due to increased loan and deposit spreads as well as higher deposit balances. Average loan balances increased $0.1 billion with increases in indirect auto loans partly due to the purchase of a $741 million high quality consumer auto loan portfolio in the third quarter and $934 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and growth in guaranteed student loans. Additionally, we have seen an increase in organic consumer loan production as consumer spending has modestly increased. Partially offsetting those increases were decreases in home equity lines, residential mortgages, and business banking loans. Loan related net interest income increased $82 million, or 10%, compared to the prior year driven by increased loan spreads. Average deposit balances increased $2.0 billion, or 3% resulting in an increase in deposit related net interest income of $100 million, or 6%, as a result of both the increase in overall average deposit balances and higher deposit spreads. Favorable mix trends continued as relatively low cost demand, NOW, money market and savings balances increased a combined $6.6 billion, or 14%. These increases were partially offset by a $4.6 billion, or 18% decline in average time deposits. 79 Table of Contents Provision for credit losses was $992 million, a decrease of $244 million, or 20%, primarily driven by a $142 million decrease in home equity line net charge offs, a $52 million decrease in indirect installment loan net charge offs, and a $34 million decrease in commercial loan net charge offs. This is the fifth sequential quarter of decreases in net charge offs since a peak in the third quarter of 2009. Total noninterest income was $1.1 billion, down $25 million, or 2%, primarily due to a decrease in service charges on deposits of $77 million, or 12% partially offset by an increase in interchange and ATM card fees which increased a combined $53 million, or 14%.The decline in service charges on deposits was driven by lower NSF/overdraft fees from Regulation E changes requiring clients to opt in to certain account transaction services that went into effect in August of this year and the revised overdraft fee structure that went into effect in July of this year. Total noninterest expense was $2.4 billion, down $98 million, or 4%. The decline was primarily due to a $173 million non cash goodwill impairment charge that was recognized in the first quarter of 2009 and lower personnel costs. Partially offsetting those decreases was a $27 million increase in FDIC expense due to higher account balances a $16 million increase in outside processing cost, as well as an increase in shared corporate expenses primarily in technology and operational areas. Diversified Commercial Banking Diversified Commercial Banking reported net income of $197 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $48 million, or 32%. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in net interest income primarily due to increased loan spreads and higher average deposit balances. Net interest income FTE was $647 million, a $75 million, or 13%, increase. Average loan balances declined $2.0 billion, or 8%, with decreases in commercial, leasing, and commercial real estate loans, partially offset by increases in tax exempt, auto dealer floor plans, and nonaccrual loans. Loan related net interest income increased $41 million, or 11%, compared to the prior year as increased loan spreads more than offset the decrease in average loan balances. Average deposits increased $0.9 billion, or 5%, from the same period in 2009. Favorable trends in deposit mix continued as lower cost commercial demand deposits increased $0.9 billion, or 15%, NOW and money market accounts increased a combined $0.8 billion, or 8%, while higher cost time deposits declined $0.8 billion, or 42%. Deposit related net interest income increased $24 million, or 9%, due to both the increase in deposit balances and a modest increase in overall deposit spreads. Provision for credit losses was $127 million, an increase of $15 million, or 13%. The increase was primarily driven by higher commercial net charge offs, partially offset by a decrease in lease financing net charge offs. Total noninterest income was $226 million, a decrease of $16 million, or 7%. Service charges on deposits decreased $5 million, or 4%, driven by lower commercial deposit analysis fees while letters of credit fees decreased $5 million, or 14%. Additional decreases in deposit sweep fees and lower leasing revenues were partially offset by an increase in loan commitment fees and sales and referral credits. Total noninterest expense was $439 million, down $29 million, or 6%. Allocated operational, support, and overhead expenses decreased $32 million primarily due to a decline in allocated credit and technology costs. Total staff expense also decreased $2 million. Commercial Real Estate CRE reported a net loss of $330 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, compared to the net loss of $584 million for the same period in 2009. The decrease in net loss was primarily related to impairment charges recorded in 2009 partially offset by higher credit related expenses in 2010. Net interest income was $162 million, down $17 million, or 9%. Average loan balances declined $2.7 billion, or 22%, largely due to a $2.1 billion decrease in construction loans as we continue to allow balances in higher risk products to attrite or charge off. Loan related net interest income decreased $24 million, or 14%, as the decrease in average balances more than offset increasing loan spreads. Average customer deposit balances declined $0.3 billion, or 17%, driven by a $248 million, or 32%, decrease in money market accounts. Deposit related net interest income declined $7 million, or 14%, due to the decrease in average balance partially offset by a modest increase in deposit spreads. These decreases in net interest income were partially offset by a $9 million increase in net interest income primarily related to lower funding of other assets due to the goodwill impairment recognized in 2009. 80 Table of Contents Provision for credit losses was $442 million, a $7 million, or 2%, increase over the same period in 2009. The increase was predominantly driven by an increase in construction and investor owned commercial real estate net charge offs. Total noninterest income was $88 million, down $6 million, or 6%. The decrease was primarily due to a $2 million decrease in other income associated with affordable housing and a $2 million decrease in letters of credit fees due to lower borrower demand. Total noninterest expense was $471 million, a decrease of $250 million, or 35%, over the same period in 2009. The decline was primarily due to the $299 million non cash goodwill impairment charge recognized in the first quarter of 2009. Credit related expenses including collections and other real estate expense increased $75 million but were partially offset by a $28 million decline in other expenses largely related to affordable housing impairment recorded in the third quarter of 2009. Corporate and Investment Banking CIBs net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 was $322 million, an increase of $206 million, compared with the same period in 2009. The increase in net income was primarily due to a decrease in provision for credit losses and an increase in total revenue. Net interest income FTE was $380 million, an increase of $76 million, or 25%, from the prior year primarily driven by higher loan and deposit spreads. Average loan balances declined $1.6 billion, or 13%, partly due to the continued reduction in line of credit utilization by large corporate clients. Although revolver utilization was down from the prior year, utilization rates have recently stabilized. The decrease in revolver utilization was partially offset by approximately $1.8 billion of incremental loans as the result of the January 1, 2010 consolidation of Three Pillars, our CP conduit. Loan related net interest income increased $54 million, or 28%, including $33 million of the increase related to the Three Pillars consolidation while higher loan spreads drove the remainder of the increase. Total average customer deposits increased $0.8 billion, or 13%, as NOW and money market account balances increased a combined $1.0 billion, or 26%, while CD balances decreased $0.3 billion or 70%. Customer deposit related net interest income increased $17 million, or 23%, as a result of improved deposit mix and higher NOW and money market spreads. Provision for credit losses was $50 million, as net charge offs declined $198 million, or 80%. Lower net charge offs related to large corporate borrowers operating in economically sensitive industries drove the decline. Total noninterest income was $670 million, an increase of $59 million, or 10%, over the prior year. The increase was driven by higher loan commitment fees, loan syndications and bond originations fees, merger and acquisition fees, and lower reserves on private equity investments.

In addition, derivative revenue, treasury management fees, fixed income sales and trading revenue, and equity offering fees also declined. Total noninterest expense was $490 million, an increase of $9 million, or 2%.

In addition, the change was driven by lower mortgage production income and net interest income offset by higher servicing income and lower staff expense. Net interest income was $427 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, down $72 million, or 14%, primarily due to lower net interest income on LHFS.

The resulting nonaccrual and restructured net interest income increased $20 million, or 28%. Provision for credit losses increased $58 million, or 5%. The increase was primarily due to specific actions taken in the first quarter of 2010 which resulted in additional charge offs recognized on severely delinquent residential mortgage NPLs, primarily in Florida, as well as $51 million in additional charge offs related to the $211 million loans that were reclassified to LHFS and subsequently sold. 81 Table of Contents Total noninterest income was $521 million, down $165 million, or 24%.

Total average assets increased $6.1 billion, or 23%, primarily due to net purchases of investment securities and an increase in other assets due to the prepayment of FDIC assessments. Total average deposits decreased $3.3 billion, or 58%, primarily due to decrease in brokered deposits, as we reduced our reliance on wholesale funding sources in conjunction with solid consumer and commercial deposit growth. Total noninterest income was $307 million, an increase of $104 million, or 51%. Trading gains increased $157 million primarily due to reduced mark to market valuation losses on our debt instruments carried at fair value. Gains on the sale of securities also increased $63 million compared to 2009. These increases were offset by a $112 million gain on Visa Class B shares recorded in the second quarter of 2009. Total noninterest expense decreased $10 million compared to the same period in 2009. The decrease in expense was primarily due to the $78 million FDIC special assessment in 2009.

The decrease was mainly due to the recognition of $183 million in expense related to the contribution of Coke shares to the SunTrust charitable foundation in the third quarter of 2008. The decrease was partially offset by a $79 million increase in FDIC insurance expense primarily due to the special assessment recorded in the second quarter of 2009. While the special assessment was recorded in the Other line of business, the increase in base FDIC premium expenses was recognized within the lines of business. Also 2009 included a $7 million accrual for Visa litigation compared to a $34 million reversal of a portion of the Visa litigation in 2008. 87 Table of Contents Table 32 Reconcilement of Non U.S. GAAP Measures Annual Year Ended December 31 (Dollars in millions, except per share and other data) 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 Net income/(loss) $189 ($1,564 ) $796 $1,634 $2,117 securities (gains)/losses, net of tax (118 ) (61 ) (665 ) (151 ) 32 Net income/(loss) excluding securities (gains)/losses, net of tax 71 (1,625 ) 131 1,483 2,149 Coke stock dividend, net of tax (47 ) (44 ) (50 ) (54 ) (53 ) Net income/(loss) excluding securities (gains)/losses and Coke stock dividend, net of tax 24 (1,669 ) 81 1,429 2,096 Preferred dividends, Series A (7 ) (14 ) (22 ) (30 ) (8 ) U.S. Treasury preferred dividends and accretion of discount (267 ) (266 ) (27 ) Dividends and undistributed earnings allocated to unvested shares (2 ) 17 (6 ) Gain on purchase of Series A prefereed stock 94 Net income/(loss) available to common shareholders excluding securities (gains)/losses and Coke stock dividend ($252 ) ($1,838 ) $26 $1,399 $2,088 Net income/(loss) available to common shareholders ($87 ) ($1,733 ) $741 $1,593 $2,098 Goodwill/intangible impairment charges other than MSRs attributable to common shareholders, after tax 715 27 Net income/(loss) available to common shareholders excluding goodwill/intangible impairment charges other than MSRs, after tax 8 ($87 ) ($1,018 ) $768 $1,593 $2,098 Efficiency ratio 1 67.94 % 79.07 % 63.83 % 63.28 % 59.23 % Impact of excluding amortization/impairment of goodwill/intangible assets other than MSRs (0.58 ) (9.72 ) (1.32 ) (1.17 ) (1.26 ) Tangible efficiency ratio 2 67.36 % 69.35 % 62.51 % 62.11 % 57.97 % Total average assets $172,375 $175,442 $175,848 $177,796 $180,315 Average net unrealized securities gains (2,231 ) (1,612 ) (1,909 ) (2,301 ) (1,620 ) Average assets less net unrealized securities gains $170,144 $173,830 $173,939 $175,495 $178,695 Total average common shareholders equity $17,905 $17,219 $17,646 $17,428 $17,546 Average accumulated other comprehensive income (1,420 ) (692 ) (1,221 ) (1,143 ) (976 ) Total average realized common shareholders equity $16,485 $16,527 $16,425 $16,285 $16,570 Return on average total assets 0.11 % (0.89 ) % 0.45 % 0.92 % 1.17 % Impact of excluding net realized and unrealized securities (gains)/losses and Coke stock dividend (0.10 ) (0.07 ) (0.40 ) (0.11 ) Return on average total assets less net unrealized securities (gains)/losses 3 0.01 % (0.96 ) % 0.05 % 0.81 % 1.17 % Return on average common shareholders equity (0.49 ) % (10.07 ) % 4.20 % 9.14 % 11.95 % Impact of excluding net realized and unrealized securities (gains)/losses and Coke stock dividend (1.04 ) (1.05 ) (4.04 ) (0.62 ) 0.58 Return on average realized common shareholders equity 4 (1.53 ) % (11.12 ) % 0.16 % 8.52 % 12.53 % Total shareholders equity $23,130 $22,531 $22,501 $18,170 $17,932 Goodwill, net of deferred taxes (6,189 ) (6,204 ) (6,941 ) (6,921 ) (6,890 ) Other intangible assets including MSRs, net of deferred taxes (1,545 ) (1,671 ) (978 ) (1,309 ) (1,182 ) MSRs 1,439 1,540 810 1,049 811 Tangible equity 16,835 16,196 15,392 10,989 10,671 Preferred stock (4,942 ) (4,917 ) (5,222 ) (500 ) (500 ) Tangible common equity $11,893 $11,279 $10,170 $10,489 $10,171 Total assets $172,874 $174,165 $189,138 $179,574 $182,162 Goodwill (6,323 ) (6,319 ) (7,044 ) (6,921 ) (6,890 ) Other intangible assets including MSRs (1,571 ) (1,711 ) (1,035 ) (1,363 ) (1,182 ) MSRs 1,439 1,540 810 1,049 811 Tangible assets $166,419 $167,675 $181,869 $172,339 $174,901 Tangible equity to tangible assets 5 10.12 % 9.66 % 8.46 % 6.38 % 6.10 % Tangible book value per common share 6 $23.76 $22.60 $28.69 $30.11 $28.66 Net interest income $4,854 $4,466 $4,620 $4,720 $4,660 Taxable equivalent adjustment 116 123 117 102 88 Net interest income FTE 4,970 4,589 4,737 4,822 4,748 Noninterest income 3,729 3,710 4,473 3,429 3,468 Total revenue FTE 8,699 8,299 9,210 8,251 8,216 securities (gains)/losses, net (191 ) (98 ) (1,073 ) (243 ) 50 Total revenue FTE excluding net securities (gains)/losses 7 $8,508 $8,201 $8,137 $8,008 $8,266 1Computed by dividing noninterest expense by total revenue FTE. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax exempt sources. 2We present a tangible efficiency ratio which excludes the amortization/impairment of goodwill/intangible assets other than MSRs. We believe this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of these intangible asset costs (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare our efficiency to other companies in the industry. This measure is utilized by us to assess our efficiency and that of our lines of business. 3We present a return on average assets less net unrealized gains on securities. The foregoing numbers primarily reflect adjustments to remove the effects of the securities portfolio which includes our ownership of common shares of Coke. We use this information internally to gauge our actual performance in the industry. We believe that the return on average assets less the net unrealized securities gains is more indicative of the our return on assets because it more accurately reflects the return on the assets that are related to our core businesses which are primarily client relationship and client transaction driven. The return on average assets less net unrealized gains on securities is computed by dividing annualized net income/(loss), excluding securities (gains)/losses and the Coke stock dividend, net of tax, by average assets less net unrealized securities (gains)/losses. 4We believe that the return on average realized common shareholders equity is more indicative of our return on equity because the excluded equity relates primarily to the holding of a specific security. The return on average realized common shareholders equity is computed by dividing annualized net income/(loss) available to common shareholders, excluding securities (gains)/losses and Coke stock dividend, net of tax, by average realized common shareholders equity. 5We present a tangible equity to tangible assets ratio that excludes the after tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets. We believe this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare our capital adequacy to other companies in the industry. This measure is used by us to analyze capital adequacy. 6We present a tangible book value per common share that excludes the after tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets and also excludes preferred stock from tangible equity. We believe this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity as well as preferred stock (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare our book value on common stock to other companies in the industry. 7We present total revenue FTE excluding net securities (gains)/losses. We believe noninterest income without net securities (gains)/losses is more indicative of our performance because it isolates income that is primarily client relationship and client transaction driven and is more indicative of normalized operations. 8We present net income/(loss) available to common shareholders that excludes the portion of the impairment charges on goodwill and intangible assets other than MSRs allocated to the common shareholders. We believe this measure is useful to investors, because removing the non cash impairment charge provides a more representative view of normalized operations and the measure also allows better comparability with peers in the industry who also provide a similar presentation when applicable. In addition, we use this measure internally to analyze performance. 88 Table of Contents Table 33 Reconcilement of Non U.S. GAAP Measures Quarterly Three Months Ended (Dollars in millions, except per
