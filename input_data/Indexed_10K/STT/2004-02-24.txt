ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION &gt; RESULTS OF OPERATIONS &gt; SUMMARY BUSINESS SUMMARY State Street Corporation (State Street or the Corporation) is focused on meeting the needs of sophisticated investors worldwide by providing a complete, integrated range of products and services. In 2003, State Street completed the acquisition of a substantial portion of Deutsche Banks Global Securities Services (GSS) business and integrated a major portion of that acquisition into its business; succeeded in continued growth of its primary lines of business, adding new clients and expanding services to existing clients; completed the sale of a non strategic business; and completed an expense reduction program, including a major restructuring of its staffing levels. At December 31, 2003, assets under custody totaled $9.4 trillion and assets under management totaled $1.1 trillion. Excluding the impact of the acquisition, State Street recorded increased revenue in 2003 from its primary fee revenue product lines, servicing fees and management fees; increased its assets under custody by over $1 trillion, or 18%, to $7.3 trillion; and marked a major milestone by exceeding $1 trillion in assets under management, which grew 45% year over year. State Streets employees are focused on providing excellent client service and enhancing total client relationships. State Street experiences a high rate of recurring revenue, continues to generate significant new business from its existing client base, and achieves significant cross selling revenue. This approach contributed to a year over year growth in servicing fees of 10%, and a year over year growth in management fees of 6%. While most of State Streets client services generate servicing or management fees, clients use a variety of other services, including global securities lending and foreign exchange trading and cash management services. State Street remains focused on increasing total revenue. State Street continues to maintain a substantial market share in U.S. pension plans and mutual fund servicing, while continuing to invest in developing businesses and growing its business globally. Investments continue to be made in developing businesses that offer outsourcing of middle and back office services and wealth management services, services for alternative investments such as hedge funds, electronic foreign exchange and equity execution supported by analysis and data analytics, and enhanced index investment management strategies. State Street continually evaluates its business mix and has sharpened its focus by acquiring businesses to support this focus and divesting those businesses that do not support this strategic focus. In the past five years, State Street has divested its Commercial Banking, Trade Banking, Corporate Trust and Private Asset Management businesses, while acquiring several investment servicing and investment management businesses. Most recently, in January 2003, State Street acquired the GSS business, and in July 2002, acquired International Fund Services (IFS), a provider of services for alternative investment portfolios such as hedge funds. The acquisition of the GSS business was transformational for State Street. With this acquisition, State Street gained important strategic benefits, including a broadened geographic presence, an expanded global client base, a leadership position in the high growth European market and economies of scale. Through this acquisition, State Street added approximately $2.1 trillion to assets under custody. State Street also acquired fund administration and depotbank services, and securities lending business. With the addition of the GSS business, State Street became a leading provider of custody and custody related services in Europe. The GSS business serves investment managers, private and public pension funds and insurance companies in 92 geographic markets. Approximately 2,800 former Deutsche Bank staff members around the world became 19 State Street employees. With most GSS clients having selected State Street as their service provider, State Street expects to retain approximately 88% of the available client revenue. To date, State Street has completed over 50% of client conversions, including approximately 66% of the acquired U.S. business, and will be converting substantially all of the remaining U.S. and non U.S. clients in 2004. On January 31, 2003, State Street completed the primary closing of the GSS acquisition, paying a premium of $1.1 billion. Based upon the performance of the acquired business for the period ending on the one year anniversary of the closing, State Street could make additional payments of up to an estimated 360 million, but expects that the actual payout will be less. State Street financed the initial purchase price through issuance of equity, equity related and capital securities to the public, as well as through existing cash resources. Additional payments will be made using existing cash resources. For eleven months of operations, the GSS business accounted for $573 million of revenue and $517 million of expenses. Expenses of the GSS business of $517 million reflect significant cost reductions achieved by State Street in the first year of operation. The financial results of the GSS business include financing costs and amortization expense related to acquired software and intangibles. When combined with financial results from the additional out of scope business obtained from the relationship with Deutsche Asset Management, and excluding related merger and integration costs, the GSS business contributed $.01 to earnings per share in 2003. Merger and integration costs were approximately $103 million in 2003. In the fourth quarter of 2003, State Street sold its Private Asset Management business and recorded a gain of $285 million, net of exit and other associated costs. Also in the fourth quarter, State Street completed the final settlement on escrow funds from the 2002 divestiture of the Corporate Trust business, resulting in an additional $60 million gain on the transaction. In the second quarter of 2003, State Street implemented an operating expense reduction program that resulted in cost savings that exceeded $100 million for the year. The cost savings were achieved through reducing direct controllable expenses and through a voluntary employee separation program, which reduced the Corporations work force by approximately a net 2,000 employees. State Street recorded $296 million in restructuring costs related to this program in 2003. This cost saving program is in addition to savings to be realized from economies of scale from the GSS business once it is fully integrated. In summary, State Streets investment servicing and investment management businesses showed solid growth during 2003. The acquisition of the GSS business added significant revenue and increased State Streets market share, especially in Europe. The divestiture of Private Asset Management and the implementation of the voluntary separation program, which resulted in reduced staffing levels and improved efficiencies, position State Street for the future. These accomplishments were achieved in a challenging interest rate and competitive pricing environment and resulted in earnings per share of $2.15 in 2003. 20 SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL OPERATING RESULTS SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION OPERATING AND BASELINE RESULTS, GSS CONTRIBUTION State Street prepares its Consolidated Statement of Income in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), referred to by State Street as reported results. Reported results for 2003 include all results of operations, including the results of the GSS business, merger and integration costs since acquisition, restructuring costs, the gain on the sale of the Private Asset Management business, the gain on the final settlement of the residual escrow from the 2002 sale of the Corporate Trust business, and two other non operating items. Unless otherwise indicated, financial results discussed in this annual report refer to reported results. In order to provide information on a comparable basis from period to period and assist stockholders, analysts, other external parties and management in analyzing financial results and trends, State Street presents supplemental financial information. This supplemental financial information includes non GAAP measures of performance defined by State Street that are based on reported results adjusted for certain transactions and activities. The Corporation believes that such supplemental non GAAP financial information facilitates an understanding and analysis of State Streets ongoing activities by providing financial information in a format that presents comparable financial trends. One non GAAP measure used by State Street is operating financial results. State Street defines 2003 operating results as reported results, including the results of the GSS business since acquisition, but excluding gains on the sales of the Private Asset Management and Corporate Trust businesses; merger, integration and divestiture costs; restructuring costs; a loss on real estate sold; and the settlement of a Massachusetts tax matter. For 2002, operating results as defined by State Street are reported results, excluding the gain on the sale and the operating results of the divested Corporate Trust business, and restructuring costs. Operating results that appear in the 2002 annual report have been restated to conform to current year presentation. Operating results for 2003 are important as they include the results of the GSS business and reflect the focus of State Streets management on financial results going forward. Operating results for 2003 and 2002 are adjusted for a taxable equivalent presentation, which increases both net interest revenue and tax expense to reflect investment yield on tax free investment income, on an equivalent basis with fully taxable investment income. Another non GAAP measure used by State Street is baseline financial results. State Street defines 2003 baseline results as operating results, excluding the results of the GSS business since acquisition. For 2002, baseline results as defined by State Street are identical to operating results. Comparing baseline results for 2003 to baseline results for 2002 is important as it reflects the growth and activity of State Streets business activities, excluding the acquisition of GSS. In this report, State Street will also reference the GSS contribution. The GSS contribution is defined as the revenue and expenses, including financing costs and amortization of intangibles and software, attributable to the GSS business acquired January 31, 2003, as well as revenue and expenses from out of scope clients gained subsequent to the acquisition due to the relationship with Deutsche Asset Management. Per share amounts reflect the increase in outstanding shares due to the acquisition.

As detailed in the above supplemental financial information, the results for 2003 include $.56 per share for the gain on the sale of the Private Asset Management business and $.12 per share gain for the final settlement of the residual escrow from the 2002 sale of the Corporate Trust business. These items were more than offset by a restructuring charge of $.58 per share, merger, integration and divestiture charges of $.22 per share, additional tax expense of $.04 per share related to the settlement of a Massachusetts tax matter and a loss on certain real estate sold of $.02 per share. Combined, these items resulted in a net $.18 loss per share. The results for 2002 include a gain on the sale of State Streets Corporate Trust business of $.90 per share, as well $.08 earnings per share from the operating results of the divested business, offset by a restructuring charge of $.04 earnings per share. Combined, these 2002 items contributed $.94 to 2002 earnings per share. On an operating basis, excluding the aforementioned non operating items, earnings per share in 2003 were $2.33 compared with $2.16 in 2002, an increase of $.17 per share or 8%. On a baseline basis, excluding the aforementioned non operating items and the GSS contribution, earnings per share in 2003 were $2.32 compared with $2.16 in 2002, an increase of $.16 per share or 7%. EARNINGS PER SHARE (Dollars) NET INCOME Net income for 2003 was $722 million, down $293 million from net income of $1.0 billion in 2002. As detailed in the preceding supplemental financial information and above, reported net income for 2003 included the net after tax impact of non operating transactions and activities that decreased 2003 net income by $61 million. The GSS business contributed $37 million to net income in 2003. Net income for 2002 included non operating transactions and activities that increased 2002 net income by $307 million. On an operating basis, net income in 2003 was $783 million compared with $708 million in 2002, an increase of $75 million or 10%. On a baseline basis, net income in 2003 was $746 million compared with $708 million in 2002, an increase of $38 million, or 5%. GSS CONTRIBUTION After eleven months of operation, the GSS business contributed $37 million to net income. Including dilution from additional shares issued to finance the acquisition, GSS contributed $.01 per share, exceeding State Streets expectation of $.01 $.03 of dilution per share. Total revenue for the GSS business was $573 million: $556 million in fee revenue, $24 million in out of scope client fee revenue, and $14 million of interest revenue, offset by $21 million of interest expense related to the acquisition financing. State Street expects 27 to retain 88% of the available client revenue acquired. Total expenses related to the GSS business, excluding merger and integration costs, were $517 million. Merger and integration costs totaled $103 million, within State Streets estimated range of $90 $110 million. REVENUE The Corporations total revenue in 2003 was $4.7 billion, an increase of $338 million from total revenue of $4.4 billion in 2002. Revenue in 2003 included a net $332 million for gains on the sales of divested businesses, net of the loss on the sale of certain real estate sold. Revenue in 2002 included $589 million for gains on the sales of divested businesses and the operations of the divested business. Total operating revenue in 2003 was $4.5 billion, an increase of $585 million from operating revenue of $3.9 billion in 2002. The GSS business contributed $573 million to this increase. TOTAL REVENUE (Dollars in millions) Total baseline revenue was flat, year over year, at $3.9 billion, up only $12 million from 2002. While total baseline revenue was flat, fluctuations occurred by type of revenue. Growth in servicing and management fees, foreign exchange trading fee revenue and processing fees and other, was largely offset by declines in global securities lending fees and net interest revenue, and lower gains on the sales of available for sale securities. Servicing fees for 2003 of $2.0 billion were up $419 million from 2002. The GSS business contributed $354 million to servicing fees, partially offset by a decrease of $77 million in servicing fees resulting from the divestiture of the Corporate Trust business. On a baseline basis, servicing fees were $1.6 billion, up $142 million from 2002. The increase was attributable to higher equity market valuations and new business from new and existing clients, including business gained through an acquisition in July 2002. Assets under custody were $9.4 trillion, including $2.1 trillion attributable to the GSS business. Management fees of $533 million in 2003 were up $48 million from the prior year, including the GSS contribution of $16 million. On a baseline basis, management fees were up $32 million, reflecting continued new business success and higher average month end equity market valuations. Assets under management were $1.1 trillion, up $343 billion from $763 billion a year ago. Foreign exchange trading revenue was $391 million, compared to $300 million a year ago. The GSS business contributed $61 million in 2003. The remaining increase reflected a higher number of customer trades and higher currency volatility in the currencies in which State Street trades. Processing fees and other was $315 million in 2003, compared with $184 million in 2002. In 2003, processing fees and other included $98 million of fee revenue attributable to the GSS business. Until customers and their related deposits are converted to State Street systems, Deutsche Bank is making payments in consideration of net interest revenue earned from GSS client deposits, recorded in processing fees and other revenue. 28 Net interest revenue in 2003 was $810 million, a decline of $169 million from $979 million in 2002. The current interest rate environment continues to constrain the level of net interest income. For the better part of 2002, State Streets portfolio contained relatively higher yielding assets remaining from prior years. As that portfolio matured and was replaced by lower yielding assets, interest income declined. In 2003, net interest revenue remained constrained by lower reinvestment rates, a flatter yield curve and State Streets proportionately greater investment in floating rate and short term money market securities. In general, sustained lower interest rates and a flat yield curve have an adverse impact on State Street as deposits are invested at lower yields. State Streets ability to increase its balance sheet size to offset the lower yield impact has been limited due to leverage constraints resulting from the GSS acquisition. OPERATING EXPENSES Operating expenses were $3.6 billion in 2003, up $781 million from 2002. Operating expenses in 2003 included $296 million related to the expense reduction program, $110 million in merger, integration and divestiture costs, and the expenses of the GSS business of $517 million. Operating expenses in 2002 included $57 million related to the divested Corporate Trust business and $20 million of restructuring costs. On a baseline basis, total operating expenses in 2003 were $2.7 billion, down $65 million, or 2%, from $2.8 billion in 2002. During 2003, State Street implemented an expense reduction program that reduced direct controllable expenses and salaries and benefits expense through a voluntary separation program, primarily in the United States. State Street was able to reduce its workforce by approximately 2,000 positions as a result of this voluntary separation program. FINANCIAL GOALS State Streets primary financial goal is to achieve sustainable, real growth in operating earnings per share that excludes significant, non operating items. Over the last five years, operating earnings per share increased at a 12% nominal compound annual growth rate. State Street has two supporting financial goals, one for total operating revenue and one for operating return on stockholders equity (ROE). State Streets total operating revenue goal is 12.5% real compound annual growth from 2000 through 2010. Operating ROE was 15.0% in 2003, compared to 16.8% in 2002. The decrease in return on equity using operating net income primarily reflected the effects of additional capital needed to support the GSS acquisition, lower margins on the GSS business during the integration period, and the slowdown of the common stock purchase program, given the capital requirements of the GSS acquisition. State Street reset its ROE goal for 2003 and 2004 as 13 15%, on an operating basis, reflecting the short term impact of the GSS acquisition. Return on stockholders equity calculated from reported net income and consolidated average equity in 2003 was 13.9% compared to 24.1% in 2002. &gt; REVENUE State Street is one of the worlds leading specialists in servicing mutual funds, collective funds and pension plans. The Corporation provides investment management and industry leading technology and information services to support financial strategies and transactions for sophisticated global investors. State Street provides highly reliable, easy to integrate investment services, which are scalable and global. State Streets focus on total client relationships enables clients to control their costs as they develop and launch competitive new investment products. These active, long term relationships with clients result in high client retention, cross selling opportunities and recurring revenue. In general, State Street strives to provide a full range of services, augmenting servicing and management fees with global securities lending revenue. In addition, State Street earns additional revenue from client transaction flows through the management of cash positions, including deposit balances, other short term investment activities, and significant foreign currency transaction volumes, which generate opportunities for additional foreign exchange trading revenue. 29 Net interest revenue was also a significant contributor to State Streets 2003 revenue. Over half of State Streets interest revenue is generated by its investment portfolio, with the remainder from client activity. State Street provides repurchase agreements and deposit services for clients investment activities and, in turn, invests this source of funds in assets yielding a higher rate, generating a margin for State Street. FEE REVENUE Total fee revenue was $3.6 billion in 2003, compared to $2.9 billion in 2002, an increase of $706 million. The primary driver of this increase was the GSS contribution of $580 million, more than offsetting the loss of fee revenue from the divested Corporate Trust business, which contributed $81 million in 2002. On a baseline basis, fee revenue was $3.0 billion, up $220 million, or 8%, from $2.8 billion in 2002, including the full year impact of revenue from IFS, a leading servicer of alternative investments including hedge funds, acquired in July 2002. Servicing and management fees are the largest components of fee revenue. Combined, they comprise approximately 70% of State Streets total fee revenue. Servicing fees increased 10% over 2002 on a baseline basis due to new business and the acquisition of IFS. Management fees increased 6% on a baseline basis on the strength of new business. Servicing and management fees are a function of several factors, including the mix and volume of assets under custody and assets under management, securities positions held, and volume of portfolio transactions, as well as types of products and services used by clients. Servicing and management fees are affected by changes in worldwide equity and fixed income valuations. In general, servicing fees are affected by changes in daily average valuations of assets under custody, and management fees are affected by changes in month end valuations of assets under management. Management fee revenue is more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue. State Street estimates, based on a study, that a 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity values would result in a corresponding change in State Streets total revenue of approximately 2%. If fixed income security values were to increase or decrease by 10%, State Street would anticipate a corresponding change of approximately 1% in its total revenue.

This increase was primarily from servicing fees of the GSS business of $354 million, including additional GSS out of scope client revenue of $24 million, and from the increase in fees from the full year impact of the IFS acquisition. The impact of new business from existing and new clients was offset by the $77 million decrease in servicing fees resulting from the divestiture of the Corporate Trust business. On a baseline basis, servicing fees were $1.6 billion, up $142 million from $1.5 billion in 2002, primarily due to a full year of revenue from IFS and new business from existing and new clients. Servicing fees include fee revenue from U.S. mutual funds, collective funds worldwide, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, foundations, endowments, and other investment pools. Products and services include custody, product and participant level accounting, daily pricing and administration; recordkeeping; and wealth manager and hedge fund services. It also includes master trust, master custody, and performance, risk and compliance analytics. The GSS business provided a range of services that included global and local custody, master trust/master custody, benefit payments, mutual fund administration, master trust accounting, and performance measurement. Outside the United States, services provided also included depotbank services. State Streets Investment Servicing businesses continued to grow outside the United States. Baseline servicing fees derived from clients outside the U.S. were approximately 23%. Including the GSS business, servicing fees derived from clients outside the U.S. were approximately 30%. State Street works with its clients to provide solutions that meet the needs of managers of mutual funds, collective funds, pension and retirement plans and other institutional investors worldwide through offices and a global custodian network that spans more than 100 geographic markets. MARKET PRESENCE State Street is the largest provider of mutual fund custody and accounting services in the United States. State Street provides custody services for 48% of registered U.S. mutual funds. State Street distinguishes itself from other mutual fund service providers because clients make extensive use of a number of related services, including accounting, daily pricing and fund administration. The Corporation provides daily pricing services for over 5,000 mutual funds with a 99.90% accuracy rate for the year ended December 31, 2003. State Street calculates prices for approximately 31% of the U.S. mutual fund prices that appear daily in The Wall Street Journal. With a 36% market share, State Street has a leading position in the market for servicing U.S. tax exempt assets for corporate and public pension funds. Additionally, State Street provides trust and valuation services for over 3,800 daily priced, unitized defined contribution accounts, making State Street a leader in this market. State Street is a leading service provider outside the U.S. as well, providing custody services for 17% of Canadian mutual funds, 24% of collective funds in the United Kingdom, including pension funds, and 30% of off shore funds based in Luxembourg, Dublin and Jersey and Guernsey in the Channel Islands. OPERATIONS OUTSOURCING State Streets services also include operations outsourcing for investment managers and wealth management services. Through these services, State Street provides global asset managers with a comprehensive suite of services, from trade order management through settlement, for their middle and back offices. Services include securities trade order processing, custodian communications for settlements, accounting systems, and networks and information technology development. FOCUS The servicing markets in which State Street competes are very price competitive, and State Street remains focused on winning and retaining client business. This focus requires a strong commitment to clients while constantly working toward providing services at lower unit costs. 31 ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY At year end 2003, total assets under custody were $9.4 trillion, including $2.1 trillion from the GSS business. This compares with $6.2 trillion a year earlier. The value of assets under custody is a broad measure of the relative size of various markets served. Changes in the value of assets under custody do not result in proportional changes in revenue. State Street uses relationship pricing for clients who take advantage of multiple services. Many services are priced on factors other than asset values, including the mix of assets under custody, securities positions held, portfolio transactions, and types of products and services. Assets under custody at December 31 comprised the following: ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY 2003 2002 2001 2000 1999 02 03 AGR 98 03 CAGR (Dollars in billions) As of December 31, CLIENTS IN THE U.S.: Mutual funds $ 3,105 $ 2,719 $ 2,794 $ 2,664 $ 2,769 14 % 8 % Pensions, insurance and other investment pools 3,198 2,734 2,737 2,803 2,669 17 7 Clients outside the U.S. 988 718 672 651 514 38 22 Acquired GSS 2,079 Total $ 9,370 $ 6,171 $ 6,203 $ 6,118 $ 5,952 52 14 MIX OF ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY 2003 Percentage of Total 2002 Percentage of Total (Dollars in billions) As of December 31, Equities $ 3,479 37 % $ 2,738 44 % Fixed income 2,636 28 2,343 38 Short term investments 3,255 35 1,090 18 Total $ 9,370 100 % $ 6,171 100 % Non U.S. securities 12 % 14 % Market value changes, as measured by indices at year end, had a significant impact on the value of assets under custody. At December 31, 2003, the S&P 500T index was up 26% from year end 2002, the NASDAQ&reg; index up 50%, the MSCI&reg; EAFE index up 35%, and the Lehman Brothers Aggregate BondSM index up 4%. [The index names mentioned in this report are service marks of their respective owners.] MANAGEMENT FEES In 2003, management fees were $533 million, up $48 million, from 2002. This increase was primarily due to new business from new and existing clients. Management fees from the GSS business of $16 million partially offset the loss of fees attributable to the divested Private Asset Management business in the fourth quarter of 2003. State Street provides a broad range of investment management strategies, securities lending, specialized investment management advisory services and other financial services for corporations, public funds, high net worth individuals and other sophisticated investors. These services are offered through State Street Global Advisors&reg; (SSgA&reg;), a division of State Street. SSgA is the eighth largest investment manager in the world, based upon assets under management, and the largest manager of assets for tax exempt organizations (primarily pension plans) in the United States. Management fees continued to show strong growth outside the United States. Approximately 12% of new business is with non U.S. clients. 32 SSgA offers a broad array of investment strategies, including passive, enhanced and active management, using quantitative and fundamental methods for both U.S. and global equities and fixed income securities. While certain management fees are directly determined by the value of assets under management and the investment strategy employed, management fees reflect other factors as well, including State Streets relationship pricing for clients who use multiple services and performance related fees. ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT At year end 2003, assets under management were $1.1 trillion, up $343 billion, or 45%, from year end 2002. Securities issued outside of the U.S. were 22% of total securities at year end 2003. Market value changes, as measured by indices at year end, had a significant impact on the value of assets under management. At December 31, 2003, the S&P 500&reg; index was up 26% from year end 2002, the NASDAQ&reg; index up 50%, the MSCI&reg; EAFE index up 35%, and the Lehman Brothers Aggregate BondSMindex up 4%. [The index names mentioned in this report are service marks of their respective owners.] Assets under management comprised the following at December 31: ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT 2003 2002 2001 2000 1999 02 03 AGR 98 03 CAGR (Dollars in billions) As of December 31, EQUITIES: Passive $ 522 $ 361 $ 398 $ 365 $ 366 45 % 17 % Active 78 44 39 44 42 77 18 Employer securities 76 56 76 75 76 36 5 Fixed income 98 74 54 44 39 32 25 Money market 332 228 208 183 144 46 22 Total $ 1,106 $ 763 $ 775 $ 711 $ 667 45 18 GLOBAL SECURITIES LENDING Securities lending provides liquidity to the financial markets and an effective means for clients to earn revenue on existing portfolios. State Street acts as a lending agent by coordinating loans between lenders and borrowers. State Street lends securities and provides liquidity in more than 30 markets around the world. Securities lending revenue, formerly reflected in both servicing fees and management fees, has been separately disclosed in 2003. Borrowers provide collateral in the form of cash or securities to State Street in return for loaned securities. The cash collateral is invested in certain investment vehicles. The return on the investment is split between the borrower, the lender and State Street as agent. For non cash collateral, the borrower pays a fee for the loaned security. The fee is then split between the lender and State Street. Securities lending revenue of $245 million in 2003 increased $19 million from a year earlier. Of this increase, $51 million was attributable to the GSS business. Excluding the GSS business, baseline securities lending revenue was down $32 million to $194 million compared with $226 million in 2002. Securities lending revenue is principally a function of the volume of securities lent and the interest rate spreads earned on the collateral. While securities lending volumes increased in 2003, the impact was more than offset by lower interest rate spreads reflecting the current, low interest rate environment and a flat yield curve under one year. FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRADING State Streets foreign exchange trading revenue continues to benefit from the Corporations exclusive ownership of FX Connect&reg;, the worlds first and leading online multi bank foreign exchange trading platform. FX Connect is delivered over Global Link, a sophisticated multi asset class network, delivering unique research, analytics and optimization technology, order management, trade execution platforms, and 33 confirmation services to investment fund managers in 23 countries. Foreign exchange trading revenue is influenced by three principal factors: the volume and type of client foreign exchange transactions, currency volatility, and the management of currency market risks. In 2003, foreign exchange trading revenue increased $91 million, to $391 million. Of this increase, $61 million is attributable to the GSS business. Excluding the GSS business, baseline foreign exchange trading fees were $330 million, up from $300 million in 2002. In 2003, client spot and forward trading volumes were strong, both in the volume and value of transactions, up 17% from 2002. Currency volatility, as measured by State Streets index of 43 currencies, increased 11% from 2002. BROKERAGE FEES Brokerage fees were $122 million in 2003, compared to $124 million in 2002, which was a record year for State Street. Sustained revenue reflected continuing high equity trading volumes by institutional investors, including commission recapture and transition management services. PROCESSING FEES AND OTHER Processing fees and other revenue includes multiple sources of fees and other revenue, including fees from structured products, fees from software licensing and maintenance, profits and losses from joint ventures, gains and losses on sales of leased equipment and other assets, other trading profits and losses, and amortization of investments in tax advantaged financings. For 2003, processing fees and other revenue also included payments from Deutsche Bank in consideration of revenue earned from GSS client deposits until these clients and their related deposits are converted to State Street; an unrealized gain related to the mark to market on variable share repurchase contracts (SPACESSM) for shares of State Streets common stock; and other than temporary impairment charges resulting from the write down of portfolio investments. Processing fees and other revenue of $315 million was up $131 million from 2002. The GSS contribution to 2003 was $98 million. Baseline processing fees and other revenue was $230 million, up $50 million, or 28%, from $180 million in 2002. This increase includes improved performance of the structured products business and improvement in the revenue from tax advantaged financings. NET INTEREST REVENUE In servicing sophisticated global investors, State Street provides short term funds management, deposit services and repurchase agreements for cash positions associated with clients investing activities. During 2003, the interest rate environment was difficult as interest rates have dropped to the their lowest levels in 42 years. In 2003, the targeted federal funds rate averaged 1.11%, down from 1.67% in 2002. The yield curve remained relatively flat with an average two year treasury rate to federal funds rate spread of 54 basis points, compared to 97 basis points in 2002. NET INTEREST REVENUE 2003 2002 2001 Change 02 03 (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, Interest revenue $ 1,539 $ 1,974 $ 2,855 Interest expense 729 995 1,830 Net interest revenue 810 979 1,025 (17 )% Provision for loan losses (4 ) (10 ) Net interest revenue after provision for loan losses $ 810 $ 975 $ 1,015 (17 ) Net interest revenue was $810 million in 2003, compared to $979 million in 2002, a decrease of $169 million. Lower prevailing yields on assets, as maturing assets were reinvested at the lower market rates during 2003, more than offset lower liability costs. The excess of rates earned over rates paid decreased from 1.26% in 2002 to 1.04% in 2003, on a taxable equivalent basis. 34 Net interest revenue in 2002 benefited significantly from the residual effect of the unusual occurrence of eleven reductions in the U.S. federal funds target rate in 2001. For the better part of 2002, State Streets portfolio contained relatively higher yielding assets remaining from prior years. As those investments matured and were replaced by assets yielding current market rates, interest income declined. State Streets ability to increase its balance sheet size to offset the lower yield impact has been limited due to leverage constraints resulting from the GSS acquisition. GAINS ON THE SALES OF AVAILABLE FOR SALE INVESTMENT SECURITIES, NET Investment portfolio management at State Street has multiple objectives, foremost of which is to generate maximum return within the parameters of modest duration and credit risk and may entail strategic sales of specific securities as market conditions warrant. In addition, the portfolio is structured to provide liquidity and serve as a source of collateral for customer activities. To accomplish this, more than half of the investment portfolio consisted of U.S. Treasury and agency securities, with high quality asset backed and mortgage backed securities making up most of the balance. More than 90% of the investment portfolio was classified as available for sale at December 31, 2003. Securities gains were $23 million in 2003, down from $76 million in 2002. In 2002, State Street sold securities to take advantage of opportunities created by continued declines in market yields on fixed income securities. As of December 31, 2003, State Street had $36.6 billion of available for sale securities with $125 million in unrealized pre tax appreciation. &gt; OPERATING EXPENSES Operating expenses for 2003 were $3.6 billion, an increase of $781 million from 2002. This increase included $517 million of direct operating expenses of the GSS business, a restructuring charge of $296 million, and merger, integration and divestiture costs of $110 million. These increases were partially offset by savings from the expense reduction program in 2003 and the decrease of $57 million in expenses resulting from the 2002 Corporate Trust divestiture. During 2003, State Street implemented an operating expense reduction program that resulted in cost savings that exceeded $100 million for the year. The cost savings were achieved through reducing direct controllable expenses and through a voluntary employee separation program, which reduced the Corporations workforce by more than 2,000 employees. State Street recorded $296 million in restructuring costs related to this program in 2003. This expense reduction program is in addition to savings to be realized from economies of scale from the GSS business once it is fully integrated. Baseline operating expenses were $2.7 billion in 2003, down $65 million, or 2%, from $2.8 billion in 2002, reflecting the impact of the expense reduction program. OPERATING EXPENSES 2003 2002 2001 Change 02 03 (Dollars in millions) YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, Salaries and employee benefits $ 1,731 $ 1,654 $ 1,663 5 % Information systems and communications 551 373 365 48 Transaction processing services 314 246 247 28 Occupancy 300 246 229 22 Merger, integration and divestiture 110 Restructuring 296 20 Other 320 302 393 6 Total operating expenses $ 3,622 $ 2,841 $ 2,897 28 AS OF DECEMBER 31, Number of employees 19,850 19,501 19,753 2 35 Salaries and employee benefits expense increased $77 million in 2003, including the impact of $205 million from the GSS business, partially offset by a reduction in expense of $32 million resulting from the divestiture of Corporate Trust. Excluding the GSS contribution in 2003 and Corporate Trust expenses in 2002, baseline salaries and benefits expense decreased $96 million from $1.6 billion to $1.5 billion. This decrease is a result of the impact of reduced headcount resulting from the voluntary separation program initiated in 2003 and lower incentive compensation. Excluding the staff acquired from GSS, State Street reduced its staffing levels from 19,500 at the end of 2002 to less than 16,700 at the end of December 2003, largely attributable to the voluntary separation program. Over 3,000 employees accepted the voluntary separation program. Approximately 1,000 positions were subsequently replaced. State Street is focused on managing costs to achieve continuous unit cost reductions. Information systems and communications expense was $551 million in 2003, up $178 million from the prior year. The GSS business added $157 million in 2003. Excluding the GSS business, baseline information systems and communications expense was $394 million, up $27 million, or 7% from 2002, reflecting continued investment in core processing capabilities and costs related to International Fund Services, acquired in July 2002. Transaction processing services expense was $314 million, up $68 million from 2002, $55 million of which related to the GSS business. Excluding the GSS business, baseline transaction processing services expense was $259 million compared with $242 million a year ago. These expenses are volume related and include subcustodian fees, external contract services, equity trading services and fees related to securities settlement. The increase resulted from a higher level of investment activity combined with higher net asset values that impact subcustodian fees. Occupancy expense was $300 million, up $54 million from 2002. The GSS business contributed $38 million to occupancy expense. Baseline occupancy expense of $262 million in 2003 was up $22 million, or 10%, reflecting new office space in Boston, Massachusetts and Luxembourg. Merger, integration and divestiture costs in 2003 were $110 million, of which $103 million were merger and integration costs related to the acquisition of the GSS business and the remaining $7 million were divestiture costs related to the divestiture of the Private Asset Management business that was completed on October 31, 2003. Restructuring costs were $296 million in 2003, up from $20 million in 2002. Restructuring costs were predominantly recorded in the second quarter of 2003 and included severance and enhanced benefits for the 3,000 individuals who accepted the voluntary separation program. Restructuring costs of $20 million in 2002 related to an April 2002 staff reduction and have been reclassified from the 2002 annual report presentation for comparative purposes. Other expenses were $320 million, including $62 million of expenses related to the GSS business. Other expenses in 2002 were $302 million, including $9 million from the divested Corporate Trust business. Excluding the GSS business, baseline other expenses were $258 million, down $35 million, or 12%, as a result of continued cost control measures related to the expense reduction program. 36 &gt; INCOME TAXES On a reported basis, State Street recorded tax expense of $390 million for 2003, compared to $540 million a year ago. In the second quarter of 2003, State Street settled a REIT related tax matter with the Massachusetts Department of Revenue. State Streets effective rate for 2003 was 35.1%, including the impact of the REIT tax matter. Excluding the REIT matter, the effective rate was 34.0% compared with 34.7% for 2002. &gt; DIVESTITURES AND ACQUISITIONS In executing its strategic plan, from time to time State Street may enter into business acquisitions and strategic alliances, and may divest non strategic operations. Acquisitions and strategic alliances enhance established capabilities by adding new products, services or technologies, expanding geographic reach, or selectively expanding market share. State Street continuously reviews and assesses various business opportunities related to this strategy. On October 31, 2003, State Street completed the sale of its Private Asset Management business to U.S. Trust. Under the terms of the agreement, the transaction was valued at $365 million, about five percent of which is subject to the successful transition of the business over the subsequent 16 months. The Corporation recorded a pre tax gain of $285 million from the transaction, or $.56 in diluted earnings per share, after providing for $62 million of exit and other associated costs in the fourth quarter. Exit costs associated with the sale primarily consisted of occupancy costs of $23 million and transaction costs of $6 million. Other costs associated with the transaction consisted of incentive compensation for general corporate use of $25 million. Additional divestiture costs to transition the business will be measured at fair value and recognized in the future periods in which the liability is incurred. Divestiture costs of $7 million were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2003. State Street expects additional divestiture costs of $13 million related to this sale. On January 31, 2003, State Street completed the primary closing of its acquisition of a substantial part of the GSS business of Deutsche Bank AG for a premium of $1.1 billion. Separate closings for the acquisitions of business units in Italy and Austria were held on July 1, 2003 and July 31, 2003, respectively, upon receipt of applicable regulatory approvals. The purchase price is subject to adjustments based upon performance of the acquired business for the year following the closing. State Street may make additional payments of up to an estimated 360 million that will be recorded as an adjustment to the goodwill acquired; however, State Street anticipates that the actual payment will be much less. In January 2003, the Corporation issued equity, equity related and capital securities under an existing shelf registration statement. State Street issued $283 million, or 7,153,000 shares of common stock, $345 million, or 1,725,000 units of SPACESSM (see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and $345 million of floating rate, medium term capital securities due 2008 (see Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Proceeds, net of issuance costs, of $595 million from these security issuances were used to partially finance the acquisition of the GSS business . The remainder of the purchase price was financed using existing resources. In connection with the acquisition, approximately 2,800 employees of Deutsche Bank became employees of State Street. State Street expects to reduce this overall workforce, primarily in the United States, by approximately 1,000 employees. State Street incurred $103 million of merger and integration costs for 2003. These one time expenses consisted primarily of costs for employee retention, systems conversion costs and professional services. 37 On December 31, 2002, State Street completed the sale of its Corporate Trust business to U.S. Bank, N.A. The premium received on the sale was $725 million, $75 million of which was placed in escrow pending the successful transition of the business. Exit costs in 2002 associated with the sale totaled approximately $118 million, and other associated costs were $37 million. The after tax gain, net of exit and other associated costs recorded in 2002, totaled approximately $296 million, or $.90 in earnings per share. On December 31, 2003, State Street recorded a $60 million gain, net of associated costs, on the final settlement of the escrow. In July 2002, State Street completed the cash purchase of International Fund Services (IFS), a leading provider of fund accounting and administration as well as securities trade support and operational services for hedge funds, for $80 million. IFS is headquartered in New York City, and has operation centers in New York City and Dublin, Ireland. In connection with this transaction, an additional $47 million of the purchase price was paid and recorded during the year ended December 31, 2003 based upon certain performance measures. In October 2001, State Street completed the cash purchase of the passive equity business of Gartmore Investment Management plc (Gartmore) in the United Kingdom. Under the terms of the agreement, SSgA hired the Gartmore team that manages, services and administers the passive equity business. In June 2001, State Street purchased DST Portfolio Systems, Inc. (DPS) for 1,483,000 shares of State Street common stock and cash in a transaction accounted for as a purchase. Included in the purchase was the Portfolio Accounting System of DPS, an integrated system that automates mutual fund accounting and investment management recordkeeping processes, such as securities pricing and dividend calculations, income and expense accruals, securities inventories, accounting for daily shareholder activity and calculation of daily net asset values. In February 2001, State Street purchased Bel Air Securities LLC and a majority interest in Bel Air Investment Advisors LLC (Bel Air) for 1,007,000 shares (2,015,000 shares restated for the 2001 stock split) of State Street common stock and cash in a transaction accounted for as a purchase. Bel Air is a Los Angeles based investment management firm, focused on providing wealth management services to ultra high net worth individuals. 38 &gt; COMPARISON OF 2002 VERSUS 2001 2002 2001 $ CHANGE % CHANGE (Dollars in millions, except per share data) YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, FEE REVENUE: Servicing fees $ 1,531 $ 1,433 $ 98 7 % Management fees 485 459 26 6 Global securities lending 226 272 (46 ) (17 ) Foreign exchange trading 300 368 (68 ) (18 ) Brokerage fees 124 89 35 39 Processing fees and other 184 148 36 23 Total fee revenue 2,850 2,769 81 3 NET INTEREST REVENUE: Interest revenue 1,974 2,855 (881 ) Interest expense 995 1,830 (835 ) Net interest revenue 979 1,025 (46 ) Provision for loan losses 4 10 (6 ) Net interest revenue after provision for loan losses 975 1,015 (40 ) (4 ) Gains on the sales of available for sale investment securities, net 76 43 33 77 Gain on the sale of the Corporate Trust business, net of exit and other associated costs 495 495 Total revenue 4,396 3,827 569 15 OPERATING EXPENSES: Salaries and employee benefits 1,654 1,663 (9 ) (1 ) Information systems and communications 373 365 8 2 Transaction processing services 246 247 (1 ) Occupancy 246 229 17 7 Restructuring costs 20 20 Other 302 393 (91 ) (23 ) Total operating expenses 2,841 2,897 (56 ) (2 ) Income before income taxes 1,555 930 625 67 Income tax expense 540 302 238 Net income $ 1,015 $ 628 $ 387 62 EARNINGS PER SHARE: Basic $ 3.14 $ 1.94 $ 1.20 62 Diluted 3.10 1.90 1.20 63 Cash dividends declared per share .480 .405 Return on equity 24.1 % 17.3 % AS OF DECEMBER 31, Total Assets $ 85,794 $ 69,850 Long term debt 1,270 1,217 Stockholders equity 4,787 3,845 Closing price per share of common stock 39.00 52.25 Number of employees 19,501 19,753 39 The discussion of 2002 versus 2001 financial results does not reflect the non GAAP measures of operating and baseline results used for a comparison of 2003 to 2002. Rather, the discussion more closely reflects the discussion originally presented in the 2002 annual report. State Streets solid performance in 2002, despite a third consecutive year of declining values in equity markets worldwide and a somewhat flat interest rate environment, resulted from winning added business from new and existing clients, expanding its product offering, and closely managing its expenses. State Streets earnings per share were $3.10 in 2002, up $1.20 from $1.90 in 2001. The results for 2002 include a gain on the sale of the Corporate Trust business of $495 million, equal to $296 million after tax, or $.90 of earnings per share. The results for 2001 included the write off of State Streets total investment in Bridge Information Systems, Inc. (Bridge) of $50 million, equal to $.10 of earnings per share, and the effect of goodwill amortization expense of $38 million, equal to $26 million after tax, or $.08 of earnings per share. Adjusting 2002 results to exclude the gain on the sale of the Corporate Trust business, earnings per share were $2.20. Adjusting 2001 results to exclude the write off of Bridge and goodwill amortization expense, earnings per share were $2.08 for 2001, resulting in an increase in comparable earnings per share of 6%. Net income was $1.0 billion in 2002, up $387 million from net income of $628 million in 2001. Of this increase, $355 million is attributable to non operating items, including the gain on the sale of the Corporate Trust business in 2002, and the after tax write off of Bridge and goodwill amortization expense in 2001. Adjusting these results to reflect ongoing operations without such items, 2002 net income was up $32 million over 2001. The Corporations total revenue was $4.4 billion in 2002, an increase of $569 million from total revenue of $3.8 billion in 2001. Of this increase, $545 million was attributable to non operating items, including the gain on the sale of the Corporate Trust business in 2002, and the write off of Bridge in 2001. Adjusting these results to reflect ongoing operations without such items, 2002 total revenue increased $24 million from 2001. The increase in total revenue of $24 million was driven by growth in servicing and management fees, brokerage fees and gains on the sales of available for sale securities, largely offset by declines in foreign exchange trading and securities lending fee revenue and net interest revenue. Servicing fees for 2002 of $1.5 billion were up $98 million from 2001. New business from existing and new clients, including business gained through an acquisition in July 2002, drove growth in servicing fees, more than offsetting constraints imposed by the decline in comparable average equity market valuations. Assets under custody were $6.2 trillion, down $32 million from 2001, reflecting declines in equity market valuations, largely offset by the installation of new business. Management fees of $485 million in 2002 were up $26 million from the prior year, reflecting continued sales success in 2002, significantly offset by lower equity market valuations. Assets under management were $763 billion, down from $775 billion at year end 2001. Global securities lending revenue was $226 million in 2002 compared to $272 million in 2001, a decline of $46 million. Global securities lending revenue is principally a function of the volume of securities lent and interest rate spreads. While loan volumes increased in 2002, interest rate spreads decreased significantly. Interest rate spreads in 2001 benefited from eleven reductions in the U.S. federal funds target rate. Foreign exchange trading revenue was $300 million in 2002, compared to $368 million in 2001, with the decrease reflecting a lower number of customer trades and lower currency volatility in the currencies in which State Street trades. Brokerage fee revenue was $124 million in 2002, compared to $89 million in 2001, driven primarily by significantly higher equity trading volumes. 40 Processing fees and other revenue was $184 million in 2002, an increase of $36 million over 2001. Processing fees and other revenue in 2001 included the total write down of State Streets investment in Bridge of $50 million. Excluding the impact of the write down, processing fees and other revenue declined $14 million in 2002. Net interest revenue was $979 million in 2002, compared to $1.0 billion in 2001, a decrease of $46 million, or 5%. Lower prevailing yields on assets, as maturing assets were reinvested at the lower market rates during 2002, more than offset growth in the balance sheet and lower liability costs. Net interest revenue in 2001 benefited significantly from the favorable U.S. interest rate environment that resulted from eleven reductions in the U.S. federal funds target rate and a favorable global interest rate environment. The excess of rates earned over rates paid decreased slightly from 1.27% in 2001 to 1.26% in 2002, on a taxable equivalent basis. Securities gains were $76 million in 2002, compared to $43 million in 2001, reflecting opportunities created by continued declines in market yields on fixed income securities. State Streets earnings performance in 2002 was partially attributable to success in reducing expenses. Operating expenses were $2.8 billion in 2002, down $56 million from 2001. Of this decrease, $38 million is attributable to goodwill amortization expense recorded in 2001, but no longer expensed in 2002 in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Adjusting for this accounting change, 2002 total expenses decreased $18 million. The decrease is primarily attributable to efforts by State Street to closely manage expenses, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions. Salaries and employee benefits expense decreased $9 million in 2002. Slightly higher salary and pension expenses for 2002 were more than offset by reduced contract services and lower incentive compensation expense. Information systems and communications expense was $373 million in 2002, up 2% from the prior year. The low level of growth reflects managements prioritization of projects and success in reducing costs. Transaction processing services expense was $246 million in 2002, down $1 million from 2001. These expenses are volume related and include external contract services, subcustodian fees, equity trading services and fees related to securities settlement. Lower mutual fund shareholder activities resulting from both a decline in asset values and lower transaction volumes were largely offset by higher expenses associated with the growth in equity trading transactions. Occupancy expense was $246 million in 2002, up $17 million from 2001. State Street continued to grow globally, with new facilities in Europe and Canada in 2002. Other expenses were $302 million, down $91 million. Of this decrease, $38 million was attributable to goodwill that is no longer amortized. The decrease in other expenses included reduced professional services and advertising and sales promotion in 2002. Income tax expense was $540 million in 2002, up $238 million compared to $302 million in 2001. In 2002, $199 million of tax expense is attributable to tax on the gain on the sale of the Corporate Trust business. In 2001, tax expense was reduced by $17 million for the write off of Bridge. Excluding these non operating items, income tax expense was $341 million in 2002, compared to $319 million in 2001. In 2002, the effective tax rate was 32.1%, excluding the gain on the sale of Corporate Trust business, down slightly from 32.6% in 2001, which excludes the write off of Bridge. 41 &gt; LINES OF BUSINESS State Street reports two lines of business: Investment Servicing and Investment Management. Given the nature of State Streets services and management organization, the results of operations for these lines of business are not necessarily comparable with those of other companies. Revenue and expenses are directly charged or allocated to the lines of business through algorithm based management information systems. State Street prices its products and services on total client relationships and other factors; therefore, revenue may not necessarily reflect market pricing on products within the business lines in the same way as it would for independent business entities. Assets and liabilities are allocated according to rules that support managements strategic and tactical goals. Capital is allocated based on risk weighted assets employed and managements judgment. The capital allocations may not be representative of the capital that might be required if these lines of business were independent business entities. Business Divestiture includes the revenue and expenses of the divested Corporate Trust business for 2002 and 2001. State Street measures its line of business results on an operating basis. As such, the table below includes an Other/One Time category. For 2003, the Other/One Time category includes the gains on the sales of the Private Asset Management and Corporate Trust businesses, the loss on real estate sold, and restructuring and merger, integration and divestiture charges. For 2002, the Other/One Time category includes the gain on the sale of the Corporate Trust business and restructuring charges. For 2001, the write off of State Streets total investment in Bridge of $50 million is included in Other/One Time, as well as goodwill amortization expense, which after December 31, 2001, was no longer expensed in accordance with GAAP. See Note 13 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The following is a summary of the results for lines of business: INVESTMENT SERVICING INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS DIVESTITURE OTHER/ONE TIME TOTAL LINES OF BUSINESS 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, Fee revenue: Servicing fees $ 1,950 $ 1,454 $ 1,359 $ 77 $ 74 $ 1,950 $ 1,531 $ 1,433 Management fees $ 533 $ 485 $ 459 533 485 459 Global securities lending 206 185 215 39 41 57 245 226 272 Foreign exchange trading 391 300 368 391 300 368 Brokerage fees 122 124 89 122 124 89 Processing fees and other 293 147 160 35 33 24 4 14 $ (13 ) $ (50 ) 315 184 148 Total fee revenue 2,962 2,210 2,191 607 559 540 81 88 (13 ) (50 ) 3,556 2,850 2,769 Net interest revenue after provision for loan losses 773 905 916 37 57 76 13 23 810 975 1,015 Gains on the sales of available for sale investment securities, net 23 76 43 23 76 43 Gains on sales of divested businesses, net 345 $ 495 345 495 Total revenue 3,758 3,191 3,150 644 616 616 94 111 332 495 (50 ) 4,734 4,396 3,827 Operating expenses 2,706 2,257 2,281 509 508 516 57 62 406 20 38 3,622 2,841 2,897 Income before income taxes $ 1,052 $ 934 $ 869 $ 135 $ 108 $ 100 $ 37 $ 49 $ (74 ) $ 475 $ (88 ) $ 1,112 $ 1,555 $ 930 Pre tax margin 28 % 29 % 28 % 21 % 18 % 16 % Average assets (billions) $ 80.6 $ 76.6 $ 69.0 $ 2.1 $ 1.9 $ 1.8 $ .6 $ .5 $ 82.7 $ 79.1 $ 71.3 Note: Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year method of presentation. 42 INVESTMENT SERVICING Investment Servicing includes custody, accounting, daily pricing and administration; master trust and master custody; trusteeship and recordkeeping; foreign exchange; securities lending; deposit and short term investment facilities; loans and lease financing; investment manager operations outsourcing and wealth management services; and performance, risk and compliance analytics to support institutional investors. State Street provides shareholder services, which includes mutual fund and collective fund shareholder accounting, through 50% owned affiliates, Boston Financial Data Services, Inc. and the International Financial Data Services group of companies. Total revenue in 2003 increased to $3.8 billion, up $567 million, or 18% from 2002. The GSS business contributed $557 million of revenue to Investment Servicing. Excluding the GSS contribution, growth in servicing fees and foreign exchange trading revenue was largely offset by declines in net interest revenue and lower gains on the sales of available for sale securities. Servicing fees for 2003 of $2.0 billion were up $496 million from 2002. The GSS business contributed $354 million to servicing fees in 2003. The remainder of the increase was attributable to the full year impact of an acquisition in July 2002, and new business from new and existing clients. Growth in securities lending revenue, up $21 million, was attributable to the GSS contribution of $51 million, largely offset by an unfavorable interest rate environment. Foreign exchange trading revenue was up $91 million, $61 million of which was attributable to the GSS business. The remainder of the increase reflects higher currency volatility and a higher number of customer trades. Processing fees and other revenue, up $146 million from 2002, reflected $98 million from the GSS business and improvement in the structured products business and in tax advantaged financings. Servicing fees, foreign exchange trading revenue, brokerage fees and gains on the sales of available for sale securities for the Investment Servicing line of business are identical to the respective total consolidated results. Please refer to the Servicing Fees, Foreign Exchange Trading, Brokerage Fees and Gains on the Sales of Available For Sale Securities captions in the Revenue section of this Financial Review for a more in depth discussion. Processing fees and other revenue and net interest revenue for Investment Servicing are nearly identical to the consolidated information provided under the captions Processing Fees and Other and Net Interest Revenue in the Revenue section of this Financial Review. A small amount of net interest revenue is recorded in the Investment Management line of business. Operating expenses were $2.7 billion in 2003, an increase of $450 million from 2002. The increase in expenses from the GSS business of $517 million was largely offset by decreases in salaries and employee benefits and other expenses as a result of State Streets expense reduction program, including the employee voluntary separation plan. INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT Investment Management offers a broad array of services for managing financial assets, including investment management and investment research, primarily for institutional investors worldwide. These services include passive and active U.S. and non U.S. equity and fixed income strategies, and other related services, such as securities lending. Total revenue in 2003 was $644 million, up $28 million from $616 million in 2002. In 2003, management fees were $533 million, up $48 million, or 10%, from 2002. The GSS business contributed $16 million in 2003 to management fee revenue. Management fees for the Investment Management line of business are identical to the respective total consolidated results. Please refer to the Management Fees caption in the Revenue section of this Financial Review for a more in depth discussion. Securities lending revenue in 2003 was down $2 million from 2002, reflecting the unfavorable interest rate environment. Processing fees and other revenue included profits and losses from joint ventures and other revenue. Operating expenses in 2003 were $509 million, up $1 million from 2002. 43 &gt; FINANCIAL GOALS AND FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT THEM State Streets primary financial goal is sustainable real growth in operating earnings per share. The Corporation has two supporting goals, one for total operating revenue growth and one for operating return on common stockholders equity (ROE). The long term revenue goal is a 12.5% real, or inflation adjusted, compound annual growth rate of revenue from 2000 through 2010. At present, this equates to approximately a 15% nominal compound annual growth rate. The return on stockholders equity goal is 13% 15% for 2004. The company will re evaluate this goal at the end of 2004. State Street considers these to be financial goals, not projections or forward looking statements. However, the discussion in this Financial Review, and in other portions of the Annual Report, may contain statements that are considered forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements may be identified by such forward looking terminology as expect, look, believe, anticipate, may, will, or similar statements or variations of such terms. The Corporations financial goals and such forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties, including the issues and factors listed below and factors further described in conjunction with the forward looking information, which could cause actual results to differ materially. The following issues and factors should be carefully considered. The forward looking statements contained in the Annual Report speak only as of the time the statements were given. The Corporation does not undertake to revise those forward looking statements to reflect events after the date of this report. CROSS BORDER INVESTING Increased cross border investing by clients worldwide benefits State Streets revenue. Future revenue may increase or decrease depending upon the extent of increases or decreases in cross border investments made by clients. Economic and political uncertainties resulting from terrorist attacks, subsequent military actions or other events could result in decreased cross border investment activities. SAVINGS RATE OF INDIVIDUALS State Street generally benefits when individuals invest their savings in mutual funds and other collective funds or in defined contribution plans. Changes in savings rates or investment styles may affect revenue. If there is a decline in the savings rates of individuals, or if there is a change in investment preferences that leads to fewer investments in mutual funds, other collective funds, and defined contribution plans, State Streets revenue may be adversely affected. ASSET VALUES IN WORLDWIDE FINANCIAL MARKETS As asset values in worldwide financial markets increase or decrease, State Streets opportunities to invest and service financial assets may change. Since a portion of the Corporations fees is based on the value of assets under custody and management, fluctuations in the valuation of worldwide securities markets will affect revenue. State Street estimates that a 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity values would result in a corresponding change in State Streets total revenue of approximately 2%. If fixed income security values worldwide were to increase or decrease by 10%, State Street would anticipate a corresponding change of approximately 1% in its total revenue. As asset values increase or decrease due to external credit factors, State Street has exposure related to its own investing activities. The impact of such exposure would be reflected in the Corporations statement of income, statement of condition and statement of changes in stockholders equity. 44 DYNAMICS OF MARKETS SERVED Changes in markets served, including the growth rate of collective funds worldwide, outsourcing decisions, mergers, acquisitions and consolidations among clients and competitors and the pace of debt issuance, can affect revenue. In general, State Street benefits from increases in the volume of financial market transactions serviced. State Street provides services worldwide. Global and regional economic factors and changes or potential changes in laws and regulations affecting the Corporations business including volatile currencies, pace of inflation, changes in monetary policy, changes in domestic and international banking supervisory regulations including capital requirements, and social and political instability could affect results of operations. The terrorist attacks that took place in the United States on September 11, 2001, and subsequent military action and terrorist activities, have caused economic and political uncertainties. These activities and the national and global efforts to combat terrorism, and other military activities and outbreaks of hostilities have affected and may further adversely affect economic growth, and may have other adverse effects on many companies, including State Street, in ways that are not predictable. Financial reporting irregularities involving large and well known companies and regulatory investigations of mutual fund industry practices and behavior may have adverse effects on State Street in ways that are not predictable. State Street is broadly involved with the mutual fund industry, and governmental agencies have sought information from it in connection with investigations relating to that industry. Legislation may cause changes in the competitive environment in which State Street operates, which could include, among other things, broadening the scope of activities of significant competitors, or facilitating consolidation of competitors into stronger entities, or attracting large and well capitalized new competitors into State Streets traditional businesses. Such factors and changes, and the ability of the Corporation to address and adapt to the regulatory and competitive challenges, may affect future results of operations. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is in the process of finalizing the New Basel Capital Accord (Basel II). The U.S. Banking and Thrift regulatory agencies have begun the process of U.S. implementation of Basel II through the joint issuance of an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) and Draft Supervisory Guidance. After obtaining comments on the ANPR and Draft Guidance, the agencies are expected to release proposed rules for comment, and ultimately final rules. The Corporation cannot predict the final form of the Basel II accord or the related U.S. rules and their impact on the Corporation. However, changes to the risk based capital guidelines as proposed may adversely affect the Corporations capital status. ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES Changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States applicable to State Street could have a material impact on the Corporations reported results of operations. While such changes may not have an economic impact on the business of State Street, these changes could affect the attainment of the current measures of the Corporations financial goals. TAX LEGISLATION Changes in tax legislation or the interpretation of existing tax laws worldwide could have a material impact on the Corporations reported results of operations. INTEREST RATES The levels of market interest rates, the shape of the yield curve and the direction and speed of interest rate changes relative to the geographic mix of the Corporations interest bearing assets and liabilities affect net interest revenue and securities lending revenue. In the short term, State Streets net interest revenue and securities lending revenue benefit from falling interest rates and are negatively affected by rising rates because interest bearing liabilities reprice sooner than interest earning assets. In general, sustained lower interest rates and a flat yield curve have a constraining effect on net interest revenue and securities lending revenue growth. Market interest rates also impact the value of certain derivative products whose change in value is reflected in processing fees and other in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 45 LIQUIDITY Any occurrence that may limit the Corporations access to the funds markets, such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers, depositors or counterparties participating in the funds markets in general or with State Street in particular, or a downgrade of State Streets debt rating, may adversely affect State Streets ability to raise capital and, in turn, its liquidity. CAPITAL Under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, State Street and State Street Bank must meet guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off balance sheet items. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could have a direct material effect on State Streets financial condition; failure to maintain the status of well capitalized under the regulatory framework could affect State Streets status as a financial holding company and eligibility for a streamlined review process for acquisition proposals. In addition, failure to maintain the status of well capitalized could affect the confidence of State Streets clients in the Corporation and could adversely affect its business. In addition to being well capitalized, State Street and State Street Bank are subject to guidelines that involve qualitative judgments by regulators about the entities status as well managed and the entities compliance with Community Reinvestment Act obligations. Federal laws and related regulations limit the amount that banks, including State Street Bank, may invest in international subsidiaries. This limitation may affect the pace of future international expansion by State Street Bank through this type of subsidiary. State Street Bank is near this limit; however, available alternatives exist for international expansion by the Corporation and State Street Bank. VOLATILITY OF CURRENCY MARKETS The degree of volatility in foreign exchange rates can affect foreign exchange trading revenue. In general, State Street benefits from currency volatility. Accordingly, foreign exchange revenue is likely to decrease during times of decreased currency volatility. In addition, as State Streets business grows globally, State Streets exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates could impact State Streets level of revenue and expense and net income and the value of State Streets investments in its non U.S. operations. PACE OF PENSION REFORM State Street expects its business to benefit from worldwide pension reform that creates additional pools of assets that use custody and related services, and investment management services. The pace of pension reform and resulting programs, including public and private pension schemes, may affect the pace of revenue growth. If the pace of pension reform and resulting programs, including public and private pension schemes, slows down or if pension reform does not occur, revenue growth may be adversely affected. PRICING/COMPETITION Future prices the Corporation is able to obtain for its products may increase or decrease from current levels depending upon demand for its products, its competitors activities, customer pricing reviews and the introduction of new products into the marketplace. PACE OF NEW BUSINESS; BUSINESS MIX A decline in the pace at which State Street attracts new clients, and the pace at which existing and new clients use additional services and assign additional assets to State Street for management or custody, will adversely affect future results of operations. A decline in the rate at which clients outsource functions such as their internal accounting activities, would also adversely affect results of operations. In addition, changes in business mix and in the source of revenue, including the mix of U.S. and non U.S. business, may affect future results of operations, depending on the economic and competitive conditions of those geographic areas at the time. 46 BUSINESS CONTINUITY State Street has business continuity and disaster recovery plans in place. However, external events, including terrorist or military actions and resulting political and social turmoil, could arise that would cause unforeseen damage to State Streets physical facilities or could cause delays or disruptions to operational functions, including information processing and financial market settlement functions. Additionally, State Streets clients, vendors and counterparties could suffer from such events. Should these events affect State Street, or the clients, vendors or counterparties with which it conducts business, State Streets results of operations could be adversely affected. RATE OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE Technological change often creates opportunities for product differentiation and reduced costs, as well as the possibility of increased expenses. Developments in the securities processing industry, including shortened settlement cycles and straight through processing, will result in changes to existing procedures. Alternative delivery systems have emerged, including the widespread use of the Internet. State Streets financial performance depends in part on its ability to develop and market new and innovative services, and to adopt or develop new technologies that differentiate State Streets products or provide cost efficiencies. The risks inherent in this process include rapid technological change in the industry, the Corporations ability to access technical and other information from clients, and the significant and ongoing investments required to bring new services to market in a timely fashion at competitive prices. A further risk is the introduction by competitors of services that could replace or provide lower cost alternatives to State Street services. State Street uses trademark, trade secret, copyright and other proprietary rights procedures to protect its technology, and has applied for a limited number of patents in connection with certain software programs. Despite these efforts, State Street cannot be certain that the steps taken by it to prevent unauthorized use of proprietary rights are sufficient to prevent misappropriation of technology, particularly outside the United States where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. In addition, no assurance can be given that the courts will adequately enforce contractual agreements that State Street has entered into to protect its proprietary technology. If any of its proprietary information were misappropriated by or otherwise disclosed to its competitors, State Streets competitive position could be adversely affected. In the event a third party asserts a claim of infringement of its proprietary rights, obtained through patents or otherwise, against the Corporation, State Street may be required to spend significant resources to defend against such claims, develop a non infringing program or process, or obtain a license to the infringed process. ACQUISITIONS, ALLIANCES AND DIVESTITURES Acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies and development of strategic alliances and divestitures of portions of its business are an active part of State Streets overall business strategy. The Corporation has completed several acquisitions, alliances and divestitures in recent years. However, there can be no assurance that services, technologies, key personnel or businesses of acquired companies will be effectively assimilated into State Streets business or service offerings or that alliances will be successful. In addition, State Street may not be able to successfully complete any divestiture on satisfactory terms, if at all, and divestitures may result in a reduction of total revenue and net income. 47 &gt; FINANCIAL CONDITION &gt; BALANCE SHEET State Street provides deposit and other balance sheet services to its institutional investor clients. In executing their worldwide cash management activities, State Streets clients use short term investments and deposit accounts that constitute the majority of State Streets liabilities. These client investment activities affect the Corporations approach to managing interest rate sensitivity, liquidity and credit risk. 1&gt; 76.5% Customer funds with interest 2&gt; 8.9% Customer funds without interest 3&gt; 8.5% Long term debt and equity 4&gt; 6.1% Other noninterest bearing AVERAGE LIABILITIES AND EQUITY LIABILITIES State Street uses its balance sheet capacity to support clients transactions and short term investment strategies. State Streets objectives and clients needs determine the volume, mix and currencies of the liabilities. Average interest bearing liabilities decreased $310 million in 2003; however, this was more than offset by a $1.2 billion increase in noninterest bearing client deposits. Clients use noninterest bearing deposit accounts for transaction settlements and as compensation to State Street for services. ASSETS State Streets assets consist primarily of short term money market assets and investment securities, which are generally more liquid than other types of assets. Investment securities, principally classified as available for sale, include U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities, highly rated municipal securities, asset backed securities, money market mutual funds and non U.S. government bonds. Money market assets include securities purchased under resale agreements, securities borrowed, federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits with banks that are short term, multicurrency instruments invested with major multinational banks. Refer to Note 3 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for detail regarding available for sale investment securities, including the determination of when unrealized losses are considered other than temporary. 1&gt; 82.3% Money market assets and investment securities 2&gt; 9.1% Other assets 3&gt; 6.7% Loans 4&gt; 1.9% Cash AVERAGE ASSETS 48 Average interest earning assets increased $327 million, less than 1%, in 2003. Other assets increased year over year due to increases in goodwill and intangibles from the GSS acquisition. Total investment securities increased $9.9 billion, or 47%, from 2002, primarily due to investments in short term U.S. Treasuries and U.S. federal agencies. This increase was largely offset by declines of securities purchased under resale agreements of $7.9 billion from 2002, and interest bearing deposits with banks of $1.8 billion. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The short duration of State Streets assets and liabilities results in the fair value of its financial instruments equating to or closely approximating their balance sheet value. See Note 24 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Further quantitative information on State Streets assets and liabilities is furnished in Notes 3 through 9 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. &gt; LIQUIDITY, CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS, AND CAPITAL LIQUIDITY The primary objective of State Streets liquidity management is to ensure that the Corporation has sufficient funds to meet its commitments and business needs, including accommodating the transaction and cash management requirements of its clients. Liquidity is provided by State Streets access to global debt markets, its ability to gather additional deposits from its clients, maturing short term assets, sales of securities and repayment of clients loans. Client deposits and other funds provide multi currency, geographically diverse sources of liquidity. State Street maintains a large portfolio of liquid assets, defined as cash and due from banks, interest bearing deposits with banks, securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed, federal funds sold, trading account assets and investment securities. As of December 31, 2003, the Corporations defined liquid assets were $73.3 billion or 84% of total assets, a significant portion of which can be sold on the open market to meet liquidity needs. Securities carried at $13.3 billion and $10.3 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, were designated as pledged securities for public and trust deposits, borrowed funds and for other purposes as provided by law. At December 31, 2003, State Street had defined short term liabilities of $72.8 billion. State Street had $125 million in net unrealized gains on available for sale investment securities at December 31, 2003, on a pre tax basis, reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income in equity as $74 million, after tax. State Street Bank can issue bank notes with an aggregate limit of $750 million and with original maturities ranging from 14 days to five years. At December 31, 2003, no notes payable were outstanding and all $750 million was available for issuance. State Street can issue commercial paper with an aggregate limit of $1.0 billion and with original maturities of up to 270 days from the date of issue. At December 31, 2003, State Street had $981 million of commercial paper outstanding. State Street maintains a universal shelf registration statement that allows for the offering and sale of unsecured debt securities, capital securities, common stock, depositary shares and preferred stock, and warrants to purchase such securities, including any shares into which the preferred stock and depositary shares may be convertible, or any combination thereof. At December 31, 2002, $1.5 billion of the shelf registration was available for issuance. In January 2003, in connection with its acquisition of the GSS business, State Street issued $345 million of floating rate, medium term capital securities due 2008. In addition, State Street issued $283 million, or 7,153,000 shares of common stock, and $345 million, or 1,725,000 units of SPACESSM. At December 31, 2003, $469 million of State Streets shelf registration statement was available for issuance. 49 In September 2003, State Street Bank authorized $1 billion and issued $400 million of 5.25% Subordinated Bank Notes due 2018 (the Notes). The Notes bear an interest rate of 5.25% per annum, and State Street Bank is required to make semi annual interest payments on the outstanding principal balance of the Notes on April 15 and October 15 of each year. The Notes qualify as Tier 2 capital for bank regulatory purposes. In connection with this offering, State Street Bank executed fair value swaps with a notional value of $400 million to, in effect, convert the Notes from fixed rate to variable rate. At December 31, 2003, $290 million was included in long term debt that related to the capital lease for One Lincoln Street, a new office building located in Boston, Massachusetts that State Street began to occupy in 2003. State Street endeavors to maintain high investment grade ratings on its debt, as measured by independent credit rating agencies. High ratings on debt minimize borrowing costs and enhance State Streets liquidity by ensuring the largest possible market for the Corporations debt. State Streets senior debt is rated AA by Standard & Poors, Aa3 by Moodys Investors Service and AA by Fitch, Inc. State Street Banks long term deposits are rated AA by Standard & Poors, Aa2 by Moodys Investors Service and AA by Fitch, Inc. With the exception of the Fitch, Inc. rating on long term deposits, which was rated AA+ in 2002, there have been no changes in State Streets ratings. The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows provides additional liquidity information.

Interest payments were calculated at the stated rate, with the exception of floating rate debt for which payments were calculated using the indexed rate in effect at December 31, 2003. TENURE OF COMMITMENT OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS Total amounts committed (1) Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years Over 5 years (Dollars in millions) As of December 31, 2003 Liquidity asset purchase agreements $ 16,135 $ 14,066 $ 1,336 $ 675 $ 58 Loan commitments 12,190 10,672 1,207 300 11 Standby letters of credit 4,018 1,538 2,058 187 235 Total commercial commitments $ 32,343 $ 26,276 $ 4,601 $ 1,162 $ 304 (1) Amounts committed are reported net of participations. Loan commitments (unfunded loans and unused lines of credit), liquidity asset purchase agreements and standby letters of credit are issued to accommodate the financing needs of State Streets clients and to provide liquidity and credit enhancements to variable interest entities. Loan commitments are agreements by State Street to lend monies at a future date. Liquidity asset purchase agreements are commitments to purchase receivables or securities, subject to conditions established in the agreements. 50 These loan, liquidity asset purchase and letter of credit commitments are subject to the same credit policies and reviews as loans. Approximately 86% of the loan commitments and asset purchase agreements expire within one year from the date of issue. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire or renew without being drawn, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. CAPITAL State Streets objective is to maintain a strong capital base in order to provide financial flexibility for its business needs, including funding corporate growth and supporting clients cash management needs. As a state chartered bank and member of the Federal Reserve System, State Street Bank, State Streets principal subsidiary, is primarily regulated by the Federal Reserve Board, which has established guidelines for minimum capital ratios. State Street has developed internal capital adequacy policies to ensure that State Street Bank meets or exceeds the level required for the well capitalized category, the highest of the Federal Reserve Boards five capital categories. State Street Bank must meet the regulatory designation of well capitalized in order for State Street to maintain its status as a financial holding company. State Streets capital management emphasizes risk exposure rather than asset levels. At December 31, 2003, the Corporations Tier 1 and total risk based capital ratios were 14.0% and 15.8%, respectively, down from 17.1% and 18.0% at year end 2002. Tier 1 and total risk based capital were negatively impacted by the increase in goodwill and intangibles from the GSS acquisition, and the restructuring charges recorded in 2003. However, Tier 1 and total risk based capital benefited from the issuance of 7,125,000 shares of common stock and from the issuance of $345 million of capital securities that qualify as Tier 1 capital. In addition, total risk based capital benefited by the issuance of $400 million of subordinated notes that qualified as Tier 2 capital. Increases in outstanding off balance sheet indemnified securities lending transactions, resulting from new clients obtained from the GSS acquisition, drove the increase in risk weighted assets from year end 2002. At December 31, 2003, State Street Banks Tier 1 and total risk based capital ratios were 12.4% and 13.7%, respectively, down from 16.4% and 16.5% at year end 2002. Tier 1 and total risk based capital were negatively impacted by the increase in goodwill and intangibles from the GSS acquisition and the restructuring charges recorded in 2003; however, total risk based capital benefited from the issuance by State Street Bank of $400 million of subordinated notes that qualified as Tier 2 capital. Increases in outstanding off balance sheet indemnified securities lending transactions drove the increase in risk weighted assets from year end 2002. At December 31, 2003, and December 31, 2002, both ratios for State Street and State Street Bank exceed the regulatory minimum of 4% and the well capitalized threshold of 6% for the Tier 1 capital ratio, and the minimum of 8% and well capitalized threshold of 10% for the total risk based capital ratio. State Street and State Street Bank had Tier 1 leverage ratios of 5.6% and 5.4%, respectively, at December 31, 2003, exceeding the regulatory minimum of 3% and the well capitalized threshold of 5%. See Note 12 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. State Streets Board of Directors has authorized the purchase of State Street common stock for use in employee benefit programs and for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2003, 8,320,000 shares may be purchased under the stock purchase program. State Street employs a third party broker dealer to acquire shares for the stock purchase program on the open market. 51 MARKET PRICE DIVIDENDS AND COMMON STOCK Dividends Declared Low High End of Quarter 2002: First Quarter $ .11 $ 48.12 $ 58.36 $ 55.38 Second Quarter .12 41.25 55.68 44.70 Third Quarter .12 34.85 45.19 38.64 Fourth Quarter .13 32.11 47.47 39.00 2003: First Quarter $ .13 $ 30.98 $ 41.80 $ 31.63 Second Quarter .14 30.37 41.71 39.40 Third Quarter .14 38.65 48.51 45.00 Fourth Quarter .15 45.08 53.63 52.08 State Street has increased its quarterly dividend twice each year since 1978. Over the last ten years, dividends per share have grown at a 16% compound annual growth rate. At December 31, 2003, State Street Bank had $1.9 billion of retained earnings available for distribution to State Street in the form of dividends. DIVIDENDS PER SHARE (Dollars) There were 5,273 stockholders of record of common stock as of December 31, 2003. &gt; RISK MANAGEMENT In providing services for institutional investors globally, State Street must manage and control certain inherent risks. These risks include credit risk, operational risk and market risk. Risk management is fundamentally the responsibility of the business areas and thus, is an integral component of State Streets business activities. A dedicated corporate group, Enterprise Risk Management, provides risk management support, coordination and oversight across the Corporation. State Street has a comprehensive and disciplined approach to risk management. The Board of Directors provides extensive review and oversight of the Corporations overall risk management process. Senior Management is responsible for policy formulation, implementation of policies approved by the Board of Directors, and for day to day risk management. Enterprise Risk Management has the responsibility for overseeing the Corporations enterprise wide risk management policies and procedures and modifying its structure as necessary to address the increasingly complex structure of the business. Management of the business areas is responsible for managing risk in their core activities. Executive management committees, such as the Major Risk Committee and Financial Policy Committee, are dedicated to the review of business activities with significant risk content. In addition, corporate committees, such as the Investment Committee, Fiduciary Review Committee and the Corporate Compliance Committee, focus on risk topics across the 52 Corporation, and business level committees, such as the Securities Finance Risk Management Committee, provide focused business area risk management review and oversight. The risk management program is complemented by Corporate Audit whose role is to provide the Board of Directors and management with continuous monitoring and control assessments to ensure adherence to the Corporations policies and procedures and effectiveness of its system of internal controls. Additionally, the internal control environment is evaluated through external examinations and regulatory compliance efforts, including Statement on Auditing Standards 70, which is applicable to service organizations, the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991, and the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. While State Street believes its risk management program is effective in managing the risks of its business, the effectiveness of its policies and procedures for managing risk exposure can never be fully assured. For example, a material counterparty failure or a material default of an obligor could have an adverse effect on the results of operations of the Corporation. CREDIT RISK Credit and counterparty risk results from the possibility that a loss may occur if a borrower or counterparty becomes unable to meet the terms of a contract. State Street has robust guidelines and procedures to monitor and manage all aspects of credit and counterparty risk, which incorporate risk elements including concentration risk, country risk, liquidity and settlement risk. The comprehensive credit approval and review process involves the assignment of risk ratings to all loans and off balance sheet credit exposures. Rigorous processes for credit approval cover traditional credit facilities, foreign exchange, placements, liquidity and credit enhancement services, securities lending and securities clearing facilities. OPERATIONAL RISK Operational risk is the potential for loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events. State Street is the worlds leading provider of services to institutional investors. The Corporations clients have a broad array of complex and specialized servicing and fiduciary requirements; therefore, oversight of operational risk is an integral part of the management process throughout the Corporation. State Streets internal control environment is designed to provide a sound operational environment. The Corporations operational risk management discipline provides the structure to identify, evaluate, control, monitor, measure, mitigate and report operational risk. MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk of adverse financial impact due to changes in market prices, such as interest rates and foreign exchange rates. State Street engages in trading and investment activities to serve clients investment and trading needs and to contribute to overall corporate earnings and liquidity. In the conduct of these activities, the Corporation is subject to, and assumes, market risk. The level of risk State Street assumes is a function of the Corporations overall objectives and liquidity needs, client requirements, and market volatility. State Street manages its overall market risk through a comprehensive risk management framework. This structure includes a market risk management group that reports independently to senior management. Market risk from foreign exchange and trading activities is controlled through established limits on aggregate and net open positions, sensitivity to changes in interest rates, and concentrations. These limits are supplemented by stop loss thresholds. The Corporation uses a variety of risk management tools and techniques, including value at risk, to measure, monitor and control market risk. All limits and measurement techniques are reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a regular basis by business managers, the market risk management group and the Investment Committee. 53 State Street uses foreign exchange contracts and a variety of financial derivative instruments to support clients needs, conduct trading activities, and manage its interest rate and currency risk. These activities are designed to create trading revenue or hedge net interest revenue. In addition, the Corporation provides services related to derivative instruments in its role as both a manager and servicer of financial assets. State Streets clients use derivatives to manage the financial risks associated with their investment goals and business activities. With the growth of cross border investing, clients have an increasing need for foreign exchange forward contracts to convert currency for international investment and to manage the currency risk in international investment portfolios. As an active participant in the foreign exchange markets, State Street provides foreign exchange forward contracts and over the counter options in support of these client needs. &gt; TRADING ACTIVITIES: FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY As part of its trading activities, the Corporation assumes positions in both the foreign exchange and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and using financial derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange and interest rate options, and interest rate swaps. As of December 31, 2003, the notional amounts of these derivative instruments were $370.5 billion, of which $322.1 billion were foreign exchange forward contracts. Long and short foreign exchange forward positions are closely matched to minimize currency and interest rate risk. All foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at current market rates. The Corporation uses a variety of risk measurement and estimation techniques, including value at risk. Value at risk is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical confidence interval. State Street uses a risk management system to estimate value at risk daily for all material trading positions. The Corporation has adopted standards for estimating value at risk, and maintains capital for market risk, in accordance with the Federal Reserves Capital Adequacy Guidelines for market risk. Value at risk is estimated for a 99% one tail confidence interval and an assumed one day holding period using a historical observation period of greater than one year. A 99% one tail confidence interval implies that daily trading losses should not exceed the estimated value at risk more than 1% of the time, or approximately three days out of the year. The methodology uses a simulation approach based on observed changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates and takes into account the resulting diversification benefits provided from the mix of the Corporations trading positions. Like all quantitative risk measures, value at risk is subject to certain limitations and assumptions inherent to the methodology. State Streets methodology gives equal weight to all market rate observations regardless of how recently the market rates were observed. The estimate is calculated using static portfolios consisting of positions held at the end of the trading day. Implicit in the estimate is the assumption that no intraday action is taken by management during adverse market movements. As a result, the methodology does not represent risk associated with intraday changes in positions or intraday price volatility. The following table presents State Streets market risk for its trading activities as measured by its value at risk methodology: VALUE AT RISK Average Maximum Minimum (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2003: Foreign exchange products $ 1.1 $ 2.9 $ .4 Interest rate products 1.8 2.8 1.2 2002: Foreign exchange products $ 1.0 $ 2.5 $ .4 Interest rate products 2.8 4.3 1.3 54 State Street compares actual daily profit and losses from trading activities to estimated one day value at risk. During 2003 and 2002, State Street did not experience any trading losses in excess of its end of day value at risk estimate. &gt; NON TRADING ACTIVITIES: CURRENCY RISK State Street had $24.4 billion of non U.S. dollar denominated non trading assets as of December 31, 2003, which were funded by non U.S. dollar denominated deposits. State Streets non U.S. dollar denominated non trading assets included 53 currencies. Approximately 97% of these assets were in eight major currencies. Since non trading assets are generally invested in the same currency in which the initial deposits are received, the risk associated with changes to currency exchange rates is minimal. To the extent that deposits are not reinvested in the same currency, the resulting net currency positions are managed as part of trading risk as discussed above. In general, the maturities of these non trading assets and liabilities are short term. To the extent duration mismatches exist, they are managed as part of State Streets consolidated asset/liability management activities, and the related market risk is included in the following non trading interest rate sensitivity disclosure. &gt; NON TRADING ACTIVITIES: INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY The objective of interest rate sensitivity management is to provide sustainable net interest revenue under various economic environments and to protect asset values from adverse effects of changes in interest rates. State Street manages the structure of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities by adjusting the mix, yields and maturity or repricing characteristics based on market conditions. Since interest bearing sources of funds are predominantly short term, State Street maintains a generally short term structure for its interest earning assets, including money market assets, investments and loans. Interest rate swaps are used minimally as part of overall asset and liability management to augment State Streets management of interest rate exposure. State Street uses three tools for measuring interest rate risk: simulation, duration and gap analysis. Key assumptions in the simulation, duration and gap models include the timing of cash flows, maturity and repricing of financial instruments, changes in market conditions, capital planning, and deposit sensitivity. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and as a result, the models cannot precisely calculate net interest revenue or precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue and economic value. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies, among other factors. Simulation models facilitate the evaluation of the potential range of net interest revenue under a most likely scenario, alternative interest rate scenarios and rate shock tests. Based upon results of the simulation model as of December 31, 2003, there would be a decrease in net interest revenue of $97 million over the following 12 months for an immediate 100 basis point increase in all global interest rates. If interest rates immediately decreased by 100 basis points, the model shows an increase in net interest revenue of less than $53 million over the following 12 months. Duration measures the change in the economic value of assets and liabilities for given changes in interest rates. Based upon the results of the duration model as of December 31, 2003, there would be a decrease in the economic value of assets, net of liabilities, of $379 million, or .44% of assets, as a result of an immediate increase in all global interest rates of 100 basis points. In the event of an immediate decrease of 100 basis points to interest rates, the model shows an increase of $321 million, or .37% of assets, to the economic value of assets, net of liabilities. The third measure of interest rate risk, gap analysis, is the difference in asset and liability repricing on a cumulative basis within a specified time period. As of year end 2003, interest bearing liabilities will reprice faster than interest earning assets over the next 12 months, as has been typical for State Street. If all other 55 variables remained constant, in the short term, falling interest rates would lead to net interest revenue that is higher than it would otherwise have been. Rising rates would lead to lower net interest revenue. Other important determinants of net interest revenue are balance sheet size and mix, interest rate spreads, the slope of the yield curve, and rate levels. Measures of interest rate sensitivity are monitored by the respective business units and the Investment and Financial Policy Committees. &gt; OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT RISK Assets under custody and assets under management are held in a fiduciary or custodial capacity for State Streets clients and are not recorded on the Corporations balance sheet in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Similarly, collateral funds resulting from State Streets securities lending services are held by State Street as agent; therefore, these assets are not consolidated in the Corporations Consolidated Statement of Condition. State Street sells and distributes securities for two types of off balance sheet entities that are not included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation. One type, special purposes entities (SPEs), as defined by FIN 46 (revised), which State Street has administered since 1992, issues asset backed commercial paper (ABCP) that is rated P 1 by Moodys Investors Service and or A 1 or better by Standard & Poors. State Street and unrelated dealers sell and distribute the commercial paper issued by the SPEs. The commercial paper represents debt issued by the SPEs. The assets of these SPEs include investment securities and purchased receivables that back the commercial paper. Such assets are transferred to the SPEs by unrelated third parties. State Street provides liquidity and credit enhancement facilities in the forms of liquidity asset purchase agreements, lines of credit, and standby letters of credit to the SPEs. At December 31, 2003, State Streets commitments under liquidity asset purchase agreements and lines of credit to these SPEs were $11.9 billion, and standby letters of credit were $644 million. During the year ended December 31, 2003, $50 million was drawn under a liquidity asset purchase agreement. Amounts committed, but unused, under the liquidity asset purchase agreements, lines of credit, and standby letters of credit that State Street provides to these SPEs are included in the disclosures in Note 23 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Asset performance deterioration may cause the asset risk to shift from the ABCP investors to State Street as the credit enhancement provider for the asset as the SPE may need to repay maturing commercial paper by drawing the liquidity facilities. Fee revenue for administration, liquidity facilities and credit enhancements was $49 million in 2003 and $41 million in 2002. At December 31, 2003, these ABCP programs had total commercial paper outstanding of $12.2 billion. FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46) impacted the program. State Street applied an expected loss model to determine the primary beneficiary of the VIEs. Variable interests factored in to the model include basis risk, credit risk, interest risk and fees to the Administrator. The results of the model required State Street to modify the VIEs by selling certain fixed rate assets and related interest rate swaps, and issuing subordinated notes to outside investors in an amount large enough to absorb the majority of the respective VIEs expected losses, as defined in FIN 46. State Street holds no equity ownership interest in these VIEs, which are structured as bankruptcy remote corporations. These changes clarify the fact that State Street is not the primary beneficiary, as defined in FIN 46, and as such does not consolidate the VIEs. For a second type of off balance sheet entity, structured as qualified special purpose entities (QSPEs) in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, State Street distributes and sells to mutual fund clients equity interests in tax exempt investment grade assets. For these QSPEs, State Street transfers the assets from its investment portfolio at fair market value. Such transfers are treated as sales. For the years ended 2003 and 2002 State Street sold $393 million and $33 million of investment securities, respectively, to the QSPEs. The QSPEs finance the acquisition of these assets by selling equity 56 interests to third party investors. State Street owns a minority residual interest in these QSPEs of less than 6%, or $76 million. As of December 31, 2003, these trusts have a weighted average life of approximately 5.5 years. In a separate agreement, State Street provides liquidity asset purchase agreements to these entities. These liquidity asset purchase agreements obligate State Street to buy the equity interests in the underlying portfolio at par value, which approximates market value, in the event that the re marketing agent is unable to place the equity interests of the QSPE with investors. The liquidity asset purchase agreements are subject to early termination by State Street in the event of payment default, bankruptcy of issuer or credit enhancement provider, taxability, or downgrade of an asset below investment grade. Fee revenue for administrative services, liquidity asset purchase agreements and residual interest earnings totaled $38 million in 2003, before tax benefit. In connection with State Streets balance sheet management activities, the Corporation incurred $32 million of interest expense on interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges against the minority residual interest of the QSPEs. As of December 31, 2003, these QSPEs had total assets of $1.3 billion in a tax exempt market estimated between $70 $80 billion. State Streets liquidity asset purchase agreements to these QSPEs were $1.2 billion at December 31, 2003, none of which were utilized, and are included in the disclosures in Note 23 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2003, State Street acquired and transferred approximately $1.5 billion of investment securities out of its available for sale portfolio at fair market value in exchange for cash to an off balance sheet entity structured as a QSPE. These transfers were treated as sales. State Street provides investment management services to this unaffiliated QSPE. The risks associated with providing administration, liquidity, and or credit enhancements to both types of off balance sheet entities are reviewed as part of State Streets corporate risk management process in a manner that is consistent with applicable policies and guidelines. State Street believes that it has sufficient liquidity and has provided adequate credit reserves to cover any risks associated with these activities. State Street has various off balance sheet financial instruments that expose the Corporation to volatility in the Consolidated Statement of Income. These financial instruments, as further explained in Notes 10 and 23 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, include the variable share contracts issued as part of the SPACESSM product and hedge ineffectiveness in the Corporations balance sheet management program and against changes in value of certain available for sale securities. If the Corporations stock price were to increase or decrease, there would be a corresponding increase or decrease in the fair value of the variable share contracts issued as part of the SPACESSM product. Such changes in value would be reflected in processing fees and other revenue. The Corporation has the right to fix the number of shares per contract to be delivered to the Corporation upon settlement under the variable share repurchase contracts (COVERS). By exercising this right, the variable share repurchase contracts are changed to fixed share repurchase contracts eliminating the requirement to mark the contracts to market. On February 17, 2004, the corporation gave notice to the Purchase Contract Agent of its election to fix the number of shares per the variable share repurchase contract. The effective date of the settlement rate, as fixed, is expected to be March 22, 2004. If the interest rate hedges employed in the Corporations balance sheet management strategy are determined to be less than perfectly effective, any ineffectiveness would be reported in current period earnings. If the hedges are highly ineffective, the entire change in value of the derivatives could impact current period earnings through processing fees and other revenue. Rapid changes in interest rates would have a significant impact on the value of certain interest rate derivatives acquired in the trading portfolio that are held as an economic hedge against certain available for sale securities. The changes in value of the interest rate contracts would be recorded in processing fees and other revenue. 57 &gt; CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Critical accounting estimates are those that require management to make assumptions that are difficult, subjective or complex about matters that are uncertain and may change in subsequent periods, resulting in changes to reported results. State Streets significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The majority of these accounting policies do not require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates, or the variability of the estimates is not material. However, the following policies could be deemed critical. State Streets management has discussed these critical accounting estimates with the Examining and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. &gt; LEASE FINANCING State Street has a leveraged lease financing portfolio, including lease in lease out structures, consisting of U.S. and cross border financings, primarily for transportation equipment, including trains, aircraft and ships. State Street has provided lease financing services since 1981, and at December 31, 2003, the portfolio aggregated $2.2 billion, and is reflected in Note 4 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This portfolio is recorded net of non recourse debt, and revenue is recognized as interest revenue. Interest revenue from the lease portfolio was $87 million in 2003. Due to the long term, cross border nature of many of these leases and the number of assumptions, including residual values, cash flows and income tax regulations and rates, risk is associated with this revenue should any of these assumptions change in future periods. &gt; CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER RESERVES State Street has established reserves for risk of losses, including loan losses and tax contingencies. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level adequate to absorb probable losses as further described in Note 1 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In the normal course of business, State Street is subject to challenges from U.S. and non U.S. tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges may result in adjustments of the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is conducting an examination of State Streets federal income tax returns for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999. In the fourth quarter, the IRS issued Notices of Proposed Adjustment for these years with respect to State Streets tax treatment of several lease in lease out lease transactions. The proposed adjustments relate to the timing of the recognition of income for tax purposes; for financial reporting purposes, deferred taxes have been provided on this income. State Street believes that its tax return reporting of these transactions was consistent with applicable tax law and intends to defend its position. Management believes State Street has appropriately accrued for tax exposures including lease in lease out structures. If State Street prevails in a matter for which an accrual has been established or is required to pay an amount exceeding its reserves, the financial impact will be reflected in the period in which the matter is resolved. 58 &gt; PENSION ACCOUNTING State Street and certain of its subsidiaries participate in a non contributory defined benefit plan. In addition to the primary plan, State Street has non qualified supplemental plans that provide certain officers with defined pension benefits in excess of allowable qualified plan limits. Non U.S. employees participate in local plans. The reported liability associated with these plans is dependent on many estimates such as the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and a series of actuarial assumptions. Management determines these estimates based upon currently available market and industry data, historical performance of the plan and its assets, and consultation with the Corporations actuaries. Management believes the estimates and assumptions used to determine the reported benefit obligation and pension expense are reasonable and reflect the terms of the plans in the current economic environment based upon information from the best available resources. Pension expense in future years is affected by the variance of the assumed rate of return from the actual return on plan assets. This variance is amortized over future years. A 1% change in the actual return on plan assets or the discount rate would affect State Streets earnings by less than $.01 per share. &gt; NEW ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS Information related to new accounting pronouncements appears in Note 1 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 59 TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS &gt; THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC, FINANCIAL AND GEOPOLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS WERE FRAGILE IN 2003. ALTHOUGH ECONOMIC NEWS WAS LARGELY POSITIVE, THE LINGERING CONFLICT IN IRAQ AND CONTROVERSY IN THE MUTUAL FUND INDUSTRY CREATED A SENSE OF UNCERTAINTY FOR INVESTORS. FOR STATE STREET, THE YEAR WAS ANYTHING BUT BUSINESS AS USUAL. WE WORKED TIRELESSLY TO INTEGRATE THE LARGEST ACQUISITION IN OUR HISTORY WHILE CONTINUING TO PROVIDE EXCELLENT SERVICE TO OUR EXISTING CLIENTS. WE ALSO WON SIGNIFICANT NEW BUSINESS AND MADE SUBSTANTIAL HEADWAY IN REDUCING OUR UNIT COSTS. &gt; FINANCIAL RESULTS Net income for 2003, including non operating gains and charges, was $722 million, down from $1.0 billion in 2002. Total revenue rose 8 percent to $4.7 billion from $4.4 billion in 2002. Operating earnings per share increased 8 percent to $2.33 in 2003, from $2.16 in 2002, marking our 26th year of consistent growth. Operating revenue was $4.5 billion, an increase from $3.9 billion in 2002. During the year, we delivered operating return on equity of 15 percent, which was within our stated goal. The increase in State Streets cash dividend brought our 10 year compounded average annual growth rate to 16 percent. Assets under custody were $9.4 trillion at December 31, 2003, up 52 percent year over year from $6.2 trillion, due in large part to our acquisition of Deutsche Banks Global Securities Services business. Assets under management were $1.1 trillion at December 31, 2003, up 45 percent from $763 billion as of year end 2002. &gt; BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS With the acquisition of the Global Securities Services (GSS) business in early 2003, State Street became the worlds leading servicer of investment assets. At year end, the GSS business contributed $.01 per share to earnings better than our original expectation and we were ahead of schedule in converting client accounts to State Street. We sharpened our focus on serving the needs of institutional investors by selling our Private Asset Management business. We also deepened our client relationships, with about half of new revenue growth, excluding GSS, coming from existing clients. Our sales pipeline was robust across all business areas and major markets. The uncertainty of the environment and weak first quarter results prompted us to take steps to reduce our operating run rate. We cut our direct controllable expenses and significantly reduced our headcount through a separation program implemented at the end of June. 60 &gt; OUTLOOK FOR 2004 We expect 2004 to be a challenging year, but believe that State Street is in an excellent position to continue to prosper and grow. A factor working in our favor and a competitive differentiator for State Street is our active, long term relationship with our clients, who are some of the most sophisticated investors in the world. State Street is an essential component in these institutional investors strategies. The solutions we provide make them more successful in meeting their goals. As we move into 2004, we are focused on a number of priorities. Our primary financial goal is to continue to achieve growth in operating earnings per share. Well meet that goal by seizing opportunities to boost our revenue especially by obtaining more business from existing clients, including those who came to us in the GSS acquisition and by continuing to control our expenses. Another priority for us is to maintain our long tradition of integrity, innovation and service excellence. Our passion for helping our clients succeed differentiates State Street in the global marketplace. We will continue to work resolutely to ensure that we not only meet our clients current needs, but anticipate their future needs as well. I am proud of State Streets performance in 2003 and of the 20,000 State Street people around the world who produce outstanding results for our clients each and every day. I am both confident and energized about our prospects for the future. Thank you for your investment in State Street. Sincerely, David A. Spina Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 61 &gt; ITEM 7A.
