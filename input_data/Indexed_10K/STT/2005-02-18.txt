ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SUMMARY BUSINESS SUMMARY State Street Corporation (State Street or the Corporation) is focused on meeting the needs of sophisticated investors worldwide by providing a complete, integrated range of products and services. State Streets employees are focused on providing excellent client service and enhancing total client relationships. State Street experiences a high rate of recurring revenue, continues to generate significant new business from its existing client base, and achieves significant cross selling revenue. This approach contributed to a year over year growth in servicing fees in 2004 of 16%, and a year over year growth in management fees of 17%. While most of State Streets client services generate servicing or management fees, clients use a variety of other services, including securities lending and foreign exchange trading and cash management services. State Street remains focused on increasing total revenue. At December 31, 2004, assets under custody totaled $9.50 trillion and assets under management totaled $1.35 trillion. In 2004, State Street focused on three key business themes. First was continued global growth and integration of a substantial portion of the Global Securities Services (GSS) business acquired in 2003 from Deutsche Bank AG. The acquisition of the GSS business was transformational for State Street. Through this acquisition, State Street added approximately $2.10 trillion to assets under custody and acquired depotbank services and additional fund administration and securities lending business. With the addition of the GSS business, State Street became a leading provider of custody and custody related services in Europe. The GSS business served investment managers, private and public pension funds and insurance companies in 92 geographic markets. To date, State Street has completed substantially all client conversions, with the exception of Germany, which will be completed in 2005. State Streets expanded global presence helped to generate new business from new and existing customers and fee revenue growth. Second, State Street heightened its focus on institutional investors and streamlined businesses or groups that did not offer the desired scale or profitability. Third, the Corporation implemented more rigorous cost cutting and expense management policies to adapt to the realities of a less robust economy. In 2003, State Street completed several initiatives that had a significant impact on 2004 results. In addition to completing the acquisition of the GSS business and integrating a major portion of that acquisition into its business, State Street completed an expense reduction program, including a major restructuring of its staffing levels, resulting in the net reduction of approximately 2,000 positions. Furthermore, in the fourth quarter of 2003, State Street completed the sale of its Private Asset Management business. State Street continues to maintain a substantial market share in U.S. pension plans and mutual fund servicing, while continuing to invest in developing businesses and growing its business globally. Investments continue to be made in developing businesses that offer outsourcing of middle and back office services, services for alternative investments such as hedge funds, electronic foreign exchange and equity execution supported by analysis and data analytics, and enhanced index investment management strategies. In summary, State Streets investment servicing and investment management businesses showed solid growth during 2004. Revenue growth, increased market share in certain key markets and the successful conversion of the GSS business were achieved in a challenging interest rate and competitive pricing environment and resulted in diluted earnings per share of $2.35 in 2004. 11 SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL OPERATING RESULTS SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION OPERATING RESULTS State Street prepares its reported Consolidated Statement of Income in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). In order to provide information on a comparable basis from period to period and assist stockholders, analysts, other external parties and management in analyzing financial results and trends of ongoing businesses and operations, State Street presents supplemental financial information on an operating basis. Operating basis results are based on GAAP (reported) results, excluding the impact of significant non recurring transactions and activities, presented on a taxable equivalent basis. The Corporation believes that such supplemental non GAAP financial information facilitates an understanding and analysis of State Streets ongoing activities and provides financial information in a format that presents comparable financial trends. Operating results for 2004 exclude merger and integration costs related to the GSS acquisition. For 2003, operating results exclude the gain on the sale and operations prior to divestiture of the Private Asset Management business; the gain on the sale of the Corporate Trust business; merger, integration, divestiture and restructuring costs; a loss on real estate sold; and the settlement of a Massachusetts tax matter.

share were $2.35 in 2004, up $.20 from $2.15 in 2003. As detailed in the preceding supplemental financial information, the results for 2004 included a reduction of $.12 per share for merger and integration charges. In 2003, merger and integration charges, restructuring charges, and other charges totaled to a pre tax charge of $419 million, or $.82 per share, as well as a $.04 reduction in earnings per share due to the settlement of a state tax issue. Somewhat offsetting these charges, 2003 results included gains of $345 million, or $.68 per share, on the sale of two businesses and $23 million, or $.04 per share, from the related operating results. Combined, these items resulted in a net $.14 loss per share in 2003. On an operating basis, excluding the aforementioned non operating gains and charges and results of a divested business, earnings per share in 2004 were $2.47 compared with $2.29 in 2003, an increase of $.18 per share, or 8%, largely driven by the gains in servicing and management fees and economies of scale achieved in the GSS business. NET INCOME Net income for 2004 was $798 million, up $76 million from net income of $722 million in 2003. As detailed in the preceding supplemental financial information and above, reported net income for 2004 included the net after tax impact of merger and integration costs that decreased 2004 net income by $41 million. Net income for 2003 included the net after tax impact of non operating transactions and activities that decreased 2003 net income by $46 million. On an operating basis, net income in 2004 was $839 million compared with $768 million in 2003, an increase of $71 million, or 9%. REVENUE The Corporations total reported revenue in 2004 was $4.95 billion, an increase of $217 million from total revenue of $4.73 billion in 2003. Revenue in 2003 included a net $345 million for gains on the sales of divested businesses and $60 million of revenue from a divested business prior to divestiture, and the loss of $13 million on the sale of certain real estate. Total operating revenue in 2004 was $5.00 billion, an increase of $603 million from operating revenue of $4.39 billion in 2003. Total operating revenue growth from 2003 reflected growth in all revenue lines, particularly in servicing and management fees, brokerage fees and net interest revenue. Servicing fees for 2004 of $2.26 billion were up $313 million from 2003. The increase was attributable to higher equity market valuations and new business from existing and new clients. Assets under custody increased to $9.50 trillion, up $127 billion from $9.37 trillion a year ago. 17 Management fees of $623 million in 2004 were up $90 million from $533 million in the prior year. Management fees for 2003 included $59 million from the divested Private Asset Management business. On an operating basis, management fees were up $149 million, reflecting continued new business success and higher average month end equity market valuations. Assets under management increased to $1.35 trillion, up $248 billion from $1.11 trillion a year ago. Securities lending fee revenue was $259 million in 2004, an improvement of $14 million from $245 million in 2003, benefiting from an increase in transaction volume. Foreign exchange trading revenue was $420 million, up $29 million compared to $391 million a year ago, reflecting a higher number of customer trades and higher currency volatility in the currencies in which State Street trades. Brokerage fees in 2004 were $155 million, a record high compared with $122 million in 2003, due to increased transition management and a stronger trading market. Processing fees and other revenue was $328 million in 2004, compared with $315 million in 2003, an increase of $13 million. Growth in processing fees and other revenue reflected improved earnings from unconsolidated affiliates and trading account profits, offset largely by a reduction in payments made by Deutsche Bank in consideration of net interest revenue earned from GSS client deposits held by Deutsche Bank until customers and their related deposits were converted to State Street systems. Net interest revenue in 2004 was $859 million, an increase of $49 million from $810 million in 2003, due to an increase in the average balance sheet driven by a higher level of customer deposits, including the conversion of GSS clients, somewhat offset by lower interest rate spreads. In addition, State Street reduced the loan loss provision by $18 million in 2004 due to reduced credit exposure and improved credit quality. OPERATING EXPENSES Operating expenses were $3.76 billion in 2004, up $137 million from 2003. Operating expenses in 2004 included $62 million in merger and integration costs, compared with $110 million of merger, integration and divestiture costs in 2003. In addition, operating expenses in 2003 included $296 million related to the 2003 expense reduction initiative that reduced direct controllable expenses and salaries and benefits expense through a voluntary separation program, accepted by approximately 3,000 people, primarily in the United States. After refilling some of those positions, State Street was able to reduce its workforce by approximately 2,000 positions as a result of this voluntary separation program. On an operating basis, total operating expenses in 2004 were $3.70 billion, up $518 million, or 16%, from $3.18 billion in 2003. Expense growth in 2004 was driven by higher salaries and employee benefits expense, primarily incentive compensation, higher transaction processing expenses related to higher transaction volume, a fourth quarter 2004 restructuring charge and higher occupancy and other costs including professional fees. GSS CONTRIBUTION In 2004, the GSS business accounted for $606 million of revenue and $501 million of expenses, compared with $573 million of revenue and $517 million of expenses in 2003. State Street achieved significant cost reductions and economies of scale in the second year of operation and substantially met financial goals established at the time of the acquisition. The financial results of the GSS business included financing costs and amortization expense related to acquired software and intangibles. When combined 18 with financial results from the additional out of scope business obtained from the relationship with Deutsche Asset Management, and excluding related merger and integration costs, the GSS business contributed $.10 to earnings per share in 2004, compared with $.01 per share in 2003. Merger and integration costs were $62 million in 2004, compared with $103 million in 2003. FINANCIAL GOALS In late 2004, State Street announced financial goals for the Corporation for 2005 and beyond. The goals are (1) annual growth in operating earnings per share of 10% to 15%, (2) annual operating revenue growth of 8% to 12%, and (3) annual operating return on stockholders equity of 14% to 17%. To reach these goals, State Street will focus on balance sheet management and is taking near term steps to better align expenses with revenue, including streamlining certain business units, modifying the Corporations incentive compensation plans and realigning State Streets real estate portfolio. While State Street does not provide specific future earnings guidance, the Corporation expects 2005 operating results to be in the lower end of the range for the operating revenue and earnings per share goals. Reported return on stockholders equity (ROE) (calculated from reported net income and consolidated average equity) for 2004 was 13.3% compared to 13.9% in 2003. Operating ROE was 14.0% in 2004, compared to 14.8% in 2003. REVENUE State Street is focused on maintaining its position as one of the worlds leading specialists in servicing collective funds, mutual funds and pension plans. Over the past five years, State Street has made great strides in gaining business outside the United States. In 2004, non U.S. revenue was approximately 37% of total revenue, compared with 27% in 1999. State Street provides reliable, easy to integrate investment services that are global and enable our clients to develop and launch competitive new investment products, as well as providing active, enhanced and passive investment management products and strategies. The Corporation provides fund accounting, custody, investment management, securities lending, transfer agency services, hedge fund services, and operations outsourcing for investment managers. These services support the complex financial strategies and transactions of our clients worldwide, in any time zone across multiple currencies. Focus on the total needs of the client allows State Street to develop active, long term relationships that result in high client retention, cross selling opportunities and recurring revenue. The servicing markets in which State Street competes are very price competitive, and State Street remains focused on winning and retaining client business. This focus requires a strong commitment to clients while constantly working toward providing services at lower unit costs. State Streets broad range of services result in fee revenue and net interest revenue. Fee revenue generated by investment servicing and management is augmented by securities lending revenue. The global nature of our clients and the world financial markets generates foreign currency transaction volumes, which in turn, generate opportunities for foreign exchange trading revenue. Transaction flows also generate the need for brokerage services provided by State Street. State Street earns net interest revenue from client deposits and short term investment activities. State Street provides deposit services, and short term investment vehicles such as repurchase agreements and commercial paper to meet clients needs for high grade liquid investments. These sources of funds and additional borrowings are invested in assets yielding a higher rate, generating an interest rate margin for State Street. FEE REVENUE Total fee revenue was $4.05 billion in 2004, compared to $3.56 billion in 2003, an increase of $492 million. Revenue for 2003 included $60 million of fee revenue from the divested Private Asset Management (PAM) business and a loss on certain real estate sold of $13 million. Excluding these items from 2003 fee revenue, fee revenue increased $539 million, or 15%, on an operating basis. 19 Servicing and management fees are the largest components of fee revenue. Combined, they comprise approximately 70% of State Streets total fee revenue. Servicing fees increased 16% over 2003 due to higher equity market valuations and new business from existing and new clients. Management fees increased 31% on an operating basis on the strength of new business and higher equity market valuations. Servicing and management fees are a function of several factors, including the mix and volume of assets under custody and assets under management, securities positions held, and volume of portfolio transactions, as well as the types of products and services used by clients. Servicing and management fees are affected by changes in worldwide equity and fixed income valuations. In general, servicing fees are affected by changes in daily average valuations of assets under custody, while management fees are affected by changes in month end valuations of assets under management. However, additional factors such as transaction volumes, balance credits, customer minimum balances and other factors may have a significant impact on revenue. Management fee revenue is more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue. State Street estimates, assuming all other factors remain constant, that a 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity values would result in a corresponding change in State Streets total revenue of approximately 2%. If fixed income security values were to increase or decrease by 10%, State Street would anticipate a corresponding change of approximately 1% in its total revenue.

This increase was primarily from higher equity market valuations and new business from existing and new clients through offices and a global custodian network that spans more than 100 geographic markets. Servicing fees include fee revenue from U.S. mutual funds, collective funds worldwide, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, foundations, endowments, and other investment pools. Products and services include custody; product and participant level accounting; daily pricing and administration; recordkeeping; hedge fund services; master trust and master custody; and performance, risk and compliance analytics. The GSS business provided a range of services that included global and local custody, master trust/master custody, benefit payments, mutual fund administration, master trust accounting, and performance measurement. Outside the United States, services provided also included depotbank services. State Streets business continued to grow outside the United States. Servicing fees in 2004 derived from clients outside the U.S. were approximately 34% of total servicing fees, up from 30% in 2003. MARKET PRESENCE State Street is the largest provider of mutual fund custody and accounting services in the United States. State Street distinguishes itself from other mutual fund service providers because clients make extensive use of a number of related services, including accounting, daily pricing and fund administration. For the year ended December 31, 2004, on a daily basis, the Corporation provided an average of more than 6,000 mutual fund prices to NASDAQ with an accuracy rate of 99.9%. State Street calculates an average of 32% of the U.S. mutual fund prices provided to NASDAQ that appear daily in The Wall Street Journal and other publications. With a 37% market share, State Street has a leading position in the market for servicing U.S. tax exempt assets for corporate and public pension funds. In response to growing market demand, State Street provides trust and valuation services for more than 4,000 daily priced portfolios, making State Street a leader for both monthly and daily valuation services. State Street is a leading service provider outside of the U.S. as well, providing custody services for more than 20% of fund assets in Canada.

This compares with $9.37 trillion a year earlier. The value of assets under custody is a broad measure of the relative size of various markets served. Changes in the value of assets under custody do not necessarily result in proportional changes in revenue. State Street uses relationship pricing for clients that take advantage of multiple services. Many services are priced on factors other than asset values, including the mix of assets under custody, securities positions held, portfolio transactions, and types of products and services used. Assets under custody at December 31 comprised the following: ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 20032004AGR 19992004CAGR (Dollars in billions) As of December 31, Clients in the U.S.: Mutual funds $ 3,385 $ 3,105 $ 2,719 $ 2,794 $ 2,664 9 % 4 % Pensions, insurance and other investment pools 4,093 3,198 2,734 2,737 2,803 28 9 Clients outside the U.S. 2,019 988 718 672 651 104 31 Acquired GSS(1) 2,079 Total $ 9,497 $ 9,370 $ 6,171 $ 6,203 $ 6,118 1 10 (1) Assets relating to GSS customers, the majority of which had not yet converted to State Streets systems, at December 31, 2003.

For 2004, assets related to GSS clients were included in the other categories of assets. 22 MANAGEMENT FEES In 2004, management fees were $623 million, up $90 million from 2003. Management fees in 2003 included $59 million of fees attributable to the divested Private Asset Management business. On an operating basis, management fees were up $149 million, or 31%, from 2003. State Street provides a broad range of investment management strategies, securities lending, specialized investment management advisory services and other financial services for corporations, public funds, and other sophisticated investors. These services are offered through State Street Global Advisors (SSgA), a division of State Street. Based upon assets under management, SSgA is the third largest investment manager in the world, and the largest manager of assets for tax exempt organizations (primarily pension plans) in the United States. Management fees showed continued strength outside the United States. Approximately 30% of management fees are from non U.S. clients. SSgA offers a broad array of investment strategies, including passive, enhanced and active management, using quantitative and fundamental methods for both U.S. and global equities and fixed income securities. While certain management fees are directly determined by the value of assets under management and the investment strategy employed, management fees reflect other factors as well, including State Streets relationship pricing for clients who use multiple services and performance related fees. Accordingly, there is not necessarily a direct correlation between the value of assets under management, market indices and management fee revenue. ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT At year end 2004, assets under management were $1.35 trillion, up $248 billion, or 22%, from year end 2003. Securities issued outside of the U.S. were 23% of total securities at year end 2004. Market value changes, as measured by indices at year end, had a significant impact on the value of assets under management. At December 31, 2004, the S&P 500 index was up 9% from year end 2003, the NASDAQ index was up 9%, the MSCI EAFE index was up 18%, and the Lehman Brothers Aggregate BondSM index was up 4%.

State Street acts as a lending agent by coordinating loans between lenders and borrowers. State Street lends securities and provides liquidity in more than 35 markets around the world. Borrowers provide collateral in the form of cash or securities to State Street in return for loaned securities. For cash collateral, State Street pays a usage fee to the provider of the cash collateral. State Street invests the cash collateral in certain investment vehicles. The spread between the yield on the investment vehicle and the usage fee paid to the provider of the collateral is split between the lender of the securities and State Street as agent. For non cash collateral, the borrower pays a fee for the loaned securities, and the fee is split between the lender of the securities and State Street. Securities lending revenue of $259 million in 2004 increased $14 million from a year earlier. Securities lending revenue is principally a function of the volume of securities lent and the interest rate spreads earned on the collateral. The effect of a 29% increase in securities lending volumes during 2004 was somewhat offset by the impact of lower interest rate spreads in the second half of 2004 attributable to the rapid succession of increases in the target interest rate by the Federal Reserve. FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRADING State Street offers a complete range of foreign exchange services offered under an account model that focuses on the global requirements of State Streets clients to execute trades and receive market insights in any time zone. State Street has exclusive ownership of FX Connect &reg;, the worlds first and leading foreign exchange trading platform, and the Corporation provides quantitatively based research into investor behavior, as well as advice and quantitative tools designed to optimize client returns. In 2004, foreign exchange trading revenue increased $29 million, to $420 million, from $391 million in 2003. Foreign exchange trading revenue is influenced by three principal factors: the volume and type of client foreign exchange transactions; currency volatility and trend; and the management of currency market risks. Client spot and forward trading volumes were strong in 2004, both in the volume and value of transactions, up 30% from 2003. Currency volatility, as measured by State Streets index of 28 currencies, increased 8% from 2003. BROKERAGE FEES State Street offers a range of trading products tailored specifically to meet the needs of the global pension community, including transition management, commission recaptures and self directed brokerage. These products are differentiated by State Streets position as an agent and partner of the institutional investor. 24 Brokerage fees were $155 million in 2004, a record high compared to $122 million the year earlier. Growth in revenue is attributed to a significant increase in the global transition management business, as well as further penetration of the investment manager marketplace. PROCESSING FEES AND OTHER Processing fees and other revenue includes multiple sources of fees and other revenue, including fees from structured products, fees from software licensing and maintenance, profits and losses from unconsolidated affiliates, gains and losses on sales of leased equipment and other assets, trading profits and losses, and amortization of investments in tax advantaged financings. Processing fees and other revenue was $328 million in 2004, compared with $315 million in 2003, an increase of $13 million. In 2004, processing fees and other revenue included payments from Deutsche Bank of $47 million in consideration of revenue earned from GSS client deposits prior to the conversion of these clients and their related deposits to State Street. These payments were $95 million in 2003. In 2003, processing fees and other revenue also included an unrealized gain related to the mark to market on variable share repurchase contracts (SPACESSM) for shares of State Streets common stock of $23 million; an other than temporary impairment charge resulting from the write down of portfolio investments of $27 million; and a $13 million loss on certain real estate sold. Excluding all these items, processing fees and other revenue in 2004 was up $44 million, reflecting improved earnings from unconsolidated affiliates and trading account profits. NET INTEREST REVENUE In servicing sophisticated global investors, State Street provides short term funds management, deposit services and repurchase agreements for cash positions associated with clients investing activities. NET INTEREST REVENUE 2004 2003 2002 Change20032004 (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, Interest revenue $ 1,787 $ 1,539 $ 1,974 16 % Interest expense 928 729 995 Net interest revenue 859 810 979 6 Provision for loan losses (18 ) 4 Net interest revenue after provision for loan losses $ 877 $ 810 $ 975 8 Excess of rates earned over rates paid (taxable equivalent) .95 % 1.04 % 1.26 Net interest margin (taxable equivalent) 1.08 1.17 1.42 Net interest revenue was $859 million in 2004, compared to $810 million in 2003, an increase of $49 million. Revenue growth was due to an increase in the average balance sheet driven by a higher level of customer deposits, including the conversion of GSS clients deposits to State Streets balance sheet. Somewhat offsetting these benefits, State Street experienced narrower interest rate spreads. Generally, State Streets liabilities reprice more quickly than its assets. In a period of rapid rate increases, interest rate spreads are constrained as the cost of funds rises more rapidly than the return on invested assets. In addition, State Street recorded a cumulative charge of $19 million in 2004 that resulted from a change in effective state tax rate assumptions used for recognition of income from leveraged lease transactions. The impact of this charge on net income was minimal as the charge was almost entirely offset by a related tax benefit of $18 million. 25 Net interest revenue after provision for loan losses reflected a reduction in the provision for loan losses of $18 million in 2004 due to reduced credit exposure and improved credit quality. GAIN ON THE SALES OF AVAILABLE FOR SALE INVESTMENT SECURITIES, NET Investment portfolio management at State Street has multiple objectives, foremost of which is to generate maximum return within the parameters of modest duration and credit risk and may entail strategic sales of specific securities as market conditions warrant. In addition, the portfolio is structured to provide liquidity and serve as a source of collateral for customer activities. To accomplish these objectives, more than half of the investment portfolio consisted of U.S. Treasury and agency securities, with high quality asset backed and mortgage backed securities making up most of the balance. More than 95% of the investment portfolio was classified as available for sale at December 31, 2004. Securities net gains were $26 million in 2004, up from $23 million in 2003. As of December 31, 2004, State Street had $36.17 billion of available for sale securities. GAIN ON THE SALES OF THE PRIVATE ASSET MANAGEMENT AND CORPORATE TRUST BUSINESSES, NET In 2003, State Street completed the sale of its Private Asset Management business to U.S. Trust. Under the terms of the agreement, the transaction was valued at $365 million, of which, approximately five percent was subject to the successful transition of the business over the subsequent 16 months. The Corporation recorded a pre tax gain of $285 million from the transaction, after providing for $62 million of exit and other associated costs. In 2003, State Street recognized a net gain of $60 million related to receipt of the escrow payment for the successful transition of the divested Corporate Trust business to U.S. Bank, N.A. This payment from escrow represents the final settlement of the transaction. OPERATING EXPENSES Operating expenses for 2004 were $3.76 billion, an increase of $137 million from 2003. Excluding merger and integration charges in both years and from 2003, restructuring costs and expenses related to a divested business, operating basis expenses were up $518 million. This increase reflected higher salaries and employee benefits, primarily incentive compensation, higher transaction processing expenses related to higher transaction volumes, and higher occupancy and other costs including professional services. OPERATING EXPENSES 2004 2003 2002 Change20032004 (Dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, Salaries and employee benefits $ 1,957 $ 1,731 $ 1,654 13 % Information systems and communications 527 551 373 (4 ) Transaction processing services 398 314 246 27 Occupancy 363 300 246 21 Merger, integration and divestiture 62 110 (44 ) Restructuring 21 296 20 (93 ) Other 431 320 302 35 Total operating expenses $ 3,759 $ 3,622 $ 2,841 4 As of December 31, Number of employees 19,668 19,850 19,501 26 Salaries and employee benefits expense increased $226 million in 2004 to $1.96 billion. On an operating basis, the increase in 2004 was $245 million. The increase was driven by higher incentive compensation costs due to the improved performance of the Corporation. For 2005, State Street has implemented a new incentive compensation plan that will reward a majority of employees based on the net income before taxes and incentive compensation of their business units, not on the performance of the entire Corporation. Information systems and communications expense was $527 million in 2004, down $24 million from the prior year, primarily as a result of converting GSS clients to State Streets systems. Transaction processing services expense was $398 million, up $84 million from $314 million a year ago. These expenses are volume related and include equity trading services and fees related to securities settlement, subcustodian fees and external contract services. The increase resulted from a higher level of investment activity combined with higher net asset values that impact subcustodian fees. Occupancy expense was $363 million, up $63 million from 2003. The increase reflected the move to new headquarters in Boston, the costs of a new data center, and recognition of a loss of $16 million on an agreement with a new sub tenant. Eliminating this excess space will offset future occupancy costs for the Corporation. Merger and integration costs in 2004 were $62 million, down from merger, integration and divestiture costs of $110 million in 2003. For 2003, these costs included $7 million of divestiture costs related to the divestiture of the Private Asset Management business. Merger and integration costs related to the acquisition of the GSS business decreased from $103 million in 2003 to $62 million in 2004. Restructuring costs were $21 million in 2004, down from $296 million in 2003. Costs for 2004 were related to severance and benefit costs associated with a 425 position workforce reduction completed in late 2004. Restructuring costs for 2003 were predominantly recorded in the second quarter of 2003 and included severance and enhanced benefits for the 3,000 individuals who accepted the voluntary separation program. Other expense was $431 million, up $111 million from $320 million in 2003, primarily due to increases in professional services related to growth initiatives as well as compliance requirements, such as Sarbanes Oxley readiness, regulatory inquiries and Basel II. INCOME TAXES On a reported basis, State Street recorded tax expense of $394 million for 2004, compared to $390 million a year ago. State Streets effective rate for 2004 was 33.1%, including the impact of a cumulative benefit of $18 million resulting from a change in the effective state tax rate applied to leveraged leasing transactions. Excluding this item, the effective rate for 2004 was 34.0%. In 2003, tax expense included a one time $12 million after tax charge for a REIT related state tax matter and resulted in an effective tax rate of 35.1% for the year. Excluding the REIT matter, the effective rate was 34.0% for 2003. DIVESTITURES AND ACQUISITIONS In executing its strategic plan, from time to time State Street may enter into business acquisitions and strategic alliances, and may divest non strategic operations. Acquisitions and strategic alliances enhance established capabilities by adding new products, services or technologies, expanding geographic reach, or selectively expanding market share. State Street continuously reviews and assesses various business opportunities related to this strategy. On October 31, 2003, State Street completed the sale of its Private Asset Management business to U.S. Trust. Under the terms of the agreement, the transaction was valued at $365 million, of which approximately five percent was subject to the successful transition of the business. The Corporation recorded a pre tax gain of $285 million from the transaction, or $.56 in diluted earnings per share. The Corporation could potentially recognize an additional gain if certain target levels of client conversions to U.S. Trust are achieved. The maximum additional gain that could be recognized in 2005 is $18 million. 27 On January 31, 2003, State Street completed the primary closing of its acquisition of a substantial part of the GSS business of Deutsche Bank AG (Deutsche Bank) for a premium of $1.13 billion. In July 2003, separate closings were held for the GSS business units in Italy and Austria. Under the terms of the sale and purchase agreement, State Street could have been required to make contingent additional purchase price payments. During the second quarter of 2004, State Street and Deutsche Bank determined that under the terms of the sale and purchase agreement, no additional consideration is payable by State Street. On December 31, 2002, State Street completed the sale of its Corporate Trust business to U.S. Bank, N.A. The premium received on the sale was $725 million, $75 million of which was placed in escrow pending the successful transition of the business. The after tax gain, net of exit and other associated costs, totaled approximately $296 million, or $.90 in diluted earnings per share, and was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2002. During the fourth quarter of 2003, State Street recognized an additional gain of $60 million, net of incentive compensation for general corporate use of $10 million, related to receipt of the escrow payment for successful transition of the Corporate Trust business. This payment from escrow represents the final settlement for the transaction. In July 2002, State Street completed the cash purchase of International Fund Services (IFS), a leading provider of fund accounting and administration as well as securities trade support and operational services for hedge funds, for $80 million. In connection with this transaction, an additional $61 million and $47 million of the purchase price was paid and recorded as goodwill in 2004 and 2003, respectively, based upon certain performance measures. Final settlement, which will occur in 2005, could require State Street to make a final payment of up to $59 million. For more information regarding divestitures and acquisitions by State Street, see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. In October 2004, State Street announced its intent to divest its ownership interest in Bel Air Investment Advisors LLC. This divestiture will likely occur in 2005 and would result in a pretax charge of approximately $150 million to $170 million. 28 COMPARISON OF 2003 VERSUS 2002 2003 2002 $ Change % Change (Dollars in millions, except per share data) YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, Fee Revenue: Servicing fees $ 1,950 $ 1,531 $ 419 27 % Management fees 533 485 48 10 Securities lending 245 226 19 8 Foreign exchange trading 391 300 91 30 Brokerage fees 122 124 (2 ) (2 ) Processing fees and other 315 184 131 71 Total fee revenue 3,556 2,850 706 25 Net Interest Revenue: Interest revenue 1,539 1,974 (435 ) (22 ) Interest expense 729 995 (266 ) (27 ) Net interest revenue 810 979 (169 ) (17 ) Provision for loan losses 4 (4 ) (100 ) Net interest revenue after provision for loan losses 810 975 (165 ) (17 ) Gain on the sales of available for sale investment securities, net 23 76 (53 ) (70 ) Gain on the sale of the Private Asset Management business, net of exit and other associated costs 285 285 100 Gain on the sale of the Corporate Trust business, net of exit and other associated costs 60 495 (435 ) (88 ) Total revenue 4,734 4,396 338 8 Operating Expenses: Salaries and employee benefits 1,731 1,654 77 5 Information systems and communications 551 373 178 48 Transaction processing services 314 246 68 28 Occupancy 300 246 54 22 Merger, integration and divestiture costs 110 110 100 Restructuring costs 296 20 276 1,380 Other 320 302 18 6 Total operating expenses 3,622 2,841 781 27 Income before income tax expense 1,112 1,555 (443 ) (28 ) Income tax expense 390 540 (150 ) (28 ) Net income $ 722 $ 1,015 $ (293 ) (29 ) Earnings Per Share: Basic $ 2.18 $ 3.14 $ (.96 ) (31 ) Diluted 2.15 3.10 (.95 ) (31 ) Cash dividends declared per share .560 .480 Return on equity 13.9 % 24.1 % AS OF DECEMBER 31, Total assets $ 87,534 $ 85,794 Long term debt 2,222 1,270 Stockholders equity 5,747 4,787 Closing price per share of common stock 52.08 39.00 Number of employees 19,850 19,501 29 SUMMARY COMPARISON OF 2003 TO 2002 For purposes of comparison to 2002, operating results for 2003 in this section will differ from operating results for 2003 provided for comparison to 2004. The significant difference is the inclusion of the operating results of the divested Private Asset Management business in 2003 because there is comparable activity in 2002. Therefore, for the comparison of 2003 to 2002, operating results in this discussion for 2003 are reported results excluding the gains on the sales of the divested Private Asset Management and Corporate Trust businesses; merger, integration and divestiture costs; restructuring costs; a loss on certain real estate sold; and the settlement of a Massachusetts tax matter. Operating results for 2002 are reported results excluding the gain on sale and operations of the divested Corporate Trust business. Operating results for 2003 and 2002 are also adjusted for a taxable equivalent presentation, which increases both net interest revenue and tax expense to reflect investment yield on tax free investment income, on an equivalent basis with fully taxable investment income. In this discussion, State Street will also reference the GSS contribution and baseline results. The GSS contribution is defined as the revenue and expenses, including financing costs and amortization of intangibles and software, attributable to the GSS business acquired January 31, 2003, as well as revenue and expenses from out of scope clients gained subsequent to the GSS acquisition due to the relationship with Deutsche Asset Management but who were not part of the acquired GSS business. Per share amounts reflect the increase in outstanding shares due to the acquisition. Baseline results are defined as operating results, excluding the GSS contribution. Baseline information is being provided because there is no comparable GSS contribution in 2002. 30 RECONCILIATION OF REPORTED RESULTS TO NON GAAP MEASURES Total Revenue TotalOperating Expenses Income Before Income Taxes Income Tax Expense (Benefit) Net Income Earnings Per Share (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Year Ended December 31, 2003 Reported results GAAP $ 4,734 $ 3,622 $ 1,112 $ 390 $ 722 $ 2.15 Non operating Business Activities: Gain on the sale of the Private Asset Management business, net of exit and other associated costs (285 ) (285 ) (97 ) (188 ) (.56 ) Gain on the sale of the Corporate Trust business, net of associated costs (60 ) (60 ) (20 ) (40 ) (.12 ) Loss on the sale of certain real state 13 13 5 8 .02 Restructuring costs (296 ) 296 101 195 .58 Merger, integration and divestiture costs (110 ) 110 37 73 .22 Settlement of a Massachusetts tax matter (13 ) 13 .04 Total non operating business activities (332 ) (406 ) 74 13 61 .18 Taxable equivalent adjustment 51 51 51 Operating results(1) 4,453 3,216 1,237 454 783 2.33 Results of the GSS business (573 ) (517 ) (56 ) (19 ) (37 ) (.01 ) Baseline results(1) $ 3,880 $ 2,699 $ 1,181 $ 435 $ 746 $ 2.32 Year Ended December 31, 2002 Reported results GAAP $ 4,396 $ 2,841 $ 1,555 $ 540 $ 1,015 $ 3.10 Non operating Business Activities: Gain on the sale of the Corporate Trust business, net of exit and other associated costs (495 ) (495 ) (199 ) (296 ) (.90 ) Results of the divested Corporate Trust business (94 ) (57 ) (37 ) (13 ) (24 ) (.08 ) Total non operating business activities (589 ) (57 ) (532 ) (212 ) (320 ) (.98 ) Taxable equivalent adjustment 61 61 61 Operating and baseline results(1) $ 3,868 $ 2,784 $ 1,084 $ 389 $ 695 $ 2.12 (1) Non GAAP measures defined by State Street State Streets reported earnings per share were $2.15 in 2003, down $.95 from $3.10 reported in 2002. The results for 2003 included a net loss of $.18 per share from non operating charges and gains, and earnings of $.01 per share related to the GSS business. Baseline earnings per share were $2.32 for 2003. The results for 2002 included an after tax gain on the sale of the Corporate Trust business of $296 million, or $.90 of earnings per share, and net earnings of $.08 per share related to operations of the Corporate Trust business prior to the fourth quarter 2002 divestiture of the Corporate Trust business. Baseline earnings per share were $2.12 for 2002. Baseline earnings per share grew 9% from 2002 to 2003. State Streets solid performance in 2003, despite a fourth consecutive year of declining values in equity markets worldwide and a relatively flat interest rate environment, resulted from winning business from new and existing clients, expanding product offerings, and closely managing expenses. Baseline total revenue was relatively flat from 2002 to 2003, while baseline total operating expenses decreased by 3%. 31 Reported net income was $722 million in 2003, down $293 million from net income of $1.02 billion in 2002. Of this decrease, $61 million was attributable to the net after tax impact of non operating transactions and activities. The GSS business contributed $37 million to net income in 2003. Net income for 2002 included non operating transactions and activities that increased 2002 net income by $320 million. On a baseline basis, net income grew by 7% from 2002 to 2003. REVENUE Total reported revenue was $4.73 billion in 2003, an increase of $338 million from total revenue of $4.40 billion in 2002. Revenue in 2003 included a net $332 million of non operating gains on the sales of divested businesses, net of the loss on the sale of certain real estate sold. Revenue in 2002 included $589 million for the gain on the sale and the operations of the divested Corporate Trust business. Total operating revenue for 2003 was $4.45 billion, an increase of $585 million from operating revenue of $3.87 billion in 2002. The GSS business contributed $573 million to this increase. BASELINE REVENUE A NON GAAP MEASURE DEFINED BY STATE STREET 2003 2002 $ Change % Change (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Years ended December 31, Servicing fees $ 1,596 $ 1,454 $ 142 10 % Management fees 517 485 32 6 Securities lending 194 226 (32 ) (14 ) Foreign exchange trading 330 300 30 10 Brokerage fees 122 124 (2 ) (1 ) Processing fees and other 230 180 50 28 Total fee revenue 2,989 2,769 220 8 Baseline net interest revenue: Net interest revenue 817 966 (149 ) Taxable equivalent adjustment 51 61 (10 ) Net interest revenue taxable equivalent 868 1,027 (159 ) Provision for loan losses 4 (4 ) Net interest revenue after provision for loan losses 868 1,023 (155 ) (15 ) Gain on the sales of available for sale investment securities, net 23 76 (53 ) (69 ) Total baseline revenue $ 3,880 $ 3,868 $ 12 Total baseline revenue in 2003 was relatively flat, year over year, at $3.88 billion, up $12 million from 2002. While total baseline revenue was flat, fluctuations occurred by type of revenue. Growth in servicing and management fees, foreign exchange trading fee revenue and processing fees and other, was largely offset by declines in securities lending fees and net interest revenue, and lower gains on the sales of available for sale securities. Servicing fees for 2003 of $1.95 billion were up $419 million from 2002. The GSS business contributed $354 million to servicing fees in 2003, partially offset by a decrease of $77 million in servicing fees resulting from the divestiture of the Corporate Trust business. On a baseline basis, servicing fees were $1.60 billion, up $142 million from 2002. The increase was attributable to higher equity market valuations and new business from new and existing clients, including business gained through an acquisition in July 2002. Assets under custody were $9.37 trillion, including $2.08 trillion attributable to the GSS business. Management fees of $533 million in 2003 were up $48 million from the prior year, including the GSS contribution of $16 million. On a baseline basis, management fees were up $32 million, reflecting continued new business success and higher average month end equity market valuations. Assets under management were $1.11 trillion, up $343 billion from $763 billion a year earlier. 32 Securities lending revenue was $245 million in 2003 compared to $226 million in 2002, an increase of $19 million, including GSS contribution of $51 million. Securities lending revenue is principally a function of the volume of securities lent and interest rate spreads earned on the collateral. While securities lending volumes increased in 2003, the impact was more than offset by lower interest rate spreads reflecting the low interest rate environment in 2003 and a flat yield curve under one year. Foreign exchange trading revenue was $391 million in 2003, compared to $300 million a year earlier. The GSS business contributed $61 million in 2003. The remaining increase reflected a higher number of customer trades and higher currency volatility in the currencies in which State Street traded. Brokerage fee revenue was $122 million in 2003, compared to $124 million in 2002. Sustained revenue reflected continued high equity trading volumes by institutional investors, including commission recapture and transition management services. Processing fees and other was $315 million in 2003, compared with $184 million in 2002. In 2003, processing fees and other included $95 million of fee revenue attributable to the GSS business. Until customers and their related deposits were converted to State Street systems, Deutsche Bank was making payments in consideration of net interest revenue earned from GSS client deposits, recorded in processing fees and other revenue. Securities net gains were $23 million in 2003, compared to $76 million a year earlier. In 2002, State Street sold securities to take advantage of opportunities created by continued declines in market yields on fixed income securities. Net interest revenue in 2003 was $810 million, a decline of $169 million from $979 million in 2002. The 2003 interest rate environment continued to constrain the level of net interest income. For the better part of 2002, State Streets portfolio contained relatively higher yielding assets. In 2003, net interest revenue was constrained by lower reinvestment rates, a flatter yield curve and State Streets proportionately greater investment in floating rate and short term money market securities. In general, sustained lower interest rates and a flat yield curve have an adverse impact on State Street as deposits are invested at lower yields. State Streets ability to increase its balance sheet size to offset the lower yield impact was limited due to leverage constraints resulting from the GSS acquisition. OPERATING EXPENSES Operating expenses were $3.62 billion in 2003, up $781 million from 2002. Operating expenses in 2003 included $296 million related to an expense reduction program, $110 million in merger, integration and divestiture costs, and the expenses of the GSS business of $517 million. Operating expenses in 2002 included $57 million related to the divested Corporate Trust business. On a baseline basis, total operating expenses in 2003 were $2.70 billion, down $85 million, or 3%, from $2.78 billion in 2002. During 2003, State Street implemented an expense reduction program that reduced direct controllable expenses and salaries and benefits expense through a voluntary separation program, primarily in the United States. State Street was able to reduce its workforce by approximately 2,000 net positions as a result of this voluntary separation program. 33 BASELINE OPERATING EXPENSES A NON GAAP MEASURE DEFINED BY STATE STREET 2003 2002 $ Change % Change (Dollars in millions, except per share data)Years ended December 31, Salaries and employee benefits $ 1,526 $ 1,622 $ (96 ) (6 )% Information systems and communications 394 367 27 7 Transaction processing services 259 242 17 7 Occupancy 262 240 22 9 Restructuring costs 20 (20 ) (100 ) Other 258 293 (35 ) (12 ) Total baseline operating expenses $ 2,699 $ 2,784 $ (85 ) (3 ) Salaries and employee benefits expense increased $77 million in 2003, including the impact of $205 million from the GSS business, partially offset by a reduction in expense of $32 million resulting from the divestiture of Corporate Trust. Excluding the GSS contribution in 2003 and Corporate Trust expenses in 2002, baseline salaries and benefits expense decreased $96 million from $1.62 billion to $1.53 billion. This decrease was a result of the impact of reduced headcount resulting from the voluntary separation program initiated in 2003 and lower incentive compensation. Information systems and communications expense was $551 million in 2003, up $178 million from the prior year. The GSS business added $157 million of expense in 2003. Excluding the GSS business, baseline information systems and communications expense was $394 million, up $27 million, or 7%, from 2002, reflecting continued investment in core processing capabilities and costs related to International Fund Services, acquired in July 2002. Transaction processing services expense was $314 million, up $68 million from 2002, $55 million of which related to the GSS business. Excluding the GSS business, baseline transaction processing services expense was $259 million compared with $242 million the prior year. These expenses are volume related and include subcustodian fees, external contract services, equity trading services and fees related to securities settlement. The increase resulted from a higher level of investment activity combined with higher net asset values that impact subcustodian fees. Occupancy expense was $300 million in 2003, up $54 million from 2002. The GSS business contributed $38 million to occupancy expense. Baseline occupancy expense of $262 million in 2003 was up $22 million, or 9%, reflecting new office space in Boston, Massachusetts and Luxembourg. Merger, integration and divestiture costs in 2003 were $110 million, of which $103 million were merger and integration costs related to the acquisition of the GSS business and the remaining $7 million were divestiture costs related to the divestiture of the Private Asset Management business that was completed on October 31, 2003. These costs have been excluded from baseline and operating results. Restructuring costs were $296 million in 2003, up from $20 million in 2002. Restructuring costs for 2003 were predominantly recorded in the second quarter and included severance and enhanced benefits for the 3,000 individuals who accepted the voluntary separation program. This program was the only voluntary separation program in State Streets history, and as such, these expenses have been excluded from baseline and operating results in 2003. Restructuring costs of $20 million in 2002 related to an April 2002 staff reduction, and have been included in baseline and operating results for 2002 because they related to normal headcount management initiatives. Other expenses were $320 million, including $62 million of expenses relating to the GSS business. Other expenses in 2002 were $302 million, including $9 million from the divested Corporate Trust business. Excluding the GSS business, baseline other expenses were $258 million, down $35 million, or 12%, as a result of continued cost control measures related to the expense reduction program. 34 Income tax expense was $390 million in 2003, down $150 million compared to $540 million in 2002, reflecting the 28% decrease in net income before taxes. In 2003, the effective tax rate was 34.0%, excluding the settlement of the REIT related state tax matter, and was 35.1% including the settlement. The effective tax rate for 2002 was 34.7%. LINES OF BUSINESS State Street reports two lines of business: Investment Servicing and Investment Management. Given State Streets services and management organization, the results of operations for these lines of business are not necessarily comparable with those of other companies, including companies in the financial services industry. Revenue and expenses are directly charged or allocated to the lines of business through management information systems. State Street prices its products and services based on total client relationships and other factors; therefore, revenue may not necessarily reflect market pricing on products within the business lines in the same way as it would for independent business entities. Assets and liabilities are allocated according to rules that support managements strategic and tactical goals. Capital is allocated based on risk weighted assets employed and managements judgment. The capital allocations may not be representative of the capital that might be required if these lines of business were independent business entities. The following is a summary of the results for lines of business: | Investment Servicing | Investment Management | Business Divestiture | Other/One Time | Total | 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, Fee revenue: Servicing fees $ 2,263 $ 1,950 $ 1,454 $ 77 $ 2,263 $ 1,950 $ 1,531 Management fees $ 623 $ 474 $ 405 $ 59 80 623 533 485 Securities lending 211 206 185 48 39 41 259 245 226 Foreign exchange trading 420 391 300 420 391 300 Brokerage fees 155 122 124 155 122 124 Processing fees and other 259 293 147 69 34 33 1 4 $ (13 ) 328 315 184 Total fee revenue 3,308 2,962 2,210 740 547 479 60 161 (13 ) 4,048 3,556 2,850 Net interest revenue after provision for loan losses 834 773 905 43 37 55 15 877 810 975 Gain on the sales of available for sale investment securities, net 26 23 76 26 23 76 Gain on the sales of divested businesses, net 345 $ 495 345 495 Total revenue 4,168 3,758 3,191 783 584 534 60 176 332 495 4,951 4,734 4,396 Operating expenses 3,115 2,706 2,273 582 473 469 37 99 $ 62 406 3,759 3,622 2,841 Income before income taxes $ 1,053 $ 1,052 $ 918 $ 201 $ 111 $ 65 $ 23 $ 77 $ (62 ) $ (74 ) $ 495 $ 1,192 $ 1,112 $ 1,555 Pre tax margin 25 % 28 % 29 % 26 % 19 % 12 % Average assets (billions) $ 92.5 $ 80.6 $ 76.6 $ 2.6 $ 2.0 $ 1.8 $ .1 $ .7 $ 95.1 $ 82.7 $ 79.1 Note: Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year method of presentation. Investment Servicing provides services for U.S. mutual funds, collective funds worldwide, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, foundations, endowments, and other investment pools. Products include custody, accounting, daily pricing and administration; master trust and master custody; recordkeeping; foreign exchange; securities lending; deposit and short term 35 investment facilities; loans and lease financing; investment and hedge fund manager operations outsourcing; and performance, risk and compliance analytics to support institutional investors. State Street provides shareholder services, which include mutual fund and collective fund shareholder accounting, through 50% owned affiliates, Boston Financial Data Services, Inc. and the International Financial Data Services group of companies. Investment Management offers a broad array of services for managing financial assets, including investment management and investment research, primarily for institutional investors worldwide. These services include passive and active U.S. and non U.S. equity and fixed income strategies, and other related services, such as securities lending. Business Divestiture includes the revenue and expenses of the divested Private Asset Management business for 2003 and 2002, and the divested Corporate Trust business for 2002. State Street measures its line of business results on an operating basis. As such, the preceding table includes an Other/One Time category. For 2004, the Other/One Time category includes merger and integration costs related to the acquisition of the GSS business. For 2003, the Other/One Time category includes the gains on the sales of the Private Asset Management and Corporate Trust businesses, the loss on certain real estate sold, and restructuring and merger, integration and divestiture charges. For 2002, the Other/One Time category includes the gain on the sale of the Corporate Trust business. INVESTMENT SERVICING Total revenue in 2004 increased to $4.17 billion, up $410 million, or 11%, from 2003. Growth was primarily driven by increases in servicing, foreign exchange trading, and brokerage fee revenue and higher net interest revenue, somewhat offset by a decline in processing fees and other revenue. Servicing fees for 2004 of $2.26 billion were up $313 million from 2003 due to higher equity valuations and new business from existing and new clients. Foreign exchange trading revenue was up $29 million, reflecting higher currency volatility and a higher number of customer trades. Processing fees and other revenue were down $34 million from 2003, primarily reflecting a $48 million decline in payments received from Deutsche Bank in lieu of net interest revenue on deposits of GSS clients that had not yet converted to State Streets systems, and a decline of $23 million attributable to the 2003 gain recorded on the SPACESSM contracts, somewhat offset by a loss recorded in 2003 of $27 million for the write down of the available for sale portfolio. Servicing fees, foreign exchange trading revenue, brokerage fees and gains on the sales of available for sale securities for the Investment Servicing line of business are identical to the respective total consolidated results. Please refer to the Servicing Fees, Foreign Exchange Trading, Brokerage Fees and Gain on the Sales of Available For Sale Securities captions in the Revenue section for a more in depth discussion. Processing fees and other revenue and net interest revenue for Investment Servicing are nearly identical to the consolidated information provided under the captions Processing Fees and Other and Net Interest Revenue in the Revenue section. A small amount of net interest revenue is recorded in the Investment Management line of business. Operating expenses were $3.12 billion in 2004, an increase of $409 million from 2003. The increase in expenses was largely attributable to salaries and employee benefits from higher incentive compensation and other expenses as a result of professional fees for regulatory compliance and growth initiatives. INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT Total revenue in 2004 was $783 million, up $199 million from $584 million in 2003. In 2004, management fees were $623 million, up $149 million, or 31%, from 2003. Management fees for the Investment Management line of business are identical to the respective total consolidated results. Please refer to the Management Fees caption in the Revenue section for a more in depth discussion. Securities lending revenue in 2004 was up $9 million from 2003, reflecting higher volumes of activity, 36 somewhat offset by the unfavorable interest rate environment. Processing fees and other revenue included increased profits from joint ventures and other revenue. Operating expenses in 2004 were $582 million, up $109 million from 2003, primarily attributable to higher incentive compensation. FINANCIAL GOALS AND FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT THEM In late 2004, State Street announced financial goals for the Corporation for 2005 and beyond. The goals are (1) annual growth in operating earnings per share of 10% to 15%, (2) annual operating revenue growth of 8% to 12%, and (3) annual operating return on stockholders equity of 14% to 17%. State Street considers these to be financial goals, not projections or forward looking statements. However, the discussion in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation, and in other portions of this report on Form 10 K, may contain statements that are considered forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements may be identified by such forward looking terminology as expect, look, believe, anticipate, may, will, or similar statements or variations of such terms. The Corporations financial goals and such forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties, including the issues and factors listed below and factors further described in conjunction with the forward looking information, which could cause actual results to differ materially. The following issues and factors should be carefully considered. The forward looking statements contained in this report speak only as of the time the statements were given. The Corporation does not undertake to revise those forward looking statements to reflect events after the date of this report. CROSS BORDER INVESTING. Increased cross border investing by clients worldwide benefits State Streets revenue. Future revenue may increase or decrease depending upon the extent of increases or decreases in cross border investments made by clients. Economic and political uncertainties resulting from terrorist attacks, subsequent military actions or other events could result in decreased cross border investment activities. SAVINGS RATES OF INDIVIDUALS. State Street generally benefits when individuals invest their savings in mutual funds and other collective funds or in defined contribution plans. Changes in savings rates or investment styles may affect revenue. If there is a decline in the savings rates of individuals, or if there is a change in investment preferences that leads to fewer investments in mutual funds, other collective funds, and defined contribution plans, State Streets revenue may be adversely affected. ASSET VALUES IN WORLDWIDE FINANCIAL MARKETS. As asset values in worldwide financial markets increase or decrease, State Streets opportunities to invest and service financial assets may change. Since a portion of the Corporations fees is based on the value of assets under custody and management, fluctuations in the valuation of worldwide securities markets will affect revenue. State Street estimates that a 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity values would result in a corresponding change in State Streets total revenue of approximately 2%. If fixed income security values worldwide were to increase or decrease by 10%, State Street would anticipate a corresponding change of approximately 1% in its total revenue. As asset values increase or decrease due to external credit factors, State Street has exposure related to its own investing activities. The impact of such exposure would be reflected in the Corporations statement of income, statement of condition and statement of changes in stockholders equity. DYNAMICS OF MARKETS SERVED. Changes in markets served, including the growth rate of collective funds worldwide, outsourcing decisions, mergers, acquisitions and consolidations among clients and competitors and the pace of debt and equity issuance, can affect revenue. In general, State Street benefits from increases in the volume of financial market transactions serviced. State Street provides services worldwide. Global and regional economic factors and changes or potential changes in laws and regulations affecting the Corporations business including volatile currencies, pace of inflation, changes in monetary policy, changes in domestic and international banking supervisory regulations including capital requirements, and social and political instability could affect results of operations. The terrorist attacks that took place in the United States on September 11, 2001, and subsequent military action and terrorist activities, have caused economic and political uncertainties. These activities and the national and global efforts to combat terrorism, and other military activities and outbreaks of hostilities have affected and may 37 further adversely affect economic growth, and may have other adverse effects on many companies, including State Street, in ways that are not predictable. Financial reporting irregularities involving large and well known companies and governmental and regulatory investigations of securities and mutual fund industry practices and behavior may have adverse effects on State Street in ways that are not predictable. State Street is broadly involved with the securities industry including, in particular, the mutual fund industry, and governmental and regulatory agencies have sought information from it in connection with investigations relating to that industry. Legislation may cause changes in the competitive environment in which State Street operates, which could include, among other things, broadening the scope of activities of significant competitors, or facilitating consolidation of competitors into stronger entities, or attracting new large and well capitalized competitors into State Streets traditional businesses. Such factors and changes, and the ability of the Corporation to address and adapt to the competitive challenges, may affect future results of operations. REGULATION AND SUPERVISION. State Streets businesses are subject to stringent regulation and examination by U.S. federal and state governmental and regulatory agencies and self regulatory organizations (including securities exchanges), and by non U.S. governmental and regulatory agencies and self regulatory organizations. In addition, State Streets clients have a broad array of complex and specialized servicing, confidentiality, and fiduciary requirements. State Street has established policies, procedures, and systems designed to comply with these regulatory and operational risk requirements. However, as a global financial services institution, State Street faces complexity and costs in its worldwide compliance efforts, and faces the potential for loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, employee supervisory or monitoring mechanisms, or other systems or controls, and from external events, which could have a material impact on the Corporations future results of operations. Also, adverse publicity and damage to its reputation arising from the failure or perceived failure to comply with legal, regulatory or contractual requirements could affect State Streets ability to attract and retain customers or maintain access to capital markets, or could result in enforcement actions, fines, penalties and lawsuits. ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. Changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States applicable to State Street could have a material impact on the Corporations results of operations. While such changes may not have an economic impact on the business of State Street, these changes could affect the attainment of the current measures of the Corporations financial goals. TAX LEGISLATION. Changes in tax legislation or the interpretation of existing tax laws worldwide could have a material impact on the Corporations results of operations. INTEREST RATES. The levels of market interest rates, the shape of the yield curve and the direction and speed of interest rate changes relative to the geographic mix of interest bearing assets and liabilities affect net interest revenue and securities lending revenue. In the short term, State Streets net interest revenue and securities lending revenue benefit from falling interest rates and are negatively affected by rising interest rates because interest bearing liabilities reprice sooner than interest earning assets. The rate of adjustment to higher or lower rates will depend on the relative duration of assets and liabilities. In general, sustained lower interest rates and a flat yield curve have a constraining effect on net interest revenue and securities lending revenue growth. Market interest rates also impact the value of certain derivative products whose change in value is reflected in processing fees and other in the Consolidated Statement of Income. LIQUIDITY. Any occurrence that may limit the Corporations access to the funds markets, such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers, depositors or counterparties participating in the funds markets in general or with State Street in particular, or a downgrade of State Streets debt rating, may adversely affect State Streets capital costs and its ability to raise capital and, in turn, its liquidity. CAPITAL. Under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, State Street and State Street Bank must meet guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off balance sheet items. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could have a direct material effect on State Streets financial condition; failure to maintain the status of well capitalized under the regulatory framework could affect State Streets status as a financial holding company and eligibility for a streamlined review process for acquisition proposals. 38 In addition, failure to maintain the status of well capitalized could affect the confidence of State Streets clients in the Corporation and could adversely affect its business. In addition to being well capitalized, State Street and State Street Bank are subject to guidelines that involve qualitative judgments by regulators about the entities status as well managed and the entities compliance with Community Reinvestment Act obligations. Federal laws and related regulations limit the amount that banks, including State Street Bank, may invest in international subsidiaries. This limitation may affect the pace of future international expansion by State Street Bank through this type of subsidiary. VOLATILITY OF CURRENCY MARKETS. The degree of volatility in foreign exchange rates can affect foreign exchange trading revenue. In general, State Street benefits from currency volatility. Accordingly, foreign exchange revenue is likely to decrease during times of decreased currency volatility. In addition, as State Streets business grows globally, State Streets exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates could impact State Streets level of revenue and expense and net income and the value of State Streets investments in its non U.S. operations. PACE OF PENSION REFORM. State Street expects its business to benefit from worldwide pension reform that creates additional pools of assets that use custody and related services, and investment management services. The pace of pension reform and resulting programs, including public and private pension schemes, may affect the pace of revenue growth. If the pace of pension reform and resulting programs, including public and private pension schemes, slows down or if pension reform does not occur, revenue growth may be adversely affected. PRICING/COMPETITION. Future prices the Corporation is able to obtain for its products may increase or decrease from current levels depending upon demand for its products, its competitors activities, customer pricing reviews and the introduction of new products into the marketplace. PACE OF NEW BUSINESS; BUSINESS MIX. A decline in the pace at which State Street attracts new clients, and the pace at which existing and new clients use additional services and assign additional assets to State Street for management or custody, may adversely affect future revenue and earnings growth. A decline in the rate at which clients outsource functions, such as their internal accounting activities, could also adversely affect revenue and earnings growth. In addition, changes in business mix and in the source of revenue, including the mix of U.S. and non U.S. business, may affect future results of operations, depending on the economic and competitive conditions of those geographic areas at the time. INVESTMENT MANAGER OPERATIONS OUTSOURCING. The Corporation enters into long term contracts to provide middle office or investment management services to clients. Services include trade order management, trade support and fail management, reconciliations, cash reporting and management, custodian communications for settlements, accounting systems, collateral management and information technology development. These contracts often extend eight to ten years and require considerable up front investments, including technology and conversion costs. Performance risk exists in each contract as these contracts are dependent upon the successful conversion and implementation of the activities onto State Streets operating platforms. BUSINESS CONTINUITY. State Street has business continuity and disaster recovery plans in place. However, external events, including terrorist or military actions and resulting political and social turmoil, could arise that would cause unforeseen damage to State Streets physical facilities or could cause delays or disruptions to operational functions, including information processing and financial market settlement functions. Additionally, State Streets clients, vendors and counterparties could suffer from such events. Should these events affect State Street, or the clients, vendors or counterparties with which it conducts business, State Streets results of operations could be adversely affected. RATE OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE. Technological change often creates opportunities for product differentiation and reduced costs, as well as the possibility of increased expenses. Developments in the securities processing industry, including shortened settlement cycles and straight through processing, will result in changes to existing procedures. Alternative delivery systems have emerged, including the widespread use of the Internet. State Streets financial performance depends in part on its ability to develop and 39 market new and innovative services, and to adopt or develop new technologies that differentiate State Streets products or provide cost efficiencies. The risks inherent in this process include rapid technological change in the industry, the Corporations ability to access technical and other information from clients, and the significant and ongoing investments required to bring new services to market in a timely fashion at competitive prices. A further risk is the introduction by competitors of services that could replace or provide lower cost alternatives to State Street services. State Street uses trademark, trade secret, copyright and other proprietary rights procedures to protect its technology, and has applied for a limited number of patents in connection with certain software programs. Despite these efforts, State Street cannot be certain that the steps taken by it to prevent unauthorized use of proprietary rights are sufficient to prevent misappropriation of technology, particularly outside the United States where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. In addition, no assurance can be given that the courts will adequately enforce contractual agreements that State Street has entered into to protect its proprietary technology. If any of its proprietary information were misappropriated by or otherwise disclosed to its competitors, State Streets competitive position could be adversely affected. In the event a third party asserts a claim of infringement of its proprietary rights, obtained through patents or otherwise, against the Corporation, State Street may be required to spend significant resources to defend against such claims, develop a non infringing program or process, or obtain a license to the infringed process. ACQUISITIONS, ALLIANCES, OUTSOURCING AGREEMENTS AND DIVESTITURES. Acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies, development of strategic alliances, outsourcing agreements and divestitures of portions of its business are an active part of State Streets overall business strategy. The Corporation has completed several acquisitions, alliances, outsourcing agreements and divestitures in recent years. However, there can be no assurance that services, technologies, key personnel or businesses of acquired companies or outsourcing agreements will be effectively assimilated into State Streets business or service offerings, that alliances will be successful, or that future revenue growth or expense savings will be achieved in outsourcing agreements. In addition, State Street may not be able to successfully complete any divestiture on satisfactory terms, if at all, and divestitures may result in a reduction of total revenue and net income. 40 FINANCIAL CONDITION BALANCE SHEET State Street provides deposit and other balance sheet services to its institutional investor clients. In executing their worldwide cash management activities, State Streets clients use short term investments and deposit accounts that constitute the majority of State Streets liabilities. These client investment activities affect the Corporations approach to managing market and credit risk, as well as overall liquidity. LIABILITIES State Street uses its balance sheet capacity to support clients transactions and short term investment strategies. State Streets objectives and clients needs determine the volume, mix and currencies of the liabilities. Average interest bearing liabilities increased $10.17 billion in 2004, primarily from non U.S. deposits, up $9.30 billion, in part reflecting the GSS clients and their deposits that have been converted to State Streets systems in 2004. In 2003, State Streets balance sheet capacity was constrained by the GSS acquisition. Average noninterest bearing client deposits, including demand and special time, increased by $688 million. Clients use noninterest bearing deposit accounts for transaction settlements and as compensation to State Street for services. DEPOSITS The average balances and rates paid on interest bearing deposits for the years ended December 31, were as follows: | 2004 | 2003 | 2002 | Average Balance Average Rate Average Balance Average Rate Average Balance Average Rate (Dollars in millions) U.S.: Noninterest bearing deposits: Demand $ 1,296 $ 717 $ 516 Special time 6,697 6,607 5,575 Interest bearing deposits: Savings 855 .72 % 1,079 .57 % 2,171 .92 % Time 5,352 1.35 4,731 1.22 7,301 1.82 Total U.S. $ 14,200 $ 13,134 $ 15,563 Non U.S.: Noninterest bearing deposits $ 53 $ 35 $ 50 Interest bearing deposits 39,046 1.11 % 29,746 1.04 % 26,393 1.31 % Total non U.S. $ 39,099 $ 29,781 $ 26,443 41 Non U.S. noninterest bearing deposits at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $71 million, $53 million and $37 million, respectively. Scheduled maturities of U.S. time deposits of $100,000 or more as of December 31, 2004 were as follows: (Dollars in millions) 2005 ($12,849 of which mature in 3 months or less) $ 12,917 2006 1,191 2007 2008 2009 157 Total $ 14,265 At December 31, 2004, substantially all non U.S. time deposit liabilities were in amounts of $100,000 or more. SHORT TERM BORROWINGS The following table reflects the amounts outstanding and weighted average interest rates of the primary components of short term borrowings as of and for the years ended December 31: | Federal Funds Purchased | Securities Sold Under Repurchase Agreements | 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 (Dollars in millions) Balance at December 31, $ 435 $ 1,019 $ 3,895 $ 21,881 $ 22,806 $ 21,963 Maximum outstanding at any month end 5,500 4,690 4,925 26,773 28,579 26,553 Average outstanding during the year 2,891 2,901 3,085 22,989 22,724 23,881 Weighted average interest rate at end of year 1.75 % 1.00 % 1.25 % 1.64 % .73 % 1.12 % Weighted average interest rate during the year 1.40 1.13 1.63 1.02 .90 1.49 ASSETS State Streets assets consist primarily of short term money market assets and investment securities, which are generally more liquid than other types of assets. Investment securities, principally classified as available for sale, include direct obligations and mortgage backed securities of the U.S. Treasury and federal agencies, highly rated municipal securities, asset backed securities, money market mutual funds and non U.S. government bonds. State Street defines money market assets to include securities purchased under resale agreements, federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits with banks that are short term, multicurrency instruments invested with major multinational banks. Average interest earning assets in 2004 increased $10.30 billion, up 14% from 2003, reflecting the additional source of funds from higher client deposits. Average investment securities increased $4.99 billion from 2003, primarily in U.S. federal agencies and asset backed securities, and an increase of $4.85 billion in average interest bearing deposits with banks. 42 INVESTMENT SECURITIES Investment securities consisted of the following as of December 31: 2004 2003 2002 (Dollars in millions) Held to Maturity (at amortized cost): U.S. Treasury and federal agencies $ 1,294 $ 1,345 $ 1,327 Other investments 106 272 216 Total $ 1,400 $ 1,617 $ 1,543 Available for Sale (at fair value): U.S. Treasury and federal agencies: Direct obligations $ 12,119 $ 18,986 $ 12,645 Mortgage backed securities 9,147 3,762 3,115 Asset backed securities 10,056 9,885 4,276 State and political subdivisions 1,785 1,999 2,018 Collateralized mortgage obligations 1,719 1,333 548 Other debt investments 922 310 703 Money market mutual funds 97 85 3,057 Other equity securities 326 238 166 Total $ 36,171 $ 36,598 $ 26,528 During the second half of 2004, State Street increased its holdings of mortgage backed securities. State Street had $96 million in net pre tax unrealized losses on available for sale investment securities at December 31, 2004, reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income in equity as a loss of $56 million, after tax. During 2003, a $27 million charge was recorded in processing fees and other revenue to reduce the amortized cost basis of certain investment securities for which the decline in fair value was determined to be other than temporary. Refer to Note 3 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for detail regarding available for sale investment securities, including the determination of when unrealized losses are considered other than temporary. 43 The maturities of debt investment securities as of December 31, 2004, were as follows: | Under 1 | 1 to 5 | 6 to 18 | Years Over 10 | Amount Yield Amount Yield Amount Yield Amount Yield (Dollars in millions) Held to Maturity (at amortized cost): U.S. Treasury and federal agencies $ 402 1.72 % $ 892 2.31 % Other investments 71 1.17 35 .70 Total $ 473 $ 927 Available for Sale (at fair value): U.S. Treasury and federal agencies $ 7,849 1.74 % $ 5,741 2.91 % $ 4,996 4.15 % $ 2,680 4.73 % Asset backed securities(1) 2,601 2.45 5,966 2.35 1,223 2.64 266 2.84 State and political subdivisions(1) 312 1.96 766 2.88 508 3.79 199 3.73 Collateralized mortgage obligations 63 3.32 951 3.65 258 3.66 447 3.08 Other investments 896 2.78 26 5.46 Total $ 11,721 $ 13,424 $ 6,985 $ 3,618 (1) Yields calculated for interest revenue on non taxable investment securities includes the effect of taxable equivalent adjustments, a method of presentation in which interest income on tax exempt securities is adjusted to present the earnings performance on a basis equivalent to interest earned on fully taxable securities, with a corresponding charge to income tax expense. The adjustment is computed using a federal income tax rate of 35%, adjusted for applicable state income taxes, net of the related federal tax benefit. The taxable equivalent adjustment included in interest revenue to calculate the yields above was $45 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The maturity of asset backed securities is based upon the expected principal payments. LOANS U.S. and non U.S. loans as of December 31, and average loans outstanding for the years ended December 31, were as follows: 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 (Dollars in millions) U.S.: Commercial and financial $ 1,826 $ 2,344 $ 1,578 $ 2,479 $ 2,502 Lease financing 373 395 403 413 433 Total U.S. 2,199 2,739 1,981 2,892 2,935 Non U.S.: Commercial and industrial 526 424 289 725 837 Lease financing 1,904 1,858 1,719 1,639 1,364 Banks and other financial institutions 177 71 119 Other 8 14 18 Total non U.S. 2,430 2,282 2,193 2,449 2,338 Total loans $ 4,629 $ 5,021 $ 4,174 $ 5,341 $ 5,273 Average loans outstanding $ 5,689 $ 5,568 $ 5,105 $ 6,081 $ 5,444 44 At December 31, 2004, 5% of State Streets assets comprised loans and lease financing. Unearned revenue included in leases was $1.13 billion and $1.18 billion for non U.S. leases, and $114 million and $123 million for U.S. leases, as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Loan maturities for selected loan categories as of December 31, 2004, were as follows: | YEARS | Under 1 1 to 5 Over 5 (Dollars in millions) U.S. Commercial and financial $ 1,794 $ 30 $ 2 Lease financing 373 Total U.S. 1,794 30 375 Non U.S. Commercial and industrial 525 1 Lease financing 3 1,901 Total non U.S. 525 4 1,901 Total $ 2,319 $ 34 $ 2,276 The following table shows the classification of loans due after one year according to sensitivity to changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2004: (Dollars in millions) Loans and leases with predetermined interest rates $ 2,278 Loans with floating or adjustable interest rates 32 Total $ 2,310 CAPITAL State Streets objective is to maintain a strong capital base in order to provide financial flexibility for its business needs, including funding corporate growth and supporting clients cash management needs. As a state chartered bank and member of the Federal Reserve System, State Street Bank, State Streets principal subsidiary, is primarily regulated by the Federal Reserve Board, which has established guidelines for minimum capital ratios. State Street has developed internal capital adequacy policies to ensure that State Street Bank meets or exceeds the level required for the well capitalized category, the highest of the Federal Reserve Boards five capital categories. State Street Bank must meet the regulatory designation of well capitalized in order for State Street to maintain its status as a financial holding company. State Streets capital management emphasizes risk exposure rather than asset levels. State Streets Board of Directors has authorized a publicly announced stock purchase program for State Street Common Stock, which was first authorized by the Board in 1995, and subsequently increased several times, most recently in 2001. Under the 1995 program, Common Stock of the Corporation was authorized for purchase for use in employee benefit programs and for 45 general corporate purposes. The remaining number of shares authorized for purchase under this program was 4.260 million shares as of December 31, 2004. This 1995 stock purchase program was terminated by action of the Board effective February 17, 2005. In its place, State Streets Board of Directors has authorized a new publicly announced stock purchase program for State Street Common Stock for use in employee benefit programs and for other corporate purposes. The number of shares authorized for purchase under this new program is 15 million. As of the date of filing of this report on Form 10 K, no shares had been purchased under the new program and all 15 million shares remained available for purchase. State Street employs third party broker dealers to acquire shares on the open market for the Corporations publicly announced stock purchase program. RETURN ON EQUITY AND ASSETS AND CAPITAL RATIOS The return on equity, return on assets, dividend payout ratio and equity to assets ratios for reported results for the years ended or as of December 31, were as follows: 2004 2003 2002 Net Income to: Average stockholders equity 13.3 % 13.9 % 24.1 % Average total assets .84 .87 1.28 Dividends declared to net income 26.9 25.9 15.4 Average stockholders equity to average assets 6.3 6.3 5.3 Tangible common equity to adjusted total assets 4.5 4.5 4.9 Regulatory capital ratios were as follows as of December 31: | REGULATORY GUIDELINES | STATE STREET | STATE STREET BANK | Minimum Well Capitalized 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in millions) Regulatory Capital Ratios: Tier 1 capital 4 % 6 % 13.3 % 14.0 % 11.6 % 12.4 % Total capital 8 10 14.7 15.8 12.5 13.7 Tier 1 leverage ratio 3 5 5.5 5.6 5.3 5.4 At December 31, 2004, the Corporations and the Banks Tier 1 and total risk based capital ratios were down from year end 2003, resulting from the growth in retained earnings being out paced by growth in total risk weighted assets, primarily reflecting a change in the mix of investment securities and higher volumes of indemnified securities lending transactions. To manage fluctuations in the Tier 1 and total risk based capital of State Street and State Street Bank resulting from foreign currency translation, the Corporation has entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of its net foreign investment in non U.S. subsidiaries. The notional value of these contracts was 300 million, or approximately $407 million, at December 31, 2004. 46 On June 26, 2004, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision released the final version of its capital adequacy framework (Basel II). Basel IIs framework includes minimum capital requirements, including capital for operational risk. U.S. banking regulatory agencies must now apply international risk based capital guidance to rules to be implemented in the U.S. The U.S. regulatory agencies are expected to release proposed new rules for comment by mid 2005, with the final version anticipated by mid 2006. The new rules as applied in the U.S. are expected to become effective by January 1, 2007, subject to transitional implementation arrangements, and will become fully operational by January 1, 2008. Mandatory compliance will be required for large, internationally active U.S. institutions, such as State Street. In preparation for compliance, the Corporation has developed a comprehensive implementation program to monitor the status and progress of Basel II, and is in the process of implementing the requirements and assessing the potential impact of Basel II on the Corporation. At this time, the Corporation cannot predict the final form of the rules in the U.S., nor their impact on the Corporations risk based capital. DIVIDENDS AND MARKET PRICE | MARKET PRICE | Dividends Declared Low High End of Quarter 2004: Fourth Quarter $ .17 $ 39.91 $ 49.25 $ 49.12 Third Quarter .16 41.59 50.12 42.71 Second Quarter .16 45.39 54.39 49.04 First Quarter .15 49.00 56.90 52.13 2003: Fourth Quarter $ .15 $ 45.08 $ 53.63 $ 52.08 Third Quarter .14 38.65 48.51 45.00 Second Quarter .14 30.37 41.71 39.40 First Quarter .13 30.98 41.80 31.63 State Street has increased its quarterly dividend twice each year since 1978. Over the last ten years, dividends per share have grown at a 16% compound annual growth rate. Federal and State banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid by subsidiary banks to State Street. At December 31, 2004, State Street Bank had $1.69 billion of retained earnings available for distribution to State Street in the form of dividends. SPACESSM In January 2003, in connection with its acquisition of the GSS business (see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data), State Street issued $345 million, or 1.725 million units, of SPACESSM. SPACES are collateralized, forward purchase contract units for additional shares of common stock of State Street. Each of the SPACES has a stated amount of $200 and consists of PACESSM, a fixed share purchase contract and treasury securities, and COVERSSM, a variable share repurchase contract. The SPACES investors will receive total annual payments of 6.75% on the units, payable quarterly, consisting of an annual 4.00% contract payment on the COVERS, an annual 0.75% contract payment on 47 the PACES and a 2.00% annual return on the underlying treasury securities. The present value of the contract payments totaled $45 million, and was treated as a cost of capital and charged to surplus upon issuance. State Street will receive the proceeds of $345 million and issue common stock upon settlement of the fixed share purchase contracts underlying the SPACES units on November 15, 2005. Effective March 22, 2004, State Street exercised its right to fix the variable share settlement rate of the variable share repurchase contracts constituting part of the SPACES or existing separately as Separate COVERS, in accordance with the terms of the contracts. The variable share settlement rate is fixed at 0.6949 shares per contract in accordance with a formula specified in the contracts. After the effective date of March 22, 2004, a holder of a variable share repurchase contract (whether held as a component of a SPACES or as a Separate COVERS) may settle the variable share repurchase contract by delivery to the Purchase Contract Agent of that number of shares of common stock of State Street equal to the share settlement rate, as fixed. The impact of fixing the settlement rate for the SPACES and Separate COVERS was a reclassification of the recognized gains of $26 million associated with the mark to market of the variable share contracts from other assets to a reduction of surplus in stockholders equity. CROSS BORDER OUTSTANDINGS Countries within which State Street has cross border outstandings (primarily deposits) of at least 1% of its total assets as of December 31, were as follows: 2004 2003 2002 (Dollars in millions) United Kingdom $ 2,355 $ 4,243 $ 4,433 Germany 3,971 3,834 3,223 Australia 1,760 1,528 1,198 Japan 941 1,490 947 France 1,346 Canada 1,383 1,175 1,283 Total outstanding $ 10,410 $ 13,616 $ 11,084 Aggregate of cross border outstandings in countries having between .75% and 1% of total assets at December 31, 2004, was $894 million (Netherlands), $865 million (France) and $707 million (Sweden); at December 31, 2003, was $842 million (Netherlands); and at December 31, 2002, was $783 million (Netherlands). FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The short duration of State Streets assets and liabilities results in the fair value of its financial instruments equating to or closely approximating their balance sheet value. See Note 24 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further discussion. Further quantitative information on State Streets assets and liabilities is furnished in Notes 3 through 9 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 48 LIQUIDITY The primary objective of State Streets liquidity management is to ensure that the Corporation has sufficient funds to meet its commitments and business needs, including accommodating the transaction and cash management requirements of its clients. Liquidity is provided by State Streets access to global debt markets, its ability to gather additional deposits from its clients, maturing short term assets, sales of securities and repayment of clients loans. Client deposits and other funds provide multi currency, geographically diverse sources of liquidity. State Street maintains a large portfolio of liquid assets, defined as cash and due from banks, interest bearing deposits with banks, securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed, federal funds sold, trading account assets and investment securities. As of December 31, 2004, the Corporations defined liquid assets were $79.31 billion or 84% of total assets, a significant portion of which can be sold on the open market to meet liquidity needs. Securities carried at $24.77 billion and $13.28 billion at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, were designated as pledged securities for public and trust deposits, borrowed funds and for other purposes as provided by law. At December 31, 2004, State Street had defined short term liabilities, which included deposits, securities sold under repurchase agreements, federal funds purchased and other short term borrowings of $78.79 billion. State Street Bank can issue bank notes with an aggregate limit of $750 million and with original maturities ranging from 14 days to five years. At December 31, 2004, no notes payable were outstanding and all $750 million was available for issuance. State Street can issue commercial paper with an aggregate limit of $3.00 billion and with original maturities of up to 270 days from the date of issue. At December 31, 2004, State Street had $966 million of commercial paper outstanding. State Street maintains a universal shelf registration statement that allows for the offering and sale of unsecured debt securities, capital securities, common stock, depositary shares and preferred stock, and warrants to purchase such securities, including any shares into which the preferred stock and depositary shares may be convertible, or any combination thereof. At December 31, 2004, $469 million of State Streets shelf registration statement was available for issuance. In addition, in 2003, State Street Bank was authorized to issue $1.00 billion of subordinated bank notes that qualify as Tier 2 capital for bank regulatory purposes. At December 31, 2004, $600 million of subordinated bank notes remained available for issuance. The Corporation currently maintains a line of credit of CAD $800 million to support its Canadian securities processing operations. The line of credit has no stated termination date and is cancellable by either party with prior notice. At the close of business on December 31, 2004, State Street did not have any balance due on the line of credit. At December 31, 2004, $518 million was included in long term debt that related to the capital leases for One Lincoln Street, an office building located in Boston, Massachusetts and the One Lincoln Street Garage that State Street began leasing in 2004. State Street endeavors to maintain high investment grade ratings on its debt, as measured by independent credit rating agencies. High ratings on debt minimize borrowing costs and enhance State Streets liquidity by ensuring the largest possible market for the Corporations debt. 49 The credit ratings of State Street Corporation and State Street Bank are as follows at December 31, 2004: Standard & Poors Moodys Fitch State Street Corporation: Commercial paper A 1+ P 1 F1+ Senior debt AA Aa3 AA Subordinated debt A+ A1 A+ Capital securities A A1 A+ State Street Bank and Trust Company: Short term deposits A 1+ P 1 F1+ Long term deposits AA Aa2 AA Senior debt AA Aa2 AA Subordinated debt AA Aa3 A+ Outlook: Stable Stable Stable With the exception of the Fitch, Inc. rating on senior debt, which was rated AA in 2003, there have been no changes in State Streets ratings in 2004. The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows provides additional liquidity information. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS | PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD | CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS Total Less than 1 year 13 years 45 years Over 5 years (Dollars in millions) As of December 31, 2004 Long term debt(1) $ 3,602 $ 115 $ 231 $ 563 $ 2,693 Operating leases 1,163 181 296 227 459 Capital lease obligations 976 50 103 104 719 SPACES 19 16 3 Total contractual cash obligations $ 5,760 $ 362 $ 633 $ 894 $ 3,871 (1) Long term debt above excludes capital leases (reported as a separate line item) and the effect of interest rate swaps. Interest payments were calculated at the stated rate, with the exception of floating rate debt for which payments were calculated using the indexed rate in effect at December 31, 2004. 50 COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS | TENURE OF COMMITMENT | OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS Total amounts committed(1) Less than 1 year 13 years 45 years Over 5 years (Dollars in millions) As of December 31, 2004 Liquidity asset purchase agreements $ 19,890 $ 16,556 $ 2,034 $ 1,300 Loan commitments 12,731 11,049 1,135 542 $ 5 Standby letters of credit 4,155 1,472 1,676 538 469 Total commercial commitments $ 36,776 $ 29,077 $ 4,845 $ 2,380 $ 474 (1) Amounts committed are reported net of participations. Loan commitments (unfunded loans and unused lines of credit), liquidity asset purchase agreements and standby letters of credit are issued to accommodate the financing liquidity and credit enhancement needs of State Streets clients. Loan commitments are agreements by State Street to lend monies at a future date. Liquidity asset purchase agreements are commitments to purchase receivables or securities, subject to conditions established in the agreements. Approximately 85% of the loan commitments and asset purchase agreements expire within one year from the date of issue. As many of the commitments are expected to expire or renew without being drawn, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. RISK MANAGEMENT In providing services for institutional investors globally, State Street must manage and control certain inherent risks. These risks include credit risk, operational risk and market risk. Risk management is fundamentally the responsibility of the business areas and thus, is an integral component of State Streets business activities. A dedicated corporate group, Enterprise Risk Management, provides risk management support, coordination and oversight across the Corporation. State Street has a comprehensive and disciplined approach to risk management. The Board of Directors provides extensive review and oversight of the Corporations overall risk management program, including review of key risk metrics. Senior management is responsible for policy formulation, implementation of policies approved by the Board of Directors, and for day to day risk management. Enterprise Risk Management has the responsibility for overseeing the Corporations enterprise wide risk management policies and guidelines. Management of the business areas is responsible for managing risk in their core activities. During 2004, executive management committees, such as the Major Risk Committee, the Fiduciary Review Committee and Financial Policy Committee, were dedicated to the review of business activities with significant risk content. In addition, corporate committees, such as the Investment Committee and the Corporate Compliance Committee, focused on risk topics across the Corporation, and business level committees, such as the Securities Finance Risk Management Committee, provided focused business area risk management review and oversight. During 2005, State Street is considering a reorganization of its risk management committees. The Board of Directors has been apprised of managements intention to create an asset liability management committee that would be cross divisional and would assume the roles of some of these other committees. The risk management program is complemented by Corporate Audit, whose role is to provide the Board of Directors and management with continuous monitoring and control assessments to ensure adherence to the Corporations policies and procedures and the effectiveness of its system of internal controls. Additionally, the internal control environment is evaluated through external examinations and regulatory compliance efforts, including Statement on Auditing Standards No. 70, which is applicable to service organizations, the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991, and the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. 51 While State Street believes its risk management program is effective in managing the risks of its business, the effectiveness of its policies and procedures for managing risk exposure can never be fully assured. For example, a material counterparty failure or a default of a material obligor could have an adverse effect on the results of operations of the Corporation. ECONOMIC CAPITAL State Street has implemented a methodology to quantify economic capital. The Corporation defines economic capital as the capital required to protect bondholders against unexpected economic losses over a one year period at a level consistent with the solvency of a firm with a target debt rating. State Street quantifies capital requirements for the risks inherent in its business activities and groups them into one of the following broadly defined categories. Market risk: the risk of adverse financial impact due to fluctuations in market prices, primarily as they relate to State Streets trading activities. Structural interest rate risk: the risk of loss in non trading, asset liability management positions, primarily balance sheet asset and liability mismatches, caused by interest rate movements. Credit risk: the risk of loss as a result of a borrower or counterparty default. Operational risk: the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems, or from external events, which is consistent with the Basel II definition. Business risk: the risk of adverse changes to the Corporations earnings from business factors, including changes in the competitive environment or changes in the operational economics of business activities. Economic capital for each of these five categories is calculated on a stand alone basis using statistical modeling techniques and then aggregated at the State Street consolidated level. A capital reduction or diversification benefit is then applied to reflect the unlikely event of experiencing an extremely large loss in each risk at the same time. Economic capital levels are directly related to the Corporations risk profile. As such, it has become an integral part of State Streets internal capital assessment process, and along with regulatory capital discussed in the Capital section, a key component in ensuring that State Streets actual level of capital is commensurate with its risk profile, in compliance with all regulatory requirements, and sufficient to provide the Corporation with the financial flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives. The framework and methodologies to quantify capital for each of the risk types have been developed by Enterprise Risk Management and Treasury and are designed to be consistent with the Corporations risk management principles. The framework has been approved by senior management and has been reviewed by the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors. Due to the evolving nature of quantification techniques, State Street expects to continue to refine the methodologies used to estimate its economic capital requirements. MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk of adverse financial impact due to changes in market prices, such as interest rates and foreign exchange rates. State Street engages in trading and investment activities to serve clients investment and trading needs and to contribute to overall corporate earnings and liquidity. In the conduct of these activities, the Corporation is subject to, and assumes, market risk. The level of risk State Street assumes is a function of the Corporations overall objectives and liquidity needs, client requirements, and market volatility. State Street manages its overall market risk through a comprehensive risk management framework. This structure includes a market risk management group that reports independently to senior management. Market risk from foreign exchange and trading activities is controlled through established limits on aggregate and net open positions, sensitivity to changes in interest rates, and concentrations. These limits are supplemented by stop loss thresholds. The Corporation uses a variety of risk management tools and techniques, including value at risk, to measure, monitor and control market risk. All limits and measurement techniques 52 are reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a regular basis by business managers, the market risk management group and the Investment Committee. State Street uses foreign exchange contracts and a variety of financial derivative instruments to support clients needs, conduct trading activities, and manage its interest rate and currency risk. These activities are designed to create trading revenue or hedge net interest revenue. In addition, the Corporation provides services related to derivative instruments in its role as both a manager and servicer of financial assets. State Streets clients use derivatives to manage the financial risks associated with their investment goals and business activities. With the growth of cross border investing, clients have an increasing need for foreign exchange forward contracts to convert currency for international investment and to manage the currency risk in international investment portfolios. As an active participant in the foreign exchange markets, State Street provides foreign exchange forward contracts and over the counter options in support of these client needs. TRADING ACTIVITIES: FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY As part of its trading activities, the Corporation assumes positions in both the foreign exchange and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and using financial derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange and interest rate options, and interest rate swaps. As of December 31, 2004, the notional amounts of these derivative instruments were $375.87 billion, of which $364.36 billion were foreign exchange forward contracts. In the aggregate, long and short foreign exchange forward positions are closely matched to minimize currency and interest rate risk. All foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at current market rates. The Corporation uses a variety of risk measurement and estimation techniques, including value at risk. Value at risk is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical confidence interval. State Street uses a risk management system to estimate value at risk daily for all material trading positions. The Corporation has adopted standards for estimating value at risk and maintains capital for market risk in accordance with the Federal Reserves Capital Adequacy Guidelines for market risk. Value at risk is estimated for a 99% one tail confidence interval and an assumed one day holding period using a historical observation period of greater than one year. A 99% one tail confidence interval implies that daily trading losses should not exceed the estimated value at risk more than 1% of the time, or approximately three days out of the year. The methodology uses a simulation approach based on observed changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates and takes into account the resulting diversification benefits provided from the mix of the Corporations trading positions. Like all quantitative risk measures, value at risk is subject to certain limitations and assumptions inherent to the methodology. State Streets methodology gives equal weight to all market rate observations regardless of how recently the market rates were observed. The estimate is calculated using static portfolios consisting of positions held at the end of the trading day. Implicit in the estimate is the assumption that no intraday action is taken by management during adverse market movements. As a result, the methodology does not represent risk associated with intraday changes in positions or intraday price volatility. 53 The following table presents State Streets market risk for its trading activities as measured by its value at risk methodology: VALUE AT RISK Average Maximum Minimum (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2004: Foreign exchange products $ 1.3 $ 3.5 $ .3 Interest rate products 1.6 3.0 1.0 2003: Foreign exchange products $ 1.1 $ 2.9 $ .4 Interest rate products 1.8 2.8 1.2 State Street compares actual daily profit and losses from trading activities to estimated one day value at risk. For the years ended. December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, State Street did not experience any trading losses in excess of its end of day value at risk estimate. NON TRADING ACTIVITIES: CURRENCY RISK State Street had $23.30 billion of non U.S. dollar denominated non trading assets as of December 31, 2004, which were funded by non U.S. dollar denominated deposits. Ninety six percent of State Streets non U.S. dollar denominated, non trading assets were in eight major currencies. Since non trading assets are generally invested in the same currency in which the initial deposits are received, the risk associated with changes to currency exchange rates is minimal. To the extent that deposits are not reinvested in the same currency, the resulting net currency positions are managed as part of trading risk as discussed above. In general, the maturities of these non trading assets and liabilities are short term. To the extent duration mismatches exist, they are managed as part of State Streets consolidated asset/liability management activities, and the related market risk is included in the following non trading interest rate sensitivity disclosure. NON TRADING ACTIVITIES: INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY The objective of interest rate sensitivity management is to provide sustainable net interest revenue under various economic environments and to protect asset values from adverse effects of changes in interest rates. State Street manages the structure of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities by adjusting the mix, yields and maturity or repricing characteristics based on market conditions. During 2004, State Street created a centralized treasury function to manage State Streets interest rate risk. Since interest bearing sources of funds are predominantly short term, State Street maintains a relatively short term structure for its interest earning assets, including money market assets, investments and loans. Interest rate swaps are used minimally as part of overall asset and liability management to augment State Streets management of interest rate exposure. State Street uses three tools for measuring interest rate risk: simulation, duration and gap analysis. Key assumptions in the simulation, duration and gap models include the timing of cash flows, maturity and repricing of financial instruments, changes in market conditions, capital planning, and deposit sensitivity. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and as a result, the models cannot precisely calculate net interest revenue or precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue and economic value. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies, among other factors. Simulation models facilitate the evaluation of the potential range of net interest revenue under a most likely scenario, alternative interest rate scenarios and rate shock tests. Based upon results of the simulation model as of December 31, 2004, there would be a decrease in net interest revenue of $49 million over the following 12 months for an immediate 100 basis point increase in 54 all global interest rates. If interest rates immediately decreased by 100 basis points, the model shows an increase in net interest revenue of less than $3 million over the following 12 months. Duration measures the change in the economic value of assets and liabilities for given changes in interest rates. Based upon the results of the duration model as of December 31, 2004, there would be a decrease in the economic value of assets, net of liabilities, of $371 million, or .40% of assets, as a result of an immediate increase in all global interest rates of 100 basis points. In the event of an immediate decrease of 100 basis points to interest rates, the model shows an increase of $271 million, or .29% of assets, to the economic value of assets, net of liabilities. The third measure of interest rate risk, gap analysis, is the difference in asset and liability repricing on a cumulative basis within a specified time period. As of year end 2004, interest bearing liabilities will reprice faster than interest earning assets over the next 12 months, as has been typical for State Street. If all other variables remained constant, in the short term, falling interest rates would lead to net interest revenue that is higher than it would otherwise have been. Rising rates would lead to lower net interest revenue. Other important determinants of net interest revenue are balance sheet size and mix, interest rate spreads, the slope of the yield curve, and rate levels. Measures of interest rate sensitivity are monitored by the respective business units, Treasury and the Investment and Financial Policy Committees. CREDIT RISK Credit and counterparty risk is the risk that a borrower or counterparty may not be able or willing to repay borrowings or settle contractual obligations. The extension of credit and acceptance of counterparty risk are governed by corporate guidelines that consider the markets served, conservativism, counterparty and country concentration, and regulatory compliance. State Street maintains robust guidelines and procedures to monitor and manage all aspects of credit and counterparty risk. Investments in debt and equity securities, including investments in affiliates, are closely monitored in relation to corporate guidelines set by a corporate oversight committee. These guidelines set limits on counterparty and country concentration, volume of securities held, and portfolio mix. State Street periodically reviews its investment portfolio to determine if an other than temporary impairment has occurred. This review encompasses all investment securities and includes such quantitative factors as the length of time the cost basis has exceeded the fair value and the severity of the impairment measured as the ratio of fair value to amortized cost, and includes all investment securities for which State Street has issuer specific concerns regardless of quantitative factors. After a full review of all investment securities, taking into consideration current economic conditions, adverse situations that might affect the ability of State Street to fully collect interest and principal, timing of future payments, the value of underlying collateral of asset backed securities, and other relevant factors, State Street determined that the total of non performing assets at December 31, 2004, was $7 million, comparable to $7 million at year end 2003. Rigorous processes for credit approval and monitoring cover cash and due from banks, interest bearing deposits with banks, securities sold under repurchase agreements, federal funds sold, loans and lease financings, foreign exchange trading, off balance sheet credit facilities and enhancements, and indemnified securities lending. Thorough due diligence appropriate to the size and tenor of the exposure and the size and quality of the counterparty is completed as part of the approval and renewal process. Exposures to these entities are aggregated and evaluated by a dedicated corporate risk management group. State Street purchases securities under agreements to resell the securities. Risk is managed by establishing the acceptability of counterparties, limiting the types of securities purchased almost exclusively to U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities, which are lower in credit risk, by taking possession or control of the assets underlying the transactions, by monitoring the level of underlying collateral and by limiting the duration of the agreements. Securities are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary from the borrower. The majority of repurchase agreements are short term, with maturities of less than 90 days. 55 State Streets credit guidelines address the size of individual loan and lease exposures to reduce risk through diversification. Loans and leases are evaluated on an individual basis to determine the appropriateness of originating or renewing the exposure. State Street does not have a general rollover policy. State Street maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable credit losses in the loan portfolio. Managements review of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is ongoing throughout the year and is based on many factors, including previous loss experience, current economic conditions and adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay, timing of future payments, estimated value of the underlying collateral and other relevant factors. State Street uses an internal rating system to assess potential risk of loss based on current economic and or client financial indicators. Loans and leases in excess of $1 million that are adversely classified using State Streets internal rating system are reviewed individually to evaluate risk of loss and are assigned a specific allocation of the allowance. These specific allocations include evaluations of the counterpartys financial strength, discounted cash flows, collateral, appraisals and guarantees. The remainder of the allowance is a general reserve for the exposures not specifically allocated a portion of the allowance, and takes into account factors such as portfolio concentrations, expected losses, current economic conditions and other risk factors. The provision for loan losses is a charge to earnings for the current period that is required to maintain the total allowance at a level considered adequate in relation to the level of risk in the loan portfolio. In 2004, State Street reversed $18 million through the provision for loan losses, reflecting a reduction in specific credit risk exposures and a reduction in the reserve that resulted from an enhanced evaluation methodology. In 2003, no provision for loan losses was recorded. The provision for loan losses was $4 million, $10 million and $9 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The changes in the allowance for loan losses for the years ended December 31, were as follows: 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 (Dollars in millions) U.S.: Balance at beginning of year $ 43 $ 43 $ 40 $ 41 $ 33 Provision for loan losses (15 ) 4 8 7 Loan charge offs commercial and financial (3 ) (9 ) Recoveries commercial and financial 3 1 Transferred upon sale(1) (1 ) Reclassification(2) (14 ) Balance at end of year U.S. 14 43 43 40 41 Non U.S.: Balance at beginning of year 18 18 18 16 15 Provision for loan losses (3 ) 2 2 Loan charge offs (1 ) Reclassification(2) (11 ) Balance at end of year Non U.S. 4 18 18 18 16 Total balance at end of year $ 18 $ 61 $ 61 $ 58 $ 57 Ratio of net charge offs (recoveries) to average loans outstanding .00 % .00 % .04 % .14 % (.02 )% (1) In December 2002, State Street completed the sale of its Global Trade Banking business, which included the transfer of $1 million of the allowance for loan loss. (2) During 2004, State Street reclassified $25 million of the allowance for loan losses to other liabilities as a reserve for off balance sheet commitments. Subsequent to the reclassification, the reserve for off balance sheet commitments was reduced by $10 million, and recorded as an offset to other operating expenses. 56 At December 31, 2004, the allowance for loan losses was $18 million, less than 1% of total loans, compared with an allowance of $61 million, or 1.21% of total loans a year ago. Past due loans are loans on which principal or interest payments are over 90 days delinquent, but where interest continues to be accrued. There were no past due loans as of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. There were less than $1 million in past due loans as of December 31, 2001 and 2000. Past due loans to non U.S. clients at December 31, 2001 were less than $1 million. There were no past due loans to non U.S. clients at December 31, 2000. It is State Streets policy to place loans on a non accrual basis when they become 60 days past due as to either principal or interest, or when, in the opinion of management, full collection of principal or interest is unlikely. Loans 60 days past due, but considered both well secured and in the process of collection, are treated as exceptions and may be exempted from non accrual status. When the loan is placed on non accrual status, the accrual of interest is discontinued and previously recorded but unpaid interest is reversed and charged against net interest revenue. There were no non accrual loans at year end 2004, 2003 and 2002, less than $1 million at year end 2001, and $4 million at year end 2000. Non accrual loans for year end 2001 and 2000 were to U.S. clients. State Street provides clients with liquidity and credit enhancement facilities, in the form of letters of credit, lines of credit and liquidity asset purchase agreements. These exposures are subject to the same credit analysis, approval and review processes as employed for the loan and lease portfolio. State Street maintains a separate reserve for probable credit losses related to certain of these off balance sheet activities. Managements review of the adequacy of the reserve is ongoing throughout the year. On behalf of its clients, State Street lends securities to creditworthy banks, broker dealers and other institutions. In certain circumstances, State Street may indemnify its clients for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities. State Street requires the borrowers to provide collateral in an amount equal to or in excess of 102% of the fair market value of the securities borrowed. The borrowed securities are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary. State Street held, as agent, cash and U.S. government securities totaling $360.61 billion and $271.27 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. OPERATIONAL RISK State Street defines operational risk as the potential for losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, and from external events. State Street is the worlds leading provider of services to institutional investors and the Corporations clients have a broad array of complex and specialized servicing, confidentiality and fiduciary requirements. Active management of operational risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business and responsibility for the management of operational risk lies with every individual in the Corporation. State Streets Operational Risk Policy Statement defines operational risk and details roles and responsibilities for managing operational risk. It provides a mandate within which sound practices, including programs, processes, and those elements required by regulation, are implemented to ensure that operational risk is identified, measured, managed and controlled in an effective and consistent manner across the Corporation. State Street maintains an operational risk governance structure to ensure responsibilities are clearly defined and to provide independent oversight of operational risk management. Enterprise Risk Management oversees the Corporations enterprise wide operational risk management program. The Major Risk and Operational Risk Committees review key metrics and policies related to operational risk, provide oversight functions to ensure compliance with the operational risk program, and escalate operational risk issues of note to the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors. Corporate Audit performs independent reviews of the application of operational risk management practices and methodologies and reports to the Examining and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. State Streets internal control environment is designed to provide a sound operational environment. The Corporations discipline in managing operational risk provides the structure to identify, evaluate, control, monitor, measure, mitigate and report operational risk. 57 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT RISK Assets under custody and assets under management are held in a fiduciary or custodial capacity for State Streets clients and are not recorded on the Corporations balance sheet in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Similarly, collateral funds resulting from State Streets securities lending services are held by State Street as agent; therefore, these assets are not consolidated in the Corporations Consolidated Statement of Condition. State Street sells and distributes securities for two types of off balance sheet entities that are not included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation. See Note 23 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information regarding special purpose entities. The risks associated with providing administration, liquidity, and or credit enhancements to both types of off balance sheet entities are reviewed as part of State Streets corporate risk management process in a manner that is consistent with applicable policies and guidelines. State Street believes that it has sufficient liquidity and has provided adequate credit reserves to cover any risks associated with these activities. As further explained in Note 22 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, State Street utilizes derivative instruments in the Corporations balance sheet management program. Hedge ineffectiveness from these derivative instruments exposes the Corporation to potential volatility in its Consolidated Statement of Income. If the interest rate hedges employed in the Corporations balance sheet management strategy were determined to be less than perfectly effective, the ineffectiveness would be reported in current period earnings. For hedges determined to be not highly effective, the entire change in value of the derivatives would be reported in current period earnings through processing fees and other revenue. Rapid changes in interest rates would have a significant impact on the value of certain interest rate derivatives acquired in the trading portfolio that are held as an economic hedge against certain available for sale securities. The changes in value of the interest rate contracts would be recorded in processing fees and other revenue. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Critical accounting estimates are those that require management to make assumptions that are difficult, subjective or complex about matters that are uncertain and may change in subsequent periods, resulting in changes to reported results. State Streets significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The majority of these accounting policies do not require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates, or the variability of the estimates is not material. However, the following policies could be deemed critical. State Streets management has discussed these critical accounting estimates with the Examining and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. LEASE FINANCING State Street has a leveraged lease financing portfolio, including lease in lease out structures, consisting of U.S. and cross border financings, primarily for transportation equipment, including trains, aircraft and ships. State Street has provided lease financing services since 1981, and at December 31, 2004, the portfolio aggregated $2.28 billion, and is reflected in Note 4 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. This portfolio is recorded net of non recourse debt, and revenue is recognized as interest revenue. Interest revenue from the lease portfolio was $57 million in 2004. Due to the long term, cross border nature of many of these leases and the number of assumptions, including 58 residual values, cash flows and income tax regulations and rates, risk is associated with this revenue should any of these assumptions change in future periods. CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER RESERVES State Street has established reserves for risk of losses, including loan losses and tax contingencies. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level adequate to absorb probable losses as further described in Note 1 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. In the normal course of business, State Street is subject to challenges from U.S. and non U.S. tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. See Note 19 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information on tax matters. PENSION ACCOUNTING State Street and certain of its subsidiaries participate in a non contributory defined benefit plan. In addition to the primary plan, State Street has non qualified supplemental plans that provide certain officers with defined pension benefits in excess of allowable qualified plan limits. Non U.S. employees participate in local plans. The reported liability associated with these plans is dependent on many estimates such as the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and a series of actuarial assumptions. Management determines these estimates based upon currently available market and industry data, historical performance of the plan and its assets, and consultation with the Corporations actuaries. Management believes the estimates and assumptions used to determine the reported benefit obligation and pension expense are reasonable and reflect the terms of the plans in the current economic environment based upon information from the best available resources. Pension expense in future years is affected by the variance of the assumed rate of return from the actual return on plan assets. This variance is amortized over future years. A 1% change in the actual return on plan assets or the discount rate would affect State Streets earnings by less than $.01 per share. NEW ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS Information related to new accounting pronouncements appears in Note 1 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 59 To Our Shareholders As the worlds leading provider of services to institutional investors, we help our customers implement their global investment strategies. At a more fundamental level, our capabilities help spread the benefits of sound investment around the world, as demand grows for professional care and management of financial assets. For decades, we have not lost sight of our mission and we continue to provide the stability, safety and soundness that you have come to expect from State Street. Three themes guided our actions in 2004. First, we benefited from our expanded presence, having successfully transitioned the Global Securities Services (GSS) business acquired from Deutsche Bank in 2003. Mandates from our customers, both existing and new, generated 19 percent gains on an operating basis in servicing and management fee revenue. Assets under custody grew to $9.5 trillion and assets under management to $1.4 trillion, record levels for both. Second, we heightened our focus on institutional investors and sharpened our priorities. We looked closely at our business model and made tough decisions to eliminate or combine operations that did not match our long term objectives. Third, we confronted the realities of a slower growth environment by carefully allocating resources and implementing more rigorous expense management. Our business remained strong in 2004. Operating revenue rose 14 percent and earnings per share increased 8 percent, marking our 27th consecutive year of operating EPS growth. Around the world, we added more than 1,600 mandates during the year, including a groundbreaking multijurisdictional outsourcing contract from AXA Investment Managers, and expanded relationships with existing customers. We launched new investment products and broadened our foreign exchange and equity trading services globally. The ever evolving regulatory landscape increased demand from customers for reporting tools and services that help them improve transparency and controls. State Street Global Advisors continues to lead across active, enhanced and passive investment management products and strategies. Sadly, the industry lost a first class executive, and we lost a friend, when SSgA Chairman and CEO Timothy B. Harbert passed away unexpectedly in August. SSqAs strong performance is a tribute to the team that Tim helped to build. The task before us is to position State Street as the premier provider in all the markets we serve, while generating consistent earnings in a period of slower growth. Achieving this requires balance. We will continue to apply greater fiscal discipline and focus on expenses, while still maintaining our distinct entrepreneurial spirit. I am committed to delivering high performance in our business, opportunity for our employees, and active participation in our communities. We are working around the clock worldwide to ensure that success. Thank you for investing in State Street. Sincerely, Ronald E. Logue Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 60 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Information concerning quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk appears in Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation under the caption Market Risk.
