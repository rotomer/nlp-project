ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW State Street Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis report two lines of business. Investment Servicing provides services for mutual funds and collective investment funds, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, foundations, endowments, and other investment pools worldwide. Products include custody, product and participant level accounting, daily pricing and administration; master trust and master custody; recordkeeping; foreign exchange, brokerage and other trading services; securities finance; deposit and short term investment facilities; loans and lease financing; investment manager and hedge fund manager operations outsourcing; and performance, risk and compliance analytics to support institutional investors. Investment Management offers a broad array of services for managing financial assets, including investment management and investment research services, primarily for institutional investors worldwide. These services include passive and active U.S. and non U.S. equity and fixed income strategies, and other related services, such as securities finance. For financial information about these business lines, see the Line of Business Information section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or Discussion and Analysis, and Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. This Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and the related Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Form 10 K. Certain previously reported amounts presented in this Discussion and Analysis have been reclassified to conform to current period classifications. The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the application of certain accounting policies that materially affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates that require management to make assumptions that are difficult, subjective or complex about matters that are uncertain and may change in subsequent periods are discussed in more depth in the Significant Accounting Estimates section of this Discussion and Analysis. Information related to recent accounting developments is included in Notes 1 and 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this Discussion and Analysis to State Street, we, us, our or similar terms mean State Street Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. From time to time, in executing our strategic plan, we may enter into business acquisitions and strategic alliances, and may divest non strategic operations. We continuously review and assess various business opportunities related to this strategy. For more financial information about our acquisition and divestiture activities, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This Discussion and Analysis contains statements that are considered forward looking statements within the meaning of U.S. federal securities laws. Forward looking statements include statements about our confidence and strategies and our expectations about revenue and market growth, acquisitions and divestitures, new technologies, services and opportunities, and earnings. These forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially. Additional information about forward looking statements and related risks and uncertainties is included in this Form 10 K under Item 1A. State Street Corporation 15 (1) 2002 earnings per share included the gain on the sale of the divested Corporate Trust business of $.90 per share. (2) 2003 earnings per share included the combined gains on sales of the divested Corporate Trust and Private Asset Management businesses of $.68 per share, and combined charges for divestiture costs, GSS acquisition merger and integration costs, restructuring expenses, settlement of a state tax matter and a loss on real estate sold equal to $.86 per share. (3) 2004 earnings per share included GSS merger and integration costs of $.12 per share. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS For 2005, we recorded net income from continuing operations of $945 million, up $147 million, or 18%, from net income of $798 million in 2004. Fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.82 in 2005, up 20% from $2.35 in 2004. Earnings per share for 2004 included $62 million, or $.12 per share, of merger and integration costs associated with the 2003 acquisition of a substantial portion of the Global Securities Services, or GSS, business of Deutsche Bank AG. We remained focused on achieving our previously disclosed financial goals in 2005, carefully balancing revenue growth with continued expense management. This focus allowed us to generate positive operating leverage for the year, which we define as a rate of total revenue growth that exceeds the rate of growth of total operating expenses. Total revenue for 2005 grew 11% while total operating expenses increased only 8%. We continued to deepen existing customer relationships and expand new product capabilities. These factors, combined with new business growth, enabled us to achieve our financial goals in moderately improving financial markets. We continue to see the most significant opportunities for growth outside of the U.S. For 2005, 39% of our total revenue was from non U.S. activities, up from 37% for 2004, and approximately 7,800 employees worked outside the U.S. We expect that eventually, we will derive 50% of total revenue from outside the United States, as a result of the growth of savings and retirement assets in Europe and the Asia Pacific region. We managed our balance sheet to better position State Street for rising interest rates during 2005. We expanded our investment securities portfolio and adjusted the mix of investments to include higher yielding, floating rate securities. As a result, net interest revenue in 2005 increased by 6% from 2004. Including taxable equivalent adjustments for 2005 and 2004 of $42 million and $45 million, respectively, net interest revenue increased by 5% from 2004. Additional information is included in the Net Interest Revenue section. Positive operating leverage was also generated through expense control. Managing our expenses involved careful allocation of headcount, realignment of our real estate portfolio and the establishment of other cost efficiency measures. 16 State Street Corporation (1) 2002 total revenue included the gain on the sale of the divested Corporate Trust business of $495 million. (2) 2003 total revenue included the combined gains on sales of the divested Corporate Trust and Private Asset Management businesses of $345 million and a loss on real estate sold of $13 million. Revenue Total revenue for 2005 was $5.47 billion, an increase of $522 million from $4.95 billion in 2004. Revenue growth from 2004 reflected growth in servicing, management, trading and securities finance fees, as well as higher net interest revenue. Collectively, servicing and management fees for 2005 were up $339 million, or 12%, from 2004. The increases were attributable to new business from existing and new customers and higher equity market valuations. Assets under custody increased to a record level of $10.12 trillion, up $624 billion from $9.50 trillion a year ago. Assets under management also increased to a record level of $1.44 trillion, up $87 billion from $1.35 trillion a year ago. Trading services revenue was $694 million, up $99 million compared to $595 million a year ago, reflecting a higher dollar volume of foreign exchange trades for customers and a higher volume of transition management business. Securities finance fees were $330 million for 2005, an improvement of $71 million from $259 million in 2004, benefiting from improved spreads and an increase in average loan volume. Processing fees and other revenue was $302 million in 2005, compared with $308 million in 2004. Net interest revenue for 2005 was $907 million, an increase of $48 million from $859 million in 2004, due to an increase in average balance sheet size and changes in balance sheet mix, somewhat offset by increased funding costs and a flatter yield curve. Operating Expenses Operating expenses were $4.04 billion for 2005, up $282 million from 2004. Expense growth in 2005 was driven in part by higher salaries and employee benefits expense, primarily from increased staffing levels to accommodate new business and higher incentive compensation expense due to improved earnings. Additionally, expense growth reflected an increase in transaction processing expense related to higher transaction volumes and higher subcustodian fees resulting from higher net asset values. Higher occupancy expense in 2005 reflected a $26 million charge related to a long term sub lease agreement, somewhat offset by a $16 million charge in 2004, and higher occupancy costs in Europe associated with new business. Higher other expenses reflected an increase in professional services incurred for compliance and regulatory initiatives. These increases were somewhat offset by reductions in information systems and communications expense. In addition, 2004 operating expenses included $62 million of merger and integration costs related to the GSS acquisition, and $21 million of restructuring costs related to a workforce reduction. Discontinued Operations Results for 2005 included a net loss from discontinued operations of $107 million (pre tax charge of $165 million reduced by related tax benefit of $58 million), or $.32 per share. During the third quarter of 2005, we committed to a plan to divest our ownership interest in Bel Air Investment Advisors LLC, or Bel Air. The decision to divest will allow us to further sharpen our strategic focus on accommodating the needs of global institutional investors. Additional information about the Bel Air divestiture is included in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. State Street Corporation 17 Significant reconciling items between GAAP and operating basis diluted earnings per share are described in the footnotes to the chart on page 16. Financial Goals In November 2004, we announced financial goals for State Street for 2005 and beyond. These financial goals are: (1) growth in operating basis earnings per share from continuing operations between 10% and 15%; (2) growth in operating basis revenue between 8% and 12%; and (3) operating basis return on shareholders equity from continuing operations between 14% and 17%. These goals are measured on an operating basis. Operating basis results, as defined by management, include taxable equivalent basis net interest revenue with a corresponding charge to income tax expense, and for 2004, excluded one time merger and integration costs of $62 million, equal to $.12 per share after tax. We measure our financial goals and related results on an operating basis to provide financial information that is comparable from period to period, and to present comparable financial trends with respect to our ongoing businesses and operations. We believe that this financial information facilitates the understanding and analysis of State Streets ongoing activities in addition to financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. For 2005, we achieved our financial goals. We increased our operating basis earnings per share from continuing operations by 14%, from $2.47 to $2.82 (or 20% from $2.35 on a GAAP basis). Our operating basis revenue increased 10% from $5.00 billion to $5.52 billion (including taxable equivalent adjustments of $45 million and $42 million, respectively); and we recorded return on shareholders equity from continuing operations of 15.3%. Our financial goals remain in place for 2006, and we expect 2006 financial results to be approximately in the middle of the above stated ranges. Information about risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected is included in this Form 10 K under Item 1A. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Revenue We are focused on maintaining our position as one of the worlds leading specialists in servicing collective investment funds, mutual funds and pension plans. Over the past five years, we have made great strides in gaining business outside the United States. For 2005, non U.S. revenue was approximately 39% of our total revenue, compared to 26% in 2000. We provide reliable, easy to integrate investment services that are global and enable our customers to develop and launch competitive new investment products, as well as providing active, including enhanced, and passive investment management products and strategies. We provide fund accounting, custody, investment management, securities finance, transfer agency services, and operations outsourcing for investment managers and hedge fund managers. These services support the complex financial strategies and transactions of our customers worldwide, in any time zone across multiple currencies. Our focus on the total needs of the customer allows us to develop active, long term relationships that result in high customer retention, cross selling opportunities and recurring revenue. The servicing markets in which we compete are very price competitive, and we remain focused on winning and retaining customer business. This focus requires a strong commitment to customers while constantly working toward providing services at lower unit costs. Our broad range of services generates fee revenue and net interest revenue. Fee revenue generated by investment servicing and investment management is augmented by securities finance, trading services and other processing fee revenue. We earn net interest revenue from customer deposits and short term investment activities. We provide deposit services and short term investment vehicles, such as repurchase agreements 18 State Street Corporation and commercial paper, to meet customers needs for high grade liquid investments, and invest these sources of funds and additional borrowings in assets yielding a higher rate, generating net interest revenue. Fee Revenue Total fee revenue was $4.55 billion for 2005 compared to $4.05 billion in 2004, an increase of $503 million. Servicing and management fees are the largest components of fee revenue, and combined comprised 71% of total 2005 fee revenue. Servicing fees increased 9% over 2004, and management fees increased 21%, as a result of new business from existing and new customers and higher equity market valuations. Servicing and management fees are a function of several factors, including the mix and volume of assets under custody and assets under management, securities positions held and the volume of portfolio transactions, as well as the types of products and services used by customers, and are affected by changes in worldwide equity and fixed income valuations. In general, servicing fees are impacted, in part, by changes in daily average valuations of assets under custody, while management fees are impacted by changes in month end valuations of assets under management. However, additional factors, such as transaction volumes, balance credits, customer minimum balances and other factors may have a significant impact on this revenue. Management fee revenue is more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue. However, performance fees have become a larger component of management fee revenue over the last year. Performance fees are generated when the performance of managed funds exceeds peer or equity market benchmarks specified in the management agreements. We estimate, assuming all other factors remain constant, that a 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity values would result in a corresponding change in our total revenue of approximately 2%. If fixed income security values were to increase or decrease by 10%, we would anticipate a corresponding change of approximately 1% in our total revenue. The following table presents selected equity market indices. Daily averages and the averages of month end indices demonstrate worldwide equity market valuation changes that impact servicing and management fee revenue, respectively. Year end indices impact the value of assets under custody and management at those dates. The index names listed in the table and elsewhere in this Discussion and Analysis are service marks of their respective owners.

Products and services include custody; product and participant level accounting; daily pricing and administration; recordkeeping; investment manager and hedge fund manager operations outsourcing services; master trust and master custody; and performance, risk and compliance analytics. Servicing fees for 2005 of $2.47 billion were up $211 million from 2004, primarily the result of new business from existing and new customers, as well as higher equity market valuations. We are the largest provider of mutual fund custody and accounting services in the United States. We distinguish ourselves from other mutual fund service providers because customers make extensive use of a number of our services, including accounting, daily pricing and fund administration. We calculate more than 31% of the U.S. mutual fund prices provided to NASDAQ that appear daily in The Wall Street Journal and other publications with an accuracy rate of 99.9%. With a 37% market share, we have a leading position in the market for servicing U.S. tax exempt assets for corporate and public pension funds. We provide trust and valuations services for more than 4,500 daily priced portfolios, making us a leader for both monthly and daily valuation services. Our business continued to grow outside the United States. In 2005, servicing fees derived from customers outside the U.S. were approximately 40% of total servicing fees, up from 34% in 2004. We have a global custodian network that spans more than 100 geographic markets. We provide custody services for more than 20% of fund assets in Canada. In Germany, we provide Depotbank services for more than 19% of retail and institutional fund assets. In the United Kingdom, we provide custody services for 19% of pension fund assets and provide administration services to more than 21% of mutual fund assets. We service more than 10% of the hedge fund market, largely offshore, through International Fund Services, a company we acquired in 2002. In addition, we service more than $500 billion of offshore assets, primarily domiciled in the Cayman Islands, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Channel Islands. We have more than $640 billion in assets under administration in the Asia Pacific region, and are a leader in Japan with more than 36% of the trust assets held by non domestic trust banks. Our services are recognized globally and in 2005, we were named Best at Investor Services in North America by Euromoney, Best Custodian by The Asset magazine, Best Hedge Fund Administrator by Institutional Investors Alpha magazine, European Mutual Fund Administrator of the Year by International Custody & Fund Administration and Top Rated in Global Custodians Hedge Fund Administration Survey. 20 State Street Corporation At year end 2005, our total assets under custody were $10.12 trillion, compared to $9.50 trillion a year earlier. The value of assets under custody is a broad measure of the relative size of various markets served. Changes in the value of assets under custody do not necessarily result in proportional changes in revenue. Assets under custody at December 31 consisted of the following: ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 20042005 AGR 20002005 CAGR (Dollars in billions) As of December 31, Customers in the U.S.: Mutual funds $ 3,891 $ 3,385 $ 3,105 $ 2,719 $ 2,794 15 % 8 % Pensions, insurance and other investment pools 4,136 4,093 3,198 2,734 2,737 1 8 Customers outside the U.S. 2,094 2,019 988 718 672 4 26 Acquired with GSS(1) 2,079 Total $ 10,121 $ 9,497 $ 9,370 $ 6,171 $ 6,203 7 11 Non U.S. securities as a percentage of total 23 % 22 % 12 % 14 % 13 % (1) Assets relating to GSS customers, the majority of which had not yet converted to our systems, at December 31, 2003.

These services are offered through State Street Global Advisors, or SSgA, a division of State Street. Based upon assets under management, SSgA is the largest manager of institutional assets worldwide, the largest manager of assets for tax exempt organizations (primarily pension plans) in the United States, and the second largest investment manager overall in the world. SSgA offers a broad array of investment strategies, including passive and active, such as enhanced and hedge fund management, using quantitative and fundamental State Street Corporation 21 methods for both U.S. and global equities and fixed income securities. SSgA also renewed its focus on exchange traded funds, or ETFs, launching new offerings such as the SPDR Dividend ETFs, and saw growth in some of its innovative approaches such as the streetTRACKS Gold Shares. For 2005, management fees were $751 million, up $128 million from 2004. Management fees showed continued strength outside the United States, with approximately 30% of management fees generated from non U.S. customers in 2005 and 2004. At year end 2005, assets under management were $1.44 trillion, up $87 billion, or 6%, from year end 2004. While certain management fees are directly determined by the value of assets under management and the investment strategy employed, management fees reflect other factors as well, including our relationship pricing for customers who use multiple services and performance related fees. Accordingly, there is not necessarily a direct correlation between the value of assets under management, market indices and management fee revenue. Assets under management consisted of the following at December 31. Non U.S. securities comprised 40% of total securities at year end 2005.

We offer a complete range of foreign exchange services under an account model that focuses on the global requirements of our customers to execute trades and receive market insights in any time zone. We have exclusive ownership of FX Connect, the worlds first and leading foreign exchange trading platform, and we provide quantitatively based research into investor behavior, as well as advice and quantitative tools designed to optimize our customers returns. In 2005, foreign exchange trading revenue increased $48 million, to $468 million, from $420 million in 2004. Foreign exchange trading revenue is influenced by three principal factors: the volume and type of customer foreign exchange transactions; currency volatility and trend; and the management of currency market risks. Customer spot, swap, forward and options trading volumes were strong in 2005, both in the volume and value of transactions, up 32% from 2004. The impact of volume increases was somewhat offset by lower currency volatility, as measured by our index of 26 currencies, down 12% from 2004. We also offer a range of brokerage and other trading products tailored specifically to meet the needs of the global pension community, including transition management, commission recapture and self directed brokerage. These products are differentiated by our position as an agent and partner of the institutional investor. Brokerage and other trading fees were $226 million in 2005, compared to $175 million a year earlier. Growth was attributable to a significant increase in the global transition management business, as well as an increase in equity trading revenue in the U.S. Securities Finance: Securities finance provides liquidity to the financial markets and an effective means for customers to earn revenue on existing portfolios. By acting as a lending agent and coordinating loans between lenders and borrowers, we lend securities and provide liquidity in more than 35 markets around the world. Borrowers provide collateral in the form of cash or securities to State Street in return for loaned securities. For cash collateral, we pay a usage fee to the provider of the cash collateral, and invest the cash collateral in certain investment vehicles. The spread between the yield on the investment vehicle and the usage fee paid to the provider of the collateral is split between the lender of the securities and State Street as agent. For non cash collateral, the borrower pays a fee for the loaned securities, and the fee is split between the lender of the securities and State Street. Securities finance revenue of $330 million in 2005 increased $71 million from a year earlier. Securities finance revenue, which is historically affected by seasonality during the second quarter of the year as a result of heavy borrowing demand from customers, is principally a function of the volume of securities lent and the interest rate spreads earned on the collateral. Growth in fees in 2005 reflected improved interest rate spreads and a 9% increase in securities finance volumes during 2005. Processing Fees and Other: Processing fees and other revenue was $302 million in 2005, down slightly compared with $308 million in 2004. Processing fees and other revenue includes multiple sources of fees and other revenue, including fees from structured products, fees from software licensing and maintenance, profits and losses from unconsolidated affiliates, gains and losses on sales of leased equipment and other assets and amortization of investments in tax advantaged financings. In addition, processing fees and other revenue included payments received from Deutsche Bank AG representing amounts earned on customer deposits of the acquired GSS business that had not yet converted to our systems. Once converted, GSS deposits are reflected as deposits in our consolidated statement of condition, and the related earnings on those deposits are reflected in net interest revenue. The corresponding decline of $30 million in these fees during 2005 was largely offset by an increase in structured products revenue. State Street Corporation 23 Net Interest Revenue In servicing sophisticated global investors, we provide short term funds management, deposit services and repurchase agreements for cash positions associated with our customers investing activities. NET INTEREST REVENUE 2005 2004 2003 Change 20042005 (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, Interest revenue $ 2,930 $ 1,787 $ 1,539 64 % Interest expense 2,023 928 729 118 Net interest revenue 907 859 810 6 Provision for loan losses (18 ) Net interest revenue after provision for loan losses $ 907 $ 877 $ 810 Net interest revenue (taxable equivalent basis) $ 949 $ 904 $ 861 5 % Excess of rates earned over rates paid (taxable equivalent basis) .82 % .95 % 1.04 % Net interest margin (taxable equivalent basis) 1.08 1.08 1.17 Additional detail about the components of interest revenue and interest expense is in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Net interest revenue was $907 million for 2005, an increase of $48 million compared to $859 million in 2004, which reflected a reduction of $19 million in interest revenue due to a change in the applicable state tax rate for leveraged lease transactions. Excluding this reduction from 2004, net interest revenue would have increased by $29 million during 2005. Higher interest revenue was principally due to an increase in the size of the average balance sheet and the impact of repositioning and increasing the average size of the investment securities portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2005, our investment securities portfolio, on an average basis, included a higher percentage of collateralized mortgage obligations and floating rate, asset backed securities compared to a year earlier, and a lower percentage of U.S. Treasuries and direct obligations of federal agencies. The shift in the portfolio was designed to better position us in a rising short term interest rate environment, without significantly increasing overall risk, as we continued to invest conservatively in AA and AAA rated securities. AA and AAA rated securities comprised approximately 95% of the investment securities portfolio, with approximately 90% AAA rated, at December 31, 2005. The provision for loan losses for 2004 reflected a reduction in the provision of $18 million attributable to reduced credit exposure and improved credit quality. (Losses) Gains on Sales of Available for Sale Securities, Net Our management of the investment securities portfolio has multiple objectives, the foremost of which is to generate maximum return within the parameters of modest duration and credit risk, which may entail strategic sales of specific securities as market conditions warrant. In addition, the portfolio is structured to provide liquidity and serve as a source of collateral for customer activities. Approximately 92% of the investment securities portfolio was classified as available for sale at December 31, 2005. We recorded a net loss of $1 million on sales of available for sale securities in 2005, down from a net gain of $26 million in 2004. As of December 31, 2005, we had $54.98 billion in available for sale securities. Additional information about these gains and losses is in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. 24 State Street Corporation Gain on Sale of Private Asset Management Business In 2003, we completed the sale of our Private Asset Management, or PAM, business. Under the terms of the agreement, the transaction was valued at $365 million, of which approximately five percent was subject to the successful transition of the business over the subsequent 16 months. During the third quarter of 2005, we recorded an additional gain of $16 million from final settlement of the sale. Additional information about the gain is included in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for 2005 were $4.04 billion, an increase of $282 million from 2004. The increase reflected higher salaries and employee benefits, transaction processing, occupancy and other expenses, somewhat offset by a decline in information systems and communications expense and the absence of GSS related merger and integration charges and restructuring costs related to a 2004 reduction in workforce. OPERATING EXPENSES 2005 2004 2003 Change 20042005 (Dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, Salaries and employee benefits $ 2,231 $ 1,957 $ 1,731 14 % Information systems and communications 486 527 551 (8 ) Transaction processing services 449 398 314 13 Occupancy 391 363 300 8 Merger, integration and divestiture 62 110 (100 ) Restructuring 21 296 (100 ) Other 484 431 320 12 Total operating expenses $ 4,041 $ 3,759 $ 3,622 8 Number of employees at year end 20,965 19,668 19,850 Salaries and employee benefits expense increased $274 million in 2005 to $2.23 billion. The increase was driven in large part by higher staffing levels required to accommodate new large investment manager operations outsourcing customers and the success of our hedge fund manager services. The increase also reflected higher incentive compensation costs related to improved earnings, higher average salaries due to merit increases and the higher costs of employee benefits. Information systems and communications expense was $486 million in 2005, down $41 million from the prior year, primarily due to efficiencies gained as GSS customers were converted to our operating platforms, somewhat offset by costs for new outsourcing customers and costs of the new data center. Transaction processing services expense was $449 million, up $51 million from $398 million a year ago. These expenses are volume related and include equity trading services and fees related to securities settlement, subcustodian fees and external contract services. The increase resulted from a higher volume of investment activity combined with higher net asset values that impact subcustodian fees. Occupancy expense was $391 million, up $28 million from 2004. We recognized a pre tax charge of $26 million in 2005 related to a long term sub lease agreement with an unrelated third party for approximately 160,000 square feet in our headquarters building. We expect that this transaction will reduce average annual occupancy costs for this property going forward by $7 million to $8 million beginning in 2006. In 2004, occupancy expense included a loss of $16 million on a sub lease agreement with an unrelated third party at our former headquarters building. Additionally, occupancy costs in Europe increased to accommodate new investment manager operations outsourcing customers. Merger and integration costs of $62 million in 2004 related to the conversion of customers gained in the GSS acquisition to our systems. Restructuring costs of $21 million in 2004 related to severance and benefit costs associated with a 425 position workforce reduction completed in late 2004. State Street Corporation 25 Other expenses were $484 million, up $53 million from $431 million in 2004, primarily due to increases in professional services related to compliance, including costs related to implementation of BASEL II and the restructuring of our treasury function, as well as growth initiatives. Income Taxes Income tax expense from continuing operations was $487 million for 2005, compared to $394 million a year ago, with the additional expense the result of increased pre tax earnings. The effective tax rate for continuing operations for 2005 was 34.0%. The effective tax rate for 2004 was 33.1%, including the impact of a cumulative benefit of $18 million resulting from a change in the effective state tax rate applied to leveraged leasing transactions. Excluding this item, the effective rate for 2004 was 34.0%. The income tax benefit attributable to the loss from discontinued operations of $165 million was $58 million. Line of Business Information We report two lines of business: Investment Servicing and Investment Management. Given our services and management organization, the results of operations for these lines of business are not necessarily comparable with those of other companies, including companies in the financial services industry. Information about revenue, expense and capital allocation methodologies is in Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. The following is a summary of line of business results. These results exclude the loss from discontinued operations related to the planned divestiture of our investment interest in Bel Air as described in the Financial Highlights section of this Discussion and Analysis. The Business Divestiture column includes the revenue and expenses of the divested PAM business for 2003 prior to its divestiture. The Other/One Time column for 2005 includes the additional gain from the sale of the PAM business. For 2004, this column includes merger and integration costs related to the acquisition of the GSS business. For 2003, the Other/One Time column includes the gains from the sales of the PAM and Corporate Trust businesses, the loss on certain real estate sold, and restructuring and merger, integration and divestiture charges. Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.

Products include custody, product and participant level accounting, daily pricing and administration; master trust and master custody; recordkeeping; foreign exchange, brokerage and other trading services; securities finance; deposit and short term investment facilities; loans and lease financing; investment manager and hedge fund manager operations outsourcing; and performance, risk and compliance analytics to support institutional investors. We provide shareholder services, which include mutual fund and collective fund shareholder accounting, through our 50% owned affiliates, Boston Financial Data Services, Inc. and the International Financial Data Services group of companies. Total revenue for 2005 increased to $4.47 billion, up $306 million, or 7%, from 2004. Growth was primarily driven by increases in servicing, trading services and securities finance revenue, somewhat offset by a decline in processing fees and other revenue and the absence of the 2004 reduction in the provision for loan losses. Servicing fees for 2005 of $2.47 billion were up $211 million from 2004 due to new business from existing and new customers and higher equity valuations. Trading services revenue was up $99 million, reflecting a higher dollar volume of foreign exchange trades for customers and a higher volume of transition management business. Processing fees and other revenue were down $18 million from 2004, primarily reflecting a $30 million decline in payments received from Deutsche Bank AG in lieu of net interest revenue on deposits of GSS customers that had not yet converted to our systems, somewhat offset by an improvement in structured products fees. Servicing fees, trading services fees and gains on sales of available for sale securities for the Investment Servicing line of business are identical to the respective consolidated results. Refer to the Servicing Fees, Trading Services and (Losses) Gains on Sales of Available For Sale Securities captions in the Revenue section of this Discussion and Analysis for a more in depth discussion. A discussion of processing fees and other revenue is provided under the caption Processing Fees and Other in the Revenue section of this Discussion and Analysis. Net interest revenue for 2005 increased by $10 million from 2004 due to higher balance sheet volumes and our repositioning of the balance sheet as further discussed under the caption Net Interest Revenue in the Revenue section of this Discussion and Analysis. In 2004, we reduced the allowance for loan losses through a reduction of the provision as a result of reduced credit exposures and overall improved credit quality. A portion of net interest revenue is recorded in the Investment Management line of business based on the volume of customer liabilities attributable to that line of business. Operating expenses were $3.36 billion for 2005, an increase of $248 million from 2004. The increase in expenses was largely attributable to salaries and employee benefits from higher staffing levels to accommodate new business and an increase in incentive compensation due to improved earnings. Transaction processing costs increased due to a higher volume of securities settlements and higher subcustodian fees. Occupancy costs were higher due to sub lease charges and additional costs for space acquired to accommodate new business, and other expenses increased as a result of professional fees for regulatory compliance and growth initiatives. Investment Management Investment Management, offered through SSgA, provides a broad array of services for managing financial assets, including investment management and investment research services, primarily for institutional investors worldwide. These services include passive and active U.S. and non U.S. equity and fixed income strategies, and other related services, such as securities finance. Total revenue for 2005 was $983 million, up $200 million from $783 million in 2004. For 2005, management fees were $751 million, up $128 million, or 21%, from 2004. Management fees for the Investment Management line of business are identical to the respective consolidated results. Refer to the Management Fees caption in the Revenue section of this Discussion and Analysis for a more in depth discussion. Securities finance revenue for 2005 was up $22 million from 2004, reflecting improved spreads and higher volumes. Net interest revenue improved due to higher volumes of customer liabilities. State Street Corporation 27 Operating expenses for 2005 were $678 million, up $96 million from 2004, primarily attributable to higher incentive compensation. COMPARISON OF 2004 AND 2003 OVERVIEW OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2004 2003 $ Change % Change (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Years ended December 31, Total fee revenue $ 4,048 $ 3,556 $ 492 14 % Net interest revenue 859 810 49 6 Provision for loan losses (18 ) (18 ) Gains on sales of available for sale investment securities, net 26 23 3 13 Gains on sales of divested businesses 345 (345 ) (100 ) Total revenue 4,951 4,734 217 5 Total operating expenses 3,759 3,622 137 4 Income before income tax expense 1,192 1,112 80 7 Income tax expense 394 390 4 Net income $ 798 $ 722 $ 76 11 Earnings Per Share: Basic $ 2.38 $ 2.18 $ .20 9 Diluted 2.35 2.15 .20 9 Return on shareholders equity 13.3 % 13.9 % The 2004 results included after tax merger and integration costs of $41 million, or $.12 per share, related to our acquisition of the GSS business. Results for 2003 included after tax merger, integration and restructuring charges of $268 million, or $.80 per share. Somewhat offsetting these charges in 2003 were after tax gains of $228 million, or $.68 per share, from the sale of our PAM and Corporate Trust businesses and $15 million, or $.04 per share, of operating results of the PAM business prior to its divestiture. 28 State Street Corporation TOTAL REVENUE 2004 2003 $ Change % Change (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, Fee Revenue: Servicing fees $ 2,263 $ 1,950 $ 313 16 % Management fees 623 533 90 17 Trading services 595 529 66 12 Securities finance 259 245 14 6 Processing fees and other 308 299 9 3 Total fee revenue 4,048 3,556 492 14 Net Interest Revenue: Interest revenue 1,787 1,539 248 16 Interest expense 928 729 199 27 Net interest revenue 859 810 49 6 Provision for loan losses (18 ) (18 ) Net interest revenue after provision for loan losses 877 810 67 8 Gains on sales of available for sale investment securities, net 26 23 3 13 Gain on sale of Private Asset Management business, net of exit and other associated costs 285 (285 ) (100 ) Gain on sale of Corporate Trust business 60 (60 ) (100 ) Total revenue $ 4,951 $ 4,734 $ 217 5 The increase of $217 million in total revenue for 2004 compared to 2003 reflected growth in both fee and net interest revenue. Fee revenue in 2004 increased $492 million from 2003, with growth in all categories, particularly servicing, management and trading services fees. Net interest revenue after provision for loan losses in 2004 was up $67 million from 2003. Total revenue in 2003 included $345 million of gains from sales of divested businesses and $60 million of revenue from the PAM business prior to its divestiture. The increase in servicing fees for 2004 of $313 million from 2003 was attributable to higher equity market valuations and new business from existing and new customers. Our business continued to grow outside the United States, with 34% of servicing fees derived from non U.S. customers, up from 30% in 2003. Assets under custody increased to $9.50 trillion at December 31, 2004, up $127 billion from $9.37 trillion a year earlier. The increase in management fees of $90 million from the prior year reflected continued new business success and higher average month end equity market valuations. Approximately 30% of management fees were from customers outside the United States. The growth in management fees was somewhat offset by the absence of $59 million of fees recorded in 2003 from the divested PAM business prior to its being sold. Assets under management increased to $1.35 trillion, up $248 billion from $1.11 trillion a year earlier. Trading services revenue, which includes foreign exchange trading, brokerage and other trading revenue, increased $66 million compared to 2003. This growth reflected an increase in brokerage and other trading fees of $37 million, primarily due to increased global transition management business, as well as further penetration of the investment manager marketplace. Trading services revenue also benefited from a $29 million increase in foreign exchange trading revenue. Customer spot and forward trading volumes were strong in 2004, both in the volume and value of transactions, up 30% from 2003. Currency volatility, as measured by our index of 28 currencies, increased 8% from 2003. Securities finance revenue for 2004 increased $14 million from 2003, as the effect of a 29% increase in securities lending volumes during 2004 was somewhat offset by the impact of lower interest rate spreads in the second half of 2004, attributable to the rapid succession of increases in a target interest rate by the Federal Reserve Board, or Federal Reserve. State Street Corporation 29 Processing fees and other revenue increased $9 million over 2003, as a result of improved earnings from unconsolidated affiliates, largely offset by a decrease of $47 million in payments made by Deutsche Bank AG in consideration of net interest revenue earned from GSS customer deposits. These deposits were held by Deutsche Bank AG until customers and their related deposits were converted to our systems. In addition, processing fees in 2003 included an unrealized gain of $23 million on the mark to market of variable share repurchase contracts, known as SPACESSM, for shares of our common stock; an other than temporary impairment charge of $27 million resulting from the write down of certain investment securities; and a $13 million loss on sales of certain real estate. Net gains on sales of available for sale securities were $26 million in 2004, up from $23 million in 2003. Net interest revenue for 2004 increased $49 million from 2003, due to an increase in our average balance sheet driven by a higher level of customer deposits, including the conversion of GSS customers, somewhat offset by lower interest rate spreads. The 2004 amount reflected a $19 million cumulative charge to interest revenue, which resulted from a change in effective state tax rate assumptions used for recognition of income from leveraged lease transactions. We reduced the allowance for loan losses in 2004 by recording an $18 million benefit in the related income statement provision in response to reduced credit exposure and improved credit quality. OPERATING EXPENSES 2004 2003 $ Change % Change (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, Operating Expenses: Salaries and employee benefits $ 1,957 $ 1,731 $ 226 13 % Information systems and communications 527 551 (24 ) (4 ) Transaction processing services 398 314 84 27 Occupancy 363 300 63 21 Merger, integration and divestiture costs 62 110 (48 ) (44 ) Restructuring costs 21 296 (275 ) (93 ) Other 431 320 111 35 Total operating expenses $ 3,759 $ 3,622 $ 137 4 Operating expenses were up $137 million from 2003, as higher expenses for salaries and employee benefits, transaction processing, occupancy and other fees were largely offset by decreases in merger, integration, divestiture and restructuring costs. Operating expenses for 2004 included $62 million of merger and integration costs, compared with $110 million of merger, integration and divestiture costs in 2003. In addition, 2004 operating expenses included $21 million of restructuring costs related to a reduction in force, down from $296 million in 2003. Salaries and employee benefits expense increased $226 million for 2004, driven by higher incentive compensation costs resulting from our improved earnings, somewhat offset by a decrease in expenses for costs related to the PAM business prior to its sale. Information systems and communications expense decreased $24 million from the prior year, primarily the result of the benefits of converting GSS customers to our systems. Transaction processing services expense increased $84 million from 2003. These expenses, which are in large part volume related, include equity trading services and fees related to securities settlement, subcustodian fees and external contract services. The increase resulted from a higher level of investment activity combined with higher net asset values that impact subcustodian fees. Occupancy expense increased $63 million from 2003, reflective of our move to our new corporate headquarters, the costs of a new data center, and the recognition of a loss of $16 million from a sub lease agreement. Merger and integration costs related to the acquisition of the GSS business were $62 million in 2004, down from $103 million in 2003. Divestiture costs related to the sale of the PAM business were $7 million in 2003. 30 State Street Corporation Restructuring costs were $21 million in 2004, down from $296 million in 2003. The 2004 costs related to severance and benefits associated with a 425 position workforce reduction completed in the fourth quarter of 2004. Restructuring costs for 2003 were predominantly recorded in the second quarter of that year, and included severance and enhanced benefits for 3,000 individuals, primarily in the United States, who accepted the voluntary separation program. After refilling some of those positions, we were able to reduce our workforce by approximately 2,000 positions as a result of this program. Other operating expenses increased $111 million from 2003, primarily due to increases in professional services related to growth initiatives; compliance requirements, such as that related to the Sarbanes Oxley Act; regulatory inquiries and Basel II readiness. Income Taxes We recorded income tax expense of $394 million for 2004, compared to $390 million a year earlier. Our effective rate for 2004 was 33.1%, including the impact of a cumulative benefit of $18 million resulting from a change in the effective state tax rate applied to leveraged leasing transactions. Excluding this item, the effective rate for 2004 was 34.0%. In 2003, income tax expense included a one time $12 million after tax charge for the settlement of a state tax matter, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 35.1% for the year. Excluding the state tax settlement, the effective rate was 34.0% for 2003. GSS Contribution In 2004, the GSS business accounted for $606 million of revenue and $501 million of expenses, compared with $573 million of revenue and $517 million of expenses in 2003. We achieved significant cost reductions and economies of scale in the second year of operation, and substantially met financial goals we established at the time of the acquisition. The impact on our financial results of the GSS business included financing costs and amortization expense related to acquired software and intangibles. When combined with financial results from the additional out of scope business obtained from the relationship with Deutsche Asset Management, and excluding related merger and integration costs, the GSS business contributed $.10 to our earnings per share in 2004, compared with $.01 per share in 2003. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES State Streets consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, including prevailing practices within the financial services industry. Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The majority of these accounting policies do not involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates in their application, or the variability of the estimates is not material to the consolidated financial statements. However, certain of these accounting policies, by their nature, require management to make judgments, involving significant estimates and assumptions, about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements, and changes in this information over time could materially impact amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported in subsequent financial statements. Based on the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the policies, estimates and assumptions underlying certain reported amounts, the relatively more significant accounting policies applied by State Street have been identified by management as accounting for lease financing; accounting for goodwill; accounting for income taxes; and accounting for pension costs. These policies require the most subjective or complex judgments, and related estimates and assumptions could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. An understanding of the judgments, estimates and assumptions underlying these accounting policies is essential in order to understand our reported financial condition and results of operations. The following is a brief discussion of the above mentioned significant accounting policies. Management of State Street has discussed these significant accounting estimates with the Examining and Audit Committee of the Board. Lease Financing We have a leveraged lease portfolio consisting of U.S. and cross border financings, primarily for transportation equipment, including trains, aircraft and ships. Lease financing investments are reported at the aggregate of lease payments receivable and estimated residual values, net of non recourse debt and unearned State Street Corporation 31 income. Unearned income is recognized in interest revenue to yield a level rate of return on the net investment in the leases. Measuring the net investment and interest revenue related to lease financing requires the use of several assumptions regarding estimates of residual values, the amount and timing of cash flows, and the impact of income tax regulations and income tax rates relating to the leases. Due to the complexity and long term nature of many of these leases, these assumptions are reviewed regularly for adjustments that may be required, including the recognition of other than temporary impairment of residual values. Changes in these assumptions in future periods could affect asset balances and related interest revenue. Additional information about lease financing balances is in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Goodwill Goodwill arises when the purchase price exceeds the assigned value of net assets of acquired businesses, and represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements being acquired. The majority of our goodwill resulted from business acquisitions of our Investment Servicing line of business. Approximately 99% of the total goodwill included in our consolidated statement of condition was recorded by this business line, and the remaining 1% was recorded by Investment Management. The sustained value of the majority of this goodwill is supported ultimately by revenue from our investment servicing business. A decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth, or our inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods, could lead to a perceived impairment of goodwill, which would be evaluated and, if necessary, be recorded as a write down of the reported amount of goodwill through a charge to earnings in our consolidated statement of income. On an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances dictate, management reviews goodwill and evaluates events or other developments that may indicate impairment in the carrying amount. We perform this evaluation at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our two major business lines. The evaluation methodology for potential impairment is inherently complex and involves significant management judgment in the use of estimates and assumptions. We evaluate impairment using a two step process. First, we compare the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, no impairment exists. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, then we compare the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, then goodwill impairment is recognized by writing the goodwill down to the implied fair value. The implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, as if the unit had been acquired in a business combination and the overall fair value of the unit was the purchase price. To determine the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit being evaluated for goodwill impairment, we use one of two principal methodologies external or independent valuation, using quoted market prices in active markets; or an analysis of comparable recent external sales or market data, such as multiples of earnings or similar performance measures. In limited circumstances, these methodologies are not available, and as such, we estimate future cash flows using present value techniques. Events that may indicate goodwill impairment include significant or adverse changes in the business, economic or political climate; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; unanticipated competition; and a more likely than not expectation that a business of State Street will be sold or otherwise disposed of. Our goodwill impairment testing for 2005 indicated that none of our goodwill was impaired, except for that related to Bel Air, which was the result of our plan to dispose of our ownership interest and the resulting business line organizational realignment, and this impairment was recorded in the third quarter of 2005. Additional information about goodwill is in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes Our overall tax position is fundamentally complex, and management judgment is involved in the analysis of income tax assets and liabilities. We are subject to the income tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which State Street operates. These tax laws can be subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the taxing authorities. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be 32 State Street Corporation adjudicated by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or administrative appeal. Managements determination of the likelihood that deferred tax assets can be realized is subjective and involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. The realization of deferred tax assets arises from carrybacks to prior taxable periods, future taxable income, including foreign source income, and the achievement of tax planning strategies. Underlying estimates and assumptions can change over time, influencing our overall tax positions, as a result of unanticipated events or circumstances. Management continually monitors and evaluates the worldwide impact of tax legislation, decisions, rulings and other current developments on the estimates and assumptions underlying our calculations of current and deferred taxes and our analysis of the expected realization of deferred tax assets. Additional information about income taxes is in Notes 9 and 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Costs We maintain a tax qualified non contributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all domestic employees, as well as certain non U.S. defined benefit plans. Measuring cost and reporting liabilities resulting from defined benefit pension plans requires the use of many assumptions, including estimates of future interest rates, asset returns, compensation increases and other actuarial based projections relating to the plans. Pension related estimates have a significant impact on the determination of pension obligations and related expense. We use December 31 as a measurement date for our pension asset and projected benefit obligation balances. Each year, we review actual demographic and investment experience with the plans actuaries. In addition to actual experience, adjustments to assumptions consider published interest rate indices, known compensation trends and policies and economic conditions that may affect the estimated long term rate of return on plan assets. The significant assumptions used to measure periodic benefit cost and pension obligations are described below. Size and Characteristics of the Employee Population Periodic benefit cost is directly related to the number of employees covered by the plans and other factors, including salary, age and years of employment. Actuarial Assumptions Actuarial assumptions used to estimate benefit obligations consider factors such as mortality rate, turnover rate, retirement rate, disability rate and the rate of compensation increases. These factors tend to change gradually over time. The aggregate impact of assumptions is reviewed each year and specific assumptions are reviewed periodically. Expected Long Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets We calculate the expected return on plan assets each year based on the composition of assets at the beginning of the plan year and the expected long term rate of return on that portfolio. The expected long term rate of return is designed to approximate the actual long term rate of return on plan assets over time and is not expected to change significantly. As a result, the pattern of income or expense recognition closely matches the stable pattern of services provided by our employees over the life of the pension obligation. To determine if the expected rate of return is reasonable, we consider such factors as (1) the actual return earned on plan assets, (2) historical rates of return on the various asset classes in the plan portfolio, (3) projections of returns on various asset classes, and (4) current/prospective capital market conditions and economic forecasts. Discount Rate We use the discount rate to determine the present value of our future benefit obligations. It reflects the rates available on long term, high quality fixed income debt instruments, reset annually on the measurement date. Additional information about our pension plans and related benefit costs is in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. State Street Corporation 33 FINANCIAL CONDITION Statement of Condition Overview The structure of our consolidated statement of condition, or balance sheet, is primarily driven by the liabilities generated by our core Investment Servicing and Investment Management businesses. As our customers execute their worldwide cash management and investment activities, they use short term investments and deposits that constitute the majority of our liabilities. These liabilities are generally in the form of non interest bearing demand deposits; interest bearing transaction account deposits, which are denominated in a variety of currencies; and repurchase agreements, which generally serve as short term investment alternatives for our customers. Our operating objectives and customers needs determine the volume, mix and currency denomination of our consolidated balance sheet. Deposits and other liabilities generated by customer activities are invested in assets that generally match the liquidity and interest rate characteristics of the liabilities. As a result, our assets consist primarily of short term money market instruments, such as inter bank placements, federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements, and high quality, marketable securities held in our available for sale or held to maturity investment portfolio. The actual mix of assets is determined by the characteristics of the customer liabilities and our desire to maintain a well diversified portfolio of high quality assets. Managing our consolidated balance sheet structure is a disciplined process conducted within specific Board approved policies for market risk, credit risk and liquidity. For 2005, average interest bearing liabilities increased $3.69 billion from 2004, reflecting an increase in non U.S. deposits of $7.67 billion, partly offset by a decrease in average U.S. deposits of $3.21 billion. Much of the growth in foreign deposits came from the conversion of customer liabilities onto our balance sheet as a result of the acquisition of a substantial portion of the GSS business of Deutsche Bank AG in 2003. These deposits are generally non U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the primary nature of the acquired activities. Average interest earning assets for 2005 increased $3.91 billion, or 5%, from 2004, reflecting the additional funds generated by higher levels of customer liabilities. During 2005, we made efforts to reposition our balance sheet by investing in more floating rate investment securities and decreasing our investments in interest bearing deposits with banks. Average investment securities increased $15.06 billion from 2004, primarily mortgage backed U.S. federal agency securities and floating rate asset backed securities, while average interest bearing deposits with banks decreased $10.13 billion. This reallocation of assets was undertaken without materially altering our risk profile, as our overall credit risk profile remained appropriately diversified. 34 State Street Corporation Investment Securities We consider a well diversified, high credit quality investment securities portfolio to be an important element in the management of our consolidated balance sheet. The portfolio continues to be concentrated in marketable securities with high credit quality, with approximately 95% of the carrying value of the portfolio AAA or AA rated. As of December 31, the percentages of the carrying value of the investment securities portfolio by credit rating were as follows: 2005 2004 AAA(1) 90 % 93 % AA 5 2 A 3 3 BBB 1 1 Non rated 1 1 100 % 100 % (1) Includes U.S. Treasury securities The investment securities portfolio is also diversified with respect to asset class. The bulk of the portfolio is in high grade mortgage backed and asset backed securities. The largely floating rate asset backed portfolio consists of home equity loan, credit card, auto and student loan securities. Mortgage backed securities are split almost equally between securities of Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and private label collateralized mortgage obligations. The carrying values of investment securities as of December 31 were as follows: (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Available for Sale: U.S. Treasury and federal agencies: Direct obligations $ 10,214 $ 12,119 $ 18,986 Mortgage backed securities 11,138 9,147 3,762 Asset backed securities 23,842 10,056 9,885 State and political subdivisions 1,868 1,785 1,999 Collateralized mortgage obligations 5,527 1,719 1,333 Other debt investments 1,695 922 310 Money market mutual funds 232 97 85 Other equity securities 463 326 238 Total $ 54,979 $ 36,171 $ 36,598 Held to Maturity: U.S. Treasury and federal agencies Direct obligations $ 1,657 $ 1,294 $ 1,345 Mortgage backed securities 925 Collateralized mortgage obligations 2,086 Other investments 223 106 272 Total $ 4,891 $ 1,400 $ 1,617 We had $475 million of net pre tax unrealized losses on available for sale investment securities at December 31, 2005, or $285 million after tax. Net pre tax unrealized losses on available for sale securities at December 31, 2004 were $96 million, or $56 million after tax. We consider the aggregate decline in fair value and the resulting net unrealized losses to be temporary and primarily the result of rising interest rates over the course of 2005, not the result of any material changes in the credit characteristics of the investment securities portfolio. We generally configure our investment securities portfolio so that any change in its fair value is largely, but not totally, offset by changes in the economic value of our customer liabilities; however, existing State Street Corporation 35 accounting standards do not allow for the change in economic value of our customer liabilities to offset unrealized losses on available for sale securities. We intend to continue managing our investment securities portfolio to align with interest rate and duration characteristics of our customer liabilities and in the context of our overall balance sheet structure, which is maintained within approved risk limits, and in consideration of the global interest rate environment. Even with material changes in unrealized losses on available for sale securities, we may not experience material changes in our interest rate risk profile, or experience a material impact on net interest revenue. Additional information about these and other unrealized losses is in Notes 3 and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. The increase in securities held to maturity resulted from our investment of certain customer liabilities in connection with our repositioning of the balance sheet. These liabilities are generated from our core Investment Servicing and Investment Management businesses, and are fairly stable. As a result, we were able to invest a portion of these liabilities in securities which management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity. The maturities of debt investment securities as of December 31, 2005, and the weighted average taxable equivalent yields, were as follows: Under 1 Year 1 to 5 Years 6 to 10 Years Over 10 Years Amount Yield Amount Yield Amount Yield Amount Yield (Dollars in millions) Available for Sale: U.S. Treasury and federal agencies Direct obligations $ 2,614 2.32 % $ 7,103 3.75 % $ 497 4.22 % Mortgage backed securities 40 3.49 1,107 3.76 5,154 4.34 $ 4,837 4.75 % Asset backed securities 1,818 3.92 9,373 4.36 9,309 4.59 3,342 4.40 State and political subdivisions(1) 321 3.56 783 4.93 627 4.60 137 4.34 Collateralized mortgage obligations 97 3.60 1,948 4.32 2,404 4.89 1,078 4.99 Other investments 685 3.24 613 4.64 389 4.99 8 5.86 Total $ 5,575 $ 20,927 $ 18,380 $ 9,402 Held to Maturity: U.S. Treasury and federal agencies Direct obligations $ 856 2.30 % $ 801 4.12 % Mortgage backed securities $ 226 4.70 % $ 699 5.04 % Collateralized mortgage obligations 354 4.61 1,007 4.99 725 4.97 Other investments 73 2.29 65 2.69 81 3.42 4 3.16 Total $ 929 $ 1,220 $ 1,314 $ 1,428 (1) Yields calculated for interest revenue on non taxable investment securities include the effect of taxable equivalent adjustments, a method of presentation in which interest income on tax exempt securities is adjusted to present the earnings performance on a basis equivalent to interest earned on fully taxable securities, with a corresponding charge to income tax expense. The adjustment is computed using a federal income tax rate of 35%, adjusted for applicable state income taxes, net of the related federal tax benefit. The taxable equivalent adjustment included in interest revenue to calculate the yields above was $42 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The maturities of asset backed securities, mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are based upon the expected principal payments. 36 State Street Corporation Loans and Lease Financing U.S. and non U.S. loans and lease financing as of December 31, and average loans outstanding for the years ended December 31, were as follows: 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 (Dollars in millions) U.S.: Commercial and financial $ 2,298 $ 1,826 $ 2,344 $ 1,578 $ 2,479 Lease financing 404 373 395 403 413 Total U.S. 2,702 2,199 2,739 1,981 2,892 Non U.S.: Commercial and industrial 1,854 526 424 289 725 Lease financing 1,926 1,904 1,858 1,719 1,639 Banks and other financial institutions 177 71 Other 8 14 Total non U.S. 3,780 2,430 2,282 2,193 2,449 Total loans $ 6,482 $ 4,629 $ 5,021 $ 4,174 $ 5,341 Average loans and lease financing outstanding $ 6,013 $ 5,689 $ 5,568 $ 5,105 $ 6,081 At December 31, 2005, approximately 7% of our assets consisted of loans and lease financing. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, unearned revenue included in lease financing was $1.07 billion and $1.13 billion for non U.S. leases, and $125 million and $114 million for U.S. leases, respectively. Information about our allowance for loan losses is included in the Risk Management Credit Risk section of this Discussion and Analysis. Maturities for selected loan and lease financing categories as of December 31, 2005, were as follows: YEARS Total Under 1 1 to 5 Over 5 (Dollars in millions) U.S.: Commercial and financial $ 2,298 $ 2,257 $ 34 $ 7 Lease financing 404 4 59 341 Total U.S. 2,702 2,261 93 348 Non U.S.: Commercial and industrial 1,854 1,853 1 Lease financing 1,926 460 1,466 Total non U.S. 3,780 1,853 461 1,466 Total $ 6,482 $ 4,114 $ 554 $ 1,814 State Street Corporation 37 The following table shows the classification of loans and leases due after one year according to sensitivity to changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2005: (Dollars in millions) Loans and leases with predetermined interest rates $ 2,327 Loans and leases with floating or adjustable interest rates 41 Total $ 2,368 Cross Border Outstandings Cross border outstandings are amounts payable to State Street by residents of foreign countries, regardless of the currency in which the claim is denominated, and local country claims in excess of local country obligations. These outstandings primarily consist of deposits with banks. As of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, total cross border outstandings represented 11%, 11% and 16% of our consolidated total assets, respectively. In addition to credit risk, cross border outstandings have the risk that, as a result of political or economic conditions in a country, borrowers may be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations of principal and or interest when due because of the unavailability of, or restrictions on, foreign exchange needed by borrowers to repay their obligations. We manage our cross border outstandings using approved exposure limits. Cross border outstandings to countries in which we do business which amounted to at least 1% of our consolidated total assets as of December 31 were as follows: 2005 2004 2003 (Dollars in millions) Germany $ 4,217 $ 3,971 $ 3,834 United Kingdom 2,696 2,355 4,243 Canada 1,463 1,383 1,175 Australia 1,441 1,760 1,528 Netherlands 992 Japan 941 1,490 France 1,346 Total outstanding $ 10,809 $ 10,410 $ 13,616 Aggregate cross border outstandings to countries which totaled between .75% and 1% of our consolidated total assets at December 31, 2005 were $1.86 billion (Belgium and Japan); at December 31, 2004, $2.47 billion (Netherlands, France and Sweden); and at December 31, 2003, $842 million (Netherlands). Capital Regulatory Capital Our objective with respect to regulatory capital management is to maintain a strong capital base in order to provide financial flexibility for our business needs, including funding corporate growth and supporting customers cash management needs, and to provide protection against loss to depositors and creditors. We strive to maintain an optimal level of capital, commensurate with our risk profile, on which an attractive return to shareholders will be realized over both the short and long term, while serving depositors, creditors and regulatory needs. The Capital Committee, working in conjunction with the Asset and Liability Committee, or ALCO, oversees the management of regulatory capital, and is responsible for ensuring capital adequacy with respect to regulatory requirements, internal targets and the expectations of credit rating agencies. Our capital management process focuses on our risk exposures, our capital position relative to our peers, regulatory capital 38 State Street Corporation requirements and the evaluations of the major independent credit rating agencies that assign ratings to our public debt. The primary regulator of both State Street and State Street Bank for capital purposes is the Federal Reserve. Both State Street and the Bank are subject to the minimum capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve and defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, or FDICIA. The Bank must meet the regulatory capital thresholds for well capitalized in order for State Street to maintain its status as a financial holding company. Regulatory capital ratios and related regulatory guidelines for State Street and State Street Bank were as follows as of December 31: REGULATORY GUIDELINES STATE STREET STATE STREET BANK Minimum Well Capitalized 2005 2004 2005 2004 Regulatory Capital Ratios: Tier 1 capital 4 % 6 % 11.7 % 13.3 % 10.3 % 11.6 % Total capital 8 10 14.0 14.7 12.5 12.5 Tier 1 leverage ratio(1) 4 5 5.6 5.5 5.4 5.3 (1) Regulatory guideline for well capitalized applies only to State Street Bank. At December 31, 2005, our Tier 1 and total risk based capital ratios, as well as those of the Bank, were down from year end 2004. Growth in capital was outpaced by growth in total risk weighted assets, primarily the result of repositioning and increasing the size of our investment securities portfolio; an increase in loans; and the impact of new banking regulatory guidance related to the risk weighting of liquidity facilities with certain special purpose entities, partly offset by lower interest bearing deposits with banks. Our ratios, and those of the Bank, exceeded the regulatory minimum and well capitalized thresholds. To manage fluctuations in the Tier 1 and total risk based capital of State Street and State Street Bank resulting from foreign currency translation, we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of our net foreign investment in non U.S. subsidiaries. The notional value of these contracts was 300 million, or approximately $355 million, at December 31, 2005. In June 2004, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision released the final version of its capital adequacy framework, or Basel II. In September 2005, the U.S. regulators announced a delay in the issuance of proposed rules and a revised implementation schedule. The U.S. regulatory agencies are expected to release proposed new rules for comment in the first quarter of 2006. The new rules that will apply to us are now expected to become effective on January 1, 2008, subject to transitional implementation arrangements, and will become fully operational on January 1, 2009, one year later than originally planned. In addition to changes in the implementation schedule, the U.S. regulators intend to introduce additional prudential safeguards to address concerns identified in a recent analysis of an impact study conducted with the U.S. banking industry. We will be subject to the new rules along with other large, internationally active U.S. institutions. In order to meet regulatory requirements designed to foster readiness for the implementation of Basel II, we have established a comprehensive implementation program to achieve Basel II compliance. At this time, we cannot predict the final form of the rules in the U.S., nor their impact on our risk based capital. State Street Corporation 39 We have increased our quarterly dividend twice each year since 1978. Over the last ten years, dividends per share have grown at a 16% compound annual growth rate. Funds for cash distributions to our shareholders by the parent company are derived from a variety of sources. The level of dividends paid to shareholders on our common stock, which was $239 million in 2005, is reviewed regularly and determined by the Board considering our liquidity, capital adequacy and recent earnings history and prospects, as well as economic conditions and other factors deemed relevant. Federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid by subsidiary banks to the parent holding company. In addition, bank regulators have the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends if they deem such payment to be an unsafe or unsound practice. At December 31, 2005, the parent company had $9.63 billion of liquid assets with which to meet dividend declaration and other payment obligations. Information concerning dividends from our subsidiary banks is in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. In 2003, in connection with the GSS acquisition, we issued 1.725 million units of SPACESSM. SPACES were collateralized, forward purchase contract units for additional shares of our common stock. Each contract had a stated amount of $200 and consisted of a fixed share purchase contract and U.S. Treasury securities (PACESSM) and a variable share repurchase contract (COVERSSM). The SPACES investors received total annual payments of 6.75% on the units, payable quarterly. The present value of the contract payments totaled $45 million and was treated as a cost of capital and charged to surplus upon issuance. On November 15, 2005, we received proceeds of $345 million and issued 8.7 million shares of our common stock upon settlement of the PACES. The proceeds from the settlement were used to redeem $345 million of capital securities on December 15, 2005. In February 2006, we received 1.2 million shares as settlement of the COVERS. In 1995, our Board authorized a publicly announced stock purchase program for our common stock for general corporate purposes, including employee benefit programs. During the first quarter of 2005, 2.9 million shares were purchased under the 1995 stock purchase program. The 1995 program was terminated by action of the Board effective February 17, 2005. In its place, the Board authorized a new publicly announced program for the purchase of 15 million shares of our common stock for other corporate purposes, including employee benefit programs. During 2005, 10.2 million shares were purchased under the 2005 stock purchase program, and as of December 31, 2005, 4.8 million shares remained available for purchase. Additional information about share purchases is in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 in this Form 10 K. We employ third party broker dealers to acquire shares on the open market for our publicly announced stock purchase program. 40 State Street Corporation Economic Capital During 2004, we implemented a methodology to quantify our economic capital needs. We define economic capital as the common equity required to protect debt holders against unexpected economic losses over a one year period at a level consistent with the solvency of a firm with our target debt rating. The Capital Committee oversees the management of State Streets economic capital. We quantify capital requirements for the risks inherent in our business activities and group them into one of the following broadly defined categories: Market risk: the risk of adverse financial impact due to fluctuations in market prices, primarily as they relate to our trading activities Interest rate risk: the risk of loss in non trading, asset and liability management positions, primarily the impact of adverse movements in interest rates on the repricing mismatches that exist between balance sheet assets and liabilities Credit risk: the risk of loss that may result from the default or downgrade of a borrower or counterparty Operational risk: the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events, which is consistent with the Basel II definition Business risk: the risk of adverse changes in our earnings from business factors, including changes in the competitive environment, changes in the operational economics of business activities, and the effect of strategic and reputation risks Economic capital for each of these five categories is estimated on a stand alone basis using statistical modeling techniques applied to internally generated and external data. These individual results are then aggregated at the State Street consolidated level. A capital reduction or diversification benefit is then applied to reflect the unlikely event of experiencing an extremely large loss in each risk type at the same time. Because the amount of economic capital varies directly with our overall level of risk, it has become an integral part of our internal capital management process. Economic and regulatory capital are key metrics used by management to ensure that our actual level of capital is commensurate with our risk profile, in compliance with all regulatory requirements, and sufficient to provide us with the financial flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives. The framework and methodologies used to quantify capital for each of the risk types have been developed by Enterprise Risk Management and Global Treasury and are designed to be generally consistent with our risk management principles. This framework has been approved by senior management and has been reviewed by the Executive Committee of the Board. Due to the evolving nature of quantification techniques, we expect to continue refining the methodologies used to estimate our economic capital requirements, which could result in a different amount of capital needed to support our risk profile. Liquidity The objective of liquidity management is to ensure that we have the ability to meet our financial obligations in a timely and cost effective manner, and that we maintain sufficient flexibility to fund strategic corporate initiatives as they arise. Effective management of liquidity involves assessing the potential mismatch between the future cash needs of our customers and our available sources of cash under normal and adverse economic and business conditions. Uses of liquidity consist primarily of meeting deposit withdrawals and funding outstanding commitments to extend credit as they are drawn upon. Liquidity is provided by the maintenance of broad access to the global capital markets and our balance sheet asset structure, as described below. Global Treasury is responsible for the day to day management of our global liquidity position, which is conducted within risk guidelines established and monitored by ALCO. Management maintains a liquidity measurement framework, including a funding contingency plan designed to manage through a potential liquidity crisis. The plan defines roles, responsibilities, and management actions to be undertaken in the event of deterioration in our liquidity profile caused by either a State Street specific event or a broader disruption in the capital markets. The plan outlines several levels of potential risk to our liquidity and identifies several triggers that we use as early warning signals of a possible difficulty. These triggers are a combination of internal and external measures of increases in potential cash needs or decreases in available cash sources and possible impairment of our ability to access the global capital markets. State Street Corporation 41 We generally manage our liquidity risk on a global basis at the consolidated level, but we also manage parent company liquidity separately. State Street Bank generally has broader access to funding products and markets limited to banks, specifically the federal funds market and the Federal Reserves discount window. The parent company is managed to a more conservative liquidity profile, reflecting narrower market access. We typically hold enough cash, primarily in the form of interest bearing deposits with subsidiary banks, to meet current debt maturities and cash needs and those projected over the next one year period. Material risks to the sources of short term liquidity would include, among other things, rating agency downgrades of our deposits and debt securities below investment grade level, which would restrict our ability to access the funding markets and may lead to withdrawals of unsecured deposits by our customers. In addition, a large volume of unanticipated funding requirements, such as guarantees of third party debt under liquidity asset purchase agreements or large draw downs of existing lines of credit could require additional liquidity. As of December 31, 2005, there were no circumstances that management considered reasonably likely to occur that would adversely impact our sources of short term liquidity. While maintenance of a high investment grade credit rating is of primary importance to our liquidity management program, on balance sheet liquid assets represent significant liquidity that we can directly control and provide a source of cash in the form of principal maturities and the ability to borrow from the capital markets using our securities as collateral. Our liquid assets consist primarily of short term money market assets, such as federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits with banks, the latter of which are multicurrency instruments invested with major multinational banks; and high quality, marketable investment securities not already pledged, which generally are more liquid than other types of assets and can be sold or borrowed against to quickly generate cash. As of December 31, 2005, our liquid assets, as defined, totaled $48.92 billion. Securities carried at $26.57 billion as of December 31, 2005 were designated as pledged for public and trust deposits, borrowed funds and for other purposes as provided by law, and are excluded from the liquid assets calculation. Based upon our level of liquid assets and our ability to access the capital markets for additional funding when necessary, including our ability to issue debt and equity securities under our current shelf registration statement, management considers overall liquidity at December 31, 2005 more than sufficient to meet State Streets current commitments and business needs, including accommodating the transaction and cash management needs of its customers. 42 State Street Corporation Our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the maintenance of high investment grade ratings on our debt, as measured by the major independent credit rating agencies. Factors essential to retaining high credit ratings include diverse and stable core earnings; strong risk management; strong capital ratios; diverse liquidity sources, including the global funds markets and customer deposits; and strong liquidity monitoring procedures. High ratings on debt minimize borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by ensuring the largest possible market for our debt. A downgrade or reduction in credit ratings could have an adverse impact to our ability to access funding at favorable interest rates. There were no changes to our ratings in 2005.

Interest payments were calculated at the stated rate, with the exception of floating rate debt for which payments were calculated using the indexed rate in effect at December 31, 2005. The preceding table does not include obligations which will be settled in cash, primarily in less than one year, such as deposits, federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements and other short term borrowings. The obligations presented in the table are recorded in our consolidated statement of condition at December 31, 2005. Additional information about deposits, federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements and other short term borrowings is in Notes 6 and 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. The table does not include obligations related to derivative contracts, because the amounts included in our consolidated statement of condition at December 31, 2005 related to derivative contracts do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid under the contracts. Additional information about derivative contracts is in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K State Street Corporation 43 under Item 8. We have obligations under pension and other postretirement benefit plans, which are more fully described in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are not included in the above table. Additional information about contractual cash obligations related to long term debt and operating and capital leases is in Notes 8 and 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The consolidated statement of cash flows, included under Item 8 of this Form 10 K, provides additional liquidity information.

Risk Management The global scope of our business activities requires that we balance what we perceive to be the primary risks in our businesses with a comprehensive and well integrated risk management function. The measurement, monitoring and mitigation of risks are essential to the financial performance and successful management of State Streets businesses. These risks, if not effectively managed, can result in current losses to State Street as well as erosion of our capital and damage to our reputation. Our systematic approach also allows for a more precise assessment of risks within a framework for evaluating opportunities for the prudent use of capital. We have a disciplined approach to risk management that involves all levels of management. The Board provides extensive review and oversight of State Streets overall risk management programs, including the approval of key risk management policies and the periodic review of State Streets key risk indicators. These indicators are designed to identify major business activities of State Street with significant risk content, and to establish quantifiable thresholds for risk measurement. Key risk indicators are reported regularly to the Executive Committee of the Board, and are reviewed periodically for appropriateness. Modifications to the indicators are made to reflect changes in our business activities or refinements to existing measurements. Enterprise Risk Management, or ERM, a dedicated corporate group, provides oversight, support and coordination across business units and is responsible for the formulation and maintenance of enterprise wide risk management policies and guidelines. In addition, ERM establishes and reviews approved limits, and with the support of business line management, monitors key risks. The head of ERM meets regularly with the Board or a Board committee, as appropriate, and has the authority to escalate issues as necessary. The execution of duties in the management of people, products, business operations and processes is the responsibility of business unit managers. The risk management function is responsible for designing, orchestrating and directing the implementation of risk management programs and processes consistent with corporate and regulatory standards. Accordingly, risk management is a shared responsibility and requires joint efforts in goal setting, program design and implementation, resource management, and performance evaluation between business and functional units. Responsibility for risk management is overseen by a series of management committees. The Major Risk Committee, or MRC, is responsible for the formulation, recommendation and approval of policies, guidelines and programs governing the identification, analysis, measurement and control of material risks across State 44 State Street Corporation Street. Chaired by the head of ERM, the MRC focuses on the review of business activities with significant risk content and the assessment of risk management programs and initiatives, and also serves as the credit policy committee for State Street. The Capital Committee, chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, oversees the management of our regulatory and economic capital, the determination of the framework for capital allocation and strategies for capital structure and debt and equity issuances. ALCO, chaired by the Treasurer, oversees the management of our consolidated balance sheet, including management of our global liquidity and interest rate risk positions. The Fiduciary Committee reviews the criteria for the acceptance of fiduciary duties, and assists our business lines with their fiduciary responsibilities executed on behalf of customers. Several other committees with specialized risk management functions report to the MRC. Corporate Audit serves in a complementary role to our risk management program, providing the Board and management with continuous monitoring and control assessments to ensure adherence to State Streets policies and procedures and the effectiveness of its system of internal controls. Additionally, the internal control environment is evaluated through external examinations and regulatory compliance efforts. The Corporate Compliance and Legal groups also serve essential risk management roles. Corporate Compliance is responsible for the design, implementation and oversight of policies, guidelines and programs to ensure our compliance with applicable laws and regulations wherever State Street conducts business, and monitors our adherence to corporate policies in our businesses. The Legal group provides counsel that enables us to deal with complex legal and regulatory environments, maximize business opportunities and minimize legal, regulatory and other risks. While we believe our risk management program is effective in managing the risks in our businesses, external factors may create risks that cannot always be identified and anticipated. For example, a material counterparty failure or a default of a material obligor could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Market Risk Market risk is defined as the risk of adverse financial impact due to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and other market driven rates or prices. State Street is exposed to market risk both in its trading and non trading, or asset and liability management, activities. The market risk management processes for these activities, discussed in further detail below, apply to both on balance sheet and off balance sheet exposures. Trading Activities: We primarily engage in trading and investment activities to serve our customers needs and to contribute to overall corporate earnings and liquidity. In the conduct of these activities, we are subject to, and assume, market risk. The level of market risk that we assume is a function of our overall objectives and liquidity needs, customer requirements and market volatility. Interest rate risk, a component of market risk, is more thoroughly discussed in the Asset and Liability Management portion of this Market Risk section. State Street manages its overall market risk through a comprehensive risk management framework. This structure includes a market risk measurement group that reports independently to senior management through ERM. Market risk associated with foreign exchange and trading activities is controlled through established limits on aggregate and net open positions, sensitivity to changes in interest rates, and concentrations, which are supplemented by stop loss thresholds. We use an array of risk management tools and methodologies, including value at risk, to measure, monitor and control market risk. All limits and measurement techniques are reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a regular basis by business managers, the market risk management group and the Trading and Market Risk Committee. We use a variety of derivative financial instruments to support customers needs, conduct trading activities and manage our interest rate and currency risk. These activities are designed to create trading revenue or hedge volatility in net interest revenue. In addition, we provide services related to derivative financial instruments in our role as both a manager and servicer of financial assets. Our customers use derivative financial instruments to manage the financial risks associated with their investment goals and business activities. With the growth of cross border investing, customers have an increasing need for foreign exchange forward contracts to convert currency for international investment and to manage the currency risk in international investment portfolios. As an active participant in the foreign exchange markets, we provide foreign exchange forward contracts and options in support of these customer needs. State Street Corporation 45 As part of our trading activities, we assume positions in the foreign exchange and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and using derivative financial instruments, including foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange and interest rate options and interest rate swaps. As of December 31, 2005, the notional amounts of all of these derivative financial instruments were $436.28 billion, of which $414.38 billion were foreign exchange forward contracts. In the aggregate, long and short foreign exchange forward positions are closely matched to minimize currency and interest rate risk. All foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at current market rates. We use a variety of risk measurement and estimation techniques, including value at risk. Value at risk is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical confidence interval. We use a risk management system to estimate value at risk daily for all material trading positions. We have adopted standards for estimating value at risk, and we maintain capital for market risk in accordance with applicable regulatory guidelines. Value at risk is estimated for a 99% one tail confidence interval and an assumed one day holding period using a historical observation period of greater than one year. A 99% one tail confidence interval implies that daily trading losses should not exceed the estimated value at risk more than 1% of the time, or approximately three days out of the year. The methodology uses a simulation approach based on observed changes in foreign exchange rates and takes into account the resulting diversification benefits provided from the mix of our trading positions. Like all quantitative risk measures, value at risk is subject to certain limitations and assumptions inherent in the methodology. Our methodology gives equal weight to all market rate observations regardless of how recently the market rates were observed. The estimate is calculated using static portfolios consisting of positions held at the end of the trading day. Implicit in the estimate is the assumption that no intraday action is taken by management during adverse market movements. As a result, the methodology does not represent risk associated with intraday changes in positions or intraday price volatility. The following table presents our market risk for our trading activities as measured by our value at risk methodology: VALUE AT RISK Annual Average Maximum Minimum (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2005: Foreign exchange products $ 1.3 $ 3.3 $ .5 Interest rate products 1.1 3.0 .3 2004: Foreign exchange products $ 1.3 $ 3.5 $ .3 Interest rate products 1.6 3.0 1.0 We compare actual daily profits and losses from trading activities to estimated one day value at risk. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we did not experience any trading losses in excess of our end of day value at risk estimate. Asset and Liability Management Activities: The primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable and growing net interest revenue, or NIR, under varying economic environments, while protecting the economic values of our balance sheet assets and liabilities from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates. Most of our NIR is earned from the investment of deposits generated by our core Investment Servicing and Investment Management businesses. We structure our balance sheet assets to generally conform to the characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities, but we manage our overall interest rate risk position in the context of current and anticipated market conditions and within approved risk guidelines. 46 State Street Corporation Our overall interest rate risk position is maintained within a series of policies approved by the Board and guidelines established and monitored by ALCO. Our Global Treasury unit has responsibility for managing State Streets day to day interest rate risk. To effectively manage the consolidated balance sheet and related net interest revenue, Global Treasury has the authority to take a limited amount of interest rate risk based on market conditions and its views about the direction of global interest rates over both short term and long term time horizons. To accommodate our increasing non U.S. dollar exposures and to further coordinate our global interest rate risk management activities, Global Treasury has established regional treasury centers in Europe and the Asia/Pacific region during 2005. Consolidated balance sheet assets are the primary tools used in managing interest rate risk. We invest in financial instruments with currency, repricing, and maturity characteristics we consider appropriate to manage our overall interest rate risk position. In addition to on balance sheet assets, we use certain derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps, to synthetically alter the interest rate characteristics of specific balance sheet assets or liabilities. The use of derivative financial instruments is subject to ALCO approved guidelines. Additional information about our use of derivative financial instruments is in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. As our non U.S. operations have grown, non U.S. dollar denominated customer liabilities have become an increasingly significant portion of our consolidated balance sheet. We use two methods to reduce foreign currency translation risk: (1) invest in interest bearing deposits with multinational financial institutions in the same currency as the customer liability; and (2) invest in U.S. dollar investment securities after conversion from local currencies into U.S. dollars using spot and forward foreign exchange contacts. While foreign exchange risk has been mitigated, we do have exposure to changes in the shape and level of non U.S. dollar yield curves, which we include in our consolidated interest rate risk management process. Because no one individual measure can accurately assess all of our risks to changes in rates, we use several quantitative measures in our assessment of current and potential future exposures to changes in interest rates and their impact on net interest revenue and balance sheet values. Net interest revenue simulation is the primary tool used in our evaluation of the potential range of possible net interest revenue results that could occur under a variety of interest rate environments. We also use market valuation and duration analysis to assess changes in the economic value of balance sheet assets and liabilities caused by assumed changes in interest rates. Finally, gap analysis the difference between the amount of balance sheet assets and liabilities repricing within a specified time period is used as a measurement of our interest rate risk position. To measure, monitor, and report on our interest rate risk position, we begin with two models: (1) NIR simulation, or NIR at risk, which measures the impact on NIR over the next twelve months to immediate, or rate shock, and slow, or rate ramp, changes in market interest rates; and (2) economic value of equity, or EVE, that measures the impact on the present value of all NIR related principal and interest cash flows of an immediate change in interest rates. NIR at risk is designed to measure the potential impact of changes in market interest rates on net interest revenue in the short term. EVE, on the other hand, is a long term view of interest rate risk, but with a liquidation view of State Street. Both of these models are subject to ALCO established guidelines, and are monitored regularly, along with other relevant simulations, scenario analyses and stress tests by both Global Treasury and ALCO. In calculating our NIR at risk, we start with a base amount of net interest revenue that is projected over the next twelve months, assuming that the then current yield curve remains unchanged over the period. Our existing balance sheet assets and liabilities are adjusted by the amount and timing of transactions that are forecasted to occur over the next twelve months. That yield curve is then shocked, or moved immediately, &plusmn;100 basis points, or bps, in a parallel fashion, or at all points along the yield curve. Two new twelve month NIR projections are then developed using the same balance sheet and forecasted transactions, but with the new yield curves, and compared to the base scenario. We also perform the calculations using interest rate ramps, which are &plusmn;100 basis point changes in interest rates that are assumed to occur gradually over the next twelve month period, rather than immediately as we do with interest rate shocks. EVE is based on the change in the present value of all NIR related principal and interest cash flows for changes in market rates of interest. The present value of existing cash flows with a then current yield curve serves as the base case. We then apply an immediate parallel shock to that yield curve of &plusmn;200 basis points and recalculate the cash flows and related present values. A large shock is used to better capture the embedded option risk in our mortgage backed securities that results from the borrowers prepayment opportunity. State Street Corporation 47 Key assumptions used in the models described above include the timing of cash flows; the maturity and repricing of balance sheet assets and liabilities, especially option embedded financial instruments like mortgage backed securities; changes in market conditions; and interest rate sensitivities of our customer liabilities with respect to the interest rates paid and the level of balances. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the models cannot precisely calculate future NIR or predict the impact of changes in interest rates on NIR and economic value. Actual results could differ from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and market conditions, changes in spreads and management strategies, among other factors. Projections of potential future streams of NIR are assessed as part of our forecasting process. The following table presents the estimated exposure of NIR for the next twelve months, calculated as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, due to an immediate &plusmn; 100 basis point shift in then current interest rates. Estimated incremental exposures set forth below are dependent on managements assumptions about asset and liability sensitivities under various interest rate scenarios, such as those previously discussed, and do not reflect any actions management may undertake in order to mitigate some of the adverse effects of interest rate changes on State Streets financial performance. NIR AT RISK Estimated Exposure to Net Interest Revenue 2005 2004 (Dollars in millions) Rate Change + 100 bps shock $ (58 ) $ (49 ) 100 bps shock (5 ) 3 + 100 bps ramp (35 ) (39 ) 100 bps ramp 9 18 The following table presents estimated EVE exposures, calculated as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, assuming an immediate and prolonged shift in interest rates, the impact of which would be spread over a number of years. ECONOMIC VALUE OF EQUITY Estimated Exposure to Economic Value of Equity 2005 2004 (Dollars in millions) Rate Change + 200 bps shock $ (714 ) $ (775 ) 200 bps shock 138 467 While the measures presented in the tables above are not a prediction of future NIR or valuations, they do suggest that if all other variables remained constant, in the short term, falling interest rates would lead to NIR that is higher than it would otherwise have been, and rising rates would lead to lower NIR. Other important factors that impact the levels of NIR are balance sheet size and mix; interest rate spreads; the slope and interest rate level of U.S. dollar and non U.S. dollar yield curves and the relationship between them; how quickly or slowly market interest rates change; and management actions taken in response to the preceding conditions. One of the most significant assumptions underlying our modeling methodologies and the level of our NIR is the reaction of our balance sheet liabilities, such as deposits, to movements in market interest rates. Customer deposit balances and related interest rates are an important element of the profitability of the overall customer relationship. Generally, we invest customer deposits in money market assets and high quality investment securities, the mix of which is determined by the interest rate and balance sensitivities of customer deposits under a variety of economic environments. We regularly assess the characteristics of customer liabilities by product, geography, currency and customer type to ensure that the characteristics have not materially changed in a way that would create material risk to our NIR and net interest margin. 48 State Street Corporation During 2005, we performed a comprehensive review of the interest rate sensitivities of our customer liabilities with respect to interest rates paid and the level of balances. The results of the review demonstrated a generally longer duration than previously considered. The incremental exposures presented in the preceding tables as of December 31, 2005 reflect the results of this review. Incremental exposures as of December 31, 2004 were not comparatively restated. Credit Risk Credit and counterparty risk is defined as the risk of financial loss if a borrower or counterparty is either unable or unwilling to repay borrowings or settle in accordance with contractual terms. The extension of credit and acceptance of counterparty risk by State Street are governed by corporate guidelines based on the prospective customers risk profile, the markets served, counterparty and country concentrations, and regulatory compliance. Our focus on large institutional investors and their businesses requires that we assume concentrated credit risk in a variety of forms to certain highly rated entities. This concentration risk is mitigated by comprehensive guidelines and procedures to monitor and manage all aspects of credit and counterparty risk that we undertake. Exposures are evaluated on an individual basis at least annually. We provide, on a limited basis, traditional loan products and services to key customers and prospects in a manner that enhances customer relationships, increases profitability and minimizes risk. We employ a relationship model in which credit decisions are based upon credit quality and the overall institutional relationship. This model is typical of financial institutions that provide credit to institutional customers in the markets that we serve. An allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb probable credit losses in the loan portfolio and is reviewed regularly by management for adequacy. An internal rating system is used to assess potential risk of loss based on current economic and or customer financial indicators. As a part of the implementation of the Basel II provisions, State Street has developed and is implementing a new rating system for its various types of credit exposures. The provision for loan losses is a charge to earnings to maintain the overall allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate relative to the level of credit risk in the loan and lease financing portfolio. No provision was recorded in 2005. In 2004, we reversed $18 million through the provision as a result of reduced credit risk exposures and improved credit quality. State Street Corporation 49 At December 31, 2005, the allowance for loan losses was $18 million, less than 1% of total loans, unchanged from $18 million a year ago. Changes in the allowance for loan losses for the years ended December 31, were as follows: 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 (Dollars in millions) U.S.: Balance at beginning of year $ 14 $ 43 $ 43 $ 40 $ 41 Provision for loan losses (15 ) 4 8 Loan charge offs commercial and financial (3 ) (9 ) Recoveries commercial and financial 3 Transferred upon sale(1) (1 ) Reclassification(2) (14 ) Balance at end of year U.S. 14 14 43 43 40 Non U.S.: Balance at beginning of year 4 18 18 18 16 Provision for loan losses (3 ) 2 Loan charge offs Reclassification(2) (11 ) Balance at end of year Non U.S. 4 4 18 18 18 Total balance at end of year $ 18 $ 18 $ 61 $ 61 $ 58 Ratio of net charge offs (recoveries) to average loans outstanding .14 % (1) In December 2002, we completed the sale of our Global Trade Banking business, which included the transfer of $1 million of the allowance for loan losses. (2) During 2004, we reclassified $25 million of the allowance for loan losses to other liabilities as a reserve for off balance sheet commitments. Subsequent to the reclassification, the reserve for off balance sheet commitments was reduced by $10 million, and recorded as an offset to other operating expenses. Past due loans are loans on which principal or interest payments are over 90 days delinquent, but where interest continues to be accrued. There were no past due loans as of December 31, 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002. There were less than $1 million of past due loans as of December 31, 2001 to a non U.S. customer. We generally place loans on non accrual status once payments are 60 days past due, or when management determines that full collection is not probable. Loans 60 days past due, but considered both well secured and in the process of collection, may be excluded from non accrual status. For loans placed on non accrual status, revenue recognition is suspended. There were no non accrual loans at year end 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002, and less than $1 million at year end 2001, all to U.S. customers. State Street purchases securities under agreements to resell. Risk is minimized by establishing the acceptability of counterparties; limiting purchases almost exclusively to low risk U.S. government securities; taking possession or control of transaction assets; monitoring levels of underlying collateral; and limiting the duration of the agreements. Securities are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary from the borrower. Most repurchase agreements are short term, with maturities of less than 90 days. State Street also provides customers with off balance sheet liquidity and credit enhancement facilities in the form of letters of credit, lines of credit and liquidity asset purchase agreements. These exposures are subject to an extensive initial credit analysis, with detailed approval and review processes. These facilities are also actively monitored and reviewed on an annual basis. We maintain a separate reserve for probable credit losses related to certain of these off balance sheet activities. Management reviews the adequacy of this reserve on a regular basis. We lend securities to creditworthy banks, broker dealers and other institutions on behalf of customers, and in certain circumstances, we provide indemnities for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities. Though these transactions are well collateralized, the substantial volume of these activities necessitates rigorous credit based underwriting and monitoring processes. State Street requires the borrowers to provide collateral in an amount equal to or in excess of 102% 50 State Street Corporation of the fair market value of the securities borrowed. The borrowed securities are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary. State Street held, as agent, cash and U.S. government securities totaling $387.22 billion and $360.61 billion as collateral for indemnified securities financing at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Rigorous processes for credit approval and monitoring are in place for other credit related activities, which include cash due from banks; interest bearing deposits with banks; federal funds sold; and foreign exchange trading. As part of the approval and renewal process, appropriate due diligence is conducted based on the size and term of the exposure, as well as the quality of the counterparty. Exposures to these entities are aggregated and evaluated by ERM. Investments in debt and equity securities, including investments in affiliates, are monitored regularly by Corporate Finance and ERM. To the extent necessary, procedures are in place for evaluating potentially impaired securities. Total non performing investment securities at December 31, 2005 were $4 million, compared to $7 million at December 31, 2004. Operational Risk We define operational risk as the potential for loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, and from external events. As a leading provider of services to institutional investors, our customers have a broad array of complex and specialized servicing, confidentiality and fiduciary requirements. Active management of operational risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business, and responsibility for the management of operational risk lies with every individual at State Street. Our Operational Risk Policy Statement defines operational risk and details roles and responsibilities for managing operational risk. The Policy Statement is reinforced by the Operational Risk Guidelines, which codify our approach to operational risk. The Guidelines document our sound practices and provide a mandate within which programs, processes, and regulatory elements are implemented to ensure that operational risk is identified, measured, managed and controlled in an effective and consistent manner across State Street. We maintain an operational risk governance structure to ensure that responsibilities are clearly defined and to provide independent oversight of operational risk management. ERM oversees the overall operational risk management program. The MRC and the Operational Risk Committee review key risk indicators and policies related to operational risk, provide oversight to ensure compliance with the operational risk program, and escalate operational risk issues of note to the Executive Committee of the Board. Corporate Audit performs independent reviews of the application of operational risk management practices and methodologies and reports to the Examining and Audit Committee of the Board. State Streets internal control environment is designed to provide a sound operational environment. Our discipline in managing operational risk provides the structure to identify, evaluate, control, monitor, measure, mitigate and report operational risk. Business Risk We define business risk as the risk of adverse changes in our earnings related to business factors, including changes in the competitive environment, changes in the operational economics of business activities and the potential effect of strategic and reputation risks, not already captured as market, credit or operational risks. We incorporate business risk into our assessment of our economic capital needs. Active management of business risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business, and responsibility for the management of business risk lies with every individual at State Street. It is sometimes difficult to separate the effects of a potential adverse event into operational and business risks. For instance, the direct financial impact of an unfavorable event in the form of fines or penalties would be classified as an operational risk loss, while the impact on our reputation and the potential loss of customers and corresponding decline in revenue would be classified as a business risk loss. An additional example of business risk is the integration of a major acquisition. Failure to successfully integrate the operations of an acquired business, and the resultant inability to retain customers as a result of integration issues, would be classified as a business risk loss. Business risk is managed with a long term focus. Techniques include the careful development of business plans and appropriate management oversight. The potential impact of the various elements of business risk is difficult to quantify with any degree of precision. We use a combination of historical earnings volatility, scenario State Street Corporation 51 analysis, stress testing and management judgment to help assess the potential effect on State Street attributable to business risk. Management and control of business risks is generally the responsibility of the business units as part of their overall and strategic planning and internal risk management processes. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Assets under custody and assets under management are held by State Street in a fiduciary or custodial capacity for our customers and are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition, in accordance with GAAP. Similarly, collateral funds resulting from our securities finance activities are held by us as agent; therefore, these assets are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. We sell and distribute securities for two types of off balance sheet entities that are not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Additional information about these special purpose entities is in Notes 9 and 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. The risks associated with providing administration, liquidity, and or credit enhancements to these special purpose entities are reviewed as part of our corporate risk management process in a manner that is consistent with applicable policies and guidelines. We believe that State Street has sufficient liquidity and has provided adequate credit reserves to cover any risks associated with these activities. As further explained in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8, we utilize derivative financial instruments in our asset and liability management process. Recent Accounting Developments Information related to recent accounting developments is in Notes 1 and 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. 52 State Street Corporation TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS State Street delivered value in 2005. We delivered value to our shareholders, our customers, our employees and the communities in which we operate. We achieved this value by focusing on delivering for our customers, executing our plan against our goals, performing consistently for our shareholders, providing more opportunities for our employees, and continuing to give back to the communities where we do business. Our goals for 2005 included growth in operating earnings per share of between 10 and 15 percent, growth in operating revenue of between 8 and 12 percent, and operating return on shareholders equity of between 14 and 17 percent. We achieved these goals, increasing operating earnings per share from continuing operations by 14 percent and operating revenue by 10 percent and recording return on shareholders equity from continuing operations of 15.3 percent. Assets under custody hit an all time high of $10.1 trillion and assets under management rose to a record $1.4 trillion. 2005 was our 28th consecutive year of operating earnings per share growth and our 27th consecutive year of dividend increases, which rose 12 percent. We also repurchased 13 million shares of our stock, putting our share count at 334 million shares outstanding, just as it was at the end of 2004. I measure the years achievements in four ways. Financial We remained focused on the bottom line in 2005, carefully balancing revenue growth with continued expense management. This focus allowed us to generate positive operating leverage for the year, an objective I set out to accomplish when I took over as chairman and chief executive officer in July 2004, and one that I continue to target. I view our 2005 results as a start, and an indication that we are heading in the right direction. Business growth across the company helped fuel our revenue increase in 2005. We added more than 2,000 new investment servicing and investment management wins in 2005, a result of our strong sales culture and our ability to execute. State Street Global Advisors (SSgA), our investment management arm and the largest institutional asset manager in the world, also posted significant growth in 2005 and improved its contribution to State Street overall. SSgA now represents 21 percent of State Streets total pretax income, up from 17 percent a year ago. We continued to deepen existing customer relationships and expand new product capabilities. These factors, combined with new business growth, enabled us to deliver what I consider to be better top line performance than our peers. 53 State Street Corporation We continue to see significant opportunities for growth outside of the United States, which accounted for 39 percent of State Streets revenue in 2005, up from 37 percent at the end of 2004. I have set a goal of increasing this number to 50 percent over time, fueled in part by the growth of savings and retirement assets in Europe and the Asia Pacific region and the globalization of investing. In addition to revenue growth, positive operating leverage was achieved through expense control. By monitoring our headcount, adding mainly to support new business wins and by better aligning our real estate portfolio with our needs, we slowed our rate of expense growth. Our strengthened and more cost effective global servicing model, shaped in part by new regulatory requirements, helped us to better serve our customers in the locations where they do business. We now have processing hubs in multiple locations around the world including Canada and India. The centralized treasury group that we formed early in 2005 has improved management of our balance sheet, which is driven by customer liabilities. To better position State Street for rising interest rates, in 2005 we expanded the investment portfolio and adjusted the mix of investments to include higher yielding floating rate securities, ending the year with a conservatively invested portfolio, 95 percent of which was AA rated or better. Customer State Streets singular focus on providing large, global institutional investors with unparalleled service and value remained a differentiator for our company in 2005. Our ability to handle complex transactions, create innovative solutions and improve efficiencies helped us to attract new customers and add significant value to our existing customer relationships around the world. 2,086 14% new investment servicing and growth in operating earnings per share investment management wins from continuing operations 54 State Street Corporation Major wins that fell into the expanded business category in 2005 included a landmark investment manager operations outsourcing renewal from Scottish Widows Investment Partnership in Edinburgh, extending our relationship with this customer well into a second decade. The years biggest investment servicing win, from Columbia Management Advisors, LLC, the asset management arm of Bank of America, gave State Street a key role in one of the largest fund integrations in the history of the mutual fund industry. This piece of business expands upon our existing relationship with a fund family that was acquired by Bank of America and illustrates our ability to earn the trust and confidence of our customers, as does another investment servicing appointment from Charles Schwab Investment Management for $149 billion in assets. Two wins from Volkswagen Group one in the United Kingdom and the other in Germany are further proof of our ability to expand many of the custody and accounting relationships we established years ago. We also established many new customer relationships in 2005 in all major geographies and across all our capabilities. These relationships include conducting one of the largest ever transition management assignments for a customer in Japan and providing servicing and management for a wide range of pension and investment schemes in Europe and Asia Pacific. State Streets ability to develop new products and services for both new and existing customers continues to set us apart. State Street Global Advisors played an important role during the year in helping to enhance Asias bond markets as manager of the ABF Pan Asia Bond Index Fund, a key component of the Asian Bond Fund 2, an initiative developed by a group of 11 central banks and monetary authorities designed to provide governments with an additional source of credit. The fund invests in the local currency debt of eight countries in Asia, increasing investors access to this vital region of the world. 10% 28 increase in operating revenue consecutive years of growth in operating earnings per share 55 State Street Corporation Product innovation continues to be a focus for us. State Street Global Advisors developed several new strategies including Global Alpha Plus, an innovative investment strategy designed to achieve consistent excess returns. It also launched a number of liability driven investment strategies aimed at better matching assets to liabilities for pension funds. SSgAs growing active product array contributed to more than half of its net new revenue in 2005. With a renewed focus on exchange traded funds, SSgA also launched nine new ETFs during the year, including the SPDR&reg; Dividend, and saw strong growth in some of its innovative approaches such as the streetTRACKS&reg; Gold Shares. Our research and trading capabilities, including foreign exchange, equity execution, transition management and securities finance activities, also posted record results in 2005. Daily trading volume on FX Connect,&reg; our multibank electronic trading system, surpassed $45 billion and State Street remained the unmatched leader in transition management, managing more than $380 billion in transitions during the year. Continued demand for our quantitative investment research led us to expand our successful State Street Investor Confidence Index&reg;, which now includes regional views for Europe, North America and the Asia Pacific region. As we advance our effort to serve customers in all the markets where they do business, we strengthened our presence in 2005 in Switzerland, the Netherlands and Hong Kong, and opened a representative office in Beijing, China. These markets will play an important role in our goal to increase revenue outside the United States. Governance State Street has made several recent changes to its corporate governance policies. First, we created a new chief compliance officer position charged with centralizing and overseeing State Streets compliance program. Our board of directors 13 out of 14 of whom qualify as independent under the New York Stock Exchange listing standards are now elected annually, eliminating three year terms of the past. Shareholders also now annually ratify the appointment of our auditors, Ernst & Young LLP. In 2005, the board adopted a majority voting standard requiring a director or nominee who receives a withhold vote from the majority of outstanding shares in an uncontested election of directors to submit his or her resignation, to be considered by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. 56 State Street Corporation Talent Great companies are built around extraordinary individual execution. We must continue to invest in State Streets future by developing and leveraging our deep pool of talented professionals. Today, we are investing in our employees at a higher level than ever before. In 2005, we added more training, enhanced our salary and promotions process, and undertook several initiatives to move executives within State Street globally to provide a deeper bench of talent that supports our succession planning. One such example is the appointment in 2005 of Bill Hunt, an 11 year company veteran, to lead State Street Global Advisors. State Street employees continue to give their time and money to improve the communities where we live and work. In a year of unprecedented natural disasters around the world, State Street colleagues offered their help and support to a variety of relief efforts, while continuing to support local charitable endeavors. More than a quarter of our workforce invested approximately 30,000 hours of volunteer time around the globe last year. Giving back is an inherent part of the State Street culture and a source of great corporate pride. In 2005, I believe State Street became a stronger, more efficient and more focused company. As we move into 2006, Im encouraged that our business pipeline remains strong, and that were executing well against our strategic objectives. For 2006, we have once again set financial goals of achieving revenue growth between 8 and 12 percent, earnings per share growth between 10 and 15 percent and return on shareholders equity between 14 and 17 percent. We are currently targeting the middle of those ranges. In my 18 months as State Streets chairman and CEO, conversations with our customers have assured me of one thing: When customers come to State Street, they get a value they cannot find anywhere else. We delivered that value in 2005, and I will keep working to build on that value for all of our stakeholders in the future. Sincerely, Ronald E.
