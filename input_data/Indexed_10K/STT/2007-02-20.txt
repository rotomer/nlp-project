ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS GENERAL State Street Corporation is a financial holding company organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this Managements Discussion to State Street, we, us, our or similar terms mean State Street Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. At December 31, 2006, we had total assets of $107.35 billion, total deposits of $65.65 billion, total shareholders equity of $7.25 billion and employed 21,700. With $11.85 trillion of assets under custody and $1.75 trillion of assets under management at year end 2006, we are a leading specialist in meeting the needs of institutional investors worldwide. In February 2007, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Investors Financial Services Corp., or Investors Financial, a $12 billion bank holding company based in Boston. Under the terms of the agreement, we will exchange .906 shares of our common stock for each share of Investors Financial common stock. The transaction is subject to customary conditions, including the approvals of Investors Financial shareholders and regulatory agencies, and we expect to close the acquisition in the third quarter of 2007. We cannot be certain that approvals of Investors Financial shareholders or the regulators will be obtained. The acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase. The acquisition agreement contains certain termination rights for both State Street and Investors Financial, and further provides that, if the agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, Investors Financial will be required to pay State Street a termination fee of up to $165 million. We report two lines of business: Investment Servicing and Investment Management. These lines of business provide a full range of products and services for our customers, which include mutual funds and other collective investment funds, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, foundations, endowments and other investment pools, and investment managers. Investment Servicing provides services to support institutional investors, such as custody, product and participant level accounting, daily pricing and administration; master trust and master custody; recordkeeping; shareholder services, including mutual fund and collective investment fund shareholder accounting; foreign exchange, brokerage and other trading services; securities finance; deposit and short term investment facilities; loans and lease financing; investment manager and hedge fund manager operations outsourcing; and performance, risk and compliance analytics. Investment Management provides a broad array of services for managing financial assets, such as investment research services and investment management, including passive and active U.S. and non U.S. equity and fixed income strategies. For additional information about our lines of business, see the Line of Business Information section of this Managements Discussion and Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. This Managements Discussion and Analysis is part of our Annual Report on Form 10 K to the SEC, and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. Certain previously reported amounts presented have been reclassified to conform to current period classifications. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. or GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the application of certain accounting policies that materially affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Estimates that require management to make assumptions that are difficult, subjective or complex about matters that are uncertain and may change in subsequent periods are discussed in more depth in the Significant Accounting Estimates section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. 20 This Managements Discussion and Analysis contains statements that are considered forward looking statements within the meaning of U.S. federal securities laws. Forward looking statements are based on our current expectations about revenue and market growth, acquisitions and divestitures, new technologies, services and opportunities, earnings and other factors. These forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially. We undertake no obligation to revise the forward looking statements contained in this Managements Discussion and Analysis to reflect events after the date we file this Form 10 K with the SEC. Additional information about forward looking statements and related risks and uncertainties is included in this Form 10 K under Item 1A. OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL RESULTS Years ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Total fee revenue $ 5,186 $ 4,551 $ 4,048 Net interest revenue 1,110 907 859 Provision for loan losses (18 ) Gains (Losses) on sales of available for sale investment securities, net 15 (1 ) 26 Gain on sale of divested business 16 Total revenue 6,311 5,473 4,951 Total operating expenses 4,540 4,041 3,759 Income from continuing operations before income tax expense 1,771 1,432 1,192 Income tax expense from continuing operations 675 487 394 Income from continuing operations 1,096 945 798 Net income (loss) from discontinued operations 10 (107 ) Net income $ 1,106 $ 838 $ 798 Earnings Per Share From Continuing Operations: Basic $ 3.31 $ 2.86 $ 2.38 Diluted 3.26 2.82 2.35 Earnings Per Share: Basic $ 3.34 $ 2.53 $ 2.38 Diluted 3.29 2.50 2.35 Return on shareholders equity from continuing operations 16.2 % 15.3 % 13.3 % Return on shareholders equity 16.4 13.6 13.3 Summary Our financial results for 2006 reflect our overall objectives of consistent revenue growth, balancing expense growth with growth in revenue and continuing to expand our business overseas. The highlights are as follows: Each category of revenue, as reported in our consolidated statement of income, increased in double digits compared to 2005, with the exception of processing fees and other revenue. We achieved positive operating leverage for 2006 compared to 2005. Our Investment Management business, State Street Global Advisors, or SSgA, increased its contribution to our consolidated results of operations to approximately 19% of consolidated total revenue and approximately 24% of consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes for 2006, compared to 18% and 21%, respectively, for 2005. 21 We grew the proportion of our non U.S. revenue to approximately 43% of consolidated total revenue, from approximately 39% for 2005. We ended 2006 with record levels of assets under custody and assets under management. We exceeded our operating basis financial goals for 2006 concerning growth in total revenue, growth in earnings per share from continuing operations and return on shareholders equity from continuing operations, all compared to 2005. Our financial results for 2006 are summarized in the following Financial Highlights section, followed by a more detailed discussion in the Consolidated Results of Operations section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. Financial Highlights For 2006, we recorded income from continuing operations of $1.1 billion, or $3.26 per diluted share, a 16% increase from $945 million, or $2.82 per diluted share, for 2005. Total revenue increased 15% from 2005, and return on equity from continuing operations was 16.2%. Overall results for 2006 included net income from discontinued operations of $10 million (pre tax income of $16 million reduced by related tax expense of $6 million), or $.03 per share, the result of the finalization of certain legal, selling and other costs recorded in connection with our divestiture of Bel Air Investment Advisors LLC. Our results for 2005 included a net loss from discontinued operations of $107 million ($165 million charge reduced by related tax benefit of $58 million), related to our commitment to divest Bel Air. Total revenue for 2006 grew 15% from 2005, with about three quarters of the growth generated from existing customers. Total fee revenue for 2006, which grew 14%, reflected consistent growth throughout the year in servicing and management fees, up 10% and 26%, respectively, compared to 2005. Generally, servicing fees benefited from our continued expansion overseas and our cross selling of services to our broad customer base, while management fees benefited from the strategic introduction of quantitative active products, which provide higher margin revenue. Trading services revenue, which benefited from strong capital markets in the first half of 2006, grew 24% year over year. Securities finance revenue, which peaked in the second quarter and declined in the third quarter as a result of seasonality, benefited from increases in volumes of securities loaned, and for the full year increased 17% from 2005. We continued to cross sell our existing customer relationships and to introduce new products and services to existing and new customers. Net interest revenue increased 22% compared to 2005, and net interest margin increased to 1.25% from 1.08%. This growth was the result of several favorable trends (1) the balance sheet repositioning we began to execute in late 2004; (2) higher yields on the re investment of securities as they matured; (3) growth in our average balance sheet due to increased customer activity; (4) a more favorable mix of customer deposits, particularly non U.S. deposits; and (5) the absence of increases in short term interest rates by the Federal Reserve during the second half of the year. We accomplished the repositioning of the balance sheet without adversely affecting the credit profile of our investment portfolio, and at year end 2006 had about 94% of the portfolio invested in AAA or AA rated securities, with 88% invested in AAA rated securities, compared to 95% and 90%, respectively, at year end 2005. Total operating expenses increased 12% from 2005, as we continued to carefully balance consistent expense management with revenue growth. Most of the increase was the result of increased incentive compensation due to our improved performance and increased headcount to support new business, particularly internationally. As a result, we generated positive operating leverage of almost 300 basis points on an annual basis, which we define as a rate of total revenue growth that exceeds the rate of growth of total operating expenses. 22 SSgA is increasingly becoming a more significant contributor to our overall results, as that business comprised about 19% of our total consolidated revenue and about 24% of our total income from continuing operations before income taxes for 2006, compared to 18% and 21%, respectively, for 2005, and achieved a pre tax operating margin of 35%, up from 31% for 2005. Net new business at SSgA was about $86 billion, with about two thirds in active management products, such as enhanced indexing, hedge fund strategies and active quantitative management. We continue to expand our business outside of the U.S., particularly in Europe and the Asia Pacific region. For 2006, approximately 43% of our consolidated total revenue was generated from non U.S. activities, up from approximately 39% for 2005, and at year end 2006 we employed 8,630 outside the U.S. Our goal is to eventually generate 50% of our consolidated total revenue from outside the United States. Assets under custody and assets under management both increased to record levels at year end 2006, with assets under custody at $11.85 trillion, up 17% from $10.12 trillion a year ago, and assets under management at $1.75 trillion, up 21% from $1.44 trillion a year ago. Assets under custody have grown at a compound annual rate of 18% since year end 2002, with U.S. assets growing by 14% and non U.S. assets growing by 36%, while assets under management have grown at a compound annual rate of 23% over the same period. Financial Goals In early 2006, we reaffirmed our financial goals for State Street for 2006. These financial goals were: Growth in operating basis revenue of between 8% and 12%; Growth in operating basis earnings per share from continuing operations of between 10% and 15%; and Operating basis return on shareholders equity from continuing operations of between 14% and 17%. Operating basis results, as defined by management, include fully taxable equivalent net interest revenue, reflecting tax equivalent adjustments of $45 million and $42 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively, and a corresponding charge to income tax expense, and for 2006, exclude aggregate tax related adjustments of $65 million, or $.20 per share. The tax adjustments related to additional provisions that resulted from the impact of the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act and issues with respect to certain of our leveraged leases. Management measures our financial goals and related results on an operating basis to provide financial information that is comparable from period to period, and to present comparable financial trends with respect to our ongoing business operations. The use of fully taxable equivalent net interest revenue facilitates the comparison of revenues from both taxable and non taxable sources. The previously described tax related adjustments are not part of our normal ongoing business operations, and as a result prevent a meaningful comparison of earnings per share and return on shareholders equity with that of other periods. Management believes that operating basis financial information facilitates an investors understanding and analysis of State Streets underlying performance and trends in addition to financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. For 2006, we exceeded our financial goals. We increased our operating basis earnings per share from continuing operations by 23%, from $2.82 to $3.46 (up 16% from $2.82 to $3.26 on a GAAP basis, including the tax related adjustments). Our operating basis revenue increased 15% from $5.52 billion to $6.36 billion (including taxable equivalent adjustments of $45 million for 2006 and $42 million for 2005); and we recorded operating basis return on shareholders equity from continuing operations of 17.1% (16.2% on a GAAP basis, including the tax related adjustments). 23 Outlook Our long term financial goals remain the same, but based on our recently announced agreement to acquire Investors Financial, we have adjusted our financial goals for 2007 to the following, assuming the acquisition closes in July 2007: Growth in operating basis revenue of between 16% and 18%; Growth in operating basis earnings per share from continuing operations of between 8% and 10%; and Operating basis return on shareholders equity from continuing operations of between 12% and 15%. Operating basis results for 2007 will exclude merger, integration and restructuring charges related to the above mentioned acquisition, and for 2006 will exclude the previously discussed tax related adjustments. Some of the factors and assumptions that we considered in determining this outlook for 2007 were as follows: Expected equity market growth, based on S&P 500 and or MSCI EAFE indices, of about 7%; Growth in revenue generated from active quantitative asset management products; Relatively stable domestic interest rates; The expected flattening of the U.S. dollar yield curve; The continuation of beneficial trends in non U.S. interest rates; Modest growth in non U.S. deposits, as well as the maintenance of a favorable mix of customer deposits, including demand deposits; A stable income tax and regulatory environment; Shareholder and regulatory approvals of the Investors Financial acquisition; Achievement of expected cost savings from the acquisition; and Retention of, and success in cross selling to, Investors Financials customer base. Information about other risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected is included in this Form 10 K under Item 1A. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This section discusses our consolidated results of operations for 2006 compared to 2005, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. 24 TOTAL REVENUE Change Years ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 2005 2006 (Dollars in millions) Fee Revenue: Servicing fees $ 2,723 $ 2,474 $ 2,263 10 % Management fees 943 751 623 26 Trading services 862 694 595 24 Securities finance 386 330 259 17 Processing fees and other 272 302 308 (10 ) Total fee revenue 5,186 4,551 4,048 14 Net Interest Revenue: Interest revenue 4,324 2,930 1,787 48 Interest expense 3,214 2,023 928 59 Net interest revenue 1,110 907 859 22 Provision for loan losses (18 ) Net interest revenue after provision for loan losses 1,110 907 877 22 Gains (Losses) on sales of available for sale investment securities, net 15 (1 ) 26 Gain on sale of Private Asset Management business 16 Total revenue $ 6,311 $ 5,473 $ 4,951 15 We are one of the worlds leading specialists in servicing mutual funds, other collective investment funds and pension plans. We are consistently gaining business globally, and for 2006, our non U.S. revenue was approximately 43% of our total revenue, compared to 26% for 2000. We provide a broad range of reliable, easy to integrate investment services that are global and enable our customers to develop and launch competitive new investment products. We also provide active management products, including enhanced indexing, hedge fund strategies and quantitative management, and passive investment management products and strategies. We provide fund accounting, custody, investment management, securities finance, transfer agency services, and operations outsourcing for investment managers and hedge fund managers. These services support the complex financial strategies and transactions of our customers worldwide, in any time zone across multiple currencies. Our focus on the total needs of the customer allows us to develop active, long term relationships that result in high customer retention, cross selling opportunities and recurring revenue. The servicing markets in which we compete are very price competitive, and we consistently focus on winning and retaining customer business. This focus requires a strong commitment to customers while constantly working toward providing services at lower costs. Our broad range of services generates fee revenue and net interest revenue. Fee revenue generated by investment servicing and investment management is augmented by securities finance, trading services and other processing fee revenue. We earn net interest revenue from customers deposits and short term investment activities, by providing deposit services and short term investment vehicles, such as repurchase agreements and commercial paper, to meet customers needs for high grade liquid investments, and investing these sources of funds and additional borrowings in assets yielding a higher rate. Fee Revenue Servicing and management fees are the largest components of fee revenue, and collectively comprised approximately 71% of total fee revenue for 2006 and 2005. These fees are a function of several factors, including the mix and volume of assets under custody and assets under management, securities positions held and the volume of portfolio transactions, and the types of products and services used by customers, and are affected by changes in worldwide equity and fixed income valuations. 25 Generally, servicing fees are impacted, in part, by changes in daily average valuations of assets under custody, while management fees are impacted by changes in month end valuations of assets under management. Additional factors, such as transaction volumes, balance credits, customer minimum balances and other factors may have a significant impact on servicing fee revenue. Generally, management fee revenue is more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue. In addition, performance fees have become a larger component of management fee revenue over the past two years, and amounted to about 9% of management fees for 2006. Performance fees are generated when the performance of managed funds exceeds benchmarks specified in the management agreements. In light of the above, we estimate, assuming all other factors remain constant, that a 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity values would result in a corresponding change in our total revenue of approximately 2%. If fixed income security values were to increase or decrease by 10%, we would anticipate a corresponding change of approximately 1% in our total revenue. The following table presents selected equity market indices. Daily averages and the averages of month end indices demonstrate worldwide equity market valuation changes that impact servicing and management fee revenue, respectively. Year end indices impact the value of assets under custody and management at those dates. The index names listed in the table and elsewhere in this Managements Discussion and Analysis are service marks of their respective owners.

Almost 70% of the $635 million increase in total fee revenue over 2005 came from servicing and management fees. Servicing Fees: Servicing fees include fee revenue from U.S. mutual funds, collective investment funds worldwide, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, foundations, endowments, and other investment pools. Products and services include custody; product and participant level accounting; daily pricing and administration; recordkeeping; investment manager and hedge fund manager operations outsourcing services; master trust and master custody; and performance, risk and compliance analytics. 26 The increase in servicing fees of $249 million from 2005 primarily resulted from net new business from existing and new customers, higher average equity market valuations, and higher customer transaction volumes. Net new business is defined as new business net of lost business. For 2006, servicing fees generated from customers outside the U.S. were approximately 44% of total servicing fees, up from 40% in 2005. We are the largest provider of mutual fund custody and accounting services in the United States. We distinguish ourselves from other mutual fund service providers by offering customers a broad array of integrated products and services, including accounting, daily pricing and fund administration. We calculate more than 31% of the U.S. mutual fund prices provided to NASDAQ that appear daily in The Wall Street Journal and other publications with an accuracy rate of 99.9%. We have a leading position for servicing U.S. tax exempt assets for corporate and public pension funds. We provide trust and valuation services for more than 4,300 daily priced portfolios, making us a leader for both monthly and daily valuation services. We are a leading service provider outside of the U.S. as well. In Germany, we provide Depotbank services for approximately 17% of retail and institutional fund assets. In the United Kingdom, we provide custody services for 19% of pension fund assets and provide administration services to more than 23% of mutual fund assets. We service approximately 13% of the hedge fund market and more than $500 billion of offshore assets, primarily domiciled in the Cayman Islands, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Channel Islands. We have more than $800 billion in assets under administration in the Asia Pacific region, and are a leader in Japan with more than 36% of the trust assets held by non domestic trust banks. At year end 2006, our total assets under custody were $11.85 trillion, compared to $10.12 trillion a year earlier. The value of assets under custody is a broad measure of the relative size of various markets served. Changes in the value of assets under custody do not necessarily result in proportional changes in revenue. Assets under custody consisted of the following at December 31: ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY As of December 31, 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 2005 2006 AGR 2002 2006 CAGR (Dollars in billions) Mutual funds $ 3,738 $ 3,442 $ 3,088 $ 3,094 $ 2,548 9 % 10 % Collective funds 1,665 1,001 911 1,153 260 66 59 Pension products 3,713 3,358 3,254 3,026 1,993 11 17 Insurance and other products 2,738 2,320 2,244 2,097 1,370 18 19 Total $ 11,854 $ 10,121 $ 9,497 $ 9,370 $ 6,171 17 18 MIX OF ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY As of December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (In billions) Financial Instrument Mix: Equities $ 5,821 $ 4,814 $ 4,688 Fixed income 4,035 3,797 3,286 Short term and other investments 1,998 1,510 1,523 Total $ 11,854 $ 10,121 $ 9,497 27 GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY As of December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (In billions) United States $ 8,962 $ 7,773 $ 7,268 Other Americas 607 508 466 Europe/Middle East/Africa 1,815 1,454 1,403 Asia/Pacific 470 386 360 Total $ 11,854 $ 10,121 $ 9,497 Management Fees: We provide a broad range of investment management strategies, specialized investment management advisory services and other financial services for corporations, public funds, and other sophisticated investors. These services are offered through State Street Global Advisors, or SSgA, a division of State Street. Based upon assets under management, SSgA is the largest manager of institutional assets worldwide, the largest manager of assets for tax exempt organizations (primarily pension plans) in the United States, and the fourth largest investment manager overall in the world. SSgA offers a broad array of investment management strategies, including passive and active, such as enhanced indexing and hedge fund strategies, using quantitative and fundamental methods for both U.S. and global equities and fixed income securities. SSgA also offers exchange traded funds, or ETFs, such as the SPDR Dividend ETFs. The $192 million increase in management fees from 2005 primarily resulted from higher equity market valuations and net new business. In addition, performance fees increased from $41 million in 2005 to $84 million in 2006. Management fees generated from customers outside the United States were approximately 32% of total management fees, up from 30% for 2005. At year end 2006, assets under management were $1.75 trillion, compared to $1.44 trillion at year end 2005. While certain management fees are directly determined by the value of assets under management and the investment strategy employed, management fees reflect other factors as well, including our relationship pricing for customers who use multiple services, and the benchmarks specified in the respective management agreements related to performance fees. Accordingly, there is not necessarily a direct correlation between the value of assets under management, market indices and management fee revenue.

We offer a complete range of foreign exchange services under an account model that focuses on the global requirements of our customers to execute trades and receive market insights in any time zone. We have exclusive ownership of FX Connect, the worlds first and leading foreign exchange trading platform, and we provide quantitatively based research into investor behavior, as well as consultative services that use quantitative tools designed to optimize our customers returns. Foreign exchange trading revenue is influenced by three principal factors: the volume and type of customer foreign exchange transactions; currency volatility and trend; and the management of currency market risks. For 2006, foreign exchange trading revenue increased 31%, to $611 million from $468 million in 2005, and benefited from a strong first half of the year. The increase from 2005 resulted from increased transaction volumes, a favorable transaction mix related to custody FX services, and an increase in FX trading profits, partially offset by a decline in customer volume weighted currency volatility. We also offer a range of brokerage and other trading products tailored specifically to meet the needs of the global pension community, including transition management, commission recapture and self directed brokerage. These products are differentiated by our position as an agent of the institutional investor. Brokerage and other trading fees were $251 million in 2006, up 11% compared to 2005. Growth was attributable to a significant increase in other trading services and trading profits, offset by a slight decrease in brokerage revenue, the result of a decline in commission recapture revenue. Securities Finance: Securities finance provides liquidity to the financial markets and an effective means for customers to earn revenue on their existing portfolios. By acting as a lending agent and coordinating loans between lenders and borrowers, we lend securities and provide liquidity in more than 35 markets around the world. Borrowers provide collateral in the form of cash or securities to State Street in return for loaned securities. For cash collateral, we pay a usage fee to the provider of the cash collateral, and invest the cash collateral in certain investment vehicles. The spread between the yield on the investment vehicle and the usage fee 29 paid to the provider of the collateral is split between the lender of the securities and State Street as agent. For non cash collateral, the borrower pays a fee for the loaned securities, and the fee is split between the lender of the securities and State Street. Securities finance revenue has historically been affected by seasonality during the year, and is principally a function of the volume of securities loaned and the interest rate spreads earned on the collateral. During 2006, securities finance revenue peaked in the second quarter, as a result of heavy borrowing demand from customers, declined in the third quarter, and rebounded slightly in the fourth quarter. Overall, securities finance revenue increased 17% from a year earlier. Growth in this revenue over 2005 resulted from a 22% increase in securities lending volumes. Consolidated spread was essentially unchanged from the prior year. Processing Fees and Other: Processing fees and other revenue includes diverse types of fees and other revenue, including fees from our structured products business, fees from software licensing and maintenance, profits and losses from unconsolidated subsidiaries, gains and losses on sales of leased equipment and other assets, and amortization of investments in tax advantaged financings. Processing fees and other revenue decreased 10% from 2005, with the decline partially due to the absence of fees from Deutsche Bank AG related to customer deposits of the acquired Global Securities Services, or GSS, business, which were converted to our systems in prior years. Net Interest Revenue In servicing sophisticated global investors, we provide short term funds management, deposit services and repurchase agreements for cash positions associated with our customers investing activities. NET INTEREST REVENUE Years ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Change 2005 2006 (Dollars in millions) Interest revenue $ 4,324 $ 2,930 $ 1,787 48 % Interest expense 3,214 2,023 928 59 Net interest revenue 1,110 907 859 22 Provision for loan losses (18 ) Net interest revenue after provision for loan losses $ 1,110 $ 907 $ 877 Net interest revenue (fully taxable equivalent basis) $ 1,155 $ 949 $ 904 22 % Excess of rates earned over rates paid (fully taxable equivalent basis) .89 % .82 % .95 % Net interest margin (fully taxable equivalent basis) 1.25 1.08 1.08 Additional detail about the components of interest revenue and interest expense is in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. The increase in net interest revenue for 2006 compared to 2005 was due to several factors. On the asset side, there was an increase in average interest earning assets as well as higher yields on our investment securities portfolio. The higher yields were the result of a higher interest rate environment as well as a repositioning program begun in late 2004 and substantially completed in the second half of 2006. On the liability side, a higher level of customer deposits, primarily resulting from the growth of our non U.S. operations, as well as a more favorable mix of deposits, also contributed to the growth in net interest revenue. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of higher funding costs, as the Federal Reserve raised short term interest rates during the first half of the year. 30 For the year ended December 31, 2006, our average investment securities portfolio increased from approximately $51.2 billion to approximately $61.6 billion. The portfolio included a higher percentage of collateralized mortgage obligations and floating rate, asset backed securities compared to a year earlier, and a lower percentage of U.S. Treasuries and direct obligations of federal agencies. The shift in the portfolio was designed to better position us in a rising short term interest rate environment, without adversely affecting overall risk, as we continued to invest conservatively in AA and AAA rated securities. AA and AAA rated securities comprised approximately 94% of the investment securities portfolio, with approximately 88% AAA rated, at December 31, 2006. Several factors could affect future levels of net interest revenue and margin, including the Federal Reserves ongoing actions to manage short term interest rates, the level and pace of changes in non U.S. rates, particularly by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, the mix of customer liabilities, and the shapes of the various yield curves around the world. Gains (Losses) on Sales of Available for Sale Securities, Net Our management of the investment securities portfolio has many objectives, the foremost of which is to generate maximum return with modest duration and credit risk. In addition, we structure the portfolio to provide liquidity and to serve as a source of collateral for customer activities. These objectives may entail strategic sales of specific securities as market conditions warrant. We recorded net gains of $15 million on sales of available for sale securities for 2006, compared to net losses of $1 million for 2005. At December 31, 2006, approximately 93% of the investment securities portfolio, or $60.45 billion, was classified as available for sale. Additional information about available for sale securities, and the gross gains and losses that comprise the net gains, is in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. Operating Expenses Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Change 2005 2006 (Dollars in millions) Salaries and employee benefits $ 2,652 $ 2,231 $ 1,957 19 % Information systems and communications 501 486 527 3 Transaction processing services 496 449 398 10 Occupancy 373 391 363 (5 ) Other 518 484 514 7 Total operating expenses $ 4,540 $ 4,041 $ 3,759 12 Number of employees at year end 21,700 20,965 19,668 The 19% increase in salaries and employee benefits from 2005 was driven primarily by higher incentive compensation costs due to improved performance, the impact of higher staffing levels and annual merit increases, and planned benefit increases. Staffing levels increased to support growth in our Investment Servicing business, particularly in Europe, and in our Investment Management business, as well as in information technology and risk management. The slight increase in information systems and communications expense primarily resulted from higher telecommunications costs and third party software expenditures to support overseas growth. Transaction processing services expenses are volume related, and include equity trading services and fees related to securities settlement, sub custodian fees and external contract services. The 10% increase primarily resulted from higher transaction volumes, as well as expansion of our operations in Europe. 31 Occupancy expense was down 5% from 2005, primarily due to the absence of the $26 million charge recorded in 2005 related to a long term sub lease agreement for space in our headquarters building, offset by a slight increase in energy and other utility costs. The 7% increase in other expenses from 2005 primarily resulted from increased costs to support growth initiatives, offset by a decline in professional services fees related to information technology and the restructuring of our Global Treasury function, which occurred in 2005. Income Taxes The increase in income tax expense from continuing operations to $675 million for 2006, from $487 million a year ago, resulted from increased pre tax earnings, as well as $81 million of aggregate adjustments recorded during 2006 primarily related to the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act and the potential resolution of issues with the IRS with respect to certain of our leveraged leases. Additional information about these adjustments is in Notes 10 and 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. The effective tax rate for continuing operations for 2006 was 38.1%, compared to 34% for 2005. The 2006 income tax expense from discontinued operations of $6 million was related to $16 million of income associated with the finalization of certain costs recorded in connection with our divestiture of Bel Air, which was completed during 2006. The 2005 income tax benefit from discontinued operations of $58 million was related to the loss of $165 million recorded in connection with our agreement to divest Bel Air in 2005. Information about income tax contingencies related to our leveraged lease portfolio is in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. LINE OF BUSINESS INFORMATION We report two lines of business: Investment Servicing and Investment Management. Given our services and management organization, the results of operations for these lines of business are not necessarily comparable with those of other companies, including companies in the financial services industry. Information about revenue, expense and capital allocation methodologies is in Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. 32 The following is a summary of line of business results. These results exclude the income (loss) from discontinued operations related to our previously discussed divestiture of Bel Air. The Other/One Time column for 2005 includes the additional gain from our sale of the Private Asset Management business, and for 2004, includes merger and integration costs related to the GSS acquisition.

Servicing fees were up from 2005 due to net new business from existing and new customers, higher equity valuations and higher customer transaction volumes. The increase in trading services revenue reflected a higher dollar volume of foreign exchange trades for customers and a higher volume of fixed income transition management business. Processing fees and other revenue declined from 2005, partly as a result of a decline in fees from Deutsche Bank AG as GSS customer deposits were converted to our systems. Servicing and trading services fees and gains (losses) on sales of available for sale securities for our Investment Servicing business line are identical to the respective consolidated results. Refer to the Servicing Fees, Trading Services and Gains (Losses) on Sales of Available For Sale Securities, Net captions in the Total Revenue section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis for a more in depth discussion. A discussion of processing fees and other revenue is provided under the caption Processing Fees and Other in the Total Revenue section. Net interest revenue for 2006 increased 19% from 2005 due to an increase in average interest earning assets, as well as higher yields on our investment securities portfolio. The higher yields were the result of a repositioning program begun in late 2004 and substantially completed in the second half of 2006, which is further discussed under the caption Net Interest Revenue in the Total Revenue section of this 33 Managements Discussion and Analysis. In 2004, we reduced the allowance for loan losses through a reduction of the loan loss provision as a result of reduced credit exposures and overall improved credit quality. A portion of net interest revenue is recorded in the Investment Management business line based on the volume of customer liabilities attributable to that business. Operating expenses increased from 2005, driven primarily by higher incentive compensation costs due to improved performance, the impact of higher staffing levels and annual merit increases, and planned benefit increases. Staffing levels increased to support growth in business, particularly in Europe. Transaction processing costs increased due to a higher volume of securities settlements and higher sub custodian fees. Other expenses increased as a result of an increase in costs to support growth initiatives, offset by lower professional services fees partly related to the restructuring of Global Treasury. Investment Management Total revenue for 2006 increased 25% from 2005. Management fees for the Investment Management business line, which were up 26%, are identical to the respective consolidated results. Refer to the Management Fees caption in the Total Revenue section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis for a more in depth discussion. Performance fees increased from $41 million for 2005 to $84 million for 2006, and accounted for almost one quarter of the increase in management fees. Securities finance revenue for 2006 was up 34% from 2005, reflecting higher securities lending volumes. Net interest revenue improved due to higher volumes of customer liabilities, primarily resulting from the growth of our non U.S. operations, as well as a more favorable mix of deposits. Operating expenses increased 18% from 2005, primarily attributable to higher incentive compensation costs due to improved performance. COMPARISON OF 2005 AND 2004 OVERVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Years ended December 31, 2005 2004 $ Change % Change (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Total fee revenue $ 4,551 $ 4,048 $ 503 12 % Net interest revenue 907 859 48 6 Provision for loan losses (18 ) 18 100 Gains (Losses) on sales of available for sale investment securities, net (1 ) 26 (27 ) (104 ) Gain on sale of divested business 16 16 Total revenue 5,473 4,951 522 11 Total operating expenses 4,041 3,759 282 8 Income from continuing operations before income tax expense 1,432 1,192 240 20 Income tax expense from continuing operations 487 394 93 24 Income from continuing operations 945 798 147 18 Net loss from discontinued operations (107 ) (107 ) Net income $ 838 $ 798 40 5 Earnings Per Share From Continuing Operations: Basic $ 2.86 $ 2.38 $ .48 20 Diluted 2.82 2.35 .47 20 Earnings Per Share: Basic $ 2.53 $ 2.38 Diluted 2.50 2.35 Return on shareholders equity 15.3 % 13.3 % 34 The net loss from discontinued operations in 2005 of $107 million, or $.32 per share, resulted from our divestiture of Bel Air. The 2004 results included $62 million of merger and integration costs, $41 million after tax or $.12 per share, related to the GSS acquisition. TOTAL REVENUE Years ended December 31, 2005 2004 $ Change % Change (Dollars in millions) Fee Revenue: Servicing fees $ 2,474 $ 2,263 $ 211 9 % Management fees 751 623 128 21 Trading services 694 595 99 17 Securities finance 330 259 71 27 Processing fees and other 302 308 (6 ) (2 ) Total fee revenue 4,551 4,048 503 12 Net Interest Revenue: Interest revenue 2,930 1,787 1,143 64 Interest expense 2,023 928 1,095 118 Net interest revenue 907 859 48 6 Provision for loan losses (18 ) (18 ) Net interest revenue after provision for loan losses 907 877 30 3 Gains (Losses) on sales of available for sale investment securities, net (1 ) 26 (27 ) (104 ) Gain on sale of Private Asset Management business 16 16 Total revenue $ 5,473 $ 4,951 $ 522 11 The increase in total revenue for 2005 compared to 2004 primarily reflected growth in fee revenue, but also reflected higher net interest revenue and a $16 million gain from final settlement of the sale of our Private Asset Management business. Fee revenue in 2005 primarily reflected growth in servicing, management, trading services and securities finance fees. The increase in servicing fees was the result of new business from existing and new customers, and higher equity market valuations. Our business continued to grow outside the U.S., with approximately 40% of our servicing fees derived from non U.S. customers, up from 34% in 2004. Assets under custody increased to $10.12 trillion at December 31, 2005, up $624 billion from $9.50 trillion a year earlier. The increase in management fees reflected continued new business and higher average month end equity market valuations. Approximately 30% of management fees were from customers outside the U.S. in 2005 and 2004. Assets under management increased to $1.44 trillion at December 31, 2005, up $87 billion from $1.35 trillion a year earlier. The growth in trading services revenue, which includes foreign exchange trading, brokerage and other trading revenue, reflected an increase in brokerage and other trading fees of $51 million, primarily due to increased global transition management business, as well as an increase in equity trading revenue in the U.S. Trading services revenue also benefited from a $48 million increase in foreign exchange trading revenue. Customer spot and forward trading volumes were strong in 2005, both in the volume and value of transactions, up 32% from 2004. The impact of volume increases was somewhat offset by lower currency volatility, as measured by our index of 26 currencies, down 12% from 2004. 35 Securities finance revenue reflected the effect of improved interest rate spreads and a 9% increase in securities lending volumes. The decline in processing fees and other revenue reflected a decrease of $30 million in payments made by Deutsche Bank AG in consideration of net interest revenue earned from GSS customer deposits, largely offset by an increase in revenue from our structured products business. The deposits were held by Deutsche Bank until customers and their related deposits were converted to our systems. The net loss on sales of available for sale securities of $1 million in 2005 compared to a gain of $26 million in 2004. The increase in net interest revenue reflected an increase in the size of our average balance sheet and the impact of repositioning and increasing the average size of our investment securities portfolio. Net interest revenue for 2004 reflected a $19 million cumulative reduction in interest revenue, which resulted from a change in the applicable state tax rate for leveraged lease transactions. We reduced the allowance for loan losses in 2004 by recording an $18 million benefit in the related income statement provision in response to reduced credit exposure and improved credit quality. OPERATING EXPENSES Years ended December 31, 2005 2004 $ Change % Change (Dollars in millions) Operating Expenses: Salaries and employee benefits $ 2,231 $ 1,957 $ 274 14 % Information systems and communications 486 527 (41 ) (8 ) Transaction processing services 449 398 51 13 Occupancy 391 363 28 8 Other 484 514 (30 ) (6 ) Total operating expenses $ 4,041 $ 3,759 $ 282 8 The increase in operating expenses from 2004 reflected higher expenses for salaries and employee benefits, transaction processing, occupancy and other expenses, somewhat offset by a decline in information systems and communications expense and the absence of merger, integration, divestiture and restructuring costs. The increase in salaries and employee benefits was driven by higher staffing levels and higher compensation costs related to improved earnings, higher averages salaries due to merit increases and higher costs of employee benefits. Information systems and communications expense decreased because of efficiencies gained as GSS customers were converted to our operation platforms, somewhat offset by costs for new outsourcing customers and costs of the new data center. Transaction processing services expenses, which in large part are volume related, include equity trading services and fees related to securities settlement, sub custodian fees and external contract services. The increase resulted from a higher volume of investment activity combined with higher net asset values that impact sub custodian fees. Occupancy expense for 2005 reflected a $26 million pre tax charge related to a long term sub lease agreement with an unrelated third party for space in our headquarters building. Occupancy expense for 2004 reflected a loss of $16 million from a sub lease agreement at our former headquarters building. Aside from these charges, the increases year over year reflected increased occupancy costs in Europe to accommodate new investment manager operations outsourcing customers. 36 The decline in other operating expenses was primarily due to the absence of merger and integration costs of $62 million recorded in 2004 related to the conversion of customers gained in the GSS acquisition to our systems, and the absence of 2004 restructuring costs of $21 million related to severance and benefit costs associated with a 425 position workforce reduction. Income Taxes The increase in income tax expense from continuing operations resulted from increased pre tax earnings. The effective tax rate for continuing operations for 2005 was 34%. Our effective rate for 2004 was 33.1%, including the impact of a cumulative benefit of $18 million resulting from a change in the effective state tax rate applied to leveraged lease transactions. Excluding this item, the effective rate for 2004 was 34%. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. The majority of these accounting policies do not involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates in their application, or the variability of the estimates is not material to the consolidated financial statements. However, certain of these accounting policies, by their nature, require management to make judgments, involving significant estimates and assumptions, about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements, and changes in this information over time could materially impact amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported in subsequent financial statements. Based on the sensitivity of reported financial statement amounts to the underlying policies, estimates and assumptions, the relatively more significant accounting policies applied by State Street have been identified by management as accounting for lease financing; accounting for goodwill; accounting for income taxes; and accounting for pension costs. These policies require the most subjective or complex judgments, and related estimates and assumptions could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. An understanding of the judgments, estimates and assumptions underlying these accounting policies is essential in order to understand our reported consolidated financial condition and results of operations. The following is a brief discussion of the above mentioned significant accounting policies. Management of State Street has discussed these significant accounting estimates with the Examining and Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, or Board. Lease Financing We have a leveraged lease portfolio consisting of U.S. and cross border financings, primarily for transportation equipment, including trains, aircraft and ships. Lease financing investments are reported at the aggregate of lease payments receivable and estimated residual values, net of non recourse debt and unearned income. Unearned income is recognized in interest revenue to yield a level rate of return on the net investment in the leases. Measuring the net investment and interest revenue related to lease financing requires the use of several assumptions regarding estimates of residual values, the amount and timing of cash flows, and the impact of income tax regulations and income tax rates relating to the leases. Due to the complexity and long term nature of many of these leases, these assumptions are reviewed regularly for adjustments that may be required, including the recognition of other than temporary impairment of residual values. 37 Changes in these assumptions in future periods could affect asset balances and related interest revenue, as well as the amount of income tax expense. Certain of these assumptions could be affected by changes in tax positions established with respect to the amount and timing of tax deductions taken with respect to certain lease transactions, which could be impacted by the enactment of tax legislation or changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws by U.S. and non U.S. tax authorities. As we discussed in the Income Taxes section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis, we recorded additional income tax expense of $81 million during 2006, as a result of the impact of the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act and changes in tax positions that we established with respect to certain of our leveraged lease transactions. Additional information about lease financing balances is in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. Goodwill Goodwill arises when the purchase price exceeds the assigned value of net assets of acquired businesses, and represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements being acquired. Almost all of our goodwill resulted from business acquisitions of our Investment Servicing line of business. Approximately 99% of the total goodwill recorded in our consolidated statement of condition was recorded by this business line, and the remaining 1% was recorded by Investment Management. The sustained value of the majority of this goodwill is supported ultimately by revenue from our investment servicing business. A decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth, or our inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods, could lead to a perceived impairment of goodwill, which would be evaluated and, if necessary, be recorded as a write down of the reported amount of goodwill through a charge to earnings in our consolidated statement of income. On an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances dictate, management reviews goodwill and evaluates events or other developments that may indicate impairment in the carrying amount. We perform this evaluation at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our two major business lines. The evaluation methodology for potential impairment is inherently complex and involves significant management judgment in the use of estimates and assumptions. We evaluate impairment using a two step process. First, we compare the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, no impairment exists. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, then we compare the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, then goodwill impairment is recognized by writing the goodwill down to the implied fair value. The implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, as if the unit had been acquired in a business combination and the overall fair value of the unit was the purchase price. To determine the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit being evaluated for goodwill impairment, we use one of two principal methodologies external or independent valuation, using quoted market prices in active markets; or an analysis of comparable recent external sales or market data, such as multiples of earnings or similar performance measures. In limited circumstances, these methodologies are not available, and as such, we estimate future cash flows using present value techniques. Events that may indicate goodwill impairment include significant or adverse changes in the business, economic or political climate; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; unanticipated competition; and a more likely than not expectation that we will sell or otherwise dispose of a business to which the goodwill relates. Our goodwill impairment testing for 2006 indicated that none of our goodwill was impaired. Goodwill recorded in our consolidated statement of condition at December 31, 2006 totaled approximately $1.4 billion. 38 Additional information about goodwill is in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes Our overall tax position is fundamentally complex, and management judgment is involved in the analysis of income tax assets and liabilities. We are subject to the income tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which State Street operates. These tax laws can be subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the taxing authorities. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be adjudicated by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or administrative appeal. Managements determination of the likelihood that deferred tax assets can be realized is subjective and involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. The realization of deferred tax assets arises from carrybacks to prior taxable periods, future taxable income, including foreign source income, and the achievement of tax planning strategies. Underlying estimates and assumptions can change over time, influencing our overall tax positions, as a result of unanticipated events or circumstances. Management continually monitors and evaluates the worldwide impact of tax legislation, decisions, rulings and other current developments on the estimates and assumptions underlying our calculations of current and deferred taxes and our analysis of the expected realization of deferred tax assets. Additional information about income taxes is in Notes 10 and 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Costs We maintain a tax qualified non contributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all domestic employees, as well as certain non U.S. defined benefit plans. Measuring cost and reporting liabilities resulting from defined benefit pension plans requires the use of many assumptions, including estimates of future interest rates, asset returns, compensation increases and other actuarial based projections relating to the plans. Pension related estimates have a significant impact on the determination of pension obligations and related expense. We use December 31 as a measurement date for our pension asset and projected benefit obligation balances. Each year, we review actual demographic and investment experience with the plans actuaries. In addition to actual experience, adjustments to assumptions consider published interest rate indices, known compensation trends and policies and economic conditions that may affect the estimated long term rate of return on plan assets. The significant assumptions used to measure periodic benefit cost and pension obligations are described below. Size and Characteristics of the Employee Population Periodic benefit cost is directly related to the number of employees covered by the plans and other factors, including salary, age and years of employment. Actuarial Assumptions Actuarial assumptions used to estimate benefit obligations consider factors such as mortality rate, turnover rate, retirement rate, disability rate and the rate of compensation increases. These factors tend to 39 change gradually over time. The aggregate impact of assumptions is reviewed each year and specific assumptions are reviewed periodically. Expected Long Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets We calculate the expected return on plan assets each year based on the composition of assets at the beginning of the plan year and the expected long term rate of return on that portfolio. The expected long term rate of return is designed to approximate the actual long term rate of return on plan assets over time and is not expected to change significantly. To determine if the expected rate of return is reasonable, we consider such factors as (1) the actual return earned on plan assets, (2) historical rates of return on the various asset classes in the plan portfolio, (3) projections of returns on various asset classes, and (4) current/prospective capital market conditions and economic forecasts. If we were to assume a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets for all defined benefit pension plans and keep all other assumptions constant, benefit cost would increase or decrease by approximately $2 million. Discount Rate We use the discount rate to determine the present value of our future benefit obligations. It reflects the rates available on long term, high quality fixed income debt instruments, reset annually on the measurement date. If we were to assume a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate for all defined benefit pension plans and keep all other assumptions constant, benefit cost would increase or decrease by approximately $5 million, and the projected benefit obligation would increase or decrease by approximately $37 million. Additional information about our pension plans and related benefit costs is in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. 40 FINANCIAL CONDITION Years ended December 31, 2006 Average Balance 2005 Average Balance (In millions) Assets: Interest bearing deposits with banks $ 9,621 $ 17,260 Securities purchased under resale agreements 12,543 12,579 Federal funds sold 277 311 Trading account assets 975 470 Investment securities 61,579 51,153 Loans 7,670 6,013 Total interest earning assets 92,665 87,786 Cash and due from banks 2,977 2,598 Other assets 10,802 9,385 Total assets $ 106,444 $ 99,769 Liabilities and Shareholders Equity: Interest bearing deposits: U.S. $ 2,453 $ 2,992 Non U.S. 53,182 46,711 Total interest bearing deposits 55,635 49,703 Securities sold under repurchase agreements 20,883 22,432 Federal funds purchased 2,777 2,306 Other short term borrowings 2,039 1,970 Long term debt 2,621 2,461 Total interest bearing liabilities 83,955 78,872 Noninterest bearing deposits 8,274 8,293 Other liabilities 7,471 6,426 Shareholders equity 6,744 6,178 Total liabilities and shareholders equity $ 106,444 $ 99,769 Overview of Consolidated Statement of Condition The structure of our consolidated statement of condition, or balance sheet, is primarily driven by the liabilities generated by our core Investment Servicing and Investment Management businesses. As our customers execute their worldwide cash management and investment activities, they use short term investments and deposits that constitute the majority of our liabilities. These liabilities are generally in the form of non interest bearing demand deposits; interest bearing transaction account deposits, which are denominated in a variety of currencies; and repurchase agreements, which generally serve as short term investment alternatives for our customers. Our customers needs and our operating objectives determine the volume, mix and currency denomination of our consolidated balance sheet. Deposits and other liabilities generated by customer activities are invested in assets that generally match the liquidity and interest rate characteristics of the liabilities. As a result, our assets consist primarily of high quality, marketable securities held in our available for sale or held to maturity investment securities portfolio and short term money market instruments, such as inter bank placements, federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements. The actual mix of assets is determined by the characteristics of the customer liabilities and our desire to maintain a well diversified portfolio of high quality assets. Managing our consolidated balance sheet structure is a disciplined process conducted within specific Board approved policies for interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity. 41 For 2006, the growth in average interest bearing liabilities of $5.1 billion was composed of a $6.5 billion increase in foreign deposits offset by a decline in repurchase agreements of $1.5 billion. These changes are representative of the higher levels of customer activity outside the U.S. Average interest earning assets in 2006 increased $4.9 billion from 2005, consistent with the increased level of customer liabilities. During 2006, we substantially completed the investment portfolio restructuring begun in late 2004. The average investment portfolio increased $10.4 billion, offset in part by a decline in average interest bearing deposits with banks of $7.6 billion. The composition of the investment portfolio continued to favor mortgage and asset backed securities because of their high credit quality, higher yields and highly liquid nature. The credit quality of the investment portfolio remained very strong at year end 2006, with 88% of the securities rated AAA and 6% rated AA. Investment Securities We consider a well diversified, high credit quality investment securities portfolio to be an important element in the management of our consolidated balance sheet. The portfolio continues to be concentrated in marketable securities with high credit quality, with approximately 94% of the carrying value of the portfolio AAA or AA rated. The percentages of the carrying value of the investment securities portfolio by credit rating were as follows as of December 31: 2006 2005 AAA(1) 88 % 90 % AA 6 5 A 4 3 BBB 1 1 Non rated 1 1 100 % 100 % (1) Includes U.S. Treasury securities The investment securities portfolio is also diversified with respect to asset class. The bulk of the portfolio is in high grade mortgage backed and asset backed securities. The largely floating rate asset backed portfolio consists of home equity loan, credit card, auto and student loan securities. Mortgage backed securities are split between securities of Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and large issuer collateralized mortgage obligations. 42 The carrying values of investment securities were as follows as of December 31: (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 Available for Sale: U.S. Treasury and federal agencies: Direct obligations $ 7,612 $ 10,214 $ 12,119 Mortgage backed securities 11,454 11,138 9,147 Asset backed securities 25,634 23,842 10,056 State and political subdivisions 3,749 1,868 1,785 Collateralized mortgage obligations 8,476 5,527 1,719 Other debt investments 3,027 1,695 922 Money market mutual funds 201 232 97 Other equity securities 292 463 326 Total $ 60,445 $ 54,979 $ 36,171 Held to Maturity: U.S. Treasury and federal agencies: Direct obligations $ 846 $ 1,657 $ 1,294 Mortgage backed securities 1,084 925 Collateralized mortgage obligations 2,357 2,086 Other investments 260 223 106 Total $ 4,547 $ 4,891 $ 1,400 We had $378 million of net pre tax unrealized losses on available for sale investment securities at December 31, 2006, or $227 million after tax. Net pre tax unrealized losses on available for sale securities at December 31, 2005 were $475 million, or $285 million after tax. Management considers the aggregate decline in fair value and the resulting net unrealized losses to be temporary and primarily the result of increases in interest rates, not the result of any material changes in the credit characteristics of the investment securities portfolio. Management has the ability and the intent to hold the securities until recovery in market value. We generally configure our investment securities portfolio so that any change in its fair value is largely, but not totally, offset by changes in the economic value of our customer liabilities; however, existing accounting standards do not allow for the change in economic value of our customer liabilities to offset unrealized losses on available for sale securities. We intend to continue managing our investment securities portfolio to align with interest rate and duration characteristics of our customer liabilities and in the context of our overall balance sheet structure, which is maintained within internally approved risk limits, and in consideration of the global interest rate environment. Even with material changes in unrealized losses on available for sale securities, we may not experience material changes in our interest rate risk profile, or experience a material impact on our net interest revenue. Additional information about these and other unrealized losses is in Notes 3 and 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. The increase in state and political subdivisions in the available for sale category compared to 2005 resulted from the consolidation onto our balance sheet of certain trusts utilized in connection with our tax exempt investment programs. This consolidation is more fully discussed in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. The increase in collateralized mortgage obligations resulted from our previously discussed investment securities repositioning program. 43 The carrying amounts, by contractual maturity, of debt securities available for sale and held to maturity, and the related weighted average contractual yields, were as follows as of December 31, 2006: Under 1 Year 1 to 5 Years 6 to 10 Years Over 10 Years (Dollars in millions) Amount Yield Amount Yield Amount Yield Amount Yield Available for Sale: U.S. Treasury and federal agencies: Direct obligations $ 4,684 3.78 % $ 2,440 4.15 % $ 488 4.31 % Mortgage backed securities 160 3.61 951 4.21 4,982 4.70 $ 5,361 5.12 % Asset backed securities 1,324 4.83 10,239 5.39 8,967 5.55 5,104 5.42 State and political subdivisions(1) 500 6.85 1,828 7.43 1,077 6.78 344 7.78 Collateralized mortgage obligations 142 5.05 1,892 4.89 3,231 5.48 3,211 5.55 Other investments 996 6.41 1,285 5.41 731 5.44 15 5.25 Total $ 7,806 $ 18,635 $ 19,476 $ 14,035 Held to Maturity: U.S. Treasury and federal agencies: Direct obligations $ 95 3.61 % $ 751 4.23 % Mortgage backed securities 22 3.75 $ 320 4.85 % $ 742 5.29 % Collateralized mortgage obligations 712 4.96 1,052 5.02 593 5.01 Other investments 76 2.70 96 6.11 85 6.50 3 8.24 Total $ 171 $ 1,581 $ 1,457 $ 1,338 (1) Yields have been calculated on a fully taxable equivalent basis, using applicable federal and state income tax rates. The maturities of mortgage backed securities, asset backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are based upon expected principal payments. 44 Loans and Lease Financing U.S. and non U.S. loans and lease financing as of December 31, and average loans outstanding were as follows for the years ended December 31: (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 U.S.: Commercial and financial $ 3,480 $ 2,298 $ 1,826 $ 2,344 $ 1,578 Lease financing 415 404 373 395 403 Total U.S. 3,895 2,702 2,199 2,739 1,981 Non U.S.: Commercial and industrial 3,137 1,854 526 424 289 Lease financing 1,914 1,926 1,904 1,858 1,719 Banks and other financial institutions 177 Other 8 Total non U.S. 5,051 3,780 2,430 2,282 2,193 Total loans $ 8,946 $ 6,482 $ 4,629 $ 5,021 $ 4,174 Average loans and lease financing outstanding $ 7,670 $ 6,013 $ 5,689 $ 5,568 $ 5,105 At December 31, 2006, approximately 8% of our assets consisted of loans and lease financing. The aggregate increase in loans from 2005 reflected an increase in daily overdrafts, which result primarily from securities settlement advances related to customer investment activities. Overdrafts included in loans were $5.69 billion and $3.41 billion at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively. Average overdrafts were approximately $5.21 billion and $3.24 billion for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These balances do not represent significant credit risk because of their short term nature, which is generally overnight, the lack of significant concentration and their occurrence in the normal course of the securities settlement process. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, unearned income included in lease financing was $1.01 billion and $1.07 billion for non U.S. leases, respectively, and $129 million and $125 million for U.S. leases, respectively. Information about our allowance for loan losses is included in the Risk Management Credit Risk section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. Maturities for selected loan and lease financing categories were as follows as of December 31, 2006: YEARS (In millions) Total Under 1 1 to 5 Over 5 U.S.: Commercial and financial $ 3,480 $ 3,453 $ 24 $ 3 Lease financing 415 17 398 Total U.S. 3,895 3,453 41 401 Non U.S.: Commercial and industrial 3,137 3,136 1 Lease financing 1,914 17 1,897 Total non U.S. 5,051 3,136 18 1,897 Total $ 8,946 $ 6,589 $ 59 $ 2,298 45 The following table presents the classification of loans and leases due after one year according to sensitivity to changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2006: (In millions) Loans and leases with predetermined interest rates $ 2,330 Loans and leases with floating or adjustable interest rates 27 Total $ 2,357 Cross Border Outstandings Cross border outstandings, as defined by bank regulatory rules, are amounts payable to State Street by residents of foreign countries, regardless of the currency in which the claim is denominated, and local country claims in excess of local country obligations. These outstandings consist primarily of deposits with banks, loans and lease financing and investment securities. In addition to credit risk, cross border outstandings have the risk that, as a result of political or economic conditions in a country, borrowers may be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations of principal and or interest when due because of the unavailability of, or restrictions on, foreign exchange needed by borrowers to repay their obligations. We manage our cross border outstandings using internally approved exposure limits. Cross border outstandings to countries in which we do business which amounted to at least 1% of our consolidated total assets were as follows as of December 31: (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 United Kingdom $ 5,531 $ 2,696 $ 2,355 Germany 2,696 4,217 3,971 Canada 1,463 1,383 Australia 1,519 1,441 1,760 Netherlands 992 Japan 941 Total outstanding $ 9,746 $ 10,809 $ 10,410 The total cross border outstandings presented in the table represented 9%, 11% and 11% of our consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Aggregate cross border outstandings to countries which totaled between .75% and 1% of our consolidated total assets at December 31, 2006 was $1.05 billion (Canada); at December 31, 2005, $1.86 billion (Belgium and Japan); and at December 31, 2004, $2.47 billion (Netherlands, France and Sweden). Capital Regulatory and economic capital management both use key metrics evaluated by management to ensure that our actual level of capital is commensurate with our risk profile, is in compliance with all regulatory requirements, and is sufficient to provide us with the financial flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives. Regulatory Capital Our objective with respect to regulatory capital management is to maintain a strong capital base in order to provide financial flexibility for our business needs, including funding corporate growth and supporting customers cash management needs, and to provide protection against loss to depositors and creditors. We strive to maintain an optimal level of capital, commensurate with our risk profile, on which 46 an attractive return to shareholders will be realized over both the short and long term, while protecting our obligations to depositors and creditors and satisfying regulatory requirements. The Capital Committee, working in conjunction with the Asset and Liability Committee, or ALCO, oversees the management of regulatory capital, and is responsible for ensuring capital adequacy with respect to regulatory requirements, internal targets and the expectations of credit rating agencies. Our capital management process focuses on our risk exposures, our capital position relative to our peers, regulatory capital requirements and the evaluations of the major independent credit rating agencies that assign ratings to our public debt. The primary regulator of both State Street and State Street Bank for capital purposes is the Federal Reserve Board. Both State Street and the Bank are subject to the minimum capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve Board and defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, or FDICIA. The Bank must meet the regulatory capital thresholds for well capitalized in order for State Street to maintain its status as a financial holding company. Regulatory capital ratios and related regulatory guidelines for State Street and State Street Bank were as follows as of December 31: REGULATORY GUIDELINES STATE STREET STATE STREET BANK Minimum Well Capitalized 2006 2005 2006 2005 Regulatory Capital Ratios: Tier 1 capital 4 % 6 % 13.7 % 11.7 % 12.0 % 10.3 % Total capital 8 10 15.9 14.0 14.1 12.5 Tier 1 leverage ratio(1) 4 5 5.8 5.6 5.6 5.4 (1) Regulatory guideline for well capitalized applies only to State Street Bank. At December 31, 2006, State Streets and State Street Banks tier 1 and total risk based capital ratios increased compared to year end 2005, the result of growth in capital, primarily from earnings. Total risk weighted assets were flat year over year, as growth in balance sheet risk weighted assets, primarily investment securities available for sale and loans, was offset by a decrease in off balance sheet equivalent risk weighted assets. The decrease resulted primarily from allowable changes in the calculation of exposure related to our securities finance activities. Both ratios for State Street and State Street Bank exceeded the regulatory minimum and well capitalized thresholds. To manage fluctuations in the tier 1 and total risk based capital of State Street and State Street Bank resulting from foreign currency translation, we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of our net foreign investment in non U.S. subsidiaries. The notional value of these contracts was 100 million, or approximately $132 million, at December 31, 2006. In June 2004, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision released the final version of its capital adequacy framework, known as Basel II. In 2006, the four U.S. banking regulatory agencies jointly issued their second draft of implementation rules, and are seeking industry comment by the end of March 2007. Additional supervisory guidance is expected to be available by the end of March 2007, and the release of the final implementation rules is expected prior to the end of 2007. Under the current implementation plan, State Street, along with other large internationally active U.S. institutions, will be required to be fully implemented under the U.S. rules during 2010. State Street previously established a comprehensive implementation program to ensure these regulatory requirements are met within prescribed timeframes. At this time, we cannot predict the final form of the rules in the U.S., nor their impact on State Streets or State Street Banks risk based capital. 47 We have increased our quarterly dividend twice each year since 1978. Over the last ten years, dividends per share have grown at a 15% compound annual growth rate. Funds for cash distributions to our shareholders by the parent company are derived from a variety of sources. The level of dividends to shareholders on our common stock, which totaled $265 million in 2006, is reviewed regularly and determined by the Board considering our liquidity, capital adequacy and recent earnings history and prospects, as well as economic conditions and other factors deemed relevant. Federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid by subsidiary banks to the parent holding company. In addition, bank regulators have the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends if they deem such payment to be an unsafe or unsound practice. At December 31, 2006, the parent company had $10.13 billion of liquid assets with which to meet dividend declaration and other payment obligations. Information concerning dividends from our subsidiary banks is in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. During the first quarter of 2006, we purchased 3 million shares of our common stock under a program authorized by our Board in 2005. On March 16, 2006, the Board authorized a new program for the purchase of up to 15 million shares of our common stock for general corporate purposes, including mitigating the dilutive impact of shares issued under employee benefit programs, and terminated the 2005 program. Under this new program, we purchased 2.8 million shares of our common stock during 2006, and as of December 31, 2006, 12.2 million shares were available for purchase. We utilize third party broker dealers to acquire common shares on the open market in our execution of the stock purchase program. Additional information about share purchases is in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. Economic Capital We define economic capital as the common equity required to protect debt holders against unexpected economic losses over a one year period at a level consistent with the solvency of a firm with our target AA debt rating. Our entire economic capital process is the responsibility of our Capital Committee. The framework and methodologies used to quantify economic capital for each of the risk types described below have been developed by our Enterprise Risk Management, Global Treasury and Finance groups, and are designed to be generally consistent with our risk management principles. This framework has been approved by senior management and has been reviewed by the Executive Committee of the Board. Due to the evolving nature of quantification techniques, we expect to periodically refine the methodologies used to estimate our economic capital requirements, which could result in a different amount of capital needed to support our risk profile. We quantify capital requirements for the risks inherent in our business activities and group them into one of the following broadly defined categories: Market risk: the risk of adverse financial impact due to fluctuations in market prices, primarily as they relate to our trading activities Interest rate risk: the risk of loss in non trading asset and liability management positions, primarily the impact of adverse movements in interest rates on the repricing mismatches that exist between balance sheet assets and liabilities Credit risk: the risk of loss that may result from the default or downgrade of a borrower or counterparty Operational risk: the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events 48 Business risk: the risk of adverse changes in our earnings from business factors, including changes in the competitive environment, changes in the operational economics of business activities, and the effect of strategic and reputation risks Economic capital for each of these five categories is estimated on a stand alone basis using statistical modeling techniques applied to internally generated and, in some cases, external data. These individual results are then aggregated at the State Street consolidated level. A capital reduction or diversification benefit is then applied to reflect the unlikely event of experiencing an extremely large loss in each risk type at the same time. Liquidity The objective of liquidity management is to ensure that we have the ability to meet our financial obligations in a timely and cost effective manner, and that we maintain sufficient flexibility to fund strategic corporate initiatives as they arise. Effective management of liquidity involves assessing the potential mismatch between the future cash needs of our customers and our available sources of cash under normal and adverse economic and business conditions. Uses of liquidity consist primarily of meeting deposit withdrawals and funding outstanding commitments to extend credit as they are drawn upon. Liquidity is provided by the maintenance of broad access to the global capital markets and our balance sheet asset structure, as described below. Global Treasury is responsible for the day to day management of our global liquidity position, which is conducted within risk guidelines established and monitored by ALCO. Management maintains a liquidity measurement framework, including a contingency funding plan designed to manage through a potential liquidity crisis. The plan defines roles, responsibilities, and management actions to be undertaken in the event of deterioration in our liquidity profile caused by either a State Street specific event or a broader disruption in the capital markets. The plan outlines several levels of potential risk to our liquidity and identifies several triggers that we use as early warning signals of a possible difficulty. These triggers are a combination of internal and external measures of increases in potential cash needs or decreases in available cash sources and possible impairment of our ability to access the global capital markets. We generally manage our liquidity risk on a global basis at the consolidated level, but we also manage parent company liquidity separately. State Street Bank generally has broader access to funding products and markets limited to banks, specifically the federal funds market and the Federal Reserves discount window. The parent company is managed to a more conservative liquidity profile, reflecting narrower market access. We typically hold enough cash, primarily in the form of interest bearing deposits with subsidiary banks, to meet current debt maturities and cash needs and those projected over the next one year period. Material risks to the sources of short term liquidity would include, among other things, rating agency downgrades of our deposits and debt securities below investment grade level, which would restrict our ability to access the funding markets and may lead to withdrawals of unsecured deposits by our customers. In addition, a large volume of unanticipated funding requirements, such as fundings under liquidity asset purchase agreements that have met draw conditions, or large draw downs of existing lines of credit, could require additional liquidity. As of December 31, 2006, there were no circumstances that management considered reasonably likely to occur that would adversely impact our sources of short term liquidity. While maintenance of our high investment grade credit rating is of primary importance to our liquidity management program, on balance sheet liquid assets represent significant liquidity that we can directly control and provide a source of cash in the form of principal maturities and the ability to borrow from the capital markets using our securities as collateral. Our liquid assets consist primarily of short term money market assets, such as federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits with banks, the latter of which are multicurrency instruments invested with major multinational banks; and high quality, 49 marketable investment securities not already pledged, which generally are more liquid than other types of assets and can be sold or borrowed against to quickly generate cash. As of December 31, 2006, our liquid assets, as defined, totaled $42 billion. Securities carried at $23.28 billion as of December 31, 2006 were designated as pledged for public and trust deposits, borrowed funds and for other purposes as provided by law, and are excluded from the liquid assets calculation. Based upon our level of liquid assets and our ability to access the capital markets for additional funding when necessary, management considers overall liquidity at December 31, 2006 more than sufficient to meet State Streets current commitments and business needs, including accommodating the transaction and cash management needs of its customers. Our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the maintenance of high investment grade ratings on our debt, as measured by the major independent credit rating agencies. Factors essential to retaining high credit ratings include diverse and stable core earnings; strong risk management; strong capital ratios; diverse liquidity sources, including the global funds markets and customer deposits; and strong liquidity monitoring procedures. High ratings on debt minimize borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by ensuring the largest possible market for our debt. A downgrade or reduction in credit ratings could have an adverse impact to our ability to access funding at favorable interest rates. There were no changes to our ratings in 2006.

The obligations presented in the table are recorded in our consolidated statement of condition at December 31, 2006. The table does not include obligations which will be settled in cash, primarily in less than one year, such as deposits, federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements and 50 other short term borrowings. Additional information about deposits, federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements and other short term borrowings is in Notes 7 and 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. The table does not include obligations related to derivative contracts, because the amounts included in our consolidated statement of condition at December 31, 2006 related to derivative contracts do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid under the contracts. Additional information about derivative contracts is in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. We have obligations under pension and other postretirement benefit plans, which are more fully described in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are not included in the above table. Additional information about contractual cash obligations related to long term debt and operating and capital leases is in Notes 9 and 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Risk Management The global scope of our business activities requires that we balance what we perceive to be the primary risks in our businesses with a comprehensive and well integrated risk management function. The measurement, monitoring and mitigation of risks are essential to the financial performance and successful management of State Streets businesses. These risks, if not effectively managed, can result in current losses to State Street as well as erosion of our capital and damage to our reputation. Our systematic approach also allows for a more precise assessment of risks within a framework for evaluating opportunities for the prudent use of capital. We have a disciplined approach to risk management that involves all levels of management. The Board provides extensive review and oversight of State Streets overall risk management programs, including the approval of key risk management policies and the periodic review of State Streets key risk indicators. These indicators are designed to identify major business activities of State Street with significant risk content, and to establish quantifiable thresholds for risk measurement. Key risk indicators are reported regularly to the Executive Committee of the Board, and are reviewed periodically for appropriateness. Modifications to the indicators are made to reflect changes in our business activities or refinements to existing measurements. Enterprise Risk Management, or ERM, a dedicated corporate group, provides oversight, support and coordination across business units and is responsible for the 51 formulation and maintenance of enterprise wide risk management policies and guidelines. In addition, ERM establishes and reviews approved limits, and with the support of business line management, monitors key risks. The head of ERM meets regularly with the Board or a Board committee, as appropriate, and has the authority to escalate issues as necessary. The execution of duties in the management of people, products, business operations and processes is the responsibility of business unit managers. The function of risk management is responsible for designing, orchestrating and directing the implementation of risk management programs and processes consistent with corporate and regulatory standards. Accordingly, risk management is a shared responsibility and requires joint efforts in goal setting, program design and implementation, resource management, and performance evaluation between business and functional units. Responsibility for risk management is overseen by a series of management committees. The Major Risk Committee, or MRC, is responsible for the formulation, recommendation and approval of policies, guidelines and programs governing the identification, analysis, measurement and control of material risks across State Street. Chaired by the head of ERM, the MRC focuses on the review of business activities with significant risk content and the assessment of risk management programs and initiatives, and also serves as the credit policy committee for State Street. The Capital Committee, chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, oversees the management of our regulatory and economic capital, the determination of the framework for capital allocation and strategies for capital structure and debt and equity issuances. ALCO, chaired by the Treasurer, oversees the management of our consolidated balance sheet, including management of our global liquidity and interest rate risk positions. The Fiduciary Review Committee reviews the criteria for the acceptance of fiduciary duties, and assists our business lines with their fiduciary responsibilities executed on behalf of customers. Several other committees with specialized risk management functions report to the MRC. Corporate Audit serves in a complementary role to our program of risk management, providing the Board and management with continuous monitoring and control assessments to ensure adherence to State Streets policies and procedures and the effectiveness of its system of internal controls. The group also has responsibility for the independent validation of financial models utilized in our businesses. Additionally, the internal control environment is evaluated through external examinations and regulatory compliance efforts. The Corporate Compliance, Regulatory and Industry Affairs, and Legal groups also serve essential roles in risk management. Corporate Compliance is responsible for the design, implementation and oversight of policies, guidelines and programs to ensure our compliance with applicable laws and regulations wherever State Street conducts business. The Regulatory and Industry Affairs group monitors proposed changes in rules and legislation, and the Legal group provides counsel that enables us to deal with complex legal and regulatory environments, maximize business opportunities and minimize legal, regulatory and other risks. While we believe our risk management program is effective in managing the risks in our businesses, external factors may create risks that cannot always be identified or anticipated. For example, a material counterparty failure or a default of a material obligor could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Market Risk Market risk is defined as the risk of adverse financial impact due to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and other market driven rates or prices. State Street is exposed to market risk both in its trading and non trading, or asset and liability management, activities. State Street manages its overall market risk through a comprehensive risk management framework. This framework includes risk management groups that report independently to senior management through ERM. The process of 52 managing market risk for these activities, discussed in further detail below, applies to both on balance sheet and off balance sheet exposures. Trading Activities We primarily engage in trading and investment activities to serve our customers needs and to contribute to overall corporate earnings and liquidity. In the conduct of these activities, we are subject to, and assume, market risk. The level of market risk that we assume is a function of our overall objectives and liquidity needs, customer requirements and market volatility. Interest rate risk, a component of market risk, is more thoroughly discussed in the Asset and Liability Management portion of this Market Risk section. Market risk associated with foreign exchange and trading activities is controlled through established limits on aggregate and net open positions, sensitivity to changes in interest rates, and concentrations, which are supplemented by stop loss limits. We use an array of risk management tools and methodologies, including value at risk, to measure, monitor and control market risk. All limits and measurement techniques are reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a regular basis by business managers, the market risk management group and the Trading and Market Risk Committee. We use a variety of derivative financial instruments to support customers needs, conduct trading activities and manage our interest rate and currency risk. These activities are designed to create trading revenue or hedge volatility in net interest revenue. In addition, we provide services related to derivative financial instruments in our role as both a manager and servicer of financial assets. Our customers use derivative financial instruments to manage the financial risks associated with their investment goals and business activities. With the growth of cross border investing, customers have an increasing need for foreign exchange forward contracts to convert currency for international investment and to manage the currency risk in international investment portfolios. As an active participant in the foreign exchange markets, we provide foreign exchange forward contracts and options in support of these customer needs. As part of our trading activities, we assume positions in the foreign exchange and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and using derivative financial instruments, including foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange and interest rate options and interest rate swaps. As of December 31, 2006, the notional amounts of all of these derivative financial instruments were $514.04 billion, of which $492.06 billion were foreign exchange forward contracts. In the aggregate, long and short foreign exchange forward positions are closely matched to minimize currency and interest rate risk. All foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at current market rates. We use a variety of risk measurement and estimation techniques, including value at risk. Value at risk is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical confidence interval. We use a system of risk management to estimate value at risk daily for all material trading positions. We have adopted standards for estimating value at risk, and we maintain capital for market risk in accordance with applicable regulatory guidelines. Value at risk is estimated for a 99% one tail confidence interval and an assumed one day holding period using a historical observation period of greater than one year. A 99% one tail confidence interval implies that daily trading losses should not exceed the estimated value at risk more than 1% of the time, or approximately three days out of the year. The methodology uses a simulation approach based on observed changes in market prices and takes into account the resulting diversification benefits provided from the mix of our trading positions. Like all quantitative risk measures, value at risk is subject to certain limitations and assumptions inherent in the methodology. Our methodology gives equal weight to all market rate observations regardless of how recently the market rates were observed. The estimate is calculated using static 53 portfolios consisting of positions held at the end of the trading day. Implicit in the estimate is the assumption that no intraday action is taken by management during adverse market movements. As a result, the methodology does not represent risk associated with intraday changes in positions or intraday price volatility. The following table presents our market risk for our trading activities as measured by our value at risk methodology: VALUE AT RISK 2006 2005 (In millions) Annual Average Maximum Minimum Annual Average Maximum Minimum Years ended December 31, Foreign exchange products $ 1.7 $ 4.3 $ .7 $ 1.3 $ 3.3 $ .5 Interest rate products .8 1.8 .2 1.1 3.0 .3 We compare daily profits and losses from trading activities to estimated one day value at risk. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we did not experience any trading losses in excess of our end of day value at risk estimate. Asset and Liability Management Activities: The primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable and growing net interest revenue, or NIR, under varying economic environments, while protecting the economic values of our balance sheet assets and liabilities from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates. Most of our NIR is earned from the investment of deposits generated by our core Investment Servicing and Investment Management businesses. We structure our balance sheet assets to generally conform to the characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities, but we manage our overall interest rate risk position in the context of current and anticipated market conditions and within internally approved risk guidelines. Our overall interest rate risk position is maintained within a series of policies approved by the Board and guidelines established and monitored by ALCO. Our Global Treasury unit has responsibility for managing State Streets day to day interest rate risk. To effectively manage the consolidated balance sheet and related net interest revenue, Global Treasury has the authority to take a limited amount of interest rate risk based on market conditions and its views about the direction of global interest rates over both short term and long term time horizons. Global Treasury manages our exposure to changes in interest rates on a consolidated basis, and they have organized themselves into three regional treasury units, North America, Europe, and Asia/Pacific, to reflect the growing, global nature of our exposures and to capture the impact of change in regional market environments on our total risk position. Our investment activities and our use of derivative financial instruments are the primary tools used in managing interest rate risk. We invest in financial instruments with currency, repricing, and maturity characteristics we consider appropriate to manage our overall interest rate risk position. In addition to on balance sheet assets, we use certain derivatives, primarily interest rate swaps, to alter the interest rate characteristics of specific balance sheet assets or liabilities. The use of derivatives is subject to ALCO approved guidelines. Additional information about our use of derivatives is in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. As a result of growth in our non U.S. operations, non U.S. dollar denominated customer liabilities are a significant portion of our consolidated balance sheet. This growth results in exposure to changes in the shape and level of non U.S. dollar yield curves, which we include in our consolidated interest rate risk management process. 54 Because no one individual measure can accurately assess all of our risks to changes in rates, we use several quantitative measures in our assessment of current and potential future exposures to changes in interest rates and their impact on net interest revenue and balance sheet values. Net interest revenue simulation is the primary tool used in our evaluation of the potential range of possible net interest revenue results that could occur under a variety of interest rate environments. We also use market valuation and duration analysis to assess changes in the economic value of balance sheet assets and liabilities caused by assumed changes in interest rates. Finally, gap analysis the difference between the amount of balance sheet assets and liabilities re pricing within a specified time period is used as a measurement of our interest rate risk position. To measure, monitor, and report on our interest rate risk position, we use (1) NIR simulation, or NIR at risk, which measures the impact on NIR over the next twelve months to immediate, or rate shock, and gradual, or rate ramp, changes in market interest rates; and (2) economic value of equity, or EVE, which measures the impact on the present value of all NIR related principal and interest cash flows of an immediate change in interest rates. NIR at risk is designed to measure the potential impact of changes in market interest rates on net interest revenue in the short term. EVE, on the other hand, is a long term view of interest rate risk, but with a view toward liquidation of State Street. Both of these measures are subject to ALCO established guidelines, and are monitored regularly, along with other relevant simulations, scenario analyses and stress tests by both Global Treasury and ALCO. In calculating our NIR at risk, we start with a base amount of net interest revenue that is projected over the next twelve months, assuming that the then current yield curve remains unchanged over the period. Our existing balance sheet assets and liabilities are adjusted by the amount and timing of transactions that are forecasted to occur over the next twelve months. That yield curve is then shocked, or moved immediately, 100 basis points in a parallel fashion, or at all points along the yield curve. Two new twelve month NIR projections are then developed using the same balance sheet and forecasted transactions, but with the new yield curves, and compared to the base scenario. We also perform the calculations using interest rate ramps, which are 100 basis point changes in interest rates that are assumed to occur gradually over the next twelve month period, rather than immediately as we do with interest rate shocks. EVE is based on the change in the present value of all NIR related principal and interest cash flows for changes in market rates of interest. The present value of existing cash flows with a then current yield curve serves as the base case. We then apply an immediate parallel shock to that yield curve of 200 basis points and recalculate the cash flows and related present values. A large shock is used to better capture the embedded option risk in our mortgage backed securities that results from the borrowers prepayment opportunity. Key assumptions used in the models described above include the timing of cash flows; the maturity and repricing of balance sheet assets and liabilities, especially option embedded financial instruments like mortgage backed securities; changes in market conditions; and interest rate sensitivities of our customer liabilities with respect to the interest rates paid and the level of balances. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the models cannot precisely calculate future NIR or predict the impact of changes in interest rates on NIR and economic value. Actual results could differ from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and market conditions, changes in spreads and management strategies, among other factors. Projections of potential future streams of NIR are assessed as part of our forecasting process. The following table presents the estimated exposure of NIR for the next twelve months, calculated as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, due to an immediate 100 basis point shift in then current interest rates. Estimated incremental exposures presented below are dependent on managements assumptions about asset and liability sensitivities under various interest rate scenarios, such as those previously discussed, and 55 do not reflect any actions management may undertake in order to mitigate some of the adverse effects of interest rate changes on State Streets financial performance. NIR AT RISK Estimated Exposure to Net Interest Revenue (In millions) 2006 2005 Rate Change + 100 bps shock $ (90 ) $ (58 ) 100 bps shock 52 (5 ) + 100 bps ramp (57 ) (35 ) 100 bps ramp 46 9 The following table presents estimated EVE exposures, calculated as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, assuming an immediate and prolonged shift in interest rates, the impact of which would be spread over a number of years. ECONOMIC VALUE OF EQUITY Estimated Exposure to Economic Value of Equity (In millions) 2006 2005 Rate Change + 200 bps shock $ (1,023 ) $ (714 ) 200 bps shock 371 138 While the measures presented in the tables above are not a prediction of future NIR or valuations, they do suggest that if all other variables remained constant, in the short term, falling interest rates would lead to NIR that is higher than it would otherwise have been, and rising rates would lead to lower NIR. Other important factors that impact the levels of NIR are balance sheet size and mix; interest rate spreads; the slope and interest rate level of U.S. dollar and non U.S. dollar yield curves and the relationship between them; the pace of change in market interest rates; and management actions taken in response to the preceding conditions. Incremental increases in the levels of NIR at risk and EVE exposures for upward shifts in interest rates presented in the tables above are largely the result of the increased purchases of fixed rate securities, primarily securities available for sale, in response to managements expectations concerning the future direction of U.S. interest rates. These purchases resulted in an overall interest rate risk position that was well within internally approved guidelines. The securities were purchased in accordance with managements intention to maintain the high credit quality of our investment portfolio. 56 One of the most significant assumptions underlying our modeling methodologies and the level of our NIR is the reaction of our balance sheet liabilities, such as deposits, to movements in market interest rates. Generally, we invest customer deposits in money market assets and high quality investment securities, the mix of which is determined by the interest rate and balance sensitivities of customer deposits under a variety of economic environments. We regularly assess the characteristics of customer liabilities by product, geography, currency and customer type to ensure that the characteristics have not materially changed in a way that would create material risk to our NIR and net interest margin. Credit Risk Credit and counterparty risk is defined as the risk of financial loss if a borrower or counterparty is either unable or unwilling to repay borrowings or settle in accordance with contractual terms. The extension of credit and acceptance of counterparty risk by State Street are governed by corporate guidelines based on the prospective customers risk profile, the markets served, counterparty and country concentrations, and regulatory compliance. Our focus on large institutional investors and their businesses requires that we assume concentrated credit risk in a variety of forms to certain highly rated entities. This concentration risk is mitigated by comprehensive guidelines and procedures to monitor and manage all aspects of credit and counterparty risk that we undertake. Exposures are evaluated on an individual basis at least annually. We provide, on a limited basis, traditional loan products and services to key customers and prospects in a manner that enhances customer relationships, increases profitability and minimizes risk. We employ a relationship model in which credit decisions are based upon credit quality and the overall institutional relationship. This model is typical of financial institutions that provide credit to institutional customers in the markets that we serve. An allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb probable credit losses in the loan portfolio and is reviewed regularly by management for adequacy. An internal rating system is used to assess potential risk of loss based on customer investment profile, current economic and or customer financial indicators. The provision for loan losses is a charge to earnings to maintain the overall allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate relative to the level of credit risk in the loan and lease financing portfolio. No provision was recorded in either 2006 or 2005. In 2004, we reversed $18 million through the provision as a result of reduced credit risk exposures and improved credit quality. 57 At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the allowance for loan losses was $18 million, less than 1% of total loans as of each year end. Changes in the allowance for loan losses were as follows for the years ended December 31: (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 U.S.: Balance at beginning of year $ 14 $ 14 $ 43 $ 43 $ 40 Provision for loan losses (15 ) 4 Loan charge offs commercial and financial (3 ) Recoveries commercial and financial 3 Transferred upon sale(1) (1 ) Reclassification(2) (14 ) Balance at end of year U.S. 14 14 14 43 43 Non U.S.: Balance at beginning of year 4 4 18 18 18 Provision for loan losses (3 ) Reclassification(2) (11 ) Balance at end of year Non U.S. 4 4 4 18 18 Total balance at end of year $ 18 $ 18 $ 18 $ 61 $ 61 (1) In 2002, we completed the sale of our Global Trade Banking business, which included the transfer of $1 million of the allowance for loan losses. (2) In 2004, we reclassified $25 million of the allowance for loan losses to other liabilities as a reserve for off balance sheet commitments. Subsequent to the reclassification, the reserve for off balance sheet commitments was reduced by $10 million, and recorded as an offset to other operating expenses. Past due loans are loans on which principal or interest payments are over 90 days delinquent, but where interest continues to be accrued. There were no past due loans as of December 31, 2006, 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002. We generally place loans on non accrual status once payments are 60 days past due, or earlier if management determines that full collection is not probable. Loans 60 days past due, but considered both well secured and in the process of collection, may be excluded from non accrual status. For loans placed on non accrual status, revenue recognition is suspended. There were no non accrual loans at year end 2006, 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002. We purchase securities under agreements to resell. Risk is minimized by establishing the acceptability of counterparties; limiting purchases almost exclusively to low risk U.S. government securities; taking possession or control of transaction assets; monitoring levels of underlying collateral; and limiting the duration of the agreements. Securities are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary from the borrower. Most repurchase agreements are short term, with maturities of less than 90 days. We also provide customers with off balance sheet liquidity and credit enhancement facilities in the form of letters of credit, lines of credit and liquidity asset purchase agreements. These exposures are subject to an initial credit analysis, with detailed approval and review processes. These facilities are also actively monitored and reviewed on an annual basis. We maintain a separate reserve for probable credit losses related to certain of these off balance sheet activities. Management reviews the adequacy of this reserve on a regular basis. On behalf of our customers, we lend their securities to creditworthy banks, broker/dealers and other institutions. In most circumstances, we indemnify our customers for the fair market value of those 58 securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities. Though these transactions are well collateralized, the substantial volume of these activities necessitates thorough credit based underwriting and monitoring processes. State Street requires the borrowers to provide collateral in an amount equal to or in excess of 100% of the fair market value of the securities borrowed. Collateral funds received in connection with our securities lending services are held by us as agent and are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. The borrowed securities and collateral are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary. State Street held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $527.37 billion and $387.22 billion as collateral for indemnified securities financing at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Processes for credit approval and monitoring are in place for other credit extensions. As part of the approval and renewal process, appropriate due diligence is conducted based on the size and term of the exposure, as well as the quality of the counterparty. Exposures to these entities are aggregated and evaluated by ERM. Investments in debt and equity securities, including investments in affiliates, are monitored regularly by Corporate Finance and ERM. To the extent necessary, procedures are in place for evaluating potentially impaired securities. Total non performing investment securities were $4 million at both December 31, 2006 and 2005. Operational Risk We define operational risk as the potential for loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, and from external events. As a leading provider of services to institutional investors, our customers have a broad array of complex and specialized servicing, confidentiality and fiduciary requirements. Active management of operational risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business, and responsibility for the management of operational risk lies with every individual at State Street. Our Operational Risk Policy Statement defines operational risk and details roles and responsibilities for managing operational risk. The Policy Statement is reinforced by the Operational Risk Guidelines, which codify our approach to operational risk. The Guidelines document our sound practices and provide a mandate within which programs, processes, and regulatory elements are implemented to ensure that operational risk is identified, measured, managed and controlled in an effective and consistent manner across State Street. We maintain an operational risk governance structure to ensure that responsibilities are clearly defined and to provide independent oversight of operational risk management. Business units periodically review the status of the business controls and monitor and report key risk indicator results. ERM oversees the overall operational risk management program. The MRC and the Operational Risk Committee review key risk indicators and policies related to operational risk, provide oversight to ensure compliance with the operational risk program, and escalate operational risk issues of note to the Executive Committee of the Board. Corporate Audit performs independent reviews of the application of operational risk management practices and methodologies and reports to the Examining and Audit Committee of the Board. State Streets internal control environment is designed to provide a sound operational environment. Our discipline in managing operational risk provides the structure to identify, evaluate, control, monitor, measure, mitigate and report operational risk. Business Risk We define business risk as the risk of adverse changes in our earnings related to business factors, including changes in the competitive environment, changes in the operational economics of business activities and the potential effect of strategic and reputation risks, not already captured as market, credit or operational risks. We incorporate business risk into our assessment of our economic capital needs. Active 59 management of business risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business, and responsibility for the management of business risk lies with every individual at State Street. It is sometimes difficult to separate the effects of a potential adverse event into operational and business risks. For instance, the direct financial impact of an unfavorable event in the form of fines or penalties would be classified as an operational risk loss, while the impact on our reputation and the potential loss of customers and corresponding decline in revenue would be classified as a business risk loss. An additional example of business risk is the integration of a major acquisition. Failure to successfully integrate the operations of an acquired business, and the resultant inability to retain customers, would be classified as a business risk loss. Business risk is managed with a long term focus. Techniques include the careful development of business plans and appropriate management oversight. The potential impact of the various elements of business risk is difficult to quantify with any degree of precision. We use a combination of historical earnings volatility, scenario analysis, stress testing and management judgment to help assess the potential effect on State Street attributable to business risk. Management and control of business risks are generally the responsibility of the business units as part of their overall and strategic planning and internal risk management processes. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS In the normal course of business, we hold assets under custody and assets under management in a custodial or fiduciary capacity for our customers, and, in accordance with GAAP, we do not record these assets in our consolidated statement of condition. Similarly, collateral funds resulting from our securities finance activities are held by us as agent; therefore, we do not record these assets in our consolidated statement of condition. Additional information about these activities is in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. In the normal course of business, we sell and distribute securities for three types of off balance sheet entities, two of which are not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Additional information about these special purpose entities is in Notes 10 and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. The risks associated with providing administration, liquidity, and or credit enhancements to these special purpose entities are reviewed as part of our corporate risk management process in a manner that is consistent with applicable policies and guidelines. We believe that State Street has sufficient liquidity and has provided adequate credit reserves to cover any risks associated with these activities. In the normal course of business, we utilize derivative financial instruments to support our customers needs, to conduct trading activities and to manage our interest rate and foreign currency risk. Additional information about our use of derivatives is in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). This new standard is intended to make it easier for financial statement users to understand an employers financial position and ability to meet the obligations of its benefit plans. The standard requires recognition in our consolidated statement of condition of the overfunded or underfunded status of our tax qualified defined benefit pension plan, nonqualified retirement plans and postretirement benefit plans, which is the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the related benefit obligations. The standard also requires the 60 reclassification of the after tax amount of any unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and unrecognized prior service costs to accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of shareholders equity. In subsequent years, the after tax amount of changes in unrecognized actuarial gains and losses, as well as unrecognized prior service costs, will be recorded in other comprehensive income. The standard was effective on December 31, 2006 with respect to the recognition of our plans funded status, and the standards remaining provisions must be applied prospectively. Upon adoption of the standard, to recognize the after tax difference between our plans net funded status and the amounts currently recorded in the consolidated statement of condition, we recorded an after tax reduction of accumulated other comprehensive income of approximately $164 million. Disclosures required by the new standard are included in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position, or FSP, No. FAS 13 2, Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction. The FSP, which must be applied as of January 1, 2007, requires that the recognition of lease income over the term of a lease be recalculated if there is a change in the expected timing of tax related cash flows. The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of the FSP must be recorded as an adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings as of January 1, 2007. Our application of the FSPs provisions to certain of our leveraged leases resulted in an after tax reduction of the beginning balance of retained earnings on January 1, 2007 of approximately $226 million. Future revenue from the affected leases is expected to increase over the remaining terms of the affected leases by an amount approximately equal to the after tax reduction. Future developments concerning our resolution of issues with the IRS with respect to the affected leases could affect managements estimate of the timing of tax related cash flows used to record the cumulative effect adjustment. Changes in estimates of the timing of these tax related cash flows could result in income tax expense in our consolidated statement of income during 2007 or later years. Information related to other recent accounting developments is in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. 61 To Our Shareholders 2006 was a very good year for State Street. We exceeded all of our financial goals (excluding tax adjustments), grew our business globally, expanded relationships with our customers, launched new products, acquired new capabilities and continued to be a strong corporate citizen in the communities in which we live and work. Our performance in 2006 was driven by a number of themes that I define as setting the standard for our industry. Consistency The first theme is consistency, which is best illustrated by our financial performance. 2006 was our twenty ninth consecutive year of operating earnings per share growth and our twenty eighth consecutive year of dividend increases, with an 11 percent increase from 2005. We outperformed our peer group in revenue and EPS growth while generating lower expense growth. Earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding the tax adjustments recorded in the second and fourth quarters, rose 23 percent from 2005 (exceeding our goal of between 10 and 15 percent); our top line operating revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was up 15 percent from 2005 (exceeding our goal of between 8 and 12 percent); and our return on equity from continuing operations, excluding the above mentioned tax adjustments, improved from 15.3 percent in 2005 to 17.1 percent (exceeding our range of between 14 and 17 percent). We also achieved 290 basis points of positive operating leverage in 2006 compared to 2005, and generated four more quarters of year over year operating leverage, bringing State Streets number of consecutive quarters of year over year positive operating leverage to nine. This consistent performance was rewarded with a 22 percent increase in our stock price in 2006. We increased net interest revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis by 22 percent over 2005 and improved net interest margin to 1.25 percent, up from 1.08 percent in 2005. We also repurchased 5.8 million shares of our common stock. State Street Global Advisors (SSgA), our investment management arm and the largest institutional asset manager in the world*, contributed to our strong financial performance with another outstanding year in 2006, accounting for 24 percent of the companys total pretax profit in 2006, up from 21 percent in 2005. Pretax profit at SSgA increased 40 percent compared to 2005, with its pretax margin up to 35 percent from 31 percent in 2005. Assets under management grew 21.4 percent in 2006 to $1.7 trillion. Consistency is also reflected in our approach to community support, sustainable development and the environment. Since 1977, we have contributed a portion of pretax profits to the State Street Foundation, which in turn provided more than $11.4 million in grants in 2006 to support affordable housing, education and health. Additionally, our employees worldwide devoted 40,000 hours to volunteer activities. In our home state of Massachusetts, we were the largest corporate contributor to the United Way of Massachusetts Bay for the sixteenth consecutive year. This consistent performance on behalf of our communities was a key factor in State Street being named to Business Ethics magazines 100 Best Corporate Citizens list for 2006. State Street was also selected for both the World and North America Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes, based on our enhanced environmental management and corporate governance policies, in addition to our strong citizenship and philanthropy programs. * Based on assets under management 62 Global Growth The second theme underpinning our strong performance in 2006 is global growth. We made considerable progress in 2006 against our long term goal of growing non US revenue to 50 percent, achieving a total of 43 percent in 2006, up from 39 percent in 2005. This increase in non US revenue highlights our ability to capitalize on key growth areas, such as hedge and offshore fund servicing, enhanced and active strategies, investment manager operations outsourcing and electronic foreign exchange trading. At SSgA, 32 percent of revenue now comes from non US sources, up from 30 percent in 2005. Global not only applies to our business but also to our people. Today, approximately 40 percent of our employees are located outside of the US, which provides us with a strong foundation for future growth as we seek to outpace our competitors in markets that are growing faster than the US. This diversity starts at the top of our company, highlighted by the election in December of three European nationals to our board of directors Peter Coym, Amelia Fawcett and Maureen Miskovic, all of whom bring a wealth of global and financial industry experience to our board. Global also describes our customer base in 2006, with key asset servicing and asset management business wins being awarded to us in Beijing, Boston, Edinburgh, Hong Kong, London, Luxembourg, Munich, New York, Paris, Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo and Toronto. These wins represent a total of 779 new investment servicing wins and 1,345 new asset management business wins from companies that include Virgin Money, Bayerische Versorgungskammer, CIMB Group, IKANO Fund Management S.A., TOWER Australia Limited and John Hancock Funds. Innovation The third theme, innovation, remains a key driver in fueling our growth and deepening our relationships with customers. This focus on innovation is supported by our commitment to investing in technology 22 percent of our operating expenses in 2006 and pioneering new products and solutions. In 2006, we launched a number of industry firsts. This innovation ranges from the launch of our Sovereign Bond Flow Indicator that measures investor flows into sovereign bonds covering 13 countries, to the expansion of our alternative investment strategies capabilities with a new line up of cutting edge absolute return strategies, to 12 new exchange traded funds providing investors with precise exposure to targeted sectors such as the oil and gas sector and the metals and mining sector. Our leading position in investment manager operations outsourcing, a capability that we pioneered in the industry in 2000, continued to expand in 2006 with the completion of the first European customer migration onto our Enterprise technology and the addition of two new North American customers Evergreen Investments and Putnam Investments. Customer Focus The fourth and final theme is customer focus. Our commitment to delivering a value to our customers that they cannot find anywhere else proved to be a strong differentiator for State Street in 2006, with more than 75 percent of our new revenue coming from deepening relationships with existing customers. For example, AXA Investment Managers expanded its relationship with us to include servicing for its Luxembourg and Dublin based fund groups for more than 20 billion in assets. Calamos Investments, a customer since 2004, chose State Street to provide fund accounting services for an additional nine open ended mutual funds and one variable insurance fund representing $29.8 billion in assets. The California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) reappointed State Street to provide investment services for its $200 billion pension fund, a testament to the high quality customer service that 63 State Street has provided to CalPERS for more than 13 years. CalPERS also selected SSgA as one of its first managers to implement a domestic long short equity strategy, underscoring the success SSgA continues to achieve in offering the most innovative investment strategies available in the industry today. Our ability to deliver for our customers continued to yield business from new customers as well. For example, SSgA was selected by Chinas National Council for Social Security Fund (NCSSF) as external manager for the National Social Security Funds global equity mandate the first time the NCSSF chose a global manager. Customer focus is part of our corporate culture at State Street and a value that is reflected across our leadership team. Three members of this team were promoted to vice chairman in 2006, in recognition of the considerable contributions they have made to the evolution of our company and the impact of their responsibilities on our current and future growth. Joseph L. (Jay) Hooley, a 20 year veteran of State Street, is head of global investment servicing and investment research and trading. Under his leadership, State Street has achieved consistently high growth and has expanded its global presence. Today, the company is the No. 1 provider of investment manager operations outsourcing services, a leading provider of hedge fund servicing and a world leader in multi asset class trading and transition management. William W. Hunt is president and chief executive officer of SSgA and a 12 year State Street veteran. With more than a decade of experience working outside of the US, Hunt plays a key role in driving State Streets global expansion as well as accelerating SSgAs push into active and enhanced strategies. Joseph C. Antonellis, a 16 year veteran of State Street, is chief information officer and heads the companys global securities services, operations and technology. Antonellis, named Best CIO by the American Financial Technology Awards, is also responsible for the companys investment servicing business in North America. Whats Next? Looking ahead to 2007, the question that I am most often asked is: Whats next? This is a question that we continually ask ourselves to ensure that we dont become complacent and falsely assume that by simply doing more of the same we will deliver similar results. While we have confidence in our strategic focus, we will continue to evolve our business to ensure that we retain our leadership position in the industry and set the standard for others to follow. We will also continue to balance revenue growth with expense discipline to generate positive operating leverage, and aggressively pursue capabilities that will augment our market share in high growth markets and will increase our revenue. Our proposed acquisitions of Investors Financial Services Corporation and Currenex, which we announced at the beginning of 2007, are examples of actions we are taking to enhance our leadership position. With the acquisition of Boston based Investors Financial Services, State Street strengthens its position as a worldwide service provider of fund accounting to the mutual fund industry, enhances its capabilities in servicing the offshore fund market, and further extends its leadership in the fastest growing segment of the asset servicing business hedge fund administration. Key to this transaction is the tremendous cross sell opportunities that it provides State Street. Investors Financial Services serves 12 of the top 25 global investment managers. These institutions will now have access to State Streets global capabilities, from foreign exchange to securities lending to servicing cross border assets. The Investors Financial Services acquisition also expands State Streets product line, bringing private equity fund servicing capabilities along with approximately $30 billion in private equity fund assets under administration and strengthens State Streets leadership position in key areas. With the addition of 64 Investors Financial Services $2.2 trillion in assets under custody, State Street will have more than $14 trillion in assets under custody. State Street will also be the No. 1 administrator of hedge funds, with assets under administration of more than $340 billion. In addition, the acquisition helps extend State Streets lead in investment manager operations outsourcing. The combination of expanded market share in key growth markets, cross sell opportunities with new customers and the addition of new products will help us generate significant new revenue. The Investors Financial Services acquisition also complements our acquisition of the Currenex foreign exchange trading platform, which accelerates our participation in the electronic foreign exchange trading market and its fastest growing segment: hedge funds. Foreign exchange is the largest and most liquid market in the world, with trading volumes of approximately $2.3 trillion per day. With the Currenex acquisition, State Street can offer its customers more efficient access to markets as well as the industrys most flexible, comprehensive trading solutions. Setting the Industry Standard When we talk about setting the industry standard, we define this standard as delivering financial results that are better than the market and our peer group. Our long term financial goals remain the same as I previously described. Due to the Investors Financial Services Corp. acquisition, however, we have set financial goals for 2007 of achieving growth in operating earnings per share of 8 to 10 percent, growth in operating revenue of 16 to 18 percent and return on equity of between 12 and 15 percent. We expect to achieve near the middle of these ranges in 2007. Our operating results for 2007 will exclude merger, integration and restructuring charges related to the Investors Financial Services acquisition, and for 2006 will exclude the previously mentioned tax adjustments. We expect that further improvements in net interest revenue and net interest margin resulting from the actions we have taken over the past two years will improve the yields from our balance sheet, without adding any significant new credit risk. By setting the standard for our industry, we will continue to deliver superior results for shareholders, customers, employees and the community. We are committed to ensuring that we consistently achieve this level of performance across the globe, while continually innovating to create products and services that deepen our relationships with our customers. We delivered on our commitment in 2006, and I will ensure that we remain equally committed to superior results for all of our stakeholders in 2007. Sincerely, /s/ RONALD E. LOGUE Ronald E.
