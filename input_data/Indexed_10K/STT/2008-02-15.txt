ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS GENERAL State Street Corporation is a financial holding company organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. All references in this Managements Discussion and Analysis to "the parent company" are to State Street Corporation. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this Managements Discussion to "State Street," "we," "us," "our" or similar terms mean State Street Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. State Street Bank and Trust Company is referred to as "State Street Bank." At December 31, 2007, we had total assets of $142.54 billion, total deposits of $95.79 billion, total shareholders equity of $11.30 billion and employed 27,110. With $15.30 trillion of assets under custody and $1.98 trillion of assets under management at year end 2007, we are a leading specialist in meeting the needs of institutional investors worldwide. We report two lines of business: Investment Servicing and Investment Management. These lines of business provide a full range of products and services for our customers, which include mutual funds and other collective investment funds, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, foundations, endowments and other investment pools, and investment managers. Investment Servicing provides services to support institutional investors, such as custody, product and participant level accounting, daily pricing and administration; master trust and master custody; recordkeeping; shareholder services, including mutual fund and collective investment fund shareholder accounting; foreign exchange, brokerage and other trading services; securities finance; deposit and short term investment facilities; loans and lease financing; investment manager and hedge fund manager operations outsourcing; and performance, risk and compliance analytics. Investment Management provides a broad array of services for managing financial assets, such as investment research services and investment management, including passive and active U.S. and non U.S. equity and fixed income strategies. For additional information about our lines of business, see the "Line of Business Information" section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis and note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. This Managements Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. Certain previously reported amounts presented have been reclassified to conform to current period classifications. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., referred to as "GAAP". The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the application of certain accounting policies that materially affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Accounting policies that require management to make assumptions that are difficult, subjective, or complex about matters that are uncertain and may change in subsequent periods are discussed in more depth in the "Significant Accounting Estimates" section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. This Managements Discussion and Analysis contains statements that are considered "forward looking statements" within the meaning of U.S. federal securities laws. Forward looking statements are based on our current expectations about revenue and market growth, acquisitions and divestitures, new technologies, services and opportunities, earnings and other factors. These forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially. We undertake no obligation to revise the forward looking statements contained in this Managements Discussion and Analysis to reflect events after the date we file this Form 10 K with the SEC. Additional information about forward looking statements and related risks and uncertainties is included in the Risk Factors section of this Form 10 K under Item 1A. 25 OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL RESULTS Years ended December 31, 2007(1) 2006 2005 (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Total fee revenue $ 6,599 $ 5,186 $ 4,551 Net interest revenue 1,730 1,110 907 Provision for loan losses Gains (Losses) on sales of available for sale investment securities, net 7 15 (1 ) Gain on sale of divested business 16 Total revenue 8,336 6,311 5,473 Total operating expenses(2) 6,433 4,540 4,041 Income from continuing operations before income tax expense 1,903 1,771 1,432 Income tax expense from continuing operations 642 675 487 Income from continuing operations 1,261 1,096 945 Income (Loss) from discontinued operations 10 (107 ) Net income $ 1,261 $ 1,106 $ 838 Earnings per share from continuing operations: Basic $ 3.50 $ 3.31 $ 2.86 Diluted 3.45 3.26 2.82 Earnings per share: Basic $ 3.50 $ 3.34 $ 2.53 Diluted 3.45 3.29 2.50 Average shares outstanding (in thousands): Basic 360,675 331,350 330,361 Diluted 365,488 335,732 334,636 Return on shareholders equity from continuing operations 13.4 % 16.2 % 15.3 % Return on shareholders equity 13.4 16.4 13.6 (1)Financial results for the year ended December 31, 2007 include results of the acquired Investors Financial business for the third and fourth quarters of 2007. (2)Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007 include merger and integration costs of $198 million associated with the acquisition of Investors Financial and a net charge of $467 million related to certain active fixed income strategies at State Street Global Advisors. Summary Our financial results for 2007 reflect our overall objectives of consistent revenue growth, managing growth in operating expenses and balancing growth in operating expenses with growth in revenue. All categories of fee revenue, as reported in our consolidated statement of income, increased compared to 2006, with the exception of processing fees and other revenue, which declined 13%. Net interest revenue increased 56% compared to 2006. We achieved positive operating leverage for 2007 compared to 2006, as defined by management. Our Investment Management business, State Street Global Advisors, which we refer to in this Managements Discussion and Analysis as "SSgA," contributed approximately 18% of our consolidated total revenue for 2007, compared to 19% for 2006, and generated net new business of $116 billion during 2007, compared to $86 billion for 2006. 26 We ended 2007 with levels of assets under custody and assets under management that increased 29% and 13%, respectively, from year end 2006. We completed our acquisition of Currenex in March 2007. For the period March to December 2007, the acquired Currenex business contributed approximately $65 million of revenue, primarily other trading services revenue. We completed our acquisition of Investors Financial in July 2007, and issued approximately 60.8 million shares in the transaction. For the second half of the year, the acquired Investors Financial business contributed $456 million in revenue, including $395 million in fee revenue, and $340 million in operating expenses. In connection with the acquisition, during the second half of the year we recorded $198 million, or $129 million after tax, of merger and integration costs. During the second half of 2007, we purchased 13.4 million shares of our common stock, as well as an additional .6 million shares in January 2008, under a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program, which program concluded on January 18, 2008. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded a net pre tax charge of $467 million, or $279 million after tax, to establish a reserve associated with certain active fixed income strategies managed by SSgA. Certain financial information is presented and discussed in the following sections on both a GAAP basis and on an "operating" basis. Management measures certain financial information on an operating basis to provide for meaningful comparisons from period to period, and to present comparable financial trends with respect to our normal ongoing business operations. Management believes that operating basis financial information, which includes the impact of revenue from non taxable sources and excludes the impact of non recurring expenses, facilitates an investors understanding and analysis of State Streets underlying performance and trends in addition to financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Financial Highlights For 2007, we recorded income from continuing operations of $1.3 billion, or $3.45 per diluted share, compared to $1.1 billion, or $3.26 per diluted share, for 2006. Total revenue increased 32% from 2006, and return on equity from continuing operations was 13.4% compared to 16.2% for 2006. Results for 2007 included two significant expenses. First, we recorded aggregate merger and integration costs of $198 million, or $129 million after tax, in connection with our acquisition of Investors Financial. Second, we recorded a net pre tax charge of $467 million, or $279 million after tax, in connection with the establishment of a reserve to address legal exposure and other costs associated with the underperformance of certain active fixed income strategies managed by SSgA, and customer concerns as to whether the execution of these strategies was consistent with the customers investment intent. These costs are more fully discussed in the "Consolidated Results of Operations Operating Expenses" section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. Our results for 2006 included income from discontinued operations of $10 million (pre tax income of $16 million reduced by related income tax expense of $6 million), or $.03 per diluted share, the result of the finalization of certain legal, selling and other costs recorded in connection with our divestiture of Bel Air Investment Advisors LLC. Total revenue for 2007 grew 32% from 2006. Total fee revenue for 2007, which grew 27%, reflected consistent growth throughout the year in servicing fees and management fees, up 24% and 21%, respectively, compared to 2006, and trading services and securities finance revenue, up 34% and 76%, respectively. Generally, servicing fees benefited from the inclusion of the acquired Investors Financial 27 business, net new business and favorable equity markets, and management fees benefited primarily from net new business and favorable equity markets. Trading services revenue grew primarily as a result of increases in customer volumes and the inclusion of the acquired Investors Financial business, with respect to foreign exchange revenue, and as a result of the inclusion of revenue from the acquired Currenex business, with respect to other trading services revenue. Securities finance revenue benefited from increases in volumes of securities loaned, both from new customers and from growth in volume from existing customers, and increases in spreads. Net interest revenue increased 56% compared to 2006, and net interest margin increased to 1.71% from 1.25%. This growth was the result of several favorable trends (1) favorable rates and volumes on non U.S. deposits; (2) the addition of interest earning assets from Investors Financials balance sheet; and (3) the favorable impact of fixed rate investments. Total operating expenses increased 42% from 2006, partly reflective of the $665 million aggregate impact of merger and integration costs associated with Investors Financial and a net pre tax charge associated with certain SSgA active fixed income strategies. If these aggregate costs are excluded, total operating expenses for 2007 totaled $5.768 billion ($6.433 billion less $665 million), an increase of 27% from $4.54 billion for 2006, as we continued to carefully manage operating expenses and balance growth in operating expenses with growth in revenue. Most of the increase resulted from the inclusion of the operating expenses of the acquired Investors Financial business for the second half of 2007, as well as increased incentive compensation due to improved performance and increased staffing levels to support new business, particularly internationally. Excluding the aggregate $665 million of merger and integration costs and the net pre tax charge, as a result of year over year growth in revenue of 32% and year over year growth in total operating expenses of 27% as described above, we generated positive operating leverage of approximately 500 basis points. We define positive operating leverage as a rate of total revenue growth that exceeds the rate of growth of total operating expenses, determined on an operating basis. SSgA was a significant contributor to our overall results for 2007. Its total revenue increased 25% for 2007 over 2006, and comprised about 18% of our total consolidated revenue for 2007, compared to 19% for 2006. In addition, SSgA generated net new business in assets under management, which we expect will generate management fee revenue in future years, of approximately $116 billion for 2007, compared to $86 billion for 2006. The decline in SSgAs relative contribution to our consolidated total revenue was the result of the impact of the acquired Investors Financial businesss revenue on total revenue of our Investment Servicing line of business, which increased 34% for 2007 over 2006. We continue to expand our business outside of the U.S., particularly in Europe and the Asia/Pacific region. For 2007, approximately $3.42 billion, or 41% of our consolidated total revenue of $8.336 billion, was generated from non U.S. activities, compared to 43% for 2006. The 2007 percentage reflects revenue from the acquired Investors Financial business, which was predominantly generated in the U.S. For illustrative purposes, if we exclude total revenue from the acquired Investors Financial business for 2007 of $456 million, non U.S. revenue of $3.42 billion for 2007 comprised approximately 43% of consolidated total revenue for 2007 of $7.88 billion ($8.336 billion less $456 million). At year end 2007, we employed 9,500 outside the U.S., compared to 8,630 at year end 2006. Our goal is to eventually generate 50% of our consolidated total revenue from outside the United States. Assets under custody and assets under management both increased from year end 2006, with assets under custody at $15.30 trillion, up 29% from $11.85 trillion a year ago, and assets under management at $1.98 trillion, up 13% from $1.75 trillion a year ago. The acquired Investors Financial business contributed $1.9 trillion of assets under custody. Assets under custody have grown at a compound annual rate of 13% since year end 2003, with U.S. assets growing by 12% and non U.S. assets growing by 16%, while assets under management have grown at a compound annual rate of 16% over the same period. 28 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This section discusses our consolidated results of operations for 2007 compared to 2006, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. A comparison of consolidated results of operations for 2006 with those for 2005 is provided in the "Comparison of 2006 and 2005 Overview of Consolidated Results of Operations" section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. TOTAL REVENUE Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Change 2006 2007 (Dollars in millions) Fee revenue: Servicing fees $ 3,388 $ 2,723 $ 2,474 24 % Management fees 1,141 943 751 21 Trading services 1,152 862 694 34 Securities finance 681 386 330 76 Processing fees and other 237 272 302 (13 ) Total fee revenue 6,599 5,186 4,551 27 Net interest revenue: Interest revenue 5,212 4,324 2,930 21 Interest expense 3,482 3,214 2,023 8 Net interest revenue 1,730 1,110 907 56 Provision for loan losses Net interest revenue after provision for loan losses 1,730 1,110 907 56 Gains (Losses) on sales of available for sale investment securities, net 7 15 (1 ) Gain on sale of Private Asset Management business 16 Total revenue $ 8,336 $ 6,311 $ 5,473 32 We are one of the worlds leading specialists in servicing mutual funds, other collective investment funds and pension plans. We are consistently gaining business globally, and for 2007, our non U.S. revenue was approximately 41% of our total revenue, compared to 43% for 2006 and 24% for 2002. We provide a broad range of reliable, easy to integrate investment services that are global and enable our customers to develop and launch competitive new investment products. We also provide active management products, including enhanced indexing, hedge fund strategies and quantitative management, and passive investment management products and strategies. We provide fund accounting, custody, investment management, securities finance, transfer agency services, and operations outsourcing for investment managers and hedge fund managers. These services support the complex financial strategies and transactions of our customers worldwide, in any time zone across multiple currencies. Our focus on the total needs of the customer allows us to develop active, long term relationships that result in high customer retention, cross selling opportunities, and recurring revenue. The servicing markets in which we compete are very price competitive, and we consistently focus on winning and retaining customer business. This focus requires a strong commitment to customers while constantly working toward providing services at lower costs. Our broad range of services generates fee revenue and net interest revenue. Fee revenue generated by investment servicing and investment management is augmented by securities finance, trading services and other processing fee revenue. We earn net interest revenue from customers deposits and short term investment activities, by providing deposit services and short term investment vehicles, such as repurchase agreements and commercial paper, to meet customers needs for high grade liquid investments, and investing these sources of funds and additional borrowings in assets yielding a higher rate. 29  Fee Revenue Servicing and management fees are the largest components of fee revenue, and collectively comprised approximately 69% of total fee revenue for 2007 and 71% for 2006. These fees are a function of several factors, including the mix and volume of assets under custody and assets under management, securities positions held and the volume of portfolio transactions, and the types of products and services used by customers, and are affected by changes in worldwide equity and fixed income valuations. Generally, servicing fees are impacted, in part, by changes in daily average valuations of assets under custody, while management fees are impacted by changes in month end valuations of assets under management. Additional factors, such as the level of transaction volumes, changes in service level, balance credits, customer minimum balances, pricing concessions and other factors may have a significant impact on servicing fee revenue. Generally, management fee revenue is more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue. Management fees also include performance fees, which amounted to approximately 6% of management fees for 2007 compared to 9% for 2006. Performance fees are generated when the performance of managed funds exceeds benchmarks specified in the management agreements, and we experience more volatility with performance fees than with more traditional management fees. In light of the above, we estimate, assuming all other factors remain constant, that a 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity values would result in a corresponding change in our total revenue of approximately 2%. If fixed income security values were to increase or decrease by 10%, we would anticipate a corresponding change of approximately 1% in our total revenue. The following table presents selected equity market indices. Daily averages and the averages of month end indices demonstrate worldwide equity market valuation changes that impact servicing and management fee revenue, respectively. Year end indices impact the value of assets under custody and management at those dates. The index names listed in the table and elsewhere in this Managements Discussion and Analysis are service marks of their respective owners.

Servicing Fees Servicing fees include fee revenue from U.S. mutual funds, collective investment funds worldwide, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, foundations, endowments, and other investment pools. Products and services include custody; product and participant level accounting; daily pricing and administration; recordkeeping; investment manager and hedge fund manager operations outsourcing services; master trust and master custody; and performance, risk and compliance analytics. The increase in servicing fees of $665 million from 2006 primarily resulted from the inclusion of $304 million of servicing fee revenue from the acquired Investors Financial business, net new business from existing and new customers, higher average equity market valuations and higher customer transaction volumes. Net new business is defined as new business net of lost business. For 2007, servicing fees generated from customers outside the U.S. were approximately 41% of total servicing fees, down from 44% in 2006. The decrease in the non U.S. proportion reflected the contribution of servicing fees from the acquired Investors Financial business, which are generated predominantly in the U.S. We are the largest provider of mutual fund custody and accounting services in the United States. We distinguish ourselves from other mutual fund service providers by offering customers a broad array of integrated products and services, including accounting, daily pricing and fund administration. We calculate more than 34% of the U.S. mutual fund prices provided to NASDAQ that appear daily in The Wall Street Journal and other publications with an accuracy rate of 99.9%. We have a leading position for servicing U.S. tax exempt assets for corporate and public pension funds. We provide trust and valuation services for more than 4,000 daily priced portfolios, making us a leader for both monthly and daily valuation services. We are a leading service provider outside of the U.S. as well. In Germany, we provide Depotbank services for approximately 16% of retail and institutional fund assets. In the United Kingdom, we provide custody services for 18% of pension fund assets and provide administration services to more than 24% of mutual fund assets. We service approximately 23% of the hedge fund market and more than $650 billion of offshore assets, primarily domiciled in Ireland and Luxembourg. We have more than $1 trillion in assets under administration in the Asia/Pacific region, and are the largest non domestic trust bank in Japan. At year end 2007, our total assets under custody were $15.30 trillion, compared to $11.85 trillion a year earlier. The value of assets under custody is a broad measure of the relative size of various markets served. Changes in the value of assets under custody do not necessarily result in proportional changes in revenue. Assets under custody consisted of the following at December 31: ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY As of December 31, 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 2006 2007 AGR 2003 2007 CAGR (Dollars in billions) Mutual funds $ 4,803 $ 3,738 $ 3,442 $ 3,088 $ 3,094 28 % 12 % Collective funds 3,199 1,665 1,001 911 1,153 92 29 Pension products 3,960 3,713 3,358 3,254 3,026 7 7 Insurance and other products 3,337 2,738 2,320 2,244 2,097 22 12 Total $ 15,299 $ 11,854 $ 10,121 $ 9,497 $ 9,370 29 13 31 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT MIX OF ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY As of December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (In billions) Equities $ 8,653 $ 5,821 $ 4,814 Fixed income 4,087 4,035 3,797 Short term and other investments 2,559 1,998 1,510 Total $ 15,299 $ 11,854 $ 10,121 GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY(1) As of December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (In billions) United States $ 11,792 $ 8,962 $ 7,773 Other Americas 698 607 508 Europe/Middle East/Africa 2,163 1,815 1,454 Asia/Pacific 646 470 386 Total $ 15,299 $ 11,854 $ 10,121 (1)Geographic mix is based on the location where the assets are serviced. Management Fees We provide a broad range of investment management strategies, specialized investment management advisory services and other financial services for corporations, public funds, and other sophisticated investors. These services are offered through SSgA. Based upon assets under management, SSgA is the largest manager of institutional assets worldwide, the largest manager of assets for tax exempt organizations (primarily pension plans) in the United States, and the third largest investment manager overall in the world. SSgA offers a broad array of investment management strategies, including passive and active, such as enhanced indexing and hedge fund strategies, using quantitative and fundamental methods for both U.S. and global equities and fixed income securities. SSgA also offers exchange traded funds, or "ETFs," such as the SPDR&reg; Dividend ETFs. The $198 million increase in management fees from 2006 primarily resulted from net new business and higher equity market valuations. Performance fees decreased from $84 million in 2006 to $72 million in 2007. Management fees generated from customers outside the United States were approximately 41% of total management fees, up from 32% for 2006. At year end 2007, assets under management were $1.98 trillion, compared to $1.75 trillion at year end 2006. While certain management fees are directly determined by the value of assets under management and the investment strategy employed, management fees reflect other factors as well, including our relationship pricing for customers who use multiple services, and the benchmarks specified in the respective management agreements related to performance fees. Accordingly, no direct correlation necessarily exists between the value of assets under management, market indices and management fee revenue.

We offer a complete range of foreign exchange services under an account model that focuses on the global requirements of our customers to execute trades and receive market insights in any time zone. In March 2007, we acquired Currenexs electronic foreign exchange trading platform. The Currenex business serves hedge funds, banks and other commercial enterprises in the active trading segment of the foreign exchange market. We have exclusive ownership of FX Connect&reg;, the worlds first foreign exchange trading platform, and we provide quantitatively based research into investor behavior, as well as consultative services that use quantitative tools designed to optimize our 33 customers returns. Foreign exchange trading revenue is influenced by three principal factors: the volume and type of customer foreign exchange transactions; currency volatility; and the management of currency market risks. For 2007, foreign exchange trading revenue increased 31%, to $802 million from $611 million in 2006, and benefited from the disruption in the global securities markets that occurred in the second half of the year. The increase was mainly driven by a 39% increase in customer volumes, but also was the result of the inclusion of $43 million of foreign exchange revenue from the acquired Investors Financial business. These increases were partly offset by an unfavorable transaction mix influenced by lower margin transactions and a 5% decline in currency volatility. We also offer a range of brokerage and other trading products tailored specifically to meet the needs of the global pension community, including transition management, commission recapture and self directed brokerage. These products are differentiated by our position as an agent of the institutional investor. Brokerage and other trading fees were $350 million in 2007, up 39% compared to 2006. The increase was attributable to the contribution of revenue from the acquired Currenex business and an increase in revenue from transition management. Securities Finance Securities finance provides liquidity to the financial markets and an effective means for customers to earn revenue on their existing portfolios. By acting as a lending agent and coordinating loans between lenders and borrowers, we lend securities and provide liquidity to customers around the world. Borrowers provide collateral in the form of cash or securities to State Street in return for loaned securities. For cash collateral, we pay a usage fee to the provider of the cash collateral, and invest the cash collateral in certain investment vehicles. The spread between the yield on the investment vehicle and the usage fee paid to the provider of the collateral is split between the lender of the securities and State Street as agent. For non cash collateral, the borrower pays a fee for the loaned securities, and the fee is split between the lender of the securities and State Street. Securities finance revenue is principally a function of the volume of securities loaned and the interest rate spreads earned on the collateral. For 2007, securities finance revenue increased 76% from a year earlier, as loan volumes increased 30%, with this volume resulting from both new customer demand and increased demand from existing customers. Consolidated spread also increased, primarily in the domestic and non U.S. equity portfolios and the corporate bond and fixed income portfolios. Spreads benefited from reductions in federal funds rates during 2007, as well as from the above mentioned market disruption. Processing Fees and Other Processing fees and other revenue includes diverse types of fees and other revenue, including fees from our structured products business, fees from software licensing and maintenance, profits and losses from unconsolidated subsidiaries, gains and losses on sales of leased equipment and other assets, and amortization of investments in tax advantaged financings. Processing fees and other revenue decreased 13% from 2006, with an additional $32 million of revenue from the acquired Investors Financial business and improved joint venture performance more than offset by reduced revenue from the structured products business, primarily from the asset backed commercial paper program, and the absence of revenue from our tax exempt investment program. The absence of revenue from the tax exempt investment program resulted from the impact of the consolidation of the program onto our balance sheet on September 30, 2006. As a result of this consolidation, revenue from the program, previously recorded in processing fees and other, is now recorded in net interest revenue. 34  NET INTEREST REVENUE Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Average Balance Interest Revenue/ Expense Rate Average Balance Interest Revenue/ Expense Rate Average Balance Interest Revenue/ Expense Rate (Dollars in millions; fully taxable equivalent basis) Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements $ 14,402 $ 756 5.25 % $ 12,820 $ 663 5.17 % $ 12,890 $ 412 3.20 % Investment securities 70,990 3,649 5.14 61,579 2,956 4.80 51,153 1,817 3.55 Loans and leases 10,753 394 3.67 7,670 288 3.75 6,013 193 3.21 Other 8,405 471 5.60 10,596 462 4.36 17,730 550 3.10 Total interest earning assets $ 104,550 $ 5,270 5.04 $ 92,665 $ 4,369 4.72 $ 87,786 $ 2,972 3.39 Deposits $ 68,220 $ 2,298 3.37 % $ 55,635 $ 1,891 3.40 % $ 49,703 $ 1,132 2.28 % Short term borrowings 22,024 959 4.36 25,699 1,145 4.46 26,708 753 2.82 Long term debt 3,402 225 6.62 2,621 178 6.77 2,461 138 5.63 Total interest bearing liabilities $ 93,646 $ 3,482 3.72 $ 83,955 $ 3,214 3.83 $ 78,872 $ 2,023 2.57 Interest rate spread 1.32 % .89 % .82 % Net interest revenue fully taxable equivalent basis(1) $ 1,788 $ 1,155 $ 949 Net interest margin fully taxable equivalent basis 1.71 % 1.25 % 1.08 % Net interest revenue GAAP basis $ 1,730 $ 1,110 $ 907 (1)Amounts include fully taxable equivalent adjustments of $58 million for 2007, $45 million for 2006 and $42 million for 2005. Net interest revenue is defined as the total of interest revenue on interest earning assets less interest expense on interest bearing liabilities. Interest earning assets, which consist of investment securities, loans and leases and money market assets, are financed primarily by customer deposits and short term borrowings. Additional detail about the components of interest revenue and interest expense is in note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. On a fully taxable equivalent basis, net interest revenue increased 55% (56% on a GAAP basis) compared to 2006, and net interest margin increased to 1.71% from 1.25%. This growth was the result of several favorable trends. First, transaction deposit volume, particularly with respect to non U.S. deposits, increased 28%, and spread increased 29%. Volume increases resulted from net new business in non U.S. assets under custody, as we continue to grow our servicing business internationally, and spreads increased because deposit rates lagged rate increases by foreign central banks during 2006 and 2007. Second, the acquired Investors Financial business added interest earning assets and related net interest revenue. Third, as fixed rate investment securities matured, they were replaced by higher yielding investments. Net interest margin represents the relationship between net interest revenue and average interest earning assets. Changes in the components of interest earning assets, as well as interest bearing liabilities, are discussed in more detail below. 35 Average federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements increased 12.3% or $1.58 billion, from $12.82 billion in 2006 to $14.40 billion for 2007. The increase was primarily the result of excess liquidity. Our average investment securities portfolio increased from approximately $61.58 billion to approximately $70.99 billion, primarily due to the acquisition of investment securities of Investors Financial and increases in our tax exempt securities portfolio. The investment portfolio now includes a higher percentage of collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage and asset backed securities compared to a year earlier. These increases did not adversely affect overall risk, as we continued to invest conservatively in "AA" and "AAA" rated securities. Securities rated "AA" and "AAA" comprised approximately 95% of the investment securities portfolio, with approximately 89% "AAA" rated, at December 31, 2007. Loans and leases averaged $10.75 billion, up 40% from $7.67 billion in 2006. The increase was related to higher levels of customer overdraft activity. Approximately 70% of the loans and leases portfolio is composed of U.S. and non U.S. short duration advances, primarily related to the processing of custodied customer investments, which averaged approximately $7.53 billion for 2007, up from $5.21 billion in 2006. The $12.59 billion increase in average interest bearing deposits from 2006 was mainly due to the acquisition of Investors Financial and an increase in low cost customer deposits, primarily non U.S. deposits. This deposit growth funded the $11.89 billion increase in average interest earning assets. Average short term borrowings decreased primarily due to the liquidity provided by the increase in customer deposits, and long term debt increased due to debt issuances associated with the Investors Financial acquisition. Several factors could affect future levels of net interest revenue and margin, including the Federal Reserves ongoing actions to manage short term interest rates, the level and pace of changes in non U.S. interest rates, particularly as a result of actions of the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, the mix of customer liabilities, and the shapes of the various yield curves around the world. Gains (Losses) on Sales of Available for Sale Securities, Net Our management of the investment securities portfolio has many objectives, the foremost of which are to provide liquidity and to serve as a source of collateral for customer activities. These objectives may entail strategic sales of specific securities as market conditions warrant. We recorded net gains of $7 million on sales of available for sale securities for 2007, compared to net gains of $15 million for 2006. At December 31, 2007, approximately 94% of the investment securities portfolio, or $70.33 billion, was classified as available for sale. Additional information about available for sale securities, and the gross gains and losses that comprise the net gains, is in note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. 36 OPERATING EXPENSES Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Change 2006 2007 (Dollars in millions) Salaries and employee benefits $ 3,256 $ 2,652 $ 2,231 23 % Information systems and communications 546 501 486 9 Transaction processing services 619 496 449 25 Occupancy 408 373 391 9 Provision for legal exposure 600 Merger and integration costs 198 Other 806 518 484 56 Total operating expenses $ 6,433 $ 4,540 $ 4,041 42 Number of employees at year end 27,110 21,700 20,965 The 23% increase in salaries and employee benefits from 2006 was driven primarily by the inclusion of approximately $180 million of salaries and benefits expense of the acquired Investors Financial business and salaries and benefits expense of the acquired Currenex business, higher incentive compensation costs due to improved performance which were offset by the reduction of incentive compensation recorded as part of the net pre tax charge related to SSgA discussed later in this section, and the impact of higher staffing levels. Staffing levels increased to support growth in our Investment Servicing business, particularly in Europe, and in our Investment Management business, as well as in information technology and risk management. The increase in information systems and communications expense included approximately $21 million from the acquired Investors Financial business, as well as increased spending internationally to support growth. Transaction processing services expenses are volume related, and include equity trading services and fees related to securities settlement, sub custodian fees and external contract services. The 25% increase included approximately $39 million from the acquired Investors Financial business, specifically sub custody costs, higher transaction volumes, and external contract services, primarily in Europe. Occupancy expense was up 9% from 2006, primarily due to additional leased space acquired as part of the Investors Financial acquisition, as well as higher occupancy costs in support of growth in Europe. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded a net pre tax charge of $467 million in connection with the establishment of a reserve to address litigation exposure and other costs associated with certain active fixed income strategies managed by SSgA and customer concerns as to whether the execution of these strategies was consistent with customers investment intent. The net charge had the following components a provision for legal exposure of $625 million offset by $25 million of insurance coverage; a $156 million reduction of salaries and benefits expense related to reduced incentive compensation primarily associated with SSgA, offset by $15 million of severance costs; and $8 million of other expenses related to professional fees. More information about this litigation exposure is included in note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. During the second half of 2007, in connection with the Investors Financial acquisition, we recorded merger and integration costs of $198 million. These costs consisted only of direct and incremental costs to integrate the acquired Investors Financial business into our operations, and did not include on going expenses of the combined organization. The costs included a non cash charge of approximately $91 million resulting from the termination of an operating lease related to one of our office buildings in Boston. This termination was completed in connection with an overall evaluation of our requirements for office space as a result of the acquisition. 37 The merger and integration costs also included $42 million associated with employee retention and other compensation, and $22 million associated with the integration of the acquired Investors Financial businesss accounting and management systems. In addition, subsequent to the completion of the acquisition, we redeemed an aggregate of $500 million of unsecured junior subordinated debentures issued by the parent company to two of our statutory business trusts, composed of $200 million of 7.94% debentures issued in 1996 and $300 million of 8.035% debentures issued in 1997. We paid the trusts the outstanding amount on the debentures plus accrued interest and an aggregate redemption premium of approximately $20 million, which was included in the merger and integration costs. The 56% increase in other expenses from 2006 primarily resulted from the acquired Investors Financial business, increases in professional services, securities processing costs, higher sales promotion costs and increased amortization of intangibles that resulted from the acquisitions of Investors Financial and Currenex. Income Taxes Income tax expense totaled $642 million for 2007, compared to $675 million from continuing operations a year ago. The decrease was primarily the result of the absence of the impact of federal tax legislation that increased income tax expense for 2006. The overall effective tax rate for 2007 was 33.7%, compared to 38.1% for 2006. Additional information about income tax expense is in note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. The 2006 income tax expense from discontinued operations of $6 million was related to $16 million of income associated with the finalization of certain costs recorded in connection with our divestiture of Bel Air, which was completed during 2006. Information about income tax contingencies related to our leveraged lease portfolio is in note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. LINE OF BUSINESS INFORMATION We report two lines of business: Investment Servicing and Investment Management. Given our services and management organization, the results of operations for these lines of business are not necessarily comparable with those of other companies, including companies in the financial services industry. Information about revenue, expense and capital allocation methodologies is in note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. The following is a summary of line of business results. Results presented exclude the income (loss) from discontinued operations related to our divestiture of Bel Air. The amount presented in the "Other/One Time" column for 2007 represents merger and integration costs recorded in connection with our acquisition of Investors Financial. The amount presented in the same column for 2005 represents additional gain from our sale of the Private Asset Management business. The amount 38 presented in the net charge line items are associated with the underperformance of certain active fixed income strategies managed by SSgA.

Servicing fees increased from 2006 primarily due to the contribution of fees from the acquired Investors Financial business, increases in net new business from existing and new customers, higher equity valuations and higher customer transaction volumes. The increase in trading services revenue reflected a higher dollar volume of foreign exchange trades for customers and a higher volume of fixed income transition management business. Securities finance revenue increased as a result of higher lending volumes and increased spreads. Processing fees and other revenue declined from 2006, primarily as a result of declines in revenue associated with the commercial paper conduits and our 39 tax exempt investment program, the latter of which was consolidated onto our balance sheet in 2006. Revenue from this program is now recorded in net interest revenue. Servicing fees, trading services revenue and net gains (losses) on sales of available for sale securities for our Investment Servicing business line are identical to the respective consolidated results. Refer to the "Servicing Fees," "Trading Services" and "Gains (Losses) on Sales of Available For Sale Securities, Net" captions in the "Total Revenue" section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis for a more in depth discussion. A discussion of processing fees and other revenue is provided under the caption "Processing Fees and Other" in the "Total Revenue" section. Net interest revenue increased 60% from 2006 due to an increase in average interest earning assets, including those from the acquired Investors Financial business, as well as higher yields on our investment securities portfolio A portion of net interest revenue is recorded in the Investment Management business line based on the volume of customer liabilities attributable to that business. Operating expenses increased from 2006, driven primarily by the inclusion of the operating expenses of the acquired Investors Financial business and Currenex, as well as higher incentive compensation costs due to improved performance and the impact of higher staffing levels. Staffing levels increased to support growth in business, particularly in Europe. Transaction processing costs increased due to a higher volume of sub custodian fees, particularly from the acquired Investors Financial business. Other expenses increased as a result of the inclusion of expenses of the acquired Investors Financial business, increases in professional services, securities processing costs and increased amortization of intangibles that resulted from the Investors Financial and Currenex acquisitions. Investment Management Total revenue for 2007 increased 25% from 2006. Management fees for the Investment Management business line, which were up 21%, are identical to the respective consolidated results. Refer to the "Management Fees" caption in the "Total Revenue" section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis for a more in depth discussion. Securities finance revenue for 2007 was up 73% from 2006, reflecting higher lending volumes and increased spreads. Net interest revenue improved due to higher volumes of customer liabilities, primarily resulting from the growth of our non U.S. operations, as well as a more favorable mix of deposits. Operating expenses of $981 million, which do not include the net pre tax charge allocated to Investment Management of $514 million, increased 23% from $798 million in 2006, primarily due to the cost of increases in staffing levels to support growth in business, and related increases in information systems and communications expenses. The net pre tax charge was recorded in connection with the establishment of a reserve to address legal exposure and other costs associated with the under performance of certain active fixed income strategies managed by SSgA and customer concerns as to whether the execution of these strategies was consistent with the customers investment intent. The net charge had the following components a provision for legal exposure of $625 million offset by $25 million of insurance coverage; a $109 million reduction of salaries and benefits expense related to reduced incentive compensation offset by $15 million of severance costs; and $8 million of other expenses related to professional fees. More information about this charge is included in the "Consolidated Results of Operations Operating Expenses" section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. The pre tax margin for Investment Management, which is the percentage of the business lines pre tax income to its total revenue, was 3% for 2007 compared to 35% for 2006 and 31% for 2005. The significant decrease in margin was the result of the net charge described above. Without the net charge, Investment Managements pre tax income would have been $555 million ($41 million plus $514 million), and its pre tax margin would have been 36% for 2007. 40 During the second half of 2007, the global markets for fixed income securities, particularly the markets for financial instruments collateralized by sub prime mortgages, experienced significant disruption. This disruption affected the liquidity and pricing of securities traded in these markets, as well as the returns of, and levels of redemptions in, investment vehicles investing in those instruments. Additional information about the impact of these market conditions on the asset backed commercial paper conduits administered by State Street is provided in the "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements" section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis and in the Risk Factors section included under Item 1A of this Form 10 K. As of December 31, 2007, global fixed income assets under management totaled approximately $259 billion, an increase of approximately $45 billion compared to $214 billion at December 31, 2006, with approximately $43 billion under active management. This amount included approximately $6.1 billion of SSgA customer assets which were invested in strategies that were adversely affected by a combination of holdings in financial instruments collateralized by sub prime mortgages, illiquidity in the fixed income markets generally, and customer redemptions. These strategies included approximately $2.2 billion of institutional customer investments in non registered pooled investment funds; approximately $2.1 billion of unit investments by other SSgA investment funds in the same non registered pooled investment funds; approximately $1.6 billion of institutional customer investments in separately managed customer accounts; and approximately $0.2 billion of customer investments in mutual funds. Information about recent proceedings, legal exposure and related costs and other similar matters associated with SSgAs active fixed income strategies, including the establishment of a reserve of approximately $625 million, is included in "Risk Factors Litigation Risks" included under Item 1A; the "Consolidated Results of Operations Operating Expenses" section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis; and note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. 41 COMPARISON OF 2006 AND 2005 OVERVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Years ended December 31, 2006 2005 $ Change % Change (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Total fee revenue $ 5,186 $ 4,551 $ 635 14 % Net interest revenue 1,110 907 203 22 Provision for loan losses Gains (Losses) on sales of available for sale investment securities, net 15 (1 ) 16 Gain on sale of divested business 16 (16 ) Total revenue 6,311 5,473 838 15 Total operating expenses 4,540 4,041 499 12 Income from continuing operations before income tax expense 1,771 1,432 339 24 Income tax expense from continuing operations 675 487 188 39 Income from continuing operations 1,096 945 151 16 Income (Loss) from discontinued operations 10 (107 ) 117 Net income $ 1,106 $ 838 $ 268 32 Earnings per share from continuing operations: Basic $ 3.31 $ 2.86 $ .45 16 Diluted 3.26 2.82 .44 16 Earnings per share: Basic $ 3.34 $ 2.53 Diluted 3.29 2.50 Return on shareholders equity from continuing operations 16.2 % 15.3 % Return on shareholders equity 16.4 % 13.6 % The income from discontinued operations in 2006 of $10 million, or $.03 per share, resulted from the finalization of legal, selling and other costs recorded in connection with our divestiture of Bel Air. The loss in 2005 of $107 million, or $.32 per share, was the result of our agreement to divest Bel Air. 42 TOTAL REVENUE Years ended December 31, 2006 2005 $ Change % Change (Dollars in millions) Fee revenue: Servicing fees $ 2,723 $ 2,474 $ 249 10 % Management fees 943 751 192 26 Trading services 862 694 168 24 Securities finance 386 330 56 17 Processing fees and other 272 302 (30 ) (10 ) Total fee revenue 5,186 4,551 635 14 Net interest revenue: Interest revenue 4,324 2,930 1,394 48 Interest expense 3,214 2,023 1,191 59 Net interest revenue 1,110 907 203 22 Provision for loan losses Net interest revenue after provision for loan losses 1,110 907 203 22 Gains (Losses) on sales of available for sale investment securities, net 15 (1 ) 16 Gain on sale of Private Asset Management business 16 (16 ) Total revenue $ 6,311 $ 5,473 $ 838 15 The increase in total revenue for 2006 compared to 2005 primarily reflected growth in fee revenue, which mainly reflected growth in servicing and management fees, with almost 70% of the overall growth in fee revenue generated from these two services. The increase in servicing fees was the result of new business from existing and new customers, and higher equity market valuations. Our business continued to grow outside the U.S., with approximately 44% of our servicing fees derived from non U.S. customers, up from 40% in 2005. Assets under custody increased to $11.85 trillion at December 31, 2006, up 17% from $10.12 trillion a year earlier. The increase in management fees reflected net new business and higher average month end equity market valuations. Approximately 32% of management fees were derived from customers outside the U.S. in 2006, up from 30% for 2005. Assets under management increased to $1.75 trillion at December 31, 2006, up $308 billion from $1.44 trillion a year earlier. The growth in trading services revenue, which includes foreign exchange trading and brokerage and other trading revenue, reflected an increase in foreign exchange trading revenue of $143 million, primarily due to increased transaction volumes, a favorable transaction mix related to custody foreign exchange services, and an increase in foreign exchange trading profits. Brokerage and other fees increased from $251 million in 2006, up 11% compared to 2005 due to a significant increase in other trading services and trading profits, offset by a slight decrease in brokerage revenue, the result of a decline in commission recapture revenue. The increase in securities finance revenue reflected the effect of improved interest rate spreads and a 22% increase in securities lending volumes. The decline in processing fees and other revenue reflected a decrease of $30 million in payments made by Deutsche Bank AG in consideration of net interest revenue earned from acquired customer deposits, largely offset by an increase in revenue from our structured products business. The deposits were held by Deutsche Bank until customers and their related deposits were converted to our systems. Net gains on sales of available for sale securities of $15 million in 2006 compared to net losses of $1 million in 2005. The increase in net interest revenue reflected an increase in the size of our average balance sheet and the impact of investment securities portfolio repositioning and increasing the average size of the portfolio. 43  OPERATING EXPENSES Years ended December 31, 2006 2005 $ Change % Change (Dollars in millions) Salaries and employee benefits $ 2,652 $ 2,231 $ 421 19 % Information systems and communications 501 486 15 3 Transaction processing services 496 449 47 10 Occupancy 373 391 (18 ) (5 ) Other 518 484 34 7 Total operating expenses $ 4,540 $ 4,041 $ 499 12 The increase in operating expenses from 2005 reflected higher expenses for salaries and employee benefits, information systems and communications, transaction processing and other expenses, somewhat offset by a decline in occupancy. The increase in salaries and employee benefits was driven by higher incentive compensation costs due to improved performance, the impact of higher staffing levels associated with the growth of the Investment Servicing business in Europe, annual merit increases and planned benefit increases. Information systems and communications expense slightly increased due to higher telecommunications costs and third party software expenditures to support overseas growth. Transaction processing services expenses, which in large part are volume related, include equity trading services and fees related to securities settlement, sub custodian fees and external contract services. The increase resulted from a higher transaction volumes, as well as expansion of our operations in Europe. Occupancy expense decreased primarily due to the absence of the $26 million charge recorded in 2005 related to a long term sub lease agreement for space in our headquarters building, offset by a slight increase in energy and other utility costs. The increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to increased costs to support growth initiatives, offset by a decline in professional services fees related to information technology and the restructuring of our Global Treasury function, which occurred in 2005. Income Taxes The increase in income tax expense from continuing operations for 2006 compared to 2005 resulted from increased pre tax earnings, as well as additional income tax expense recorded in 2006 primarily related to federal tax legislation and certain leveraged leases. The effective tax rate for continuing operations for 2006 was 38.1%. Our effective rate for 2005 was 34%. The 2005 income tax benefit from discontinued operations of $58 million was related to the loss of $165 million recorded in connection with our agreement to divest Bel Air in 2005. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. The majority of these accounting policies do not involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates in their application, or the variability of the estimates is not material to the consolidated financial statements. However, certain of these accounting policies, by their nature, require management to make judgments, involving significant estimates and assumptions, about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements, and changes in this information over time could 44 materially impact amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported in subsequent financial statements. Based on the sensitivity of reported financial statement amounts to the underlying policies, estimates and assumptions, the relatively more significant accounting policies applied by State Street have been identified by management as accounting for fair value of financial instruments; accounting for special purpose entities; accounting for goodwill; and accounting for income taxes. These policies require the most subjective or complex judgments, and related estimates and assumptions could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. An understanding of the judgments, estimates and assumptions underlying these accounting policies is essential in order to understand our reported consolidated financial condition and results of operations. The following is a brief discussion of the above mentioned significant accounting policies. Management of State Street has discussed these significant accounting estimates with the Examining and Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Fair Value of Financial Instruments We carry certain of our assets and liabilities at fair value in our consolidated financial statements, including trading assets, investment securities available for sale and derivative instruments. At December 31, 2007, approximately $75.43 billion of our assets and approximately $4.57 billion of our liabilities were carried at fair value. The fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices and observable market inputs. For a significant amount of our assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value, those fair values are determined based upon quotations provided by independent third party pricing services or observable market inputs, and as a result there is little or no management judgment involved in determining fair value. Prices provided by independent third party pricing services are subject to review by management. In developing their quotations, the independent pricing services seek to utilize observable inputs, including trade and market information. However, because many fixed income securities do not trade regularly, the pricing services quotations may also be based on proprietary financial models that incorporate available information, such as benchmarking to similar securities, sector groupings or matrix pricing. Quotations may not always be available for some securities or in markets where trading activity has slowed or ceased. When quotations are not available, and are not provided by third party pricing services, management judgment is necessary to determine fair value. In situations involving management judgment, fair value is determined using discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models, which incorporate available market information, including appropriate benchmarking to similar instruments, analysis of default and recovery rates, estimation of prepayment characteristics and implied volatilities. Discounted cash flow analysis is dependent upon estimated future cash flows and the level of interest rates. Expected cash flows are discounted using market interest rates commensurate with the credit quality and duration of the investment. Valuation models use as their basis independently sourced market inputs including, for example, interest rate yield curves and foreign currency exchange rates. Our valuation process using models considers factors such as credit quality, product structure, third party enhancements and guarantees. We apply judgment in the application of these factors. Other factors can affect our estimates of fair value, including market dislocations, incorrect model assumptions and unexpected correlations. These valuation methods could expose us to materially different results should the models used or underlying assumptions be inaccurate. We determine fair value for trading account assets primarily by using quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments in active markets for those securities. Fair value for investment 45 securities available for sale is determined using quotations from independent third party pricing services, which generally are based on observable market inputs for identical or similar instruments in active and non active markets for those securities. We value derivative instruments primarily by using valuation models. These models generally do not involve material subjectivity because the methodologies used do not necessitate significant judgment, and the pricing inputs are observed from actively quoted markets, for instance with over the counter interest rate swap and option contracts, and foreign exchange forward and option contracts. Management reviews the fair value of the portfolio at least quarterly, and evaluates individual securities for declines in fair value that may be other than temporary. This review considers factors such as current and expected future interest rates, external credit ratings, dividend payments, the financial health of the issuer and other pertinent information. Other pertinent information includes current developments with respect to the issuer, the length of time the cost basis has exceeded the fair value, the severity of the impairment measured as the ratio of fair value to amortized cost and managements intent and ability to hold the security. The review includes all investment securities for which we have issuer specific concerns regardless of quantitative factors. The review considers current economic conditions, adverse situations that might affect our ability to fully collect interest and principal, the timing of future payments, the credit quality and performance of underlying collateral and guarantees and other relevant factors. If declines are deemed other than temporary, an impairment loss is recognized and the amortized cost basis of the investment security is written down to its current fair value, which becomes the new cost basis. Additional information about fair values of financial instruments and fair value estimates is included in note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Special Purpose Entities In the normal course of business, we utilize three types of special purpose entities, referred to as "SPEs," two of which are not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Information about the activities of these SPEs, which are used in connection with our tax exempt investment program, our involvement with managed investment vehicles and our asset backed commercial paper program, is in notes 10 and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. Additional information about SPEs used in connection with our commercial paper program is provided below. In our role as a financial intermediary, we administer four third party asset backed commercial paper conduits, which are structured as bankruptcy remote, limited liability companies, and which are not included in our consolidated financial statements. These conduits purchase a variety of financial assets from third party financial institutions, and fund these purchases by issuing commercial paper. The financial assets purchased by the conduits are not originated by us, and we do not hold any equity ownership interest in the conduits. Additional information about the conduits and their business activities is in the "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements" section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis and in note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Our accounting for the conduits activities, and our conclusion that we are not required to include each or all of the conduits assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements, is based on our application of the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), which governs our accounting for the conduits and which is discussed in more detail in note 11. Expected losses, which we estimate using a financial model as described below, form the basis for our application of the provisions of FIN 46(R). Expected losses, as defined by FIN 46(R), are not economic losses. Instead, expected losses are calculated by comparing projected possible cash flows, which are probability weighted, with expected cash flows for the risk(s) the entity was designed to create and distribute; they represent the variability 46 in potential cash flows of the entitys designated risks. We believe that credit risk is the predominant risk that is designed to be created and distributed by these entities. There is also a modest amount of basis risk within each conduit. Basis risk arises when commercial paper funding costs move at a different rate than the comparable floating rate asset benchmark rates (generally LIBOR). This risk is mitigated through the use of derivative instruments, principally basis swaps, which remove this variability from each conduit. Accordingly, basis risk is not a significant assumption in the financial model. Any credit losses of the conduits would be absorbed by (1) investors in the subordinated debt, commonly referred to as "first loss notes," issued by the conduits; (2) State Street; and (3) the holders of the conduits commercial paper, in order of priority. The investors in the first loss notes, which are independent third parties, would absorb the first dollar of any credit loss on the conduits assets. If credit losses exceeded the first loss notes, we would absorb credit losses through our credit facilities provided to the conduits. The commercial paper holders would absorb credit losses after the first loss notes and State Streets credit facilities have been exhausted. We have developed a financial model to estimate and allocate each conduits expected losses. Our model has determined that, as of December 31, 2007, the amount of first loss notes of each conduit held by the third party investors causes them to absorb a majority of each conduits expected losses, as defined by FIN 46(R), and, accordingly, the investors in the first loss notes are considered to be the primary beneficiary of the conduits. The aggregate amount of first loss notes issued by the conduits totaled approximately $32 million as of December 31, 2007. In order to estimate expected losses as required by FIN 46(R), we estimate possible defaults of the conduits assets. These expected losses are allocated to the conduits variable interest holders based on the order in which actual losses would be absorbed, as described above. We use the model to estimate expected losses based on hundreds of thousands of probability weighted loss scenarios. These simulations incorporate published rating agency data to estimate expected losses due to credit risk. Primary assumptions incorporated into the financial model relative to credit risk variability, such as default probabilities and loss severities, are directly linked to the conduits underlying assets. These default probabilities and loss severity assumptions vary by asset class and ratings of individual conduit assets. Accordingly, the models calculation of expected losses is significantly affected by the credit ratings and asset mix of each conduits assets. These statistics are reviewed by management regularly and more formally on an annual basis. If downgrades and asset mix change significantly, or if defaults occur on the conduits underlying assets, we may conclude that the current level of first loss notes is insufficient to absorb a majority of the conduits expected losses. We perform stress tests and sensitivity analyses, with respect to each conduit individually, in order to model potential scenarios that could cause the amount of first loss notes to be insufficient to absorb the majority of the conduits expected losses. As part of these analyses, we have identified certain conduit assets that could be more susceptible to credit downgrade because of their underlying credit characteristics. Our scenario testing specifically addresses asset classes that have experienced significant price erosion and or have little observed market activity. Examples of scenarios that are designed to measure the sensitivity of the sufficiency of the first loss notes include performing a downgrade of all assets which have underlying monoline insurance provider support, and a downgrade scenario on certain other conduit securities where our analysis of the timing and amount of expected cash flows for selected security default expectations does not re affirm the securitys current external credit rating. These simulations do not include a scenario whereby all positions are simultaneously downgraded, the possibility of which we consider remote. In addition, a scenario could arise where one or more defaults could be so severe that the associated losses would exhaust the conduits total first loss notes currently outstanding. We believe that the current level of first loss notes of approximately $32 million as of December 31, 2007 is sufficient to support default scenarios that we believe are more likely, including the stress tests previously described. However, in the future, if the determination and allocation of 47 conduit expected losses by the financial model indicates that the current level of first loss notes is insufficient to absorb a majority of the conduits expected losses, we would be required to either (1) issue additional first loss notes to third parties; (2) change the composition of conduit assets; or (3) take other actions in order to avoid being determined to be the primary beneficiary of the conduits. If we were unable to accomplish any of the above, we would be determined to be the primary beneficiary of the conduits, and would be required to consolidate the conduits assets and liabilities. For illustrative purposes only, if consolidation of all four of the conduits had been required on December 31, 2007, we would have recognized an extraordinary after tax loss of approximately $530 million in our consolidated statement of income. In addition, the consolidation of the conduits assets would have had a direct impact on our leverage capital ratios. The illustrative impact of consolidation of the conduits and the assumptions underlying its calculation are discussed in the "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements" section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. The conduits do not regularly trade their assets. That is, the design of the conduits is such that conduit assets are purchased with the intent to hold to them to their maturities. Accordingly, changes in the fair values of the conduits assets do not impact the day to day management of the conduits. However, we closely monitor changes in fair values of the conduits assets to ensure that the default assumptions in our financial model continue to be appropriate. As of December 31, 2007, total assets in the unconsolidated conduits were approximately $28.76 billion, and the pre tax unrealized loss on those assets was approximately $850 million, or $530 million after tax. We believe the fair values of the conduits assets are impacted by a number of factors, including the lack of liquidity of mortgage and asset backed securities, supply and demand imbalance in the market, and a risk aversion premium being demanded by investors for certain asset types. We do not believe that the current fair values of some of the conduits assets are necessarily indicative of a change in marketplace participants view of the default probabilities for these assets. Goodwill Goodwill is created when the purchase price exceeds the assigned value of net assets of acquired businesses, and represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements being acquired. Almost all of our goodwill has resulted from business acquisitions of our Investment Servicing line of business. As a result, substantially all of the total goodwill recorded in our consolidated statement of condition was recorded by this business line, with the remainder recorded by Investment Management. The sustained value of the majority of this goodwill is supported ultimately by revenue from our investment servicing business. A decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth, or our inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods, could lead to a perceived impairment of goodwill, which would be evaluated and, if necessary, be recorded as a write down of the reported amount of goodwill through a charge to earnings in our consolidated statement of income. On an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances dictate, management reviews goodwill and evaluates events or other developments that may indicate impairment in the carrying amount. We perform this evaluation at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our two major business lines. The evaluation methodology for potential impairment is inherently complex and involves significant management judgment in the use of estimates and assumptions. We evaluate impairment using a two step process. First, we compare the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, no impairment exists. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, then we compare the "implied" fair value of the reporting units goodwill with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, then goodwill impairment is recognized by writing the goodwill down to the implied fair value. The implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, as if the unit had been acquired in a business combination and the overall fair value of the unit was the purchase price. 48  To determine the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit being evaluated for goodwill impairment, we use one of two principal methodologies external or independent valuation, using quoted market prices in active markets; or an analysis of comparable recent external sales or market data, such as multiples of earnings or similar performance measures. In limited circumstances, these methodologies are not available, and as such, we estimate future cash flows using present value techniques. Events that may indicate goodwill impairment include significant or adverse changes in the business, economic or political climate; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; unanticipated competition; and a more likely than not expectation that we will sell or otherwise dispose of a business to which the goodwill relates. Our goodwill impairment testing for 2007 indicated that none of our goodwill was impaired. Goodwill recorded in our consolidated statement of condition at December 31, 2007 totaled approximately $4.57 billion. Additional information about goodwill, including information by line of business, is in note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Income Taxes Our overall tax position is fundamentally complex, and management judgment is involved in the analysis of income tax assets and liabilities. We are subject to the income tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws can be subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the taxing authorities. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be adjudicated by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or administrative appeal. Managements determination of the likelihood that deferred tax assets can be realized is subjective and involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. The realization of deferred tax assets arises from future taxable income, including foreign source income, and the achievement of tax planning strategies. Underlying estimates and assumptions can change over time, influencing our overall tax positions, as a result of unanticipated events or circumstances. Management continually monitors and evaluates the worldwide impact of tax legislation, decisions, rulings and other current developments on the estimates and assumptions underlying our calculations of current and deferred taxes and our analysis of the expected realization of deferred tax assets. Additional information about income taxes is in notes 10 and 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. 49 FINANCIAL CONDITION Years ended December 31, 2007 Average Balance 2006 Average Balance (In millions) Assets: Interest bearing deposits with banks $ 7,433 $ 9,621 Securities purchased under resale agreements 12,466 12,543 Federal funds sold 1,936 277 Trading account assets 972 975 Investment securities 70,990 61,579 Loans 10,753 7,670 Total interest earning assets 104,550 92,665 Cash and due from banks 3,272 2,977 Other assets 15,660 10,802 Total assets $ 123,482 $ 106,444 Liabilities and shareholders equity: Interest bearing deposits: U.S. $ 7,557 $ 2,453 Non U.S. 60,663 53,182 Total interest bearing deposits 68,220 55,635 Securities sold under repurchase agreements 16,132 20,883 Federal funds purchased 1,667 2,777 Other short term borrowings 4,225 2,039 Long term debt 3,402 2,621 Total interest bearing liabilities 93,646 83,955 Noninterest bearing deposits 10,640 8,274 Other liabilities 9,769 7,471 Shareholders equity 9,427 6,744 Total liabilities and shareholders equity $ 123,482 $ 106,444 Overview of Consolidated Statement of Condition The structure of our consolidated statement of condition, or balance sheet, is primarily driven by the liabilities generated by our core Investment Servicing and Investment Management businesses. As our customers execute their worldwide cash management and investment activities, they use short term investments and deposits that constitute the majority of our liabilities. These liabilities are generally in the form of non interest bearing demand deposits; interest bearing transaction account deposits, which are denominated in a variety of currencies; and repurchase agreements, which generally serve as short term investment alternatives for our customers. Our customers needs and our operating objectives determine the volume, mix and currency denomination of our consolidated balance sheet. Deposits and other liabilities generated by customer activities are invested in assets that generally match the liquidity and interest rate characteristics of the liabilities. As a result, our assets consist primarily of high quality, marketable securities held in our available for sale or held to maturity investment securities portfolio and short term money market instruments, such as interest bearing deposits, federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements. The actual mix of assets is determined by the characteristics of the customer liabilities and our desire to maintain a well diversified portfolio of high quality assets. Managing our consolidated 50 balance sheet structure is a disciplined process conducted within specific Board approved policies for interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity. For 2007, the growth in average interest bearing liabilities of $9.7 billion was primarily composed of a $12.6 billion increase in customer deposits, $7.5 billion of which were foreign, offset by a decline in repurchase agreements of $4.8 billion. These changes are representative of the higher levels of customer activity outside the U.S. Average interest earning assets in 2007 increased $11.9 billion from 2006, consistent with the increased level of customer liabilities. Additional information about our average balance sheet, primarily interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, is included in the "Consolidated Results of Operations Net Interest Revenue" section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. Investment Securities The carrying values of investment securities were as follows as of December 31: (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Available for sale: U.S. Treasury and federal agencies: Direct obligations $ 8,181 $ 7,612 $ 10,214 Mortgage backed securities 14,585 11,454 11,138 Asset backed securities 25,069 25,634 23,842 Collateralized mortgage obligations 11,892 8,476 5,527 State and political subdivisions 5,813 3,749 1,868 Other debt investments 4,041 3,027 1,695 Money market mutual funds 243 201 232 Other equity securities 502 292 463 Total $ 70,326 $ 60,445 $ 54,979 Held to maturity: U.S. Treasury and federal agencies: Direct obligations $ 757 $ 846 $ 1,657 Mortgage backed securities 940 1,084 925 Collateralized mortgage obligations 2,190 2,357 2,086 Other investments 346 260 223 Total $ 4,233 $ 4,547 $ 4,891 We consider a well diversified, high credit quality investment securities portfolio to be an important element in the management of our consolidated balance sheet. The portfolio continues to be concentrated in securities with high credit quality, with approximately 95% of the carrying value of the 51 portfolio "AAA" or "AA" rated. The percentages of the carrying value of the investment securities portfolio by external credit rating were as follows as of December 31: 2007 2006 AAA(1) 89 % 88 % AA 6 6 A 3 4 BBB 1 1 Non rated 1 1 100 % 100 % (1)Includes U.S. Treasury securities. The investment securities portfolio is also diversified with respect to asset class. The majority of the portfolio is in high grade mortgage backed and asset backed securities. The largely floating rate asset backed portfolio consists of home equity loan, credit card, auto and student loan securities. Mortgage backed securities are split between securities of Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and large issuer collateralized mortgage obligations. As of December 31, 2007, the asset backed securities in the portfolio included $6.2 billion collateralized by sub prime mortgages. Of this total, 71% were AAA rated and 29% were AA rated. We had $1.105 billion of net pre tax unrealized losses on available for sale investment securities at December 31, 2007, or $678 million after tax. Net pre tax unrealized losses on available for sale securities at December 31, 2006 were $378 million, or $227 million after tax. Management considers the aggregate decline in fair value and the resulting net unrealized losses to be temporary and not the result of any material changes in the credit characteristics of the investment securities portfolio. Management has the ability and the intent to hold the securities until recovery in market value. We intend to continue managing our investment securities portfolio to align with interest rate and duration characteristics of our customer liabilities and in the context of our overall balance sheet structure, which is maintained within internally approved risk limits, and in consideration of the global interest rate environment. Even with material changes in unrealized losses on available for sale securities, we may not experience material changes in our interest rate risk profile, or experience a material impact on our net interest revenue. Additional information about these and other unrealized losses is in notes 3 and 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. 52 The carrying amounts, by contractual maturity, of debt securities available for sale and held to maturity, and the related weighted average contractual yields, were as follows as of December 31, 2007: Under 1 Year 1 to 5 Years 6 to 10 Years Over 10 Years (Dollars in millions) Amount Yield Amount Yield Amount Yield Amount Yield Available for sale(2): U.S. Treasury and federal agencies: Direct obligations $ 5,683 4.43 % $ 1,072 3.91 % $ 520 6.27 % $ 906 7.63 % Mortgage backed securities 116 4.16 1,384 4.31 4,152 4.90 8,933 5.18 Asset backed securities 1,304 4.68 11,321 5.13 8,223 5.21 4,221 5.21 Collateralized mortgage obligations 170 4.90 3,156 5.07 3,617 5.48 4,949 5.45 State and political subdivisions(1) 370 5.94 1,997 5.74 1,644 5.60 1,802 5.41 Other investments 1,686 6.46 1,405 5.48 906 5.33 44 5.61 Total $ 9,329 $ 20,335 $ 19,062 $ 20,855 Held to maturity(2): U.S. Treasury and federal agencies: Direct obligations $ 256 3.89 % $ 501 4.38 % Mortgage backed securities 30 3.95 $ 329 4.85 % $ 581 5.35 % Collateralized mortgage obligations 725 4.94 970 5.03 495 5.03 Other investments 163 1.99 119 5.81 61 6.02 3 7.16 Total $ 419 $ 1,375 $ 1,360 $ 1,079 (1)Yields have been calculated on a fully taxable equivalent basis, using applicable federal and state income tax rates. (2)The maturities of mortgage backed securities, asset backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are based upon expected principal payments. Loans and Lease Financing U.S. and non U.S. loans and lease financing as of December 31, and average loans and lease financing, were as follows for the years ended December 31: (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 U.S.: Commercial and financial $ 9,402 $ 3,480 $ 2,298 $ 1,826 $ 2,344 Lease financing 396 415 404 373 395 Total U.S. 9,798 3,895 2,702 2,199 2,739 Non U.S.: Commercial and financial 4,420 3,137 1,854 526 424 Lease financing 1,584 1,914 1,926 1,904 1,858 Total non U.S. 6,004 5,051 3,780 2,430 2,282 Total loans $ 15,802 $ 8,946 $ 6,482 $ 4,629 $ 5,021 Average loans and lease financing $ 10,753 $ 7,670 $ 6,013 $ 5,689 $ 5,568 At December 31, 2007, approximately 11% of our consolidated total assets consisted of loans and lease financing. The aggregate increase in loans from 2006 reflected an increase in overdrafts, which result primarily from securities settlement activities of our customers. Overdrafts included in loans were $11.65 billion and $5.69 billion at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. Average 53 overdrafts were approximately $7.53 billion and $5.21 billion for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. These balances do not represent significant credit risk because of their short term nature, which is generally overnight, the lack of significant concentration, and their occurrence in the normal course of the cash and securities settlement process. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, unearned income included in lease financing was $1.29 billion and $1.01 billion for non U.S. leases, respectively, and $212 million and $129 million for U.S. leases, respectively. Maturities for loan and lease financing categories were as follows as of December 31, 2007: YEARS (In millions) Total Under 1 1 to 5 Over 5 U.S.: Commercial and financial $ 9,402 $ 9,372 $ 10 $ 20 Lease financing 396 8 388 Total U.S. 9,798 9,380 10 408 Non U.S.: Commercial and financial 4,420 4,419 1 Lease financing 1,584 53 1,531 Total non U.S. 6,004 4,419 54 1,531 Total $ 15,802 $ 13,799 $ 64 $ 1,939 The following table presents the classification of loans and leases due after one year according to sensitivity to changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2007: (In millions) Loans and leases with predetermined interest rates $ 1,973 Loans and leases with floating or adjustable interest rates 30 Total $ 2,003 Cross Border Outstandings Cross border outstandings, as defined by bank regulatory rules, are amounts payable to State Street by residents of foreign countries, regardless of the currency in which the claim is denominated, and local country claims in excess of local country obligations. These cross border outstandings consist primarily of deposits with banks, loans and lease financing and investment securities. In addition to credit risk, cross border outstandings have the risk that, as a result of political or economic conditions in a country, borrowers may be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations of principal and or interest when due because of the unavailability of, or restrictions on, foreign exchange needed by borrowers to repay their obligations. 54 Cross border outstandings to countries in which we do business which amounted to at least 1% of our consolidated total assets were as follows as of December 31: (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 United Kingdom $ 5,951 $ 5,531 $ 2,696 Canada 4,565 1,463 Australia 3,567 1,519 1,441 Netherlands 992 Germany 2,944 2,696 4,217 Total cross border outstandings $ 17,027 $ 9,746 $ 10,809 The total cross border outstandings presented in the table represented 12%, 9% and 11% of our consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. There were no cross border outstandings to countries which totaled between .75% and 1% of our consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2007. Aggregate cross border outstandings to countries which totaled between .75% and 1% of our consolidated total assets at December 31, 2006, amounted to $1.05 billion (Canada) and at December 31, 2005, amounted to $1.86 billion (Belgium and Japan). Capital Regulatory and economic capital management both use key metrics evaluated by management to ensure that our actual level of capital is commensurate with our risk profile, is in compliance with all regulatory requirements, and is sufficient to provide us with the financial flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives. Regulatory Capital Our objective with respect to regulatory capital management is to maintain a strong capital base in order to provide financial flexibility for our business needs, including funding corporate growth and supporting customers cash management needs, and to provide protection against loss to depositors and creditors. We strive to maintain an optimal level of capital, commensurate with our risk profile, on which an attractive return to shareholders will be realized over both the short and long term, while protecting our obligations to depositors and creditors and satisfying regulatory requirements. Our capital management process focuses on our risk exposures, our capital position relative to our peers, regulatory capital requirements and the evaluations of the major independent credit rating agencies that assign ratings to our public debt. The Capital Committee, working in conjunction with the Asset and Liability Committee, referred to as "ALCO," oversees the management of regulatory capital, and is responsible for ensuring capital adequacy with respect to regulatory requirements, internal targets and the expectations of the major independent credit rating agencies. The primary regulator of both State Street and State Street Bank for regulatory capital purposes is the Federal Reserve Board. Both State Street and State Street Bank are subject to the minimum capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve Board and defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991. State Street Bank must meet the regulatory capital thresholds for "well capitalized" in order for the parent company to maintain its status as a financial holding company. 55 Regulatory capital ratios and related regulatory guidelines for State Street and State Street Bank were as follows as of December 31: REGULATORY GUIDELINES STATE STREET STATE STREET BANK Minimum Well Capitalized 2007 2006 2007 2006 Regulatory capital ratios: Tier 1 risk based capital 4 % 6 % 11.2 % 13.7 % 11.2 % 12.0 % Total risk based capital 8 10 12.7 15.9 12.7 14.1 Tier 1 leverage ratio(1) 4 5 5.3 5.8 5.5 5.6 (1)Regulatory guideline for well capitalized applies only to State Street Bank. At December 31, 2007, State Streets and State Street Banks regulatory capital ratios decreased compared to year end 2006. Growth in capital from earnings and the issuance of our common stock to acquire Investors Financial were offset by the repurchase of our common stock under the accelerated share repurchase program and the impact of goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in connection with the Currenex and Investors Financial acquisitions. Total risk weighted assets increased year over year, as balance sheet risk weighted assets, partly from the Investors Financial acquisition, and off balance sheet equivalent risk weighted assets both grew from year end 2006. All ratios for State Street and State Street Bank exceeded the regulatory minimum and well capitalized thresholds. To manage fluctuations in the tier 1 and total risk based capital of State Street and State Street Bank resulting from foreign currency translation, we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of our net foreign investment in non U.S. subsidiaries. The notional value of these contracts was &euro;100 million, or approximately $146 million, at December 31, 2007. In 2004, the Committee on Banking Supervision released the final version of its capital adequacy framework, commonly referred to as "Basel II". In 2006, the four U.S. banking regulatory agencies jointly issued their second draft of implementation rules, with industry comment provided by the end of March 2007. Additional supervisory guidance from the agencies was released late in February 2007; comments to the agencies were provided by the end of May 2007, and the final rules were released on December 7, 2007, with a stated effective date of April 1, 2008. State Street previously established a comprehensive implementation program to ensure these regulatory requirements are met within prescribed timeframes. We anticipate adopting the most advanced approaches for assessing capital adequacy. In March 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 15 million shares of common stock for general corporate purposes, including mitigating the dilutive impact of shares issued under employee benefit plans, in addition to its previous authorization in 2006 of up to 15 million shares, of which 12.2 million shares remained available for purchase at December 31, 2006. We generally employ third party broker dealers to acquire shares on the open market in connection with our stock purchase program. Under the above described authorization, during 2007 we repurchased 13.4 million shares of our common stock, and an additional .6 million shares in January 2008, in connection with a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program that concluded on January 18, 2008. As of that date, approximately 13.2 million shares remain available for future purchase under the combined authorization described above. We have increased our quarterly dividend twice each year since 1978. Over the last ten years, dividends per share have grown at a 15% compound annual growth rate. Funds for cash distributions to our shareholders by the parent company are derived from a variety of sources. The level of dividends 56 to shareholders on our common stock, which totaled $320 million in 2007, is reviewed regularly and determined by the Board of Directors considering our liquidity, capital adequacy and recent earnings history and prospects, as well as economic conditions and other factors deemed relevant. Federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid by subsidiary banks to the parent holding company. In addition, bank regulators have the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends if they deem such payment to be an unsafe or unsound practice. Information concerning limitations on dividends from our subsidiary banks is in note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. Economic Capital We define economic capital as the common equity required to protect debt holders against unexpected economic losses over a one year period at a level consistent with the solvency of a firm with our target "AA" debt rating. Our entire economic capital process is the responsibility of our Capital Committee. The framework and methodologies used to quantify economic capital for each of the risk types described below have been developed by our Enterprise Risk Management, Global Treasury and Finance groups, and are designed to be generally consistent with our risk management principles. This framework has been approved by senior management and has been reviewed by the Executive Committee of the Board. Due to the evolving nature of quantification techniques, we expect to periodically refine the methodologies used to estimate our economic capital requirements, which could result in a different amount of capital needed to support our risk profile. We quantify capital requirements for the risks inherent in our business activities and group them into one of the following broadly defined categories: Market risk: the risk of adverse financial impact due to fluctuations in market prices, primarily as they relate to our trading activities Interest rate risk: the risk of loss in non trading asset and liability management positions, primarily the impact of adverse movements in interest rates on the repricing mismatches that exist between balance sheet assets and liabilities Credit risk: the risk of loss that may result from the default or downgrade of a borrower or counterparty Operational risk: the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events Business risk: the risk of adverse changes in our earnings from business factors, including changes in the competitive environment, changes in the operational economics of business activities, and the effect of strategic and reputation risks Economic capital for each of these five categories is estimated on a stand alone basis using statistical modeling techniques applied to internally generated and, in some cases, external data. These individual results are then aggregated at the State Street consolidated level. A capital reduction or diversification benefit is then applied to reflect the unlikely event of experiencing an extremely large loss in each risk type at the same time. Liquidity The objective of liquidity management is to ensure that we have the ability to meet our financial obligations in a timely and cost effective manner, and that we maintain sufficient flexibility to fund strategic corporate initiatives as they arise. Effective management of liquidity involves assessing the potential mismatch between the future cash needs of our customers and our available sources of cash under normal and adverse economic and business conditions. Uses of liquidity consist primarily of meeting deposit withdrawals; funding outstanding commitments to extend credit or purchase securities 57 as they are drawn upon; overdraft facilities; and liquidity asset purchase agreements. Liquidity is provided by the maintenance of broad access to the global capital markets and our balance sheet asset structure. Global Treasury is responsible for the day to day management of our global liquidity position, which is conducted within risk guidelines established and monitored by ALCO. Management maintains a liquidity measurement framework to assess the sources and uses of liquidity that is continuously monitored by Global Treasury and Enterprise Risk Management. Embedded in this framework is a process that outlines several levels of potential risk to our liquidity and identifies "triggers" that we use as early warning signals of a possible difficulty. These triggers are a combination of internal and external measures of potential increases in cash needs or decreases in available sources of cash and possible impairment of our ability to access the global capital markets. Another important component of the framework is a contingency funding plan that is designed to identify and manage through a potential liquidity crisis. The plan defines roles, responsibilities and management actions to be undertaken in the event of a deterioration in our liquidity profile caused by either a State Street specific event or a broader disruption in the capital markets. Specific actions are linked to the levels of "triggers." We generally manage our liquidity risk on a global basis at the consolidated level. We also manage parent company liquidity, and in certain cases branch liquidity, separately. State Street Bank generally has broader access to funding products and markets limited to banks, specifically the federal funds market and the Federal Reserves discount window. The parent company is managed to a more conservative liquidity profile, reflecting narrower market access. We typically hold enough cash, primarily in the form of interest bearing deposits with subsidiary banks, to meet current debt maturities and cash needs, as well as those projected over the next one year period. Sources of liquidity come from two primary areas: access to the global capital markets and liquid assets maintained on our consolidated balance sheet. Our ability to source incremental funding at reasonable rates of interest from wholesale investors in the capital markets is the first source of liquidity we would tap to accommodate the uses of liquidity described below. On balance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our liquidity management strategy. These assets provide liquidity through maturities of the assets, but more importantly, they provide us with the ability to raise funds by pledging the securities as collateral or through outright sales. Each of these sources is used in the management of daily cash needs and in a crisis scenario where we would need to accommodate potential large, unexpected demand for funds. Uses of liquidity result from four primary areas: withdrawals of unsecured customer deposits; draws on unfunded commitments to extend credit or purchase securities, generally provided through lines of credit; overdraft facilities; and liquidity asset purchase agreements supporting the four commercial paper conduits that we administer. Customer deposits are generated largely from our investment servicing activities, and are invested in a combination of term investment securities and short term money market assets whose mix is determined by the characteristics of the deposits. Most of the customer liabilities are payable upon demand or are short term in nature, which means that withdrawals can potentially occur quickly and in large amounts. Similarly, customers can request disbursement of funds under commitments to extend credit, or can overdraw deposit accounts rapidly and in large volumes. Material risks to sources of short term liquidity would include, among other things, external rating agency downgrades of our deposits and debt securities, which would restrict our ability to access the capital markets and may lead to withdrawals of unsecured deposits by our customers. In addition, a large volume of unanticipated funding requirements, such as fundings under liquidity asset purchase agreements that have met draw conditions, or large draw downs of existing lines of credit, could require additional liquidity. During the summer of 2007, the disruption in the global fixed income securities 58 markets, which largely stemmed from sub prime mortgages and securities collateralized by them and later spread to asset backed securities in general, caused us to invoke some elements of our contingency funding plan, resulting in more active monitoring of our liquidity position and more frequent reporting to management. Of primary concern was our ability to replace maturing commercial paper issued by the conduits. As more fully discussed in the "Off Balance Arrangements" section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis, we have been able to reissue the paper, but with some difficulty and at higher rates of interest because of a significant decline in the demand for asset backed commercial paper in the market generally. One action we have taken to improve our liquidity position has been the issuance of term wholesale certificates of deposit and the placement of those funds into short term money market assets where they would be available to meet cash needs. This portfolio stood at $4.57 billion as of December 31, 2007. It is important to note that we did not experience any deterioration in our customer deposit base; it was stable to growing during 2007. While maintenance of our high investment grade credit rating is of primary importance to our liquidity management program, on balance sheet liquid assets represent significant liquidity that we can directly control, and provide a source of cash in the form of principal maturities and the ability to borrow from the capital markets using our securities as collateral. Our liquid assets consist primarily of short term money market assets, such as federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits with banks, the latter of which are multicurrency instruments invested with major multinational banks; and high quality, marketable investment securities not already pledged, which generally are more liquid than other types of assets and can be sold or borrowed against to quickly generate cash. As of December 31, 2007, the cash value of our liquid assets, as defined, totaled $55.14 billion. Securities carried at $39.84 billion as of December 31, 2007 were designated as pledged for public and trust deposits, borrowed funds and for other purposes as provided by law, and are excluded from the liquid assets calculation. Included in liquid assets are securities that have been pledged to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston in order to secure our ability to borrow from the discount window should the need arise. This access to the discount window, including the Federal Reserves recently announced term auction facility, is an important source of back up liquidity for State Street Bank. As of December 31, 2007, we had no outstanding borrowings from the discount window. Based upon our level of liquid assets and our ability to access the capital markets for additional funding when necessary, management considers overall liquidity at December 31, 2007 more than sufficient to meet State Streets current commitments and business needs, including accommodating the transaction and cash management needs of its customers. In April 2007, the parent company issued $700 million of senior debt, consisting of $250 million of floating rate notes due in 2012 and $450 million of 5.375% notes due in 2017. In addition, State Street Capital Trust IV, a Delaware statutory trust wholly owned by the parent company, issued $800 million in aggregate liquidation amount of floating rate capital securities and used the proceeds to purchase a like amount of floating rate junior subordinated debentures from the parent company. The capital securities represent an undivided preferred beneficial interest in those junior subordinated debentures, which are the only assets of the trust. The junior subordinated debentures have an initial scheduled maturity in June 2037 and an initial final repayment date in June 2067, each of which we may extend by ten years in specified circumstances. In accordance with existing accounting standards, we did not record the trust in our consolidated financial statements. The junior subordinated debentures qualify for inclusion in tier 1 regulatory capital. In connection with the issuance of the junior subordinated debentures, the parent company entered into a replacement capital covenant in which it agreed, for the benefit of the holders of its junior subordinated debentures due 2028 underlying the floating rate capital securities issued by State Street Capital Trust I, that it will not repay, redeem or repurchase, and that none of its subsidiaries will purchase, any part of the newly issued debentures or the floating rate capital securities on or before June 1, 2047, unless the repayment, redemption or repurchase is made from the net cash proceeds of 59 the issuance of certain qualified securities and pursuant to the other terms and conditions set forth in the covenant. In July 2007, we redeemed an aggregate of $500 million of unsecured junior subordinated debentures issued by the parent company to two of our statutory business trusts, State Street Capital Trusts A and B, composed of $200 million of 7.94% debentures issued in 1996 and $300 million of 8.035% debentures issued in 1997. We paid the trusts the outstanding amount on the debentures plus accrued interest and an aggregate redemption premium of approximately $20 million. This redemption premium was included in the merger and integration costs which we recorded during the third quarter of 2007 in connection with the Investors Financial acquisition. Additional information about these costs is in the "Consolidated Results of Operations Operating Expenses" section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. In July 2007, the trusts, consistent with the terms of their applicable governing documents, redeemed their respective outstanding capital securities, with an aggregate liquidation amount of $500 million, corresponding to the debentures. The trusts paid to the holders of the outstanding capital securities the same amount that was paid by the parent company to the trusts to redeem the debentures. In January 2008, State Street Capital Trust III, a Delaware statutory trust wholly owned by the parent company, issued $500 million in aggregate liquidation amount of 8.250% fixed to floating rate normal automatic preferred enhanced capital securities, referred to as "normal APEX," and used the proceeds to purchase a like amount of remarketable 6.001% junior subordinated debentures due 2042 from the parent company. In addition, the trust entered into stock purchase contracts with the parent company under which the trust agrees to purchase, and the parent company agrees to sell, on the stock purchase date, a like amount in aggregate liquidation amount of the parent companys non cumulative perpetual preferred stock, series A, $100,000 liquidation preference per share. State Street will make contract payments to the trust at an annual rate of 2.249% of the stated amount of $100,000 per stock purchase contract. The normal APEX are beneficial interests in the trust. The trust will pass through, as distributions on or the redemption price of normal APEX, amounts that it receives on its assets that are the corresponding assets for the normal APEX. The corresponding assets for each normal APEX, $1,000 liquidation amount, initially are $1,000 principal amount of the 6.001% junior subordinated debentures and a 1/100th, or a $1,000, interest in a stock purchase contract for the purchase and sale of one share of the Series A preferred stock for $100,000. The stock purchase date is expected to be March 15, 2011, but it may occur on an earlier date or as late as March 15, 2012. From and after the stock purchase date, the corresponding asset for each normal APEX will be a 1/100th, or a $1,000, interest in one share of the Series A preferred stock. In accordance with existing accounting standards, we did not record the trust in our consolidated financial statements. The 6.001% junior debentures qualify for inclusion in tier 1 regulatory capital. As stated previously, our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the maintenance of high investment grade ratings on our debt, as measured by the major independent credit rating agencies. Factors essential to retaining high credit ratings include diverse and stable core earnings; strong risk management; strong capital ratios; diverse liquidity sources, including the global capital markets and customer deposits; and strong liquidity monitoring procedures. High ratings on debt minimize borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by ensuring the largest possible market for our debt. A downgrade or reduction of these credit ratings could have an adverse impact to our ability to access funding at favorable interest rates. Following our January 3, 2008 announcement of a net charge to establish a reserve associated with certain active fixed income strategies managed by SSgA, the major national rating agencies affirmed their ratings for State Street and State Street Bank. However, Moodys Investors Service and Fitch changed their outlook from stable to negative. These 60 changes have not had a material impact on our liquidity position or on our ability to access the global capital markets at reasonable rates of interest.

Risk Management The global scope of our business activities requires that we balance what we perceive to be the primary risks in our businesses with a comprehensive and well integrated risk management function. The measurement, monitoring and mitigation of risks are essential to the financial performance and successful management of our businesses. These risks, if not effectively managed, can result in current losses to State Street as well as erosion of our capital and damage to our reputation. Our systematic approach also allows for a more precise assessment of risks within a framework for evaluating opportunities for the prudent use of capital. We have a disciplined approach to risk management that involves all levels of management. The Board of Directors provides extensive review and oversight of our overall risk management programs, including the approval of key risk management policies and the periodic review of State Streets key risk indicators. These indicators are designed to identify major business activities of State Street with significant risk content, and to establish quantifiable thresholds for risk measurement. Key risk indicators are reported regularly to the Executive Committee of the Board, and are reviewed periodically for appropriateness. Modifications to the indicators are made to reflect changes in our business activities or refinements to existing measurements. Enterprise Risk Management, or ERM, a dedicated corporate group, provides oversight, support and coordination across business units and is responsible for the formulation and maintenance of enterprise wide risk management policies and guidelines. In addition, ERM establishes and reviews approved limits, and with business line management, monitors key risks. The head of ERM meets regularly with the Board or a Board committee, as appropriate, and has the authority to escalate issues as necessary. The execution of duties in the management of people, products, business operations and processes is the responsibility of business unit managers. The function of risk management is responsible for designing, orchestrating and directing the implementation of risk management programs and processes consistent with corporate and regulatory standards. Accordingly, risk management is a shared responsibility between ERM and the business lines and requires joint efforts in goal setting, program design and implementation, resource management, and performance evaluation between business and functional units. Responsibility for risk management is overseen by a series of management committees. The Major Risk Committee, or MRC, is responsible for the formulation and recommendation of policies, and the approval of guidelines and programs governing the identification, analysis, measurement and control of material risks across State Street. Chaired by the head of ERM, the MRC focuses on the review of 62 business activities with significant risk content and the assessment of risk management programs and initiatives. The Capital Committee, chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, oversees the management of our regulatory and economic capital, the determination of the framework for capital allocation and strategies for capital structure and debt and equity issuances. ALCO, chaired by the Treasurer, oversees the management of our consolidated balance sheet, including management of our global liquidity and interest rate risk positions. The Fiduciary Review Committee reviews the criteria for the acceptance of fiduciary duties, and assists our business lines with their fiduciary responsibilities executed on behalf of customers. The Credit Committee, chaired within ERM, acts as the credit policy committee for State Street. The Operational Risk Committee, chaired within ERM, provides cross business oversight of operational risk to identify, measure, manage and control operational risk in an effective and consistent manner across State Street. The Model Assessment Committee, chaired within ERM, provides unbiased recommendations concerning technical modeling issues and independently validates qualifying financial models utilized by our businesses. Several other committees with specialized risk management functions report to the MRC. Corporate Audit serves in a complementary role to our program of risk management, providing the Board and management with continuous monitoring and control assessments to ensure adherence to State Streets policies and procedures and the effectiveness of its system of internal controls. Additionally, the internal control environment is evaluated through external examinations and regulatory compliance efforts. The Corporate Compliance, Regulatory and Industry Affairs, and Legal groups also serve essential roles in risk management. Corporate Compliance is responsible for the design, implementation and oversight of policies, guidelines and programs to ensure our compliance with applicable laws and regulations wherever we conduct business. The Regulatory and Industry Affairs group monitors proposed changes in rules and legislation, and the Legal group provides counsel that enables us to deal with complex legal and regulatory environments, maximize business opportunities and minimize legal, regulatory and other risks. While we believe that our risk management program is effective in managing the risks in our businesses, external factors may create risks that cannot always be identified or anticipated. For example, a material counterparty failure or a default of a material obligor could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. Market Risk Market risk is defined as the risk of adverse financial impact due to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and other market driven rates or prices. We are exposed to market risk both in our trading and non trading, or asset and liability management, activities. We manage our overall market risk through a comprehensive risk management framework. This framework includes risk management groups that report independently to senior management through ERM. The process of managing market risk for these activities, discussed in further detail below, applies to both on balance sheet and off balance sheet exposures. Trading Activities We primarily engage in trading and investment activities to serve our customers needs and to contribute to overall corporate earnings and liquidity. In the conduct of these activities, we are subject to, and assume, market risk. The level of market risk that we assume is a function of our overall objectives and liquidity needs, customer requirements and market volatility. Interest rate risk, a component of market risk, is more thoroughly discussed in the "Asset and Liability Management" portion of this "Market Risk" section. Market risk associated with foreign exchange and trading activities is controlled through established limits on aggregate and net open positions, sensitivity to changes in interest rates, and 63 concentrations, which are supplemented by stop loss thresholds. We use an array of risk management tools and methodologies, including value at risk, to measure, monitor and control market risk. All limits and measurement techniques are reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a regular basis by business managers, the market risk management group and the Trading and Market Risk Committee. We use a variety of derivative financial instruments to support customers needs, conduct trading activities and manage our interest rate and currency risk. These activities are designed to create trading revenue or to hedge volatility in net interest revenue. In addition, we provide services related to derivative financial instruments in our role as both a manager and servicer of financial assets. Our customers use derivative financial instruments to manage the financial risks associated with their investment goals and business activities. With the growth of cross border investing, customers have an increasing need for foreign exchange forward contracts to convert currency for international investment and to manage the currency risk in international investment portfolios. As an active participant in the foreign exchange markets, we provide foreign exchange forward contracts and options in support of these customer needs. As part of our trading activities, we assume positions in the foreign exchange and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and using derivative financial instruments, including foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange and interest rate options and interest rate swaps. As of December 31, 2007, the notional amounts of all of these derivative financial instruments were $796.19 billion, of which $732.01 billion were foreign exchange forward contracts. In the aggregate, long and short foreign exchange forward positions are closely matched to minimize currency and interest rate risk. All foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at current market rates. We use a variety of risk measurement and estimation techniques, including value at risk. Value at risk is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical confidence interval. We use a system of risk management to estimate value at risk daily for all material trading positions. We have adopted standards for estimating value at risk, and we maintain capital for market risk in accordance with applicable regulatory guidelines. Value at risk is estimated for a 99% one tail confidence interval and an assumed one day holding period using a historical observation period of greater than one year. A 99% one tail confidence interval implies that daily trading losses should not exceed the estimated value at risk more than 1% of the time, or approximately three days out of the year. The methodology uses a simulation approach based on observed changes in market prices and takes into account the resulting diversification benefits provided from the mix of our trading positions. Like all quantitative risk measures, value at risk is subject to certain limitations and assumptions inherent in the methodology. Our methodology gives equal weight to all market rate observations regardless of how recently the market rates were observed. The estimate is calculated using static portfolios consisting of positions held at the end of the trading day. Implicit in the estimate is the assumption that no intraday action is taken by management during adverse market movements. As a result, the methodology does not represent risk associated with intraday changes in positions or intraday price volatility. 64 The following table presents market risk related to our trading activities as measured by our value at risk methodology: VALUE AT RISK 2007 2006 Years ended December 31, (In millions) Annual Average Maximum Minimum Annual Average Maximum Minimum Foreign exchange products $ 1.8 $ 4.0 $ .7 $ 1.7 $ 4.3 $ .7 Interest rate products 1.4 3.7 .1 .8 1.8 .2 We compare daily profits and losses from trading activities to estimated one day value at risk. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we did not experience any trading losses in excess of our end of day value at risk estimate. Asset and Liability Management Activities The primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable and growing net interest revenue, or "NIR," under varying economic environments, while protecting the economic values of our balance sheet assets and liabilities from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates. Most of our NIR is earned from the investment of deposits generated by our core Investment Servicing and Investment Management businesses. We structure our balance sheet assets to generally conform to the characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities, but we manage our overall interest rate risk position in the context of current and anticipated market conditions and within internally approved risk guidelines. Our overall interest rate risk position is maintained within a series of policies approved by the Board and guidelines established and monitored by ALCO. Our Global Treasury unit has responsibility for managing State Streets day to day interest rate risk. To effectively manage the consolidated balance sheet and related NIR, Global Treasury has the authority to take a limited amount of interest rate risk based on market conditions and its views about the direction of global interest rates over both short term and long term time horizons. Global Treasury manages our exposure to changes in interest rates on a consolidated basis, and they have organized themselves into three regional treasury units, North America, Europe, and Asia/Pacific, to reflect the growing, global nature of our exposures and to capture the impact of change in regional market environments on our total risk position. Our investment activities and our use of derivative financial instruments are the primary tools used in managing interest rate risk. We invest in financial instruments with currency, repricing, and maturity characteristics we consider appropriate to manage our overall interest rate risk position. In addition to on balance sheet assets, we use certain derivatives, primarily interest rate swaps, to alter the interest rate characteristics of specific balance sheet assets or liabilities. The use of derivatives is subject to ALCO approved guidelines. Additional information about our use of derivatives is in note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. As a result of growth in our non U.S. operations, non U.S. dollar denominated customer liabilities are a significant portion of our consolidated balance sheet. This growth results in exposure to changes in the shape and level of non U.S. dollar yield curves, which we include in our consolidated interest rate risk management process. Because no one individual measure can accurately assess all of our risks to changes in rates, we use several quantitative measures in our assessment of current and potential future exposures to changes in interest rates and their impact on net interest revenue and balance sheet values. Net interest revenue simulation is the primary tool used in our evaluation of the potential range of possible net interest revenue results that could occur under a variety of interest rate environments. We also use 65 market valuation and duration analysis to assess changes in the economic value of balance sheet assets and liabilities caused by assumed changes in interest rates. Finally, gap analysis the difference between the amount of balance sheet assets and liabilities re pricing within a specified time period is used as a measurement of our interest rate risk position. To measure, monitor, and report on our interest rate risk position, we use (1) NIR simulation, or "NIR at risk," which measures the impact on NIR over the next twelve months to immediate, or "rate shock," and gradual, or "rate ramp," changes in market interest rates; and (2) economic value of equity, or "EVE," which measures the impact on the present value of all NIR related principal and interest cash flows of an immediate change in interest rates. NIR at risk is designed to measure the potential impact of changes in market interest rates on NIR in the short term. EVE, on the other hand, is a long term view of interest rate risk, but with a view toward liquidation of State Street. Both of these measures are subject to ALCO established guidelines, and are monitored regularly, along with other relevant simulations, scenario analyses and stress tests by both Global Treasury and ALCO. In calculating our NIR at risk, we start with a base amount of NIR that is projected over the next twelve months, assuming that the then current yield curve remains unchanged over the period. Our existing balance sheet assets and liabilities are adjusted by the amount and timing of transactions that are forecasted to occur over the next twelve months. That yield curve is then "shocked," or moved immediately, &plusmn;100 basis points in a parallel fashion, or at all points along the yield curve. Two new twelve month NIR projections are then developed using the same balance sheet and forecasted transactions, but with the new yield curves, and compared to the base scenario. We also perform the calculations using interest rate ramps, which are &plusmn;100 basis point changes in interest rates that are assumed to occur gradually over the next twelve month period, rather than immediately as we do with interest rate shocks. EVE is based on the change in the present value of all NIR related principal and interest cash flows for changes in market rates of interest. The present value of existing cash flows with a then current yield curve serves as the base case. We then apply an immediate parallel shock to that yield curve of &plusmn;200 basis points and recalculate the cash flows and related present values. A large shock is used to better capture the embedded option risk in our mortgage backed securities that results from the borrowers prepayment opportunity. Key assumptions used in the models described above include the timing of cash flows; the maturity and repricing of balance sheet assets and liabilities, especially option embedded financial instruments like mortgage backed securities; changes in market conditions; and interest rate sensitivities of our customer liabilities with respect to the interest rates paid and the level of balances. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the models cannot precisely calculate future NIR or predict the impact of changes in interest rates on NIR and economic value. Actual results could differ from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and market conditions, changes in spreads and management strategies, among other factors. Projections of potential future streams of NIR are assessed as part of our forecasting process. The following table presents the estimated exposure of NIR for the next twelve months, calculated as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, due to an immediate &plusmn; 100 basis point shift in then current interest rates. Estimated incremental exposures presented below are dependent on managements assumptions about asset and liability sensitivities under various interest rate scenarios, such as those previously discussed, and do not reflect any actions management may undertake in order to mitigate some of the adverse effects of interest rate changes on State Streets financial performance. 66 NIR AT RISK Estimated Exposure to Net Interest Revenue (In millions) 2007 2006 Rate change: +100 bps shock $ (98 ) $ (90 ) 100 bps shock 7 52 +100 bps ramp (44 ) (57 ) 100 bps ramp 20 46 The following table presents estimated EVE exposures, calculated as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, assuming an immediate and prolonged shift in interest rates, the impact of which would be spread over a number of years. ECONOMIC VALUE OF EQUITY Estimated Exposure to Economic Value of Equity (In millions) 2007 2006 Rate change: +200 bps shock $ (1,195 ) $ (1,023 ) 200 bps shock 48 371 With respect to the December 31, 2007 information presented in the tables above, the balance sheet of Investors Financial is reflected in the estimated NIR at risk and the estimated EVE exposure. Information for prior periods was not restated. The incremental increases in the levels of NIR at risk and EVE exposure to upward shifts in interest rates are largely attributable to increased purchases of fixed rate securities in the first quarter of 2007, slower projected prepayment speeds for mortgage backed securities effective in the fourth quarter of 2007, and the contribution of the acquired Investors Financial business during the third quarter of 2007. While the dollar amount of NIR at risk increased, its rate of increase was lower than the reported growth rate for NIR. While the measures presented in the tables above are not a prediction of future NIR or valuations, they do suggest that if all other variables remained constant, in the short term, falling interest rates would lead to NIR that is higher than it would otherwise have been, and rising rates would lead to lower NIR. Other important factors that impact the levels of NIR are balance sheet size and mix; interest rate spreads; the slope and interest rate level of U.S. dollar and non U.S. dollar yield curves and the relationship between them; the pace of change in market interest rates; and management actions taken in response to the preceding conditions. One of the most important assumptions in our management of interest rate risk is the response of customer liabilities to changes in market interest rates. As such, we regularly reassess the characteristics of customer liabilities. Our most recent assessment was completed during the second quarter of 2007 and resulted in a small lengthening in the estimated duration of customer liabilities. The impact of this longer estimated duration for customer liabilities reduced both NIR at risk and EVE exposure to increases in market interest rates, partially mitigating the factors responsible for higher interest rate risk detailed above. Credit Risk Credit and counterparty risk is defined as the risk of financial loss if a borrower or counterparty is either unable or unwilling to repay borrowings or settle in accordance with contractual terms. The extension of credit and acceptance of counterparty risk by State Street are governed by corporate 67 guidelines based on the prospective customers risk profile, the markets served, counterparty and country concentrations, and regulatory compliance. Our focus on large institutional investors and their businesses requires that we assume concentrated credit risk in a variety of forms to certain highly rated entities. This concentration risk is mitigated by comprehensive guidelines and procedures to monitor and manage all aspects of credit and counterparty risk that we undertake. Exposures are evaluated on an individual basis at least annually. We provide, on a limited basis, traditional loan products and services to key customers and prospects in a manner that enhances customer relationships, increases profitability and minimizes risk. We employ a relationship model in which credit decisions are based upon credit quality and the overall institutional relationship. This model is typical of financial institutions that provide credit to institutional customers in the markets that we serve. An allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb probable credit losses in the loan portfolio and is reviewed regularly by management for adequacy. An internal rating system is used to assess potential risk of loss based on customer investment profile, current economic and or customer financial indicators. The provision for loan losses is a charge to earnings to maintain the overall allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate relative to the level of credit risk in the loan and lease financing portfolio. No provision was recorded in either 2007, 2006 or 2005. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the allowance for loan losses was $18 million. Changes in the allowance for loan losses were as follows for the years ended December 31: (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 2004(1) 2003 U.S.: Balance at beginning of year $ 18 $ 18 $ 17 $ 43 $ 43 Provision for loan losses (15 ) Loan charge offs commercial and financial Recoveries commercial and financial Reclassification (14 ) Balance at end of year U.S. 18 18 17 14 43 Non U.S.: Balance at beginning of year 1 18 18 Provision for loan losses (3 ) Reclassification (11 ) Balance at end of year Non U.S. 1 4 18 Total balance at end of year $ 18 $ 18 $ 18 $ 18 $ 61 (1)In 2004, we reclassified $25 million of the allowance for loan losses to other liabilities as a reserve for off balance sheet commitments. Subsequent to the reclassification, the reserve for off balance sheet commitments was reduced by $10 million, and recorded as an offset to other operating expenses. We also reversed $18 million through the provision for loan losses as a result of reduced credit risk exposures and improved credit quality. Past due loans are loans on which principal or interest payments are over 90 days delinquent, but where interest continues to be accrued. There were no past due loans as of December 31, 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003. We generally place loans on non accrual status once payments are 60 days past due, or earlier if management determines that full collection is not probable. Loans 60 days past due, but considered both well secured and in the process of collection, may be excluded from non accrual status. For loans 68 placed on non accrual status, revenue recognition is suspended. There were no non accrual loans at year end 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003. We purchase securities under agreements to resell. Risk is minimized by establishing the acceptability of counterparties; limiting purchases almost exclusively to low risk U.S. government securities; taking possession or control of transaction assets; monitoring levels of underlying collateral; and limiting the duration of the agreements. Securities are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary from the borrower. Most repurchase agreements are short term, with maturities of less than 90 days. We also provide customers with off balance sheet liquidity and credit enhancement facilities in the form of letters of credit, lines of credit and liquidity asset purchase agreements. These exposures are subject to an initial credit analysis, with detailed approval and review processes. These facilities are also actively monitored and reviewed on an annual basis. We maintain a separate reserve for probable credit losses related to certain of these off balance sheet activities. Management reviews the adequacy of this reserve on a regular basis. On behalf of our customers, we lend their securities to creditworthy banks, broker/dealers and other institutions. In most circumstances, we indemnify our customers for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities. Though these transactions are well collateralized, the substantial volume of these activities necessitates thorough credit based underwriting and monitoring processes. State Street requires the borrowers to provide collateral in an amount equal to or in excess of 100% of the fair market value of the securities borrowed. Collateral funds received in connection with our securities lending services are held by us as agent and are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. The borrowed securities and collateral are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary. State Street held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $572.93 billion and $527.37 billion as collateral for indemnified securities financing at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Processes for credit approval and monitoring are in place for other credit extensions. As part of the approval and renewal process, appropriate due diligence is conducted based on the size and term of the exposure, as well as the quality of the counterparty. Exposures to these entities are aggregated and evaluated by ERM. Investments in debt and equity securities, including investments in affiliates, are monitored regularly by Corporate Finance and ERM. To the extent necessary, procedures are in place for evaluating potentially impaired securities, as discussed in notes 1 and 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. Total non performing investment securities were $3 million and $4 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operational Risk We define operational risk as the potential for loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events. As a leading provider of services to institutional investors, our customers have a broad array of complex and specialized servicing, confidentiality and fiduciary requirements. Active management of operational risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business, and responsibility for the management of operational risk lies with every individual at State Street. Our Operational Risk Policy Statement defines operational risk and details roles and responsibilities for managing operational risk. The Policy Statement is reinforced by the Operational Risk Guidelines, which codify our approach to operational risk. The Guidelines document our sound practices and provide a mandate within which programs, processes, and regulatory elements are implemented to ensure that operational risk is identified, measured, managed and controlled in an effective and consistent manner across State Street. 69  We maintain an operational risk governance structure to ensure that responsibilities are clearly defined and to provide independent oversight of operational risk management. Business units periodically review the status of the business controls and monitor and report key risk indicator results. ERM oversees the overall operational risk management program. The MRC and the Operational Risk Committee review key risk indicators and policies related to operational risk, provide oversight to ensure compliance with the operational risk program, and escalate operational risk issues of note to the Executive Committee of the Board. Corporate Audit performs independent reviews of the application of operational risk management practices and methodologies and reports to the Examining and Audit Committee of the Board. State Streets internal control environment is designed to provide a sound operational environment. Our discipline in managing operational risk provides the structure to identify, evaluate, control, monitor, measure, mitigate and report operational risk. Business Risk We define business risk as the risk of adverse changes in our earnings related to business factors, including changes in the competitive environment, changes in the operational economics of business activities and the potential effect of strategic and reputation risks, not already captured as market, interest rate, credit or operational risks. We incorporate business risk into our assessment of our economic capital needs. Active management of business risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business, and responsibility for the management of business risk lies with every individual at State Street. It is sometimes difficult to separate the effects of a potential material adverse event into operational and business risks. For instance, the direct financial impact of an unfavorable event in the form of fines or penalties would be classified as an operational risk loss, while the impact on our reputation and the potential loss of customers and corresponding decline in revenue would be classified as a business risk loss. An additional example of business risk is the integration of a major acquisition. Failure to successfully integrate the operations of an acquired business, and the resultant inability to retain customers, would be classified as a business risk loss. Business risk is managed with a long term focus. Techniques include the careful development of business plans and appropriate management oversight. The potential impact of the various elements of business risk is difficult to quantify with any degree of precision. We use a combination of historical earnings volatility, scenario analysis, stress testing and management judgment to help assess the potential effect on State Street attributable to business risk. Management and control of business risks are generally the responsibility of the business units as part of their overall and strategic planning and internal risk management processes. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS In the normal course of business, we hold assets under custody and assets under management in a custodial or fiduciary capacity for our customers, and, in accordance with GAAP, we do not record these assets in our consolidated statement of condition. Similarly, collateral funds associated with our securities finance activities are held by us as agent; therefore, we do not record these assets in our consolidated statement of condition. Additional information about these and other off balance sheet activities is in note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. In the normal course of business, we utilize derivative financial instruments to support our customers needs, to conduct trading activities and to manage our interest rate and foreign currency risk. Additional information about our use of derivatives is in note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. 70 In the normal course of business, we utilize three types of special purpose entities, referred to as SPEs, two of which are not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Information about the activities of these SPEs, which are used in connection with our tax exempt investment program, our involvement with managed investment vehicles and our asset backed commercial paper conduits, is in notes 10 and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. Additional information about the commercial paper conduits is provided below. The risks associated with providing administration, liquidity, and or credit enhancements to these special purpose entities are reviewed as part of our corporate risk management process in a manner that is consistent with applicable policies and guidelines. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and have provided adequate credit reserves to cover any risks associated with these activities. Asset Backed Commercial Paper Programs As further described in note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8, we administer four third party owned, special purpose, multi seller asset backed commercial paper programs, commonly referred to as "conduits," the first of which was established in 1992. These conduits, which are structured as bankruptcy remote entities and are not recorded in our consolidated financial statements under existing accounting standards, are designed to satisfy the demand of our institutional customers, particularly mutual fund customers, for commercial paper. Total assets in the four unconsolidated conduits were approximately $28.76 billion at December 31, 2007 and $25.25 billion at December 31, 2006. The conduits obtain funding through the issuance of commercial paper and hold diversified portfolios of investments, which are predominately composed of securities purchased in the capital markets. These investments are collateralized by mortgages, student loans, automobile and equipment loans and credit card receivables, most of which securities are investment grade. Conduit assets are not sourced from our consolidated balance sheet. The following tables provide additional information regarding the composition of the conduits asset portfolios, in the aggregate, as of December 31, 2007. As of this date, none of the conduits portfolio securities were predominantly collateralized by sub prime real estate mortgages. CONDUIT ASSETS BY COLLATERAL TYPE Amount Percent of Total Conduit Assets (Dollars in billions) Australian residential mortgage backed securities $ 4.7 16 % European residential mortgage backed securities 4.7 16 U.S. residential mortgage backed securities 4.2 15 United Kingdom residential mortgage backed securities 2.3 8 Student loans 3.3 11 Auto and equipment loans 2.8 10 Credit cards 2.0 7 Other(1) 4.8 17 Total conduit assets $ 28.8 100 % (1)"Other" included trade receivables, collateralized debt obligations, business/commercial loans and other financial instruments.

CONDUIT ASSETS BY ASSET ORIGIN Amount Percent of Total Conduit Assets (Dollars in billions) U.S. $ 12.2 42 % Australia 6.1 21 Great Britain 2.9 10 Spain 1.9 7 Italy 1.9 7 Portugal 0.7 2 Germany 0.7 2 Netherlands 0.5 2 Greece 0.3 1 Other 1.6 6 Total conduit assets $ 28.8 100 % Since the conduits were first organized beginning in 1992, we have entered into contractual obligations in the form of liquidity asset purchase agreements to support most or all of the liquidity of the conduits. We also provide credit enhancement to the conduits in the form of standby letters of credit. Other institutions can and do provide contractual liquidity to the conduits. As provided for in these agreements, we provide back up liquidity in the event that the conduits cannot meet their funding needs through the issuance of commercial paper. In the event that maturing commercial paper cannot be reissued into the market by the conduits dealer group, we and the other institutions providing liquidity may be required to provide liquidity by purchasing portfolio assets from the conduits. State Street may also provide liquidity by purchasing commercial paper or providing other extensions of credit to the conduits. As of December 31, 2007, State Streets commitments under these liquidity asset purchase agreements and back up lines of credit totaled approximately $28.37 billion, and our commitments under standby letters of credit totaled $1.04 billion. The conduits generally sell commercial paper to third party investors; however, we sometimes purchase commercial paper from the conduits. At December 31, 2007, we held on our consolidated balance sheet an aggregate of approximately $2 million of commercial paper issued by the conduits. The highest total overnight position in the conduits commercial paper held by State Street was approximately $1.25 billion during 2007. This was higher than the levels of commercial paper we have historically held, and was reflective of both the reduced liquidity in the asset backed commercial paper markets during the third and fourth quarters and our desire to provide short term stability to funding costs given the lack of liquidity in the marketplace. There were no draw downs on the liquidity asset purchase agreements or standby letters of credit during 2007. 72 As the third quarter of 2007 progressed and investors became increasingly concerned about the credit quality of the underlying assets generally held in asset backed commercial paper conduits and similar vehicles, the resulting reduction in liquidity in the global fixed income securities markets made the funding of the State Street administered conduits more challenging than in normal market conditions, and the yields that issuers had to pay on asset backed commercial paper increased. Consistent with the experience of other market participants, commercial paper was generally being placed by the State Street administered conduits with shorter maturities and higher investor yields than historically experienced. This compressed the spread between the rate earned on the conduits assets and the conduits funding costs. The weighted average maturity of the conduits commercial paper was approximately 20 days as of December 31, 2007, compared to approximately 23 days as of December 31, 2006. However, the conduits continue to roll over the commercial paper as it matures, i.e., place the commercial paper with market participants, including State Street. We intend to continue to manage the liquidity of the programs, if and as needed, through purchases of commercial paper as necessary; however, if due to further deterioration in the liquidity of the fixed income markets or otherwise, it would become necessary to purchase assets from the conduits, we anticipate that we could fund those purchases. During 2007, we did not experience any losses in our role as a liquidity and credit enhancement provider to the conduits, although the margins that we generated from administration of the conduits were lower than the levels historically achieved on commercial paper issued by the conduits. The fee revenue we generated from our involvement with the conduits was approximately $66 million for 2007, $62 million for 2006 and $58 million for 2005. We earn fees from our role as administrator, liquidity or credit enhancement provider and as one of the dealers, which fees are priced on a market basis. These fees are recorded in processing fees and other revenue in our consolidated statement of income. Our overall conduit business activities generated pre tax income, which included the fee revenue described above, of approximately $23 million for 2007, compared to pre tax income of $49 million for 2006 and $45 million for 2005. The decrease in this income from 2006 to 2007 primarily resulted from the change in fair value of basis swaps, as well as other conduit operating expenses. As described above, we provide the conduits with contractual liquidity in the form of liquidity asset purchase agreements. If a conduit experienced a problem with an asset, such as a default or credit rating downgrade, subject to certain conditions, the liquidity asset purchase agreement could be invoked by the conduit, requiring State Street to purchase the asset from the conduit at prices which may exceed the fair value of the assets. If that occurred, we would be required to recognize a loss upon purchase of the asset. Any loss from a credit default would first be offset by the level of funding provided by the first loss note holders. Currently, in light of the recent reduction in liquidity in the markets, with spreads on virtually all asset classes except U.S. treasuries having widened, we expect that an asset purchase would result in a loss. This loss may be recovered in future periods, depending on State Streets actions after the asset is purchased and market conditions. It is also possible that we would be required to consolidate one or more of the conduits assets and liabilities onto our consolidated balance sheet. This consolidation would occur if we were determined to be the primary beneficiary of the conduits as defined in FIN 46(R). For example, if we updated our expected loss model assumptions as a result of changes in market conditions or a downgrade of securities, we may be required to increase the amount of first loss notes in order for the investors in the first loss notes to continue to be considered the primary beneficiaries of the conduits. If the conduits are not able to issue additional first loss notes or take other actions, we may be determined to be the primary beneficiary of the conduits, and would be required to consolidate the conduits assets and liabilities onto our consolidated balance sheet. Additional information about our use of an expected loss model and the third party investors in first loss notes is provided in the "Significant Accounting Estimates Special Purpose Entities" section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis and in note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under 73 Item 8. Our accounting treatment of the conduits is reviewed at least quarterly, and more frequently if specific events warrant. As a result of the events in the global fixed income securities markets, we reviewed the underlying assumptions incorporated in our FIN 46(R) expected loss model. We concluded as of December 31, 2007, that our model assumptions were appropriate and were reflective of market participant assumptions, and appropriately considered the probability of, and potential for, the recurrence of these events. If consolidation were to occur because we were determined to be the primary beneficiary of the conduits as defined in FIN 46(R), we would consolidate the conduits assets and liabilities onto our consolidated balance sheet at fair value. We expect that we would recognize an extraordinary loss on the date of consolidation if the fair value of the conduits liabilities exceeded the fair value of the conduits assets, as they do currently. This loss would be recovered back into income over the remaining lives of the assets, assuming that the assets were held to maturity and that we recovered the full principal amount of the securities. Purchasing or consolidating all or a significant portion of the assets of the conduits would affect the size and composition of our consolidated balance sheet and alter our financial and regulatory capital ratios, and may affect our earnings. In light of our continued ability to manage the liquidity of the commercial paper, we do not currently anticipate that this action will become necessary. However, for illustrative purposes only, assuming estimated fair values of the conduits assets as of December 31, 2007, if all of the conduits assets were purchased under the liquidity asset purchase agreements, or if the conduits assets and liabilities were consolidated onto our consolidated balance sheet, we estimate that we would recognize an after tax loss of approximately $530 million in our consolidated statement of income. This estimate assumes that all of the conduits, with total assets of approximately $28.76 billion as of December 31, 2007, are consolidated on that date; that the assets of the conduits are recorded at fair value, which is based on State Streets consistent application of its pricing policies for conduit assets; and that the pre tax loss is tax effected at a 40% marginal income tax rate. If this consolidation were to occur in the future, or we were required to purchase assets pursuant to the liquidity asset purchase agreements at prices in excess of the fair value of the assets, the ultimate amount of loss will be based upon market conditions at the date such a determination is made, which could differ from the estimate provided above. If the assets were consolidated for accounting purposes pursuant to FIN 46(R), we expect that this loss would be recorded as an extraordinary loss, after income from continuing operations. If we were to purchase the assets under the liquidity asset purchase agreements, to the extent that a loss was incurred, we expect that the loss would be recognized in continuing operations. We consider the activities of the conduits in our liquidity management process, as more fully described in the "Liquidity" section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. We would be able to access multiple sources of liquidity to fund required asset purchases, including sales of other assets, asset repurchase agreements, the issuance of corporate commercial paper, the issuance of bank certificates of deposit and time deposits, and accessing the Federal Reserve discount window or similar facilities in other jurisdictions in which we maintain significant banking operations. The consolidation of the conduits for accounting purposes alone would not require additional funding or liquidity for the conduits to fund their asset portfolios. However, if the reasons for consolidation related to an inability of the conduits to issue commercial paper, the conduits would require additional liquidity. If we were required to consolidate the conduits assets and liabilities, our regulatory capital ratios would be negatively impacted for a period of time. With respect to regulatory capital, the consolidation of the conduits assets and liabilities would cause a reduction of our tier 1 and total risk based capital ratios. The impact of consolidation on our tier 1 leverage ratio would be more significant, but the 74 degree of impact would depend on how and when consolidation occurred, since this ratio is a function of our consolidated total average assets over an entire quarter. Assuming estimated fair values of the conduits assets as of December 31, 2007, priced as described above, if all of the conduits assets and liabilities were consolidated onto our consolidated balance sheet on December 31, 2007, and no other management actions were taken with respect to regulatory capital, the following table presents the estimated impact on State Streets and State Street Banks regulatory capital ratios.
