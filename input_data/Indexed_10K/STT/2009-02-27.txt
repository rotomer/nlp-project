ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS GENERAL State Street Corporation is a financial holding company organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. All references in this Managements Discussion and Analysis to the parent company are to State Street Corporation. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this Managements Discussion and Analysis to State Street, we, us, our or similar terms mean State Street Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. State Street Bank and Trust Company is referred to as State Street Bank. At December 31, 2008, we had total assets of $173.63 billion, total deposits of $112.23 billion, total shareholders equity of $12.77 billion and employed 28,475. With $12.04 trillion of assets under custody and $1.44 trillion of assets under management at year end 2008, we are a leading specialist in meeting the needs of institutional investors worldwide. We report two lines of business: Investment Servicing and Investment Management. These lines of business provide a full range of products and services for our customers, which include mutual funds, collective investment funds and other investment pools, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, foundations, endowments and investment managers. Investment Servicing provides services to support institutional investors, such as custody, product and participant level accounting, daily pricing and administration; master trust and master custody; recordkeeping; shareholder services, including mutual fund and collective investment fund shareholder accounting; foreign exchange, brokerage and other trading services; securities finance; deposit and short term investment facilities; loans and lease financing; investment manager and hedge fund manager operations outsourcing; and performance, risk and compliance analytics. Investment Management provides a broad array of services for managing financial assets, such as investment research services and investment management, including passive and active U.S. and non U.S. equity and fixed income strategies. For additional information about our lines of business, see the Line of Business Information section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis and note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. This Managements Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. Certain previously reported amounts presented have been reclassified to conform to current period classifications. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., referred to as GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the application of certain accounting policies that materially affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Accounting policies that require management to make assumptions that are difficult, subjective or complex about matters that are uncertain and may change in subsequent periods are discussed in more depth in the Significant Accounting Estimates section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. Certain financial information provided in this Managements Discussion and Analysis has been prepared on both a GAAP basis and an operating basis. Management measures and compares certain financial information on an operating basis, as it believes that this presentation supports meaningful comparisons from period to period and the analysis of comparable financial trends with respect to State Streets normal ongoing business operations. Management believes that operating basis financial information, which reports revenue from non taxable sources on a fully taxable equivalent basis and excludes the impact of revenue and expenses outside of the normal course of our business, facilitates an investors understanding and analysis of State Streets underlying financial performance and trends in addition to financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. This Managements Discussion and Analysis contains statements that are considered forward looking statements within the meaning of U.S. federal securities laws. Forward looking statements are based on our current expectations about revenue and market growth, acquisitions and divestitures, new technologies, services and opportunities, earnings and other factors. These forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially. We undertake no obligation to revise the forward looking statements contained in this Managements Discussion and Analysis to reflect events after the 32 Table of Contents date we file this Form 10 K with the SEC. Additional information about forward looking statements and related risks and uncertainties is included in the Risk Factors section of this Form 10 K under Item 1A.

(3) Amount was composed of a provision for legal exposure of $600 million, a reduction of salaries and benefits expense of $141 million, and other expenses of $8 million; refer to the Expenses section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. Financial Highlights For 2008, we recorded net income of $1.79 billion, or $4.30 per diluted share, compared to $1.26 billion, or $3.45 per diluted share, for 2007. Total revenue increased 28% from 2007, and return on common equity was 14.8% compared to 13.4% for 2007. Total revenue for 2008 grew 28% from 2007. Total fee revenue, which grew 17%, reflected growth in servicing fees and trading services revenue, up 11% and 27%, respectively, compared to 2007, and securities finance revenue, up 81%. Generally, servicing fees benefited from the inclusion of the acquired Investors 33 Table of Contents Financial business for the full year and net new business, partly offset by declines in equity market valuations. Management fees declined 10% from 2007, primarily as a result of declines in equity market valuations and lower performance fees. Trading services revenue grew primarily as a result of higher levels of volatility and the contribution of the acquired Investors Financial business (with respect to foreign exchange revenue), and the inclusion of revenue from the acquired Currenex business (with respect to brokerage and other fees), both for a full year. Securities finance revenue benefited primarily from wider credit spreads across all lending programs, as well as revenue contributed by the acquired Investors Financial business. Processing fees and other revenue were flat with 2007 levels. The growth in total revenue also reflected a $350 million gain from the sale of our joint venture interest in CitiStreet in July 2008. Net interest revenue increased 53% compared to 2007, or 54% on a fully taxable equivalent basis ($2,754 million compared to $1,788 million, reflecting tax equivalent adjustments of $104 million and $58 million, respectively), with a related increase in net interest margin of 37 basis points. These increases were primarily due to the impact of Federal Reserve reductions in interest rates during 2008 and increases in customer deposits. Total expenses of $7.85 billion increased 22% from 2007, partly reflective of the aggregate $1.07 billion of the following items: merger and integration costs associated with the Investors Financial acquisition ($115 million); the charge associated with the cash infusion into the SSgA investment management accounts ($450 million); the restructuring charges associated with the reduction in workforce and other cost initiatives ($306 million); and the provision for estimated net exposure on an indemnification obligation associated with collateralized repurchase agreements ($200 million). This compares to the aggregate $665 million of the following items: merger and integration costs associated with Investors Financial ($198 million), and a net charge related to certain active fixed income strategies managed by State Street Global Advisors, or SSgA ($467 million) recorded in 2007. Expenses from operations of $6.78 billion ($7.85 billion net of $1.07 billion) increased 17.5% compared to 2007 expenses from operations of $5.77 billion ($6.43 billion net of $665 million). The increase resulted from the inclusion of expenses of the acquired Investors Financial business for full year 2008 compared to six months in 2007, increases in salaries and benefits expenses, higher levels of professional fees and securities processing costs, and new fees and assessments paid to banking regulators. For 2008, our non U.S. revenue was approximately 35% of our total revenue, compared to 41% for 2007 and 43% for 2006. The decrease compared to 2007 was primarily the result of the inclusion of revenue from the acquired Investors Financial business for the full year, compared to six months for 2007, as well as higher levels of domestic revenue growth. Results for 2008 included the following significant items outside of the ordinary course of our business. During the third and fourth quarters of 2008, we participated in the Federal Reserves AMLF, and earned $68 million of pre tax net interest revenue related to this program (see the Net Interest Revenue section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis for additional information); During the third quarter of 2008, the IRS issued a standard settlement offer to taxpayers that have entered into SILO leveraged leases. We did not accept the offer and continue to pursue our appeal rights within the IRS. In consideration of the terms of the offer and the context in which it was issued, we revised our projection of the timing and amount of tax cash flows from the leases and recalculated the recognition of lease related revenue over the leases terms from their inception. This recalculation resulted in a cumulative reduction of net interest revenue of $98 million and the accrual of income tax expense of $39 million during 2008 (see the Net Interest Revenue section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis for additional information); We completed the sale of our 50% joint venture interest in CitiStreet in July 2008, and recognized a $350 million pre tax gain, which was net of exit and other costs associated with the sale (see the Consolidated Results of Operations Total Revenue section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis for additional information); In October 2008, in connection with SSgA investment management products that rely upon contractual arrangements with wrap providers, we provided support to these accounts by purchasing approximately $2.49 billion of asset backed and mortgage backed securities from them at then current market prices and 34 Table of Contents making an aggregate cash infusion into the accounts of approximately $450 million. As a result of these actions, we recorded a charge of $450 million in our consolidated statement of income (see the Expenses section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis for additional information); During the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded restructuring charges of $306 million associated with a reduction in our global workforce and other cost initiatives (see the Expenses section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis for additional information); During the third quarter of 2008, we recorded a $200 million provision to recognize our estimated net exposure related to an indemnification obligation associated with collateralized repurchase agreements with an affiliate of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (see the Expenses section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis for additional information); and We recorded $115 million of merger and integration costs associated with our July 2007 acquisition of Investors Financial (see the Expenses section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis for additional information). In February 2009, in light of the impact of the continued disruption in the global capital markets experienced since the middle of 2007, which is described in more detail in the following section, we announced a series of actions to strengthen our tangible common equity, or TCE, ratio. We define the TCE ratio as the relationship of our consolidated common shareholders equity to our consolidated total assets, with both amounts reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets net of related deferred taxes. For 2009, our plan to improve our TCE ratio includes temporarily reducing our quarterly dividend on our common stock to $0.01 per share, the reinvestment of investment securities paying down and maturing during 2009 into interest bearing deposits with U.S. and non U.S. central banks, and a resulting reduction in the size of our consolidated balance sheet. We expect that these actions will produce growth in organic capital but will reduce our net interest margin for 2009 by approximately 13% to 18% compared to 2008. IMPACT OF SECURITIES MARKETS DISRUPTION AND GOVERNMENT ACTIONS Over the past eighteen months, the global financial markets have experienced significant disruption, including substantial volatility, limited trading activity in some markets and a widespread lack of liquidity. These events, and the potential for increased and continuing disruption, have significantly diminished overall confidence in the financial markets and in financial institutions, and have further worsened liquidity and pricing issues within the fixed income securities markets. In the second half of 2008, these conditions resulted in the bankruptcy or acquisition of, or significant government assistance to, a number of major domestic and international financial institutions. Overall, this disruption increased the uncertainty and unpredictability we face in our business and affected our results of operations and our financial condition. The significant declines in equity and other financial markets globally during 2008 adversely affected our servicing and management fee revenues, which are based, in part, on the value of assets under custody or management. Our trading services revenue benefitted from market volatility and the resulting increases in the volumes of transactions that we execute for our customers. Our securities finance revenue was favorably affected by wider spreads, although this business experienced a decline in lending due to the reduction or suspension of participation by some institutional investors in our securities lending program. During the third and fourth quarters of 2008, in response to the above described market conditions, federal government and bank regulatory agencies, particularly the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the FDIC, working in cooperation with foreign governments and other central banks, instituted a variety of programs designed to restore confidence in the financial markets, strengthen financial institutions and encourage the flow of credit and liquidity in support of the U.S. economy. The programs in which State Street had significant participation or involvement are described below. Asset Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility This facility, referred to as the AMLF, was instituted by the Federal Reserve in September 2008. It is designed to restore liquidity in the asset backed commercial paper markets and assist money market mutual funds in meeting 35 Table of Contents investor redemption requests. The Federal Reserve extends non recourse loans to eligible banking organizations to finance their purchase of high quality asset backed commercial paper from eligible money market funds or other eligible entities. The facility, originally intended to expire on January 30, 2009, was extended to October 30, 2009. We began our participation in the AMLF in September 2008, and were one of the first institutions to be fully operational for mutual fund customers desiring to utilize the facility. For 2008, we earned net interest revenue associated with this facility of approximately $68 million. Additional information about the impact of our participation in the AMLF on our consolidated financial statements is provided in the Consolidated Results of Operations Net Interest Revenue section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis and in note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. Mortgage Backed Securities Purchase Program The program, announced by the U.S. Treasury in September 2008, is designed to broaden access to mortgage funding for current and prospective homeowners, as well as to promote market stability through the Treasurys purchase of new mortgage backed securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The program is intended to expire on December 31, 2009. In October 2008, SSgA was one of two asset managers appointed as an agent to manage assets purchased under the program. Temporary Guarantee Program for Money Market Funds The U.S. Treasury instituted the Temporary Guarantee Program for Money Market Funds in September 2008. The program is designed to address temporary dislocations in credit markets. The program temporarily guarantees the share price of any publicly offered, eligible money market mutual fund that applies for and pays a fee to participate in the program. The program provides coverage to shareholders up to amounts that they held in participating money market funds as of the close of business on September 19, 2008. The program, originally intended to expire on December 29, 2008, has been extended through April 30, 2009. Three of SSgAs money market funds are participating in the program. Commercial Paper Funding Facility The facility, referred to as the CPFF, was instituted by the Federal Reserve and became operational in October 2008. The facility is designed to complement the Federal Reserves existing credit facilities to help provide liquidity to term funding markets. It provides a liquidity back stop to U.S. issuers of commercial paper through a special purpose vehicle that purchases three month unsecured and asset backed commercial paper directly from eligible issuers. State Street was appointed CPFF custodian and administrator in October 2008. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we paid a registration fee of approximately $23 million to the Federal Reserve to participate in the facility. The State Street administered asset backed commercial paper conduits, as of December 31, 2008, had sold $5.70 billion of commercial paper to the CPFF. The CPFF, originally intended to expire on April 30, 2009, was extended to October 30, 2009. Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program The program was announced by the FDIC in October 2008, and final rules were issued in November and December 2008. The program is designed to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the U.S. banking system (1) by guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks, thrifts and certain holding companies, and (2) by providing unlimited insurance protection for non interest bearing deposit transactions accounts at FDIC insured institutions through December 31, 2009. The program provides a 100% guarantee for unsecured senior debt issued through June 30, 2009 by banks, thrifts, bank holding companies, financial holding companies and thrift holding companies. The guarantee will exist for three years. In December 2008, we paid aggregate fees of approximately $5 million to participate in both features of this program. Additional information about the FDICs guarantee of certain of our senior unsecured debt is provided in the Liquidity section of Managements Discussion and Analysis included in this Form 10 K under Item 7. 36 Table of Contents Money Market Investor Funding Facility This program, instituted by the Federal Reserve, became operational in November 2008. The program is designed to provide liquidity to eligible U.S. money market investors. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York will provide up to $600 billion of senior secured funding to a series of private sector special purpose vehicles to finance the purchase of eligible assets from eligible investors. The special purpose vehicles will commence a wind down process on October 30, 2009 unless the Federal Reserve further extends the facility. State Street facilitated the implementation and extension of this program, working with the Federal Reserve and the program administrator. TARP Capital Purchase Program State Street was selected by Treasury as one of the nine financial institutions to participate in the launch of this program, in connection with actions taken by the U.S. government designed to protect the U.S. economy, strengthen public confidence in financial institutions and foster the strong functioning of credit markets. In October 2008, State Street agreed to, and received, a $2 billion investment (based on a percentage of its consolidated risk weighted assets) through the issuance of 20,000 shares of its Series B preferred stock and a related warrant to purchase approximately 5.6 million shares of its common stock to Treasury. Information about the impact of our participation in the capital purchase program on our consolidated financial statements is provided in the Capital section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis and in note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. 37 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This section discusses our consolidated results of operations for 2008 compared to 2007, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. A comparison of consolidated results of operations for 2007 with those for 2006 is provided in the Comparison of 2007 and 2006 Overview of Consolidated Results of Operations section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. TOTAL REVENUE Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Change2007 2008 (Dollars in millions) Fee revenue: Servicing fees $ 3,745 $ 3,388 $ 2,723 11 % Management fees 1,028 1,141 943 (10 ) Trading services 1,467 1,152 862 27 Securities finance 1,230 681 386 81 Processing fees and other 277 271 272 2 Total fee revenue 7,747 6,633 5,186 17 Net interest revenue: Interest revenue 4,879 5,212 4,324 (6 ) Interest expense 2,229 3,482 3,214 (36 ) Net interest revenue 2,650 1,730 1,110 53 Provision for loan losses Net interest revenue after provision for loan losses 2,650 1,730 1,110 53 Gains (Losses) related to investment securities, net (54 ) (27 ) 15 Gain on sale of CitiStreet interest, net of exit and other associated costs 350 Total revenue $ 10,693 $ 8,336 $ 6,311 28 Our broad range of services generates fee revenue and net interest revenue. Fee revenue generated by investment servicing and investment management is augmented by securities finance, trading services and other processing fee revenue. We earn net interest revenue from customers deposits and short term investment activities, by providing deposit services and short term investment vehicles, such as repurchase agreements and commercial paper, to meet customers needs for high grade liquid investments, and investing these sources of funds and additional borrowings in assets yielding a higher rate. Fee Revenue Servicing and management fees collectively comprised approximately 62% of our total fee revenue for 2008 and 68% for 2007. These fees are a function of several factors, including the mix and volume of assets under custody and assets under management, securities positions held and the volume of portfolio transactions, and the types of products and services used by customers, and are affected by changes in worldwide equity and fixed income valuations. Generally, servicing fees are affected, in part, by changes in daily average valuations of assets under custody, while management fees are affected by changes in month end valuations of assets under management. Additional factors, such as the level of transaction volumes, changes in service level, balance credits, customer minimum balances, pricing concessions and other factors, may have a significant effect on servicing fee revenue. Generally, management fee revenue is more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue. Management fees also include performance fees, which amounted to approximately 2% of management fees for 2008 compared to 6% for 2007. Performance fees are generated when the performance of certain managed funds exceeds benchmarks specified in the management agreements, and we experience more volatility with performance fees than with more traditional management fees. In light of the above, we estimate, assuming all other factors remain constant, that a 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity values would result in a corresponding change in our total revenue of 38 Table of Contents approximately 2%. If fixed income security values were to increase or decrease by 10%, we would anticipate a corresponding change of approximately 1% in our total revenue. We would expect the above described relationships to exist in normalized financial markets. These relationships were not experienced in 2008 in light of the significant disruption in the global financial markets. Those disrupted conditions adversely affected our servicing and management fee revenues for 2008, which are based, in part, on the value of assets under custody or management as described earlier in this section. However, during 2008, in general, our trading services revenue benefited from volatility in the markets and from related increases in customer transaction volume; our securities finance revenue benefited from wider spreads, in spite of a decline in securities lending volumes caused by reduced or suspended participation by some institutional investors in the program; and our net interest revenue grew as a result of Federal Reserve rate reductions and significant increases in customer deposits. Collectively, these positive trends offset a portion of the market related impact on certain of our revenue. In addition, the acquired Investors Financial business contributed a full year of revenue in 2008 compared to six months in 2007. The following table presents selected equity market indices. Daily averages and the averages of month end indices demonstrate worldwide equity market valuation changes that affect servicing and management fee revenue, respectively. Year end indices impact the value of assets under custody and management at those dates. The index names listed in the table and elsewhere in this Managements Discussion and Analysis are service marks of their respective owners.

Servicing Fees Servicing fees include fee revenue from U.S. mutual funds, collective investment funds worldwide, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, foundations, endowments, and other investment pools. Products and services include custody; product and participant level accounting; daily pricing and administration; recordkeeping; investment manager and hedge fund manager operations outsourcing services; master trust and master custody; and performance, risk and compliance analytics. The growth in servicing fees from 2007 primarily resulted from the inclusion of an additional $232 million of servicing fee revenue from the acquired Investors Financial business, an increase of $87 million from the impact of net new business from existing and new customers and higher transaction volumes. Net new business is defined as new business net of lost business. The aggregate increase in servicing fees was partially offset by declines in daily average equity market valuations and pricing concessions. During 2008, the portion of assets under custody composed of equities, which generally earn higher fees, declined to 42% of total assets under 39 Table of Contents custody compared to 57% in 2007, reflecting the impact of declines in equity market valuations. For 2008 and 2007, servicing fees generated from customers outside the U.S. were approximately 41% of total servicing fees. We are the largest provider of mutual fund custody and accounting services in the United States. We distinguish ourselves from other mutual fund service providers by offering customers a broad array of integrated products and services, including accounting, daily pricing and fund administration. We calculate more than 38% of the U.S. mutual fund prices provided to NASDAQ that appear daily in The Wall Street Journal and other publications with an accuracy rate of 99.9%. We have a leading position for servicing U.S. tax exempt assets for corporate and public pension funds. We provide trust and valuation services for more than 5,000 daily priced portfolios, making us a leader for both monthly and daily valuation services. We are a leading service provider outside of the U.S. as well. In Germany, we provide Depotbank services for approximately 15% of retail and institutional fund assets. In the United Kingdom, we provide custody services for 15% of pension fund assets and provide administration services to more than 27% of mutual fund assets. We service approximately 21% of the hedge fund market and more than $500 billion of offshore assets, primarily domiciled in Ireland, Luxembourg and Toronto. We have more than $800 billion in assets under administration in the Asia/Pacific region, and are the largest non domestic trust bank in Japan. At year end 2008, our total assets under custody were $12.04 trillion, compared to $15.30 trillion a year earlier. The majority of the decrease compared to 2007 was the result of declines in market valuations. The value of assets under custody is a broad measure of the relative size of various markets served. Changes in the value of assets under custody do not necessarily result in proportional changes in revenue. Assets under custody consisted of the following at December 31: ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY As of December 31, 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 2007 2008AnnualGrowthRate 2004 2008CompoundAnnualGrowthRate (Dollars in billions) Mutual funds $ 3,896 $ 4,803 $ 3,738 $ 3,442 $ 3,088 (19 )% 6 % Collective funds 2,173 3,199 1,665 1,001 911 (32 ) 24 Pension products 2,784 3,960 3,713 3,358 3,254 (30 ) (4 ) Insurance and other products 3,188 3,337 2,738 2,320 2,244 (4 ) 9 Total $ 12,041 $ 15,299 $ 11,854 $ 10,121 $ 9,497 (21 ) 6 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT MIX OF ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY As of December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (In billions) Equities $ 5,003 $ 8,653 $ 5,821 Fixed income 5,014 4,087 4,035 Short term and other investments 2,024 2,559 1,998 Total $ 12,041 $ 15,299 $ 11,854 GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY(1) As of December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (In billions) United States $ 9,506 $ 11,792 $ 8,962 Other Americas 498 698 607 Europe/Middle East/Africa 1,524 2,163 1,815 Asia/Pacific 513 646 470 Total $ 12,041 $ 15,299 $ 11,854 (1) Geographic mix is based on the location where the assets are serviced. 40 Table of Contents Management Fees We provide a broad range of investment management strategies, specialized investment management advisory services and other financial services for corporations, public funds, and other sophisticated investors. These services are offered through SSgA. Based upon assets under management, SSgA is the largest manager of institutional assets worldwide, the largest manager of assets for tax exempt organizations (primarily pension plans) in the United States, and the third largest investment manager overall in the world. SSgA offers a broad array of investment management strategies, including passive and active, such as enhanced indexing and hedge fund strategies, using quantitative and fundamental methods for both U.S. and global equities and fixed income securities. SSgA also offers exchange traded funds, or ETFs, such as the SPDR&reg; Dividend ETFs. The 10% decrease in management fees from 2007 primarily resulted from declines in average month end equity market valuations and lower performance fees. Average month end equity market valuations, individually presented in the above INDEX table, were down an average of 18% compared to 2007. The decrease in performance fees from $72 million in 2007 to $21 million in 2008 was generally the result of reduced levels of assets under management subject to performance fees, and somewhat lower relative performance measured against specified benchmarks during 2008. Management fees generated from customers outside the United States were approximately 40% of total management fees for 2008, down slightly from 41% for 2007. At year end 2008, assets under management were $1.44 trillion, compared to $1.98 trillion at year end 2007. While certain management fees are directly determined by the value of assets under management and the investment strategy employed, management fees reflect other factors as well, including our relationship pricing for customers who use multiple services, and the benchmarks specified in the respective management agreements related to performance fees. Accordingly, no direct correlation necessarily exists between the value of assets under management, market indices and management fee revenue. The overall decrease in assets under management at December 31, 2008 compared to December 31, 2007 resulted from declines in market valuations and from a net loss of business, with declines in market valuations representing the substantial majority of the decrease. During 2008, we experienced an aggregate net loss of business of approximately $55 billion, compared to net new business of approximately $116 billion during 2007. Our levels of assets under management were affected by a number of factors, including investor issues related to SSgAs active fixed income strategies and the relative under performance of certain of our passive equity products. The net loss of business of $55 billion for 2008 did not reflect new business awarded to us during 2008 that had not been installed prior to December 31, 2008. This new business will be reflected in assets under management in future periods after installation. Assets under management consisted of the following at December 31: ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT As of December 31, 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 2007 2008AnnualGrowthRate 2004 2008CompoundAnnualGrowthRate (Dollars in billions) Equities: Passive $ 576 $ 803 $ 691 $ 625 $ 600 (28 )% (1 )% Active and other 91 206 181 147 122 (56 ) (7 ) Company stock/ESOP 39 79 85 76 77 (51 ) (16 ) Total equities 706 1,088 957 848 799 (35 ) (3 ) Fixed income: Passive 238 218 180 128 106 9 22 Active 32 41 34 28 35 (22 ) (2 ) Cash and money market 468 632 578 437 414 (26 ) 3 Total fixed income and cash/money market 738 891 792 593 555 (17 ) 7 Total $ 1,444 $ 1,979 $ 1,749 $ 1,441 $ 1,354 (27 ) 2 41 Table of Contents GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT(1) As of December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (In billions) United States $ 1,020 $ 1,353 $ 1,202 Other Americas 24 36 30 Europe/Middle East/Africa 272 427 384 Asia/Pacific 128 163 133 Total $ 1,444 $ 1,979 $ 1,749 (1) Geographic mix is based on the location where the assets are managed.

We offer a complete range of foreign exchange services under an account model that focuses on the global requirements of our customers for our proprietary research and to execute trades in any time zone. Foreign exchange trading revenue is influenced by three principal factors: the volume and type of customer foreign exchange transactions; currency volatility; and the management of currency market risks. For 2008, foreign exchange trading revenue totaled $1.08 billion for 2008, a 35% increase from 2007 revenue of $802 million, and benefited from the continued disruption in the global securities markets. The increase was mainly driven by a 92% increase in currency volatility, but also included an increase of $45 million of foreign exchange revenue attributable to the inclusion of a full year of revenue of the acquired Investors Financial business compared to two quarters for 2007. Aggregate customer volumes were relatively flat compared to 2007. We also offer a range of brokerage and other trading products tailored specifically to meet the needs of the global pension community, including transition management, commission recapture and self directed brokerage. These products are differentiated by our position as an agent of the institutional investor. Brokerage and other trading fees of $385 million were up 10% compared to 2007 revenue of $350 million. The increase was attributable to higher electronic trading revenues from both the acquired Currenex business and from our Global Link product, as well as an increase in brokerage revenue, principally transition management and equity trading. This increase was partially offset by a decline in trading profits. Securities Finance Securities finance provides liquidity to the financial markets and an effective means for customers to earn revenue on their existing portfolios. By acting as a lending agent and coordinating loans between lenders and borrowers, we lend securities and provide liquidity to customers around the world. Borrowers provide collateral in the form of cash or securities to State Street in return for loaned securities. For cash collateral, we pay a usage fee to the provider of the cash collateral, and invest the cash collateral in certain investment vehicles or managed accounts. The spread between the yield on the investment vehicle and the usage fee paid to the provider of the collateral is split between the lender of the securities and State Street as agent. For non cash collateral, the borrower pays a fee for the loaned securities, and the fee is split between the lender of the securities and State Street. Securities finance revenue is principally a function of the volume of securities on loan and the interest rate spreads earned on the underlying collateral. For 2008, securities finance revenue increased 81% from a year earlier, primarily as a result of wider credit spreads across all lending programs, partially offset by a decrease in 42 Table of Contents lending volumes. Spreads benefited from the Federal Reserves aggregate 400 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate during 2008, as well as continued disruption of the global fixed income securities markets. Beginning in the third quarter of 2008, a number of institutional investors suspended or limited their participation in our securities lending program, resulting in lower lending volumes. The decreased lending volumes are expected to continue as long as this suspended or limited participation continues. During 2008, we experienced significant withdrawal activity from the underlying collateral pools, primarily to allow the lending programs to meet mark to market changes in collateral agreements caused by declines in the values of securities on loan or the return of borrowed securities, with a net reduction of the value of securities on loan from June 30, 2008 to December 31, 2008 of approximately 41%. We were able to manage these outflows of cash collateral, as well as the impact of the disruptions in the credit markets, in a manner that substantially reduced the risk of loss to our customers. However, we imposed limitations on withdrawals from our lending programs in order to manage the liquidity in the cash collateral pools, and the net asset value of our cash collateral pools, determined using market valuations, has fallen below $1.00 per unit. We cannot determine how long these limitations will remain in place, nor can we determine how long market illiquidity will continue to affect the valuation of the collateral pools. The continuation of either trend could materially affect the longer term prospects for our securities lending business. We continue to distinguish our securities lending program from those of our competitors due to the absence to date of realized credit losses with respect to our program. Processing Fees and Other Processing fees and other revenue includes diverse types of fees and other revenue, including fees from our structured products business, fees from software licensing and maintenance, equity income from joint venture investments, gains and losses on sales of leased equipment and other assets, and amortization of investments in tax advantaged financings. Processing fees and other revenue were relatively flat compared to 2007, with the benefit of two additional quarters of revenue from the acquired Investors Financial business for 2008 compared to 2007, offset by lower levels of equity income from joint venture investments.

Additional information about the AMLF is provided in note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. (2) Interest revenue for loans and leases for the year ended December 31, 2008 reflects a cumulative reduction of $98 million recorded in connection with our SILO lease transactions. Additional information about our SILO lease transactions is provided in note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. (3) Amounts include fully taxable equivalent adjustments of $104 million for 2008, $58 million for 2007 and $45 million for 2006. Net interest revenue is defined as the total of interest revenue earned on interest earning assets less interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities. Interest earning assets, which consist of investment securities, loans and leases and other liquid assets, are financed primarily by customer deposits and short term borrowings. Net interest margin represents the relationship between net interest revenue and average interest earning assets. Changes in the components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are discussed in more detail below. Additional detail about the components of interest revenue and interest expense is in note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. For 2008, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, net interest revenue increased 54% (53% on a GAAP basis) compared to 2007, and net interest margin increased to 2.08% from 1.71%. This growth was generally the result of widening spreads on fixed rate investment securities and tax exempt investment securities, as well as added interest earning assets and related net interest revenue from the acquired Investors Financial business. Average transaction deposit volumes, particularly non U.S. deposits, increased 18% for 2008 compared to 2007, primarily the result of customers accumulation of cash balances during the third and fourth quarters of 2008 to build liquidity. Average federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements decreased 10% or $1.51 billion, from $14.40 billion in 2007 to $12.90 billion for 2008. The decrease was mainly due to a re allocation of liquidity to U.S. Treasury securities. Our average investment securities portfolio increased from approximately $70.99 billion for 2007 to approximately $72.23 billion for 2008, primarily due to the acquisition of the investment securities of Investors Financial offset by limited re investment and net run off in the aggregate portfolio, as liquidity was increased in response to the dislocation in the financial markets, and by lower market valuations in the available for sale portfolio. On average, for 2008, the investment portfolio included a lower percentage of collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage and asset backed securities compared to a year earlier, and a higher percentage of U.S. Treasury securities. We continued to invest conservatively in AA and AAA rated securities. Securities rated AA and AAA comprised approximately 89% of the investment securities portfolio, with approximately 78% AAA rated, at December 31, 2008. Loans and leases averaged $11.88 billion for 2008, up 11% from $10.75 billion for 2007. The increase was related to higher levels of customer overdraft activity, particularly U.S. overdrafts. Approximately 67% of the loan and lease portfolio was composed of U.S. and non U.S. short duration advances that provide liquidity to customers in support of their transaction flows, which averaged approximately $8.00 billion for 2008, up from $7.53 billion in 2007. Average other interest earning assets increased $18.02 billion, or 214%, to $26.43 billion in 2008 compared to 2007. The increase was primarily due to an increase in interest bearing deposits with banks. An average of $6.4 billion was held at the Federal Reserve Bank, which resulted from our investment of excess cash in short term money market instruments as the financial markets disruption escalated in the second half of 2008. Our average interest bearing deposits increased $11.29 billion, or 17%, from $68.22 billion in 2007 to $79.51 billion for 2008. The increase was mainly attributable to the acquisition of Investors Financial and an increase in non U.S. transaction accounts. The growth in deposits was a significant contributor to the overall increase in average interest earning assets. 44 Table of Contents Average other short term borrowings decreased $741 million, or 3%, to $21.28 billion for 2008, primarily due to higher customer deposits. Average long term debt increased $704 million, or 21%, to $4.1 billion for 2008 due to a debt issuance in mid 2007 and an additional debt issuance in the first quarter of 2008 to enhance our regulatory capital position. Additional information about our long term debt is provided in note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. Several factors could affect future levels of net interest revenue and margin, including the mix of customer liabilities, actions of the various central banks, changes in U.S. and non U.S. interest rates, and the shapes of the various yield curves around the world. In addition, we expect that our actions announced in February 2009 with respect to our plan to improve our tangible common equity, described earlier under Financial Highlights, and which include the reinvestment of investment securities paying down and maturing during 2009 into interest bearing deposits and a resulting reduction in the size of our consolidated balance sheet, will reduce net interest revenue and margin for 2009. Gains (Losses) Related to Investment Securities, Net We recorded net gains of $68 million from sales of available for sale securities for 2008, compared to a net gain of $7 million in 2007. In addition, we recorded other than temporary impairment of $122 million in 2008, compared to $34 million in 2007, which resulted from our impairment analysis process. Management regularly reviews the investment securities portfolio to determine whether it expects any loss of principal or interest, in light of current market and economic conditions, consideration of pertinent information and related expectations. As a result of this process, management identified securities that it believed were other than temporarily impaired. Additional information about available for sale securities, and the gross gains and losses that compose the net sale gains, is in the Financial Condition section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis and in note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. Gain on Sale of CitiStreet Interest, Net of Exit and Other Associated Costs On July 1, 2008, we completed the sale of our 50% joint venture interest in CitiStreet, a benefits servicing business that provides retirement plan recordkeeping and administrative services and at that date had approximately $220 billion in assets under administration on behalf of corporate and government entities, employee unions and other customers. The premium received in connection with the sale was $407 million, and we recorded a resulting pre tax gain of $350 million in our consolidated statement of income during the third quarter of 2008, net of exit and other associated costs incurred in connection with the sale. These costs totaled $57 million, and consisted of incentive compensation of $30 million, professional fees of $10 million, and other related costs of $17 million.

These increases were partly offset by a decline in incentive compensation. The increase in information systems and communications expense for 2008 included an additional $40 million in expenses from the acquired Investors Financial business compared to 2007, as well as an increase in spending on telecommunications hardware and software. Transaction processing services expenses are volume related, and include equity trading services and fees related to securities settlement, sub custodian services and external contract services. The increase over 2007 resulted primarily from higher transaction volumes and external contract services, primarily in Europe. Occupancy expense increased from 2007, primarily due to additional leased space acquired to support growth in the hedge funds servicing and investment manager operations outsourcing businesses, as well as higher occupancy costs in support of growth in Europe, including our new facility in the U.K. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded a net pre tax charge of $467 million in connection with the establishment of a reserve to address litigation exposure and other costs associated with certain active fixed income strategies managed by SSgA and customer concerns as to whether the execution of these strategies was consistent with customers investment intent. The net charge had the following components: a provision for legal exposure of $625 million offset by $25 million of insurance coverage (net provision of $600 million); a $156 million reduction of salaries and benefits expense related to reduced incentive compensation primarily associated with SSgA, offset by $15 million of severance costs; and $8 million of other expenses related to professional fees. Information with respect to activity in the balance sheet reserve during 2008 is provided in note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we elected to provide support to certain investment accounts managed by SSgA through the purchase of asset and mortgage backed securities and a cash infusion, which resulted in a charge of $450 million. These accounts, offered to retirement plans, allow participants to purchase and redeem units at a constant net asset value regardless of volatility in the underlying value of the assets held by the account. The accounts enter into contractual arrangements with independent third party financial institutions that agree to make up any shortfall in the account if all the units are redeemed at the constant net asset value. The financial institutions have the right, under certain circumstances, to terminate this guarantee with respect to future investments in the account. During 2008, the liquidity and pricing issues in the fixed income markets adversely affected the market value of the securities in these accounts to the point that the third party guarantors considered terminating their financial guarantees with the accounts. Although we were not statutorily or contractually obligated to do so, we elected to purchase approximately $2.49 billion of asset and mortgage backed securities from these accounts that had been identified as presenting increased risk in the current market environment and to contribute an aggregate of $450 million to the accounts to improve the ratio of the market value of the accounts portfolio holdings to the book value of the accounts. We have no ongoing commitment or intent to provide support to these accounts. The asset and mortgage backed securities are carried in investment securities available for sale in our consolidated statement of condition. In December 2008, we announced a plan to reduce our operating costs and support our long term growth while aligning the organization to meet the challenges and opportunities presented by the current market environment. As a primary component of this plan, we initiated a reduction of approximately 7% of our global workforce, which reduction we expect to be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of 2009. In connection with this plan, during the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded aggregate restructuring charges of $306 million. We expect that this plan will result in an annualized reduction of our expenses from operations of between $375 million and $400 million. Additional information with respect to the charges, and activity during 2008 in the related balance sheet reserve, is provided in note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. 46 Table of Contents During 2008, in connection with the Investors Financial acquisition, we recorded merger and integration costs of $115 million compared to $198 million for 2007. These costs consisted only of direct and incremental costs to integrate the acquired Investors Financial business into our operations, and did not include ongoing expenses of the combined organization. The costs were primarily related to employee retention and system and customer integration. During the third quarter of 2008, we recorded a $200 million reserve to provide for our estimated net exposure on an indemnification obligation associated with collateralized repurchase agreements with an affiliate of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., or Lehman Brothers. In September and October 2008, Lehman Brothers and certain of its affiliates filed for bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings. While we had no unsecured financial exposure to Lehman Brothers or its affiliates, we indemnified certain customers in connection with these and other collateralized repurchase agreements with Lehman Brothers entities. In the then current market environment, the market value of the underlying collateral had declined. To the extent that these declines resulted in collateral value falling below the indemnification obligation, we recorded a reserve. The reserve was based on the cost of satisfying the indemnification obligation net of the fair value of the collateral. We purchased the collateral, composed of commercial real estate loans, during the fourth quarter of 2008 as described in the Loans and Lease Financing section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. We had other customer indemnification obligations under a collateralized repurchase agreement with another Lehman Brothers entity. In these cases, the fair value of the collateral at the time we committed to take possession of it was equal to or greater than the associated indemnification obligation and therefore no related reserve was recorded. We will continue to evaluate these assets and collateral and determine whether to dispose of them or hold them to maturity. The market value of these assets and collateral will continue to fluctuate and ultimately may be less than the value of our indemnification obligations. The increase in aggregate other expenses (professional services, securities processing, amortization of other intangible assets, regulator fees and assessments and other) from $806 million for 2007 to $1.196 billion for 2008 resulted from a 53% increase in professional services spending, primarily legal and consulting costs, amortization of other intangible assets for the full year in connection with the acquisitions of Investors Financial and Currenex, higher securities processing costs and higher regulatory fees and assessments, the latter mainly fees and assessments paid in connection with our participation in certain federal government and banking regulatory agency programs described earlier in the Impact of Securities Markets Disruption and Government Actions section. Income Taxes Income tax expense totaled $1.031 billion for 2008, compared to $642 million from continuing operations a year ago. Our overall effective tax rate for 2008 was 36.2%, compared to 33.7% for 2007. The increase in income tax expense was generally the result of a higher level of pre tax earnings for 2008, partly offset by a net income tax benefit related to the aggregate pre tax impact of the significant transactions outside of the ordinary course of our business described earlier under Financial Highlights. Information about income tax contingencies related to our leveraged lease portfolio is provided in note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. LINE OF BUSINESS INFORMATION We report two lines of business: Investment Servicing and Investment Management. Given our services and management organization, the results of operations for these lines of business are not necessarily comparable with those of other companies, including companies in the financial services industry. Information about revenue, expense and capital allocation methodologies is in note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. 47 Table of Contents The following is a summary of our line of business results. The amounts in the Divestitures columns represent the operating results of our joint venture interest in CitiStreet prior to the sale in July 2008. The amounts presented in the Other column for 2008 represent the net interest revenue associated with our participation in the AMLF; the gain on the sale of our joint venture interest in CitiStreet; the restructuring charges recorded primarily in connection with our plan to reduce our expenses from operations; the provision related to our estimated net exposure for customer indemnification associated with collateralized repurchase agreements; and the merger and integration costs recorded in connection with our acquisition of Investors Financial.

Servicing fees increased primarily due to the contribution of fees from the acquired Investors Financial business, increases from net new business from existing and new customers and higher customer transaction volumes. The increase in trading services revenue reflected an increase in foreign exchange trading revenue, as we benefited from the continued disruption in the global securities markets and the resulting increase in currency volatility, as well as increases in electronic trading revenues from the acquired Currenex business and from our Global Link product. Securities finance revenue increased as a result of wider credit spreads across all lending programs, as well as the impact of the acquired Investors Financial business, offset by a decrease in lending volumes. Servicing fees, trading services revenue and gains (losses) related to investment securities, net for our Investment Servicing business line are identical to the respective consolidated results. Refer to the Servicing Fees, Trading Services and Gains (Losses) Related to Investment Securities, Net captions in the Total Revenue section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis for a more in depth discussion. A discussion of processing fees and other revenue is provided under the caption Processing Fees and Other in the Total Revenue section. Net interest revenue increased 57% from 2007 due to wider spreads on fixed and floating rate investment securities and tax exempt investment securities, as well as added interest earning assets and related net interest revenue from the acquired Investors Financial business. A portion of net interest revenue is recorded in the Investment Management business line based on the volume of customer liabilities attributable to that business. Expenses from operations increased from 2007, primarily attributable to increased salaries and benefits costs, which reflected the expenses of the acquired Investors Financial business, as well as increase in staffing levels to support business growth, and higher levels of professional services spending. Information systems and communications expenses increased due to additional expenses from the acquired Investors Financial business, as well as higher spending on telecommunications and higher software amortization costs. Other expenses increased due to higher levels of professional services spending, increased amortization of other intangible assets that resulted from the Investors Financial acquisition and regulatory fees and assessments associated with our participation in certain government programs. Investment Management Total revenue for 2008 increased 2% from 2007, reflecting a 102% increase in securities finance revenue, partly offset by a 10% decline in management fees and a 23% decline in net interest revenue. Management fees for the Investment Management business line are identical to the respective consolidated results. Refer to the Management Fees caption in the Total Revenue section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis for a more in depth discussion. Increase in securities finance revenue benefited primarily from wider credit spreads. Expenses from operations of $1.13 billion increased 16% from 2007, primarily due to the cost of increases in staffing levels to support growth in business, higher occupancy costs and related increases in information systems and communications expenses. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we elected to provide support to certain investment accounts managed by SSgA through the purchase of asset and mortgage backed securities and a cash infusion, which resulted in a charge of $450 million. These accounts, offered to retirement plans, enter into contractual arrangements with third party financial institutions that agree to make up any shortfall in the account if all the units are redeemed at the constant net asset value. The financial institutions have the right, under certain circumstances, to terminate this guarantee with respect to future investments in the account. During 2008, the liquidity and pricing issues in the fixed income markets adversely impacted the market value of the securities in these accounts to the point that the third party guarantors considered terminating their financial guarantees with the accounts. Although we were not statutorily or contractually obligated to do so, we elected to purchase approximately $2.49 billion of 49 Table of Contents securities from these accounts that had been identified as presenting increased risk in the current market environment and to contribute an aggregate of $450 million to the accounts to improve the ratio of the market value of the accounts portfolio holdings to the book value of the accounts. More information about these charges are included in the Consolidated Results of Operations Expenses section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. In 2007, the net pre tax charge of $514 million ($467 million excluding related reduction of incentive compensation of $47 million allocated to Investment Servicing) was recorded in connection with the establishment of a reserve to address legal exposure and other costs associated with the under performance of certain active fixed income strategies managed by SSgA and customer concerns as to whether the execution of these strategies was consistent with the customers investment intent. The net charge had the following components: a provision for legal exposure of $625 million offset by $25 million of insurance coverage; a $109 million reduction of salaries and benefits expense related to reduced incentive compensation offset by $15 million of severance costs; and $8 million of other expenses related to professional fees. More information about the consolidated net pre tax charge of $467 million is included in the Consolidated Results of Operations Expenses section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. The pre tax margin for Investment Management, which is the percentage of the business lines pre tax income to its total revenue, was (2)% for 2008 compared to 2% for 2007 and 34% for 2006. The significant decreases in margin were the result of the impact of the charges described above. Without the charges, Investment Managements pre tax income for 2008 and 2007 would have been $414 million ($(36) million plus $450 million) and $538 million ($24 million plus $514 million), and its pre tax margin would have been 27% for 2008 and 36% for 2007. 50 Table of Contents COMPARISON OF 2007 AND 2006 OVERVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 %Change (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Total fee revenue $ 6,633 $ 5,186 28 % Net interest revenue 1,730 1,110 56 Gains (Losses) related to investment securities, net (27 ) 15 Total revenue 8,336 6,311 32 Total expenses 6,433 4,540 42 Income from continuing operations before income tax expense 1,903 1,771 7 Income tax expense from continuing operations 642 675 (5 ) Income from continuing operations 1,261 1,096 15 Income from discontinued operations 10 Net income $ 1,261 $ 1,106 14 Earnings per common share from continuing operations: Basic $ 3.50 $ 3.31 6 Diluted 3.45 3.26 6 Earnings per common share: Basic $ 3.50 $ 3.34 Diluted 3.45 3.29 Return on common shareholders equity from continuing operations 13.4 % 16.2 % Return on common shareholders equity 13.4 % 16.4 % The income from discontinued operations in 2006 of $10 million, or $.03 per share, resulted from the finalization of legal, selling and other costs recorded in connection with our previously disclosed divestiture of Bel Air Investment Advisers LLC.

The increase in servicing fees was the result of the inclusion of servicing fee revenue from the acquired Investors Financial business, the impact of net new business from existing and new customers, higher average equity market valuations and higher customer transaction volumes. Approximately 41% of our servicing fees were derived from non U.S. customers in 2007, down from 44% in 2006. The decrease in the non U.S. proportion reflected the contribution of servicing fees from the acquired Investors Financial business, which are generated predominately in the U.S. Assets under custody increased to $15.30 trillion at December 31, 2007, up 29% from $11.85 trillion a year earlier, with the majority of the increase the result of the addition of assets under custody of the acquired Investors Financial business. The increase in management fees from 2006 primarily resulted from the impact of net new business on 2007 revenue and higher equity market valuations. Approximately 41% of management fees were derived from customers outside the U.S. in 2007, up from 32% for 2006. Assets under management increased to $1.98 trillion at December 31, 2007, up $230 billion from $1.75 trillion a year earlier. The growth in trading services revenue, which includes foreign exchange trading and brokerage and other trading revenue, reflected an increase in foreign exchange trading revenue of $191 million, primarily due to increased customer volumes, but also the result of the inclusion of $43 million of foreign exchange revenue from the acquired Investors Financial business. Brokerage and other fees increased from $251 million in 2006, up 39% to $350 million in 2007 due to the contribution of revenue from the acquired Currenex business and an increase in revenue from transition management. The increase in securities finance revenue reflected the effect of increased loan volumes resulting from both new customer demands and increased demand from existing customers. Spreads also increased, primarily in the domestic and non U.S. equity portfolios and the corporate bond and fixed income portfolios. Spreads benefited from reductions in federal funds rates during 2007. The increase in net interest revenue was the result of several favorable trends. Transaction deposit volume increased, particularly with respect to non U.S. deposits. Volume increases resulted from net new business in non U.S. assets under custody, and spreads increased because deposit rates lagged rate increases by foreign central banks during 2007. The acquired Investors Financial business added interest earning assets and related net interest revenue. Finally, as fixed rate investment securities matured, they were replaced by higher yielding investments. EXPENSES Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 % Change (Dollars in millions) Salaries and employee benefits $ 3,256 $ 2,652 23 % Information systems and communications 546 501 9 Transaction processing services 619 496 25 Occupancy 408 373 9 Provision for legal exposure 600 Merger and integration costs 198 Professional services 236 157 50 Amortization of other intangible assets 92 43 114 Other 478 318 50 Total expenses $ 6,433 $ 4,540 42 The increase in salaries and employee benefits was driven primarily by the inclusion of salaries and benefits expense of the acquired Investors Financial and Currenex businesses, higher incentive compensation costs due to improved performance, which were offset by the reduction of incentive compensation recorded as part of the net 52 Table of Contents pre tax charge related to SSgA and the impact of higher staffing levels associated with the growth of our Investment Servicing business, particularly in Europe, and in our Investment Management business, as well as in information technology and risk management. Information systems and communications expense increased due to the addition of expenses of the acquired Investors Financial business as well as increased spending internationally to support growth. Transaction processing services expenses, which in large part are volume related, include equity trading services and fees related to securities settlement, sub custodian fees and external contract services. The increase resulted from the addition of approximately $39 million of expenses from the acquired Investors Financial business, specifically sub custody costs, as well as higher transaction volumes, and external contract services, primarily in Europe. Occupancy expense increased primarily due to additional leased space acquired as part of the Investors Financial acquisition, as well as higher occupancy costs in support of growth in Europe. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded a net pre tax charge of $467 million in connection with the establishment of a reserve to address litigation exposure and other costs associated with certain active fixed income strategies managed by SSgA and customer concerns as to whether the execution of these strategies was consistent with customers investment intent. In connection with the Investors Financial acquisition, we recorded merger and integration costs of $198 million in the second half of 2007. These costs consisted only of direct and incremental costs to integrate the acquired Investors Financial business into our operations, and did not include ongoing expenses of the combined organization. The increase in other expenses was primarily due to the acquired Investors Financial business, increases in professional services, securities processing costs, higher sales promotion costs and increased amortization of intangibles that resulted from the acquisition of the Investors Financial and Currenex businesses. Income Taxes The decrease in income tax expense from continuing operations for 2007 compared to 2006 resulted from the absence of the impact of federal tax legislation that increased income tax expense for 2006. The overall effective tax rate for 2007 was 33.7% compared to 38.1% for 2006. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. The majority of these accounting policies do not involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates in their application, or the variability of the estimates is not material to the consolidated financial statements. However, certain of these accounting policies, by their nature, require management to make judgments, involving significant estimates and assumptions, about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements, and changes in this information over time could materially affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported in subsequent financial statements. Based on the sensitivity of reported financial statement amounts to the underlying policies, estimates and assumptions, the relatively more significant accounting policies applied by State Street have been identified by management as accounting for fair value measurements; accounting for special purpose entities; and accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets. These policies require the most subjective or complex judgments, and related estimates and assumptions could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. An understanding of the judgments, estimates and assumptions underlying these accounting policies is essential in order to understand our reported consolidated financial condition and results of operations. 53 Table of Contents The following is a brief discussion of the above mentioned significant accounting policies. Management of State Street has discussed these significant accounting estimates with the Examining and Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Fair Value Measurements We carry certain of our financial assets and liabilities at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, including trading account assets, investment securities available for sale and various types of derivative instruments. As discussed in further detail below, changes in the fair value of these financial assets and liabilities are recorded either as components of our consolidated statement of income, or as components of other comprehensive income within shareholders equity in our consolidated statement of condition. In addition to those financial assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value in our consolidated financial statements, we disclose the fair value in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of certain other of our financial assets and liabilities that are carried at amortized cost in our consolidated statement of condition. We estimate the fair value of all of these financial assets and liabilities using the definition of fair value described below. At December 31, 2008, approximately $66.92 billion of our assets and approximately $12.36 billion of our liabilities were carried at fair value, compared to $75.43 billion and $4.57 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2007. The amounts at December 31, 2008 represented approximately 39% of our consolidated total assets and approximately 8% of our consolidated total liabilities, compared to 53% and 3%, respectively, at December 31, 2007. The decrease in the relative percentages as of December 31, 2008, compared to December 31, 2007, resulted primarily from a significant increase in our consolidated total assets, which increase was mostly due to the impact of higher levels of customer deposits and the purchase of asset backed commercial paper under the previously discussed AMLF during 2008, neither of which is carried at fair value. As described in more detail in note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, effective January 1, 2008. The standard does not require the measurement of our financial assets and liabilities at fair value, but provides a consistent definition of fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP. Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. We have not elected the fair value option for any of our financial assets or financial liabilities since our adoption of the standard, although we may do so in the future. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. When we measure fair value for our financial assets and liabilities, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. When possible, we look to active and observable markets to measure the fair value of identical, or similar, financial assets or liabilities. When identical financial assets and liabilities are not traded in active markets, we look to market observable data for similar assets and liabilities. In some instances, certain assets and liabilities are not actively traded in observable markets, and as a result we use alternative valuation techniques to measure their fair value. In accordance with the standard, we categorize the financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value in our consolidated statement of condition based upon the standards three level valuation hierarchy. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1) and the lowest priority to valuation methods using significant unobservable inputs (level 3). We categorized approximately 15% of our financial assets carried at fair value in level 1, 70% in level 2 and 15% in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, including the effect of master netting agreements. We categorized approximately 93% of our financial liabilities carried at fair value in level 2, with the remaining 7% in level 3, including the effect of master netting agreements. 54 Table of Contents The fair value of the investment securities categorized in level 1 was composed of U.S. Treasury securities, specifically Treasury bills, which have a maturity of one year or less. Fair value was measured by management using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical securities. The fair value of the investment securities categorized in level 2 was measured by management primarily using information obtained from independent third parties. Information obtained from third parties is subject to review by management as part of a continuous validation process. Management has developed a process to review information provided by third parties, including an understanding of underlying assumptions and the level of market participant information used to support those assumptions. In addition, management compares significant assumptions used by third parties to available market information. Such information may include known trades or, to the extent that trading activity is limited, comparisons to market research information pertaining to credit expectations, execution prices and the timing of cash flows. The fair value of the derivative instruments categorized in level 2 predominantly represented foreign exchange contracts used in our trading activities, for which fair value was measured by management using discounted cash flow techniques with inputs consisting of observable spot and forward points, as well as observable interest rate curves. With respect to derivative instruments, we evaluated the impact on valuation of the credit risk of our counterparties and our own credit. We considered factors such as the likelihood of default by us and our counterparties, our net exposures and remaining maturities in determining the appropriate measurements of fair value. Valuation adjustments associated with these factors were not significant for 2008. While the substantial majority of our financial assets categorized in level 3 were composed of asset backed securities available for sale, primarily securities collateralized by student loans, level 3 also included trading account assets, composed of corporate debt securities, and foreign exchange options. The categorization of asset backed securities in level 3 as of December 31, 2008 was significantly influenced by current conditions, including reduced levels of liquidity, in the fixed income securities markets. Little or no market activity for these securities occurred during the fourth quarter of 2008, and as a result of the lack of price transparency, we measured their fair value using unobservable pricing inputs, such as spread indices and non binding quotes received directly from third parties. These inputs were subject to managements review and were determined to be appropriate based on individual facts and circumstances. Generally, we obtain non binding quotes from market specialists for each individual security as necessary. Given the unique nature of each underlying security structure, it is not practical or useful to obtain multiple quotes for individual securities. The aggregate fair value of our financial assets and liabilities categorized in level 3 as of December 31, 2008, compared to January 1, 2008, increased approximately 48%. The change resulted primarily from purchases of corporate debt securities and transfers in of investment securities available for sale, principally student loan backed securities, partly offset by unrealized losses on available for sale securities recorded in other comprehensive income and the reclassification of certain classes of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations to level 2. Special Purpose Entities In the normal course of business, we utilize three types of special purpose entities, referred to as SPEs. One type of SPE is utilized in connection with our involvement as collateral manager with respect to managed investment vehicles, and is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. A second type of SPE is utilized in connection with our tax exempt investment program, and is recorded in our consolidated financial statements, since we treat the underlying transactions as secured borrowings, not as sales. Additional information about the activities of these SPEs is provided in notes 11 and 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. Additional information about the third type of SPE, used in connection with our commercial paper program, is provided below. In our role as a financial intermediary, we administer four third party asset backed commercial paper conduits, which are structured as bankruptcy remote, limited liability companies, and which are not included in our consolidated financial statements. These conduits purchase a variety of financial assets from third party financial institutions, and fund these purchases by issuing commercial paper. The financial assets purchased by 55 Table of Contents the conduits are not originated by us, and we do not hold any equity ownership interest in the conduits. Detailed information about the conduits and their business activities is provided in note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. During the first quarter of 2008, pursuant to the contractual terms of our liquidity asset purchase agreements with the four unconsolidated asset backed commercial paper conduits that we administer, we were required to purchase $850 million of conduit assets. The purchase was the result of various factors, including the continued illiquidity in the commercial paper markets. The securities were purchased at prices determined in accordance with existing contractual terms in the liquidity asset purchase agreements, and which exceeded their fair value. Accordingly, during the first quarter of 2008, the securities were written down to fair value through a $12 million reduction of processing fees and other revenue in our consolidated statement of income, and are carried at fair value in securities available for sale in our consolidated statement of condition. None of our liquidity asset purchase agreements with the conduits was drawn upon during the remainder of 2008, and no draw downs on the standby letters of credit occurred during 2008. We sometimes purchase commercial paper from the conduits to support their liquidity. As the disruption in the financial markets continued through 2008, our support of the conduits liquidity resulted in our purchasing historically high levels of commercial paper from them. On December 31, 2008 and 2007, we held $230 million and $2 million, respectively, of commercial paper issued by the conduits in trading account assets in our consolidated balance sheet. The amount held at December 31, 2008 did not include $5.70 billion sold by the conduits to the Federal Reserves CPFF. The highest total overnight position (including AMLF) in the conduits commercial paper held by us during the year ended December 31, 2008, was approximately $9.22 billion. The average total overnight position (including AMLF) for the same period was approximately $2.27 billion. As of February 25, 2009, we held $5.97 billion of the conduits commercial paper and $7.70 billion had been sold by the conduits to the Federal Reserves CPFF. The CPFF is currently scheduled to expire for new issuances on October 30, 2009. The weighted average maturity of the conduits commercial paper in the aggregate was approximately 25 days as of December 31, 2008, compared to approximately 20 days as of December 31, 2007. Our accounting for the conduits activities, and our conclusion that we are not required to include each or all of the conduits assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements, is based on our application of the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), which governs our accounting for the conduits and which is discussed in more detail in note 12. Expected losses, which we estimate using a financial model as described below, form the basis for our application of the provisions of FIN 46(R). Expected losses, as defined by FIN 46(R), are not economic losses. Instead, expected losses are calculated by comparing projected possible cash flows, which are probability weighted, with expected cash flows for the risk(s) the entity was designed to create and distribute; they represent the variability in potential cash flows of the entitys designated risks. We believe that credit risk is the predominant risk that is designed to be created and distributed by these entities. The conduits also have a modest amount of basis risk. Basis risk arises when commercial paper funding costs change at a different rate than the comparable floating rate asset benchmark rates (generally LIBOR). This risk is managed through the use of derivative instruments, principally basis swaps, which mitigate this variability for each conduit. Any credit losses of the conduits would be absorbed by (1) investors in the subordinated debt, commonly referred to as first loss notes, issued by the conduits; (2) State Street or other providers of liquidity or credit enhancement; and (3) the holders of the conduits commercial paper, in that order of priority. The investors in the first loss notes, which are independent third parties, would absorb the first dollar of any credit loss on the conduits assets. If credit losses exceeded the first loss notes, we would absorb credit losses through our credit facilities provided to the conduits. The commercial paper holders would absorb credit losses after the first loss notes and State Streets and other providers credit facilities have been exhausted. We have developed a financial model to estimate and allocate each conduits expected losses. This model has determined that, as of December 31, 2008, the amount of first loss notes of each conduit held by the third party investors causes them to absorb a majority of each conduits expected losses, as defined by FIN 46(R), and, accordingly, the investors in the first loss notes are considered to be the primary beneficiary of the conduits. The aggregate amount of first loss notes issued by the conduits totaled approximately $67 million as of December 31, 2008. 56 Table of Contents In order to estimate expected losses as required by FIN 46(R), we estimate possible defaults of the conduits assets. These expected losses are allocated to the conduits variable interest holders based on the order in which actual losses would be absorbed, as described above. We use the model to estimate expected losses based on hundreds of thousands of probability weighted loss scenarios. These simulations incorporate published credit rating agency data to estimate expected losses due to credit risk. Primary assumptions incorporated into the financial model relative to credit risk variability, such as default probabilities and loss severities, are directly linked to the conduits underlying assets. These default probabilities and loss severity assumptions vary by asset class and ratings of individual conduit assets. Accordingly, the models calculation of expected losses is significantly affected by the credit ratings and asset mix of each conduits assets. These statistics are periodically reviewed by management. If downgrades and asset mix change significantly, or if defaults occur on the conduits underlying assets, we may conclude that the current level of first loss notes is insufficient to absorb a majority of the conduits expected losses. We perform stress tests and sensitivity analyses on each conduit individually, to model potential scenarios that could cause the amount of first loss notes to be insufficient to absorb the majority of the conduits expected losses. As part of these analyses, we have identified certain conduit assets that could be more susceptible to credit downgrade because of their underlying credit characteristics. Our scenario testing specifically addresses asset classes that have experienced significant price erosion and or have little observed market activity. Examples of scenarios that are designed to measure the sensitivity of the sufficiency of the first loss notes include performing a downgrade of all assets which have underlying monoline insurance provider support, and a downgrade scenario on certain other conduit securities where our analysis of the timing and amount of expected cash flows for selected security default expectations does not re affirm the securitys current external credit rating. These simulations do not include a scenario whereby all positions are simultaneously downgraded, the possibility of which we consider remote. In addition, a scenario could arise where one or more defaults could be so severe that the associated losses would exhaust the conduits total first loss notes currently outstanding. Certain of the conduits hold asset backed securities that have the benefit of a third party guarantee from a financial guaranty insurance company. The aggregate amortized cost of securities with underlying guarantees was approximately $2.49 billion at December 31, 2008 and $3.51 billion at December 31, 2007. Certain of these securities, which totaled approximately $730 million at December 31, 2008, are currently drawing on the underlying guarantees in order to make contractual principal and interest payments to the conduits. In these cases, the performance of the underlying security is highly dependent on the performance of the guarantor. In calculating expected losses, these securities carry the higher of the underlying security rating or the rating of the third party guarantor. During 2008, many of these guarantors experienced ratings downgrades. The credit ratings of the guarantors ranged from AAA to CCC as of December 31, 2008. None of these securities are in default. In the future, as a result of our stress tests, if the determination and allocation of conduit expected losses by the financial model indicates that the then existing level of first loss notes would be insufficient to absorb a majority of the conduits expected losses, we would be required to either (1) issue additional first loss notes to third parties; (2) change the composition of conduit assets; or (3) take other actions in order to avoid being determined to be the primary beneficiary of the conduits on the date of determination. Under existing accounting standards, if we were determined to be the primary beneficiary of the conduits and were required to consolidate the conduits into our consolidated financial statements, based on changes in assumptions or future events, the conduits assets and liabilities would be consolidated at their respective fair values. We would recognize a loss if the fair value of the conduits aggregate liabilities and first loss notes exceeded the fair value of their aggregate assets. Management believes that this loss would be recovered in future periods; as with our investment securities portfolio, we expect that we would collect substantially all principal and interest on the assets according to their underlying contractual terms. The fair value of the conduits aggregate liabilities and first loss notes exceeded the fair value of their aggregate assets by $3.56 billion after tax at December 31, 2008. Based on the difference in the fair value of the conduits aggregate liabilities and first loss notes and their aggregate assets of $3.56 billion after tax, the consolidation of the conduits assets would reduce our tier 1 and total risk based capital ratios. The impact of consolidation on our tier 1 leverage ratio would be more significant, 57 Table of Contents but the degree of impact would depend on how and when consolidation occurred, since this ratio is a function of our consolidated total average assets over an entire quarter. For illustrative purposes, assuming estimated fair values of the conduits assets as of December 31, 2008, if all of the conduits assets and liabilities were consolidated onto our consolidated balance sheet on December 31, 2008, the following table presents the estimated impact on State Streets and State Street Banks regulatory capital ratios as of that date. State Street State Street Bank Reported as ofDecember 31, 2008 Adjusted forConduitConsolidationas ofDecember 31, 2008 Reported as ofDecember 31, 2008 Adjusted forConduitConsolidationas ofDecember 31, 2008 Tier 1 leverage ratio 7.8 % 5.5 % 7.6 % 5.3 % Tier 1 risk based capital ratio 20.3 14.4 19.8 13.9 Total risk based capital ratio 21.6 15.8 21.3 15.5 The conduits do not regularly trade their assets. That is, the design of the conduits is such that conduit assets are purchased with the intent to hold them to their maturities. Accordingly, changes in the fair values of the conduits assets do not impact the day to day management of the conduits. We believe the fair values of the conduits assets are affected by a number of factors, including the lack of liquidity of mortgage and asset backed securities, supply and demand imbalance in the market, and a risk aversion premium being demanded by investors for certain asset types. The aggregate fair value of the conduits assets at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $17.75 billion and $27.95 billion, respectively. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill is created when the purchase price exceeds the assigned value of net assets of acquired businesses, and represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements being acquired. Other acquired identifiable intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair value. Goodwill is not amortized. Other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, and both are subject to impairment adjustment if events or circumstances indicate the potential inability to realize the carrying amount. We evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually, based on undiscounted cash flows. Almost all of the goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in our consolidated statement of condition have resulted from business acquisitions of our Investment Servicing line of business. The remainder have been recorded by Investment Management. The sustained value of the majority of goodwill is supported ultimately by revenue from our investment servicing business. A decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth, or our inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods, could lead to a perceived impairment of goodwill, which would be evaluated and, if necessary, be recorded as a write down of the reported amount of goodwill through a charge to earnings in our consolidated statement of income. On an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances dictate, management reviews goodwill and evaluates events or other developments that may indicate impairment in the carrying amount. We perform this evaluation at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our two major business lines. The evaluation methodology for potential impairment is inherently complex and involves significant management judgment in the use of estimates and assumptions. We evaluate goodwill for impairment using a two step process. First, we compare the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, no impairment exists. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, then we compare the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, then goodwill impairment is recognized by writing the goodwill down to the implied fair value. The implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, as if the unit had been acquired in a business combination and the overall fair value of the unit was the purchase price. 58 Table of Contents To determine the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit being evaluated for goodwill impairment, we use one of two principal methodologies external or independent valuation, using quoted market prices in active markets; or an analysis of comparable recent external sales or market data, such as multiples of earnings or similar performance measures. In limited circumstances, these methodologies are not available, and as such, we estimate future cash flows using present value techniques. Events that may indicate impairment include significant or adverse changes in the business, economic or political climate; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; unanticipated competition; and a more likely than not expectation that we will sell or otherwise dispose of a business to which the goodwill or other intangible assets relate. Additional information about goodwill and other intangible assets, including information by line of business, is in note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Our evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment for 2008 indicated that none of our goodwill was impaired. For 2008, we recorded approximately $27 million of impairment associated with other intangible assets, $23 million of which was recorded as a component of the restructuring charges described in the Expenses section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis and in note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. Goodwill recorded in our consolidated statement of condition at December 31, 2008 totaled approximately $4.53 billion. Other intangible assets recorded in our consolidated statement of condition at December 31, 2008 totaled approximately $1.85 billion.

Additional information about the AMLF is provided in note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. 59 Table of Contents Overview of Consolidated Statement of Condition The structure of our consolidated statement of condition, or balance sheet, is primarily driven by the liabilities generated by our core Investment Servicing and Investment Management businesses. As our customers execute their worldwide cash management and investment activities, they use short term investments and deposits that constitute the majority of our liabilities. These liabilities are generally in the form of non interest bearing demand deposits; interest bearing transaction account deposits, which are denominated in a variety of currencies; and repurchase agreements, which generally serve as short term investment alternatives for our customers. Our customers needs and our operating objectives determine the volume, mix and currency denomination of our consolidated balance sheet. Deposits and other liabilities generated by customer activities are invested in assets that generally match the liquidity and interest rate characteristics of the liabilities. As a result, our assets consist primarily of securities held in our available for sale or held to maturity portfolios and short term money market instruments, such as interest bearing deposits, federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements. The actual mix of assets is determined by the characteristics of the customer liabilities and our desire to maintain a well diversified portfolio of high quality assets. Managing our consolidated balance sheet structure is conducted within specific Board approved policies for interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity. For 2008, the growth in average interest bearing liabilities of $20.4 billion was primarily composed of an $11.3 billion increase in customer deposits, $7.6 billion of which were foreign, partially offset by a decline in repurchase agreements of $1.9 billion. Average interest earning assets in 2008 increased $28.1 billion from 2007, primarily the result of higher levels of interest bearing deposits with domestic and foreign central banks related to the investment of excess cash generated from customers accumulation of liquidity, as well as our purchase of asset backed commercial paper under the AMLF. Additional information about our average balance sheet, primarily interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, is included in the Consolidated Results of Operations Net Interest Revenue section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. Investment Securities The carrying values of investment securities were as follows as of December 31: (In millions) 2008 2007 2006 Available for sale: U.S. Treasury and federal agencies: Direct obligations $ 11,579 $ 8,181 $ 7,612 Mortgage backed securities 10,798 14,585 11,454 Asset backed securities 19,424 25,069 25,634 Collateralized mortgage obligations 1,441 11,892 8,476 State and political subdivisions 5,712 5,813 3,749 Other debt investments 4,723 4,041 3,027 Money market mutual funds 344 243 201 Other equity securities 142 502 292 Total $ 54,163 $ 70,326 $ 60,445 Held to maturity purchased under AMLF: Asset backed commercial paper $ 6,087 Held to maturity: U.S. Treasury and federal agencies: Direct obligations $ 501 $ 757 $ 846 Mortgage backed securities 810 940 1,084 Asset backed securities 3,986 Collateralized mortgage obligations 9,979 2,190 2,357 State and political subdivisions 382 180 183 Other investments 109 166 77 Total $ 15,767 $ 4,233 $ 4,547 60 Table of Contents We consider a well diversified, high credit quality investment securities portfolio to be an important element in the management of our consolidated balance sheet. The portfolio continues to be concentrated in securities with high credit quality, with approximately 89% of the carrying value of the portfolio AAA or AA rated. The percentages of the carrying value of the investment securities portfolio by external credit rating, excluding securities purchased under the AMLF, were as follows as of December 31: 2008 2007 AAA(1) 78 % 89 % AA 11 6 A 5 3 BBB 4 1 BB 1 Non rated 1 1 100 % 100 % (1) Includes U.S. Treasury securities. The investment securities portfolio is also diversified with respect to asset class. The majority of the portfolio is composed of mortgage backed and asset backed securities. The largely floating rate asset backed portfolio consists of home equity loan, credit card, auto and student loan backed securities. Mortgage backed securities are split between securities of Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and large issuer collateralized mortgage obligations. As of December 31, 2008, the asset backed securities in the portfolio included $5.8 billion collateralized by sub prime mortgages. Of this total, 38% were AAA rated and 32% were AA rated. We had $6.62 billion of net pre tax unrealized losses on available for sale investment securities at December 31, 2008, or $4.06 billion after tax. This unrealized loss excludes the unrealized loss of $2.27 billion, or $1.39 billion after tax, related to securities available for sale that were reclassified to securities held to maturity during the fourth quarter of 2008, which are discussed below. Net pre tax unrealized losses on available for sale securities at December 31, 2007 were $1.105 billion, or $678 million after tax. Excluding the securities for which $122 million of other than temporary impairment was recorded during 2008, management considers the aggregate decline in fair value of the remaining securities and the resulting net unrealized losses to be temporary and not the result of any material changes in the credit characteristics of the securities. Management continues to believe that it is probable that we will collect all principal and interest according to underlying contractual terms, and has the ability and the intent to hold the securities until recovery in market value. During the fourth quarter of 2008, management reassessed its classification of certain asset and mortgage backed securities carried in the available for sale portfolio, and reclassified securities with an amortized cost of $14.6 billion and a fair value of $12.3 billion to securities held to maturity. No gain or loss was recognized at the time of reclassification. The related pre tax unrealized loss of $2.27 billion, or $1.39 billion after tax, recorded in other comprehensive income, or OCI, remained in OCI and is being amortized as an adjustment of the yield of the reclassified securities over their remaining terms. The securities were reclassified at their then fair value of $12.3 billion, and this fair value was established as the adjusted amortized cost of the reclassified securities. The resulting discount is being accreted as an adjustment of the yield of the reclassified securities over their remaining terms. As a result, the reclassification will have no ultimate impact on our consolidated results of operations. Management considers the held to maturity classification to be appropriate because it has the ability and the intent to hold these securities to their maturity. We intend to continue managing our investment securities portfolio to align with interest rate and duration characteristics of our customer liabilities and in the context of our overall balance sheet structure, which is maintained within internally approved risk limits, and in consideration of the global interest rate environment. Even with material changes in unrealized losses on available for sale securities, we may not experience material changes in our interest rate risk profile, or experience a material impact on our net interest revenue. Additional information about these and other unrealized losses is in notes 3 and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. 61 Table of Contents The carrying amounts, by contractual maturity, of debt securities available for sale and held to maturity, and the related weighted average contractual yields, were as follows as of December 31, 2008: Under 1 Year 1 to 5 Years 6 to 10 Years Over 10 Years (Dollars in millions) Amount Yield Amount Yield Amount Yield Amount Yield Available for sale(1): U.S. Treasury and federal agencies: Direct obligations $ 10,615 0.98 % $ 88 3.77 % $ 212 5.32 % $ 664 4.75 % Mortgage backed securities 129 4.17 2,755 4.42 2,314 5.16 5,600 4.13 Asset backed securities 545 2.05 9,449 1.98 5,153 2.98 4,277 3.33 Collateralized mortgage obligations 1 4.75 577 5.64 94 5.83 769 5.75 State and political subdivisions(2) 289 5.08 2,322 5.20 1,624 5.35 1,477 5.96 Other investments 2,171 4.33 1,814 5.09 646 5.39 92 4.17 Total $ 13,750 $ 17,005 $ 10,043 $ 12,879 Held to maturity purchased under AMLF: Asset backed securities(3) $ 6,087 3.02 % Held to maturity(1): U.S. Treasury and federal agencies: Direct obligations $ 501 4.38 % Mortgage backed securities $ 32 5.00 % $ 778 5.13 % Asset backed securities $ 269 0.84 % 3,061 2.93 5 0.97 651 4.94 Collateralized mortgage obligations 403 4.44 4,208 4.93 1,861 4.40 3,507 4.05 State and political subdivisions(2) 100 3.36 264 5.39 15 4.31 3 5.53 Other investments 105 0.50 4 3.06 Total $ 877 $ 8,038 $ 1,913 $ 4,939 (1) The maturities of mortgage backed securities, asset backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are based upon expected principal payments.

Additional information about the AMLF is provided in note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. Loans and Lease Financing U.S. and non U.S. loans and lease financing, and average loans and lease financing, were as follows for the years ended December 31 (excluding the allowance for losses): (In millions) 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 U.S.: Commercial and financial $ 6,397 $ 9,402 $ 3,480 $ 2,298 $ 1,826 Lease financing 407 396 415 404 373 Total U.S. 6,804 9,798 3,895 2,702 2,199 Non U.S.: Commercial and financial 890 4,420 3,137 1,854 526 Lease financing 1,437 1,584 1,914 1,926 1,904 Total non U.S. 2,327 6,004 5,051 3,780 2,430 Total loans $ 9,131 $ 15,802 $ 8,946 $ 6,482 $ 4,629 Average loans and lease financing $ 11,884 $ 10,753 $ 7,670 $ 6,013 $ 5,689 62 Table of Contents U.S. commercial and financial loans at December 31, 2008 included approximately $800 million of commercial real estate loans purchased from certain customers pursuant to indemnified repurchase agreements with an affiliate of Lehman Brothers. We recorded a reserve of $200 million associated with performance under the indemnification agreement during the third quarter of 2008, representing the difference between our indemnification obligation and the fair value of the loans acquired. We paid $1.00 billion to settle the indemnification obligations, and the acquired loans had an estimated fair value of $800 million. The contractual legal balance of the acquired loans is approximately $1.24 billion. The loans, which are primarily collateralized by direct and indirect interests in commercial real estate, were recorded at their then current fair value. The accounting for substantially all of these loans is governed by AICPA Statement of Position, or SOP, No. 03 3, Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer. SOP No. 03 3 applies to loans with evidence of credit deterioration since origination for which it is probable, as of the date of acquisition of the loans, that all contractual payments will not be collected. Pursuant to SOP No. 03 3, management will periodically reassess these cash flow assumptions, and the impact of any changes in expectations will be recognized in results of operations through an adjustment to a fair value allowance and, in some cases, an adjustment to the yield of the loans. Fair value represented managements expectation with respect to collection of principal and interest using appropriate market discount rates as of the date of acquisition. No additional valuation adjustments or provisions for loss were recorded since the initial acquisition of these loans. At December 31, 2008, approximately 5% of our consolidated total assets consisted of loans and lease financing. The aggregate decrease in loans from 2007 reflected a decrease in overdrafts, which result primarily from securities settlement activities of our customers. Overdrafts included in loans were $4.64 billion and $11.65 billion at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. Average overdrafts were approximately $8.00 billion and $7.53 billion for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. These balances do not represent significant credit risk because of their short term nature, which is generally overnight, the lack of significant concentration, and their occurrence in the normal course of the cash and securities settlement process. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, unearned income included in lease financing was $1.04 billion and $1.29 billion for non U.S. leases, respectively, and $199 million and $212 million for U.S. leases, respectively. Maturities for loan and lease financing categories were as follows as of December 31, 2008: YEARS (In millions) Total Under 1 1 to 5 Over 5 U.S.: Commercial and financial $ 6,397 $ 6,357 $ 21 $ 19 Lease financing 407 7 400 Total U.S. 6,804 6,357 28 419 Non U.S.: Commercial and financial 890 890 Lease financing 1,437 19 1,418 Total non U.S. 2,327 890 19 1,418 Total $ 9,131 $ 7,247 $ 47 $ 1,837 The following table presents the classification of loans and leases due after one year according to sensitivity to changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2008: (In millions) Loans and leases with predetermined interest rates $ 1,844 Loans and leases with floating or adjustable interest rates 40 Total $ 1,884 63 Table of Contents Cross Border Outstandings Cross border outstandings, as defined by bank regulatory rules, are amounts payable to State Street by residents of foreign countries, regardless of the currency in which the claim is denominated, and local country claims in excess of local country obligations. These cross border outstandings consist primarily of deposits with banks, loan and lease financing and investment securities. In addition to credit risk, cross border outstandings have the risk that, as a result of political or economic conditions in a country, borrowers may be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations of principal and or interest when due because of the unavailability of, or restrictions on, foreign exchange needed by borrowers to repay their obligations. Cross border outstandings to countries in which we do business which amounted to at least 1% of our consolidated total assets were as follows as of December 31: (In millions) 2008 2007 2006 United Kingdom $ 5,836 $ 5,951 $ 5,531 Australia 2,044 3,567 1,519 Canada 4,565 Germany 2,944 2,696 Total cross border outstandings $ 7,880 $ 17,027 $ 9,746 The total cross border outstandings presented in the table represented 5%, 12% and 9% of our consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Aggregate cross border outstandings to countries which totaled between .75% and 1% of our consolidated total assets at December 31, 2008 amounted to $3.45 billion (Canada and Germany). There were no cross border outstandings to countries which totaled between .75% and 1% of our consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2007. Aggregate cross border outstandings to countries which totaled between .75% and 1% of our consolidated total assets at December 31, 2006 amounted to $1.05 billion (Canada). Capital Regulatory and economic capital management both use key metrics evaluated by management to assess whether our actual level of capital is commensurate with our risk profile, is in compliance with all regulatory requirements, and is sufficient to provide us with the financial flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives. Regulatory Capital Our objective with respect to regulatory capital management is to maintain a strong capital base in order to provide financial flexibility for our business needs, including funding corporate growth and supporting customers cash management needs, and to provide protection against loss to depositors and creditors. We strive to maintain an optimal level of capital, commensurate with our risk profile, on which an attractive return to shareholders will be realized over both the short and long term, while protecting our obligations to depositors and creditors and satisfying regulatory requirements. Our capital management process focuses on our risk exposures, our capital position relative to our peers, regulatory capital requirements and the evaluations of the major independent credit rating agencies that assign ratings to our public debt. Our Capital Committee, working in conjunction with our Asset and Liability Committee, referred to as ALCO, oversees the management of regulatory capital, and is responsible for ensuring capital adequacy with respect to regulatory requirements, internal targets and the expectations of the major independent credit rating agencies. The primary regulator of both State Street and State Street Bank for regulatory capital purposes is the Federal Reserve. Both State Street and State Street Bank are subject to the minimum capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve and defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act 64 Table of Contents of 1991. State Street Bank must meet the regulatory capital thresholds for well capitalized in order for the parent company to maintain its status as a financial holding company. Regulatory capital ratios and related regulatory guidelines for State Street and State Street Bank were as follows as of December 31: REGULATORYGUIDELINES STATESTREET STATESTREETBANK Minimum WellCapitalized 2008(2) 2007 2008(2) 2007 Regulatory capital ratios: Tier 1 risk based capital 4 % 6 % 20.3 % 11.2 % 19.8 % 11.2 % Total risk based capital 8 10 21.6 12.7 21.3 12.7 Tier 1 leverage ratio(1) 4 5 7.8 5.3 7.6 5.5 (1) Regulatory guideline for well capitalized applies only to State Street Bank. (2) Tier 1 and total risk based capital and tier 1 leverage ratios exclude the impact of the asset backed commercial paper purchased under the AMLF, as permitted by the AMLFs terms and conditions. At December 31, 2008, State Streets and State Street Banks regulatory capital ratios increased compared to year end 2007. The increases for State Street resulted primarily from the issuance of capital eligible debt securities in January 2008, the June 2008 public offering of our common stock and our participation in the U.S. Treasurys capital purchase program in October 2008 described further below, as well as 2008 net income. With respect to State Street Bank, the parent company contributed an aggregate of approximately $4.68 billion to State Street Bank during 2008 to enhance its equity capital. For State Street and State Street Bank, these increases in capital more than offset increases in on and off balance risk weighted assets primarily associated with the impact of increases in customer deposits and higher volumes of foreign exchange derivative contracts. All ratios for State Street and State Street Bank exceeded the regulatory minimum and well capitalized thresholds. In January 2008, State Street Capital Trust III, a Delaware statutory trust wholly owned by the parent company, issued $500 million in aggregate liquidation amount of 8.250% fixed to floating rate normal automatic preferred enhanced capital securities, referred to as normal APEX, and used the proceeds to purchase a like amount of remarketable 6.001% junior subordinated debentures due 2042 from the parent company. In addition, the trust entered into stock purchase contracts with the parent company under which the trust agrees to purchase, and the parent company agrees to sell, on the stock purchase date, a like amount in aggregate liquidation amount of the parent companys non cumulative perpetual preferred stock, series A, $100,000 liquidation preference per share. State Street will make contract payments to the trust at an annual rate of 2.249% of the stated amount of $100,000 per stock purchase contract. The normal APEX are beneficial interests in the trust. The trust will pass through, as distributions on or the redemption price of normal APEX, amounts that it receives on its assets that are the corresponding assets for the normal APEX. The corresponding assets for each normal APEX, $1,000 liquidation amount, initially are $1,000 principal amount of the 6.001% junior subordinated debentures and a 1/100th, or a $1,000, interest in a stock purchase contract for the purchase and sale of one share of the Series A preferred stock for $100,000. The stock purchase date is expected to be March 15, 2011, but it may occur on an earlier date or as late as March 15, 2012. From and after the stock purchase date, the corresponding asset for each normal APEX will be a 1/100th, or a $1,000, interest in one share of the Series A preferred stock. In accordance with existing accounting standards, we did not record the trust in our consolidated financial statements. The 6.001% junior debentures qualify for inclusion in tier 1 regulatory capital. Capital Purchase Program On October 28, 2008, in connection with the U.S. Treasurys capital purchase program, we issued 20,000 shares of our Series B fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock, $100,000 liquidation preference per share, and a warrant to purchase 5,576,208 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $53.80 per share, to Treasury, and received aggregate proceeds of $2 billion. 65 Table of Contents The preferred shares, which qualify as tier 1 regulatory capital, pay cumulative quarterly dividends at a rate of 5% per year for the first five years, and 9% per year thereafter. The preferred shares are non voting, other than class voting rights on certain matters that could adversely affect the shares. We can redeem the preferred shares at par after December 15, 2011. Prior to this date, we can only redeem the preferred shares at par in an amount up to the cash proceeds (minimum $500 million) from qualifying equity offerings of any tier 1 eligible perpetual preferred or common stock. Any redemption is subject to the consent of the Federal Reserve. Until October 28, 2011, or such earlier time as the preferred stock has been redeemed or transferred by Treasury, we are not permitted, without Treasurys consent, to increase the quarterly dividend per share on our common stock above $0.24 per share, or to repurchase our common stock. The warrant is immediately exercisable, and has a 10 year term. The exercise price of $53.80 per share was based upon the average of the closing prices of our common stock during the 20 trading day period ended October 10, 2008, the last trading day prior to our election to participate in the program. The exercise price and number of common shares subject to the warrant are both subject to anti dilution adjustments. If we receive aggregate gross cash proceeds of at least $2 billion from one or more qualifying equity offerings of tier 1 eligible perpetual preferred or common stock on or prior to December 31, 2009, the number of shares of common stock underlying the warrant then held by Treasury will be reduced by one half of the original number of common shares, considering all adjustments, underlying the warrant. Common Stock On June 3, 2008, we completed a public offering of approximately 40.5 million shares of our common stock. The public offering price was $70 per share, and aggregate proceeds from the offering, net of underwriting commissions and related offering costs, totaled approximately $2.75 billion. Underwriting commissions totaled approximately $85 million. Of the total shares issued, approximately 7.4 million shares were issued out of treasury stock, and the remaining 33.1 million shares were newly issued. We executed the offering pursuant to our current universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. In January 2008, under an existing authorization by our Board of Directors, we repurchased 552,000 shares of our common stock in connection with a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program that concluded on January 18, 2008. As of December 31, 2008, approximately 13,245,000 shares remained available for future purchase under the Board authorization. We generally employ third party broker/dealers to acquire shares on the open market in connection with our common stock purchase program. Funds for cash distributions to our shareholders by the parent company are derived from a variety of sources. The level of dividends to shareholders on our common stock, which totaled $400 million ($0.95 per share) in 2008 (compared to $320 million and $0.88 per share in 2007), is reviewed regularly and determined by the Board of Directors considering our liquidity, capital adequacy and recent earnings history and prospects, as well as economic conditions and other factors deemed relevant. Federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid by subsidiary banks to the parent holding company. In addition, banking regulators have the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends if they deem such payment to be an unsafe or unsound practice. Information concerning limitations on dividends from our subsidiary banks is provided in note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. During the first quarter of 2009, in light of the continued disruption in the global capital markets experienced since the middle of 2007, and as part of a plan to strengthen our tangible common equity, we announced a temporary reduction of our quarterly dividend on our common stock to $0.01 per share. Other In 2004, the Committee on Banking Supervision released the final version of its capital adequacy framework, referred to as Basel II. In 2006, the four U.S. banking regulatory agencies jointly issued their second draft of implementation rules, with industry comment provided by the end of March 2007. Additional 66 Table of Contents supervisory guidance from the agencies was released late in February 2007; comments to the agencies were provided by the end of May 2007, and the final rules were released on December 7, 2007, with a stated effective date of April 1, 2008. State Street previously established a comprehensive implementation program to ensure these regulatory requirements are met within prescribed timeframes. We anticipate adopting the most advanced approaches for assessing capital adequacy. Economic Capital We define economic capital as the capital required to protect holders of our senior debt, and obligations higher in priority, against unexpected economic losses over a one year period at a level consistent with the solvency of a firm with our target AA senior debt rating. Our Capital Committee is responsible for overseeing our economic capital process. The framework and methodologies used to quantify economic capital for each of the risk types described below have been developed by our Enterprise Risk Management, Global Treasury and Corporate Finance groups and are designed to be generally consistent with our risk management principles and the new Basel II regulatory capital rules. This framework has been approved by senior management and the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors. Due to the evolving nature of quantification techniques, we expect to periodically refine the methodologies, assumptions, and data used to estimate our economic capital requirements, which could result in a different amount of capital needed to support our business activities. We quantify capital requirements for the risks inherent in our business activities and group them into one of the following broadly defined categories: Market risk: the risk of adverse financial impact due to fluctuations in market prices, primarily as they relate to our trading activities; Interest rate risk: the risk of loss in non trading asset and liability management positions, primarily the impact of adverse movements in interest rates on the repricing mismatches that exist between balance sheet assets and liabilities; Credit risk: the risk of loss that may result from the default or downgrade of a borrower or counterparty; Operational risk: the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events, which is consistent with the Basel II definition; and Business risk: the risk of negative earnings resulting from adverse changes in business factors, including changes in the competitive environment, changes in the operational economics of our business activities, and the effect of strategic and reputation risks. Economic capital for each of these five categories is estimated on a stand alone basis using statistical modeling techniques applied to internally generated and, in some cases, external data. These individual results are then aggregated at the State Street consolidated level. A capital reduction or diversification benefit is then applied to reflect the unlikely event of experiencing an extremely large loss in each risk type at the same time. Liquidity The objective of liquidity management is to ensure that we have the ability to meet our financial obligations in a timely and cost effective manner, and that we maintain sufficient flexibility to fund strategic corporate initiatives as they arise. Effective management of liquidity involves assessing the potential mismatch between the future cash needs of our customers and our available sources of cash under normal and adverse economic and business conditions. Significant uses of liquidity, described more fully below, consist primarily of meeting deposit withdrawals and funding outstanding commitments to extend credit or to purchase securities as they are drawn upon. Liquidity is provided by the maintenance of broad access to the global capital markets and by our consolidated balance sheet asset structure. Our Global Treasury group is responsible for the day to day management of our global liquidity position, which is conducted within risk guidelines established and monitored by ALCO. Management maintains a liquidity 67 Table of Contents measurement framework to assess the sources and uses of liquidity that is monitored by Global Treasury and our Enterprise Risk Management group. Embedded in this framework is a process that outlines several levels of potential risk to our liquidity and identifies triggers that we use as early warning signals of a possible difficulty. These triggers are a combination of internal and external measures of potential increases in cash needs or decreases in available sources of cash and possible impairment of our ability to access the global capital markets. Another important component of the framework is a contingency funding plan that is designed to identify and manage through a potential liquidity crisis. The plan defines roles, responsibilities and management actions to be undertaken in the event of deterioration in our liquidity profile caused by either a State Street specific event or a broader disruption in the capital markets. Specific actions are linked to the levels of triggers. We generally manage our liquidity risk on a global basis at the consolidated level. We also manage parent company liquidity, and in certain cases branch liquidity, separately. State Street Bank generally has broader access to funding products and markets limited to banks, specifically the federal funds market and the Federal Reserves discount window and term auction facility. The parent company is managed to a more conservative liquidity profile, reflecting narrower market access. We typically hold enough cash, primarily in the form of interest bearing deposits with subsidiary banks, to meet current debt maturities and cash needs, as well as those projected over the next one year period. Sources of liquidity come from two primary areas: access to the global capital markets and liquid assets maintained on our consolidated balance sheet. Our ability to source incremental funding at reasonable rates of interest from wholesale investors in the capital markets is the first source of liquidity we would tap to accommodate the uses of liquidity described below. On balance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our liquidity management strategy. These assets provide liquidity through maturities of the assets, but more importantly, they provide us with the ability to raise funds by pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales. Each of these sources of liquidity is used in the management of daily cash needs and in a crisis scenario, where we would need to accommodate potential large, unexpected demand for funds. Uses of liquidity result from the following: withdrawals of unsecured customer deposits; draw downs on unfunded commitments to extend credit or to purchase securities, generally provided through lines of credit; overdraft facilities; liquidity asset purchase agreements supporting the four unconsolidated asset backed commercial paper conduits that we administer, and purchases by us of commercial paper issued by the conduits to support their liquidity. Customer deposits are generated largely from our investment servicing activities, and are invested in a combination of term investment securities and short term money market assets whose mix is determined by the characteristics of the deposits. Most of the customer deposits are payable upon demand or are short term in nature, which means that withdrawals can potentially occur quickly and in large amounts. Similarly, customers can request disbursement of funds under commitments to extend credit, or can overdraw deposit accounts rapidly and in large volumes. In addition, a large volume of unanticipated funding requirements, such as under liquidity asset purchase agreements that have met draw down conditions, or large draw downs of existing lines of credit, could require additional liquidity. Material risks to sources of short term liquidity could include, among other things, adverse changes in the perception in the financial markets of our financial condition or liquidity needs, and downgrades by major independent credit rating agencies of our deposits and our debt securities, which would restrict our ability to access the capital markets and could lead to withdrawals of unsecured deposits by our customers. In managing our liquidity, we have issued term wholesale certificates of deposit and invested those funds in short term money market assets where they would be available to meet cash needs. This portfolio stood at $1.93 billion at December 31, 2008, compared to $4.57 billion at December 31, 2007. In conjunction with our management of liquidity where we seek to maintain access to sources of back up liquidity at reasonable costs, we have participated in the Federal Reserves term auction facility, which is a secured lending program available to financial institutions that was established in December 2007. As of December 31, 2008, State Street Banks borrowings under the term auction facility totaled $5.0 billion, which represented the highest level of State Street Banks borrowings under this facility for 2008. The aggregate certificate of deposit and term auction facility balances were higher at December 31, 2008 compared to December 31, 2007, as State Street Bank held greater 68 Table of Contents liquidity in light of the continued disruption in the financial markets. We did not experience any net deterioration in our customer deposit base during 2008. While maintenance of our high investment grade credit rating is of primary importance to our liquidity management program, on balance sheet liquid assets represent significant liquidity that we can directly control, and provide a source of cash in the form of principal maturities and the ability to borrow from the capital markets using our securities as collateral. Our liquid assets consist primarily of cash balances at central banks in excess of regulatory requirements and other short term liquid assets, such as federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits with banks, the latter of which are multicurrency instruments invested with major multinational banks; and high quality, marketable investment securities not already pledged, which generally are more liquid than other types of assets and can be sold or borrowed against to generate cash quickly. As of December 31, 2008, the cash value of our liquid assets, as defined, totaled $85.81 billion, compared to $55.14 billion as of December 31, 2007. The increase was mainly the result of a significant increase in customer deposits in the third quarter of 2008 as the credit markets worsened. As customers accumulated liquidity, they placed cash with us. The vast majority of these incremental customer deposits remained with State Street Bank at year end 2008. Due to the unusual size and volatile nature of these incremental customer deposits, we chose to maintain approximately $48.64 billion at central banks as of December 31, 2008, in excess of regulatory required minimums. Securities carried at $42.74 billion as of December 31, 2008, compared to $39.84 billion as of December 31, 2007, were designated as pledged for public and trust deposits, borrowed funds and for other purposes as provided by law, and are excluded from the liquid assets calculation, unless pledged to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. The liquid assets and pledged securities described above excluded securities purchased under the Federal Reserves AMLF. Liquid assets included securities pledged to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston to secure our ability to borrow from their discount window should the need arise. This access to primary credit is an important source of back up liquidity for State Street Bank. As of December 31, 2008, we had no outstanding primary credit borrowings from the discount window. Based upon our level of liquid assets and our ability to access the capital markets for additional funding when necessary, including our ability to issue debt and equity securities under our current universal shelf registration, management considers overall liquidity at December 31, 2008 to be sufficient to meet State Streets current commitments and business needs, including supporting the liquidity of the commercial paper conduits and accommodating the transaction and cash management needs of our customers. As referenced above, our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the maintenance of high investment grade ratings on our debt, as measured by the major independent credit rating agencies. Factors essential to retaining high credit ratings include diverse and stable core earnings; strong risk management; strong capital ratios; diverse liquidity sources, including the global capital markets and customer deposits; and strong liquidity monitoring procedures. High ratings on debt minimize borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by ensuring the largest possible market for our debt. A downgrade or reduction of these credit ratings could have an adverse impact to our ability to access funding at favorable interest rates. 69 Table of Contents The following table presents information about State Streets and State Street Banks credit ratings as of February 27, 2009.

We have, as discussed previously, issued in the past, and we may issue in the future, securities pursuant to the shelf registration. The issuance of debt or equity securities will depend on future market conditions, funding needs and other factors. We currently maintain a commercial paper program, under which we can issue up to $3 billion with original maturities of up to 270 days from the date of issue. At December 31, 2008, we had $2.59 billion of commercial paper outstanding, compared to $2.36 billion at December 31, 2007. Additional information about our commercial paper program is provided in note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. In connection with our participation in the FDICs Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, in which we elected to participate in December 2008, we can issue up to $1.67 billion, and State Street Bank can issue up to $2.48 billion, of unsecured senior debt through June 30, 2009, which will be backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. The guarantee of this unsecured senior debt expires on the earlier of the maturity date of the debt or June 30, 2012. No debt was outstanding under this guarantee program as of December 31, 2008. During the first quarter of 2009, State Street issued unsecured senior debt totaling $155 million, composed of commercial paper issued under our program described in the preceding paragraph, which is backed by this guarantee. State Street Bank currently has Board authority to issue bank notes up to an aggregate of $5 billion, including up to $2.48 billion of senior notes under the above described FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program and up to $1 billion of subordinated bank notes. At December 31, 2008, no notes payable were outstanding and all $5 billion was available for issuance. State Street Bank currently maintains a line of credit with a financial institution of CAD $800 million, or approximately USD $657 million as of December 31, 2008, to support its Canadian securities processing operations. The line of credit has no stated termination date and is cancelable by either party with prior notice. As of December 31, 2008, no balance was outstanding on this line of credit. 70 Table of Contents CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD As of December 31, 2008 (In millions) Total Less than 1year 1 3years 4 5years Over 5years Long term debt(1) $ 7,473 $ 189 $ 653 $ 570 $ 6,061 Operating leases 1,651 232 412 393 614 Capital lease obligations 1,192 73 148 140 831 Total contractual cash obligations $ 10,316 $ 494 $ 1,213 $ 1,103 $ 7,506 (1) Long term debt above excludes capital lease obligations (reported as a separate line item) and the effect of interest rate swaps.

Risk Management The global scope of our business activities requires that we balance what we perceive to be the primary risks in our businesses with a comprehensive and well integrated risk management function. The measurement, monitoring and mitigation of risks are essential to the financial performance and successful management of our businesses. These risks, if not effectively managed, can result in current losses to State Street as well as erosion of our capital and damage to our reputation. Our systematic approach also allows for a more precise assessment of risks within a framework for evaluating opportunities for the prudent use of capital. 71 Table of Contents We have a disciplined approach to risk management that involves all levels of management. The Board of Directors provides extensive review and oversight of our overall risk management programs, including the approval of key risk management policies and the periodic review of State Streets key risk indicators. These indicators are designed to identify major business activities of State Street with significant risk content, and to establish quantifiable thresholds for risk measurement. Key risk indicators are reported regularly to the Executive Committee of the Board and are reviewed periodically for appropriateness. Modifications to the indicators are made to reflect changes in our business activities or refinements to existing measurements. Enterprise Risk Management, or ERM, a dedicated corporate group, provides oversight, support and coordination across business units and is responsible for the formulation and maintenance of enterprise wide risk management policies and guidelines. In addition, ERM establishes and reviews approved limits, and with business line management, monitors key risks. The head of ERM meets regularly with the Board or a Board committee, as appropriate, and has the authority to escalate issues as necessary. The execution of duties in the management of people, products, business operations and processes is the responsibility of business unit managers. The function of risk management is responsible for designing, orchestrating and directing the implementation of risk management programs and processes consistent with corporate and regulatory standards. Accordingly, risk management is a shared responsibility between ERM and the business lines and requires joint efforts in goal setting, program design and implementation, resource management, and performance evaluation between business and functional units. Responsibility for risk management is overseen by a series of management committees. The Major Risk Committee, or MRC, is responsible for the formulation and recommendation of policies, and the approval of guidelines and programs governing the identification, analysis, measurement and control of material risks across State Street. Chaired by the head of ERM, the MRC focuses on the review of business activities with significant risk content and the assessment of risk management programs and initiatives. Our Capital Committee, chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, oversees the management of our regulatory and economic capital, the determination of the framework for capital allocation and strategies for capital structure and debt and equity issuances. ALCO, chaired by the Treasurer, oversees the management of our consolidated balance sheet, including management of our global liquidity and interest rate risk positions. The Fiduciary Review Committee reviews the criteria for the acceptance of fiduciary duties, and assists our business lines with their fiduciary responsibilities executed on behalf of customers. The Credit Committee, chaired within ERM, acts as the credit policy committee for State Street. The Operational Risk Committee, chaired within ERM, provides cross business oversight of operational risk to identify, measure, manage and control operational risk in an effective and consistent manner across State Street. The Model Assessment Committee, chaired within ERM, provides recommendations concerning technical modeling issues and independently validates qualifying financial models utilized by our businesses. Several other committees with specialized risk management functions report to the MRC. Corporate Audit serves in a complementary role to our program of risk management, providing the Board and management with continuous monitoring and control audits to assess adherence to State Streets policies and procedures and the effectiveness of its system of internal controls. Additionally, the internal control environment is evaluated through external examinations and regulatory compliance efforts. The Corporate Compliance, Regulatory and Industry Affairs, and Legal groups also serve essential roles in risk management. Corporate Compliance is responsible for the design, implementation and oversight of policies, guidelines and programs to support our compliance with applicable laws and regulations wherever we conduct business. The Regulatory and Industry Affairs group monitors proposed changes in rules and legislation, and the Legal group provides counsel that enables us to deal with complex legal and regulatory environments, maximize business opportunities and minimize legal, regulatory and other risks. While we believe that our risk management program is effective in managing the risks in our businesses, external factors may create risks that cannot always be identified or anticipated. Market Risk Market risk is defined as the risk of adverse financial impact due to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and other market driven factors and prices. State Street is exposed to market risk in both its 72 Table of Contents trading and non trading, or asset and liability management, activities. The market risk management processes related to these activities, discussed in further detail below, apply to both on balance sheet and off balance sheet exposures. We primarily engage in trading and investment activities to serve our customers needs and to contribute to overall corporate earnings and liquidity. In the conduct of these activities, we are subject to, and assume, market risk. The level of market risk that we assume is a function of our overall objectives and liquidity needs, customer requirements and market volatility. Interest rate risk, a component of market risk, is more thoroughly discussed in the Asset and Liability Management portion of this Market Risk section. Trading Activities Market risk associated with foreign exchange and other trading activities is managed through corporate guidelines, including established limits on aggregate and net open positions, sensitivity to changes in interest rates, and concentrations, which are supplemented by stop loss thresholds. We use a variety of risk management tools and methodologies, including value at risk, to measure, monitor and manage market risk. All limits and measurement techniques are reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a regular basis by business managers, the market risk management group and the Trading and Market Risk Committee. We use a variety of derivative financial instruments to support our customers needs, conduct trading activities and manage our interest rate and currency risk. These activities are designed to create trading revenue and to hedge potential earnings volatility. In addition, we provide services related to derivatives in our role as both a manager and a servicer of financial assets. Our customers use derivatives to manage the financial risks associated with their investment goals and business activities. With the growth of cross border investing, customers have an increasing need for foreign exchange forward contracts to convert currency for international investments and to manage the currency risk in their international investment portfolios. As an active participant in the foreign exchange markets, we provide foreign exchange forward contracts and options in support of these customer needs. As part of our trading activities, we assume positions in the foreign exchange and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and using derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange and interest rate options and interest rate swaps. As of December 31, 2008, the aggregate notional amount of these derivatives was $742.84 billion, of which $688.81 billion were foreign exchange forward and spot contracts. In the aggregate, long and short foreign exchange forward positions are closely matched to minimize currency and interest rate risk. All foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at current market rates. Additional information about trading derivatives is provided in note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. As noted above, we use a variety of risk measurement tools and methodologies, including value at risk, or VaR, which is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical confidence interval. We use a risk measurement system to estimate VaR daily. We have adopted standards for estimating VaR, and we maintain capital for market risk in accordance with applicable regulatory guidelines. VaR is estimated for a 99% one tail confidence interval and an assumed one day holding period using a historical observation period of greater than two years. A 99% one tail confidence interval implies that daily trading losses should not exceed the estimated VaR more than 1% of the time, or less than three business days out of a year. The methodology uses a simulation approach based on historically observed changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates (domestic and foreign) and foreign exchange implied volatilities, and takes into account the resulting diversification benefits provided from the mix of our trading positions. Like all quantitative risk measures, VaR is subject to limitations and assumptions inherent in our methodology. Our methodology gives equal weight to all market rate observations regardless of how recently the market rates were observed. The estimate is calculated using static portfolios consisting of trading positions held at the end of each business day. Therefore, implicit in the VaR estimate is the assumption that no intraday actions are taken by management during adverse market movements. As a result, the methodology does not include risk associated with intraday changes in positions or intraday price volatility. 73 Table of Contents The following table presents VaR with respect to our trading activities, as measured by our VaR methodology for the periods indicated: VALUE AT RISK 2008 2007 Years ended December 31, (In millions) AnnualAverage Maximum Minimum AnnualAverage Maximum Minimum Foreign exchange products $ 1.8 $ 4.7 $ .3 $ 1.8 $ 4.0 $ .7 Interest rate products 1.1 2.4 .6 1.4 3.7 .1 We back test the estimated one day VaR on a daily basis. This information is reviewed and used to confirm that all relevant trading positions are properly modeled. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, we did not experience any actual trading losses in excess of our end of day VaR estimate. Asset and Liability Management Activities The primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable and growing net interest revenue, or NIR, under varying economic environments, while protecting the economic values of our balance sheet assets and liabilities from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates. Most of our NIR is earned from the investment of deposits generated by our core Investment Servicing and Investment Management businesses. We structure our balance sheet assets to generally conform to the characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities, but we manage our overall interest rate risk position in the context of current and anticipated market conditions and within internally approved risk guidelines. Our overall interest rate risk position is maintained within a series of policies approved by the Board and guidelines established and monitored by ALCO. Our Global Treasury group has responsibility for managing State Streets day to day interest rate risk. To effectively manage the consolidated balance sheet and related NIR, Global Treasury has the authority to take a limited amount of interest rate risk based on market conditions and its views about the direction of global interest rates over both short term and long term time horizons. Global Treasury manages our exposure to changes in interest rates on a consolidated basis organized into three regional treasury units, North America, Europe and Asia/Pacific, to reflect the growing, global nature of our exposures and to capture the impact of change in regional market environments on our total risk position. Our investment activities and our use of derivative financial instruments are the primary tools used in managing interest rate risk. We invest in financial instruments with currency, repricing, and maturity characteristics we consider appropriate to manage our overall interest rate risk position. In addition to on balance sheet assets, we use certain derivatives, primarily interest rate swaps, to alter the interest rate characteristics of specific balance sheet assets or liabilities. The use of derivatives is subject to ALCO approved guidelines. Additional information about our use of derivatives is in note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. As a result of growth in our non U.S. operations, non U.S. dollar denominated customer liabilities are a significant portion of our consolidated balance sheet. This growth results in exposure to changes in the shape and level of non U.S. dollar yield curves, which we include in our consolidated interest rate risk management process. Because no one individual measure can accurately assess all of our exposures to changes in interest rates, we use several quantitative measures in our assessment of current and potential future exposures to changes in interest rates and their impact on net interest revenue and balance sheet values. Net interest revenue simulation is the primary tool used in our evaluation of the potential range of possible net interest revenue results that could occur under a variety of interest rate environments. We also use market valuation and duration analysis to assess changes in the economic value of balance sheet assets and liabilities caused by assumed changes in interest rates. Finally, gap analysis the difference between the amount of balance sheet assets and liabilities re pricing within a specified time period is used as a measurement of our interest rate risk position. 74 Table of Contents To measure, monitor, and report on our interest rate risk position, we use (1) NIR simulation, or NIR at risk, which measures the impact on NIR over the next twelve months to immediate, or rate shock, and gradual, or rate ramp, changes in market interest rates; and (2) economic value of equity, or EVE, which measures the impact on the present value of all NIR related principal and interest cash flows of an immediate change in interest rates. NIR at risk is designed to measure the potential impact of changes in market interest rates on NIR in the short term. EVE, on the other hand, is a long term view of interest rate risk, but with a view toward liquidation of State Street. Both of these measures are subject to ALCO established guidelines, and are monitored regularly, along with other relevant simulations, scenario analyses and stress tests by both Global Treasury and ALCO. In calculating our NIR at risk, we start with a base amount of NIR that is projected over the next twelve months, assuming that the then current yield curve remains unchanged over the period. Our existing balance sheet assets and liabilities are adjusted by the amount and timing of transactions that are forecasted to occur over the next twelve months. That yield curve is then shocked, or moved immediately, &plusmn;100 basis points in a parallel fashion, or at all points along the yield curve. Two new twelve month NIR projections are then developed using the same balance sheet and forecasted transactions, but with the new yield curves, and compared to the base scenario. We also perform the calculations using interest rate ramps, which are &plusmn;100 basis point changes in interest rates that are assumed to occur gradually over the next twelve month period, rather than immediately as we do with interest rate shocks. EVE is based on the change in the present value of all NIR related principal and interest cash flows for changes in market rates of interest. The present value of existing cash flows with a then current yield curve serves as the base case. We then apply an immediate parallel shock to that yield curve of &plusmn;200 basis points and recalculate the cash flows and related present values. A large shock is used to better capture the embedded option risk in our mortgage backed securities that results from the borrowers prepayment opportunity. Key assumptions used in the models described above include the timing of cash flows; the maturity and repricing of balance sheet assets and liabilities, especially option embedded financial instruments like mortgage backed securities; changes in market conditions; and interest rate sensitivities of our customer liabilities with respect to the interest rates paid and the level of balances. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the models cannot precisely predict future NIR or predict the impact of changes in interest rates on NIR and economic value. Actual results could differ from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and market conditions, changes in spreads and management strategies, among other factors. Projections of potential future streams of NIR are assessed as part of our forecasting process. The following table presents the estimated exposure of NIR for the next twelve months, calculated as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, due to an immediate &plusmn; 100 basis point shift in then current interest rates. Estimated incremental exposures presented below are dependent on managements assumptions about asset and liability sensitivities under various interest rate scenarios, such as those previously discussed, and do not reflect any actions management may undertake in order to mitigate some of the adverse effects of interest rate changes on State Streets financial performance. NIR AT RISK Estimated Exposure toNet Interest Revenue (In millions) 2008 2007 Rate change: +100 bps shock $ 7 $ (98 ) 100 bps shock (439 ) 7 +100 bps ramp (29 ) (44 ) 100 bps ramp (166 ) 20 The NIR at risk exposure to an immediate 100 bp increase in market interest rates changed from negative at December 31, 2007 to slightly positive at December 31, 2008, while the NIR at risk exposure to a 100 bp downward shock in rates changed from slightly positive to significantly negative. These changes were the result of two factors. First, the level of on balance sheet liquid assets was increased during 2008 in response to the 75 Table of Contents disruption in the financial markets, resulting in NIR at risk exposures becoming more asset sensitive compared to 2007. Second, with market interest rates and liability yields both well below 1.00% at December 31, 2008, the downward 100 bp shock produced balance sheet spread compression, as liability yields were prevented from repricing lower to the full extent of the rate shock. With central bank administered interest rates worldwide already at historically low levels, however, we are positioned to benefit from rising interest rates going forward. The year over year changes in NIR at risk exposure to +100 and 100 bp ramps were directionally the same as for the +/ 100 bp shocks, with exposure to rising rates becoming less negative, and exposure to declining rates changing to negative, although the change was less pronounced due to the gradual shift in market rates inherent in the ramp scenarios. Other important factors that impact the levels of NIR are balance sheet size and mix; interest rate spreads; the slope and interest rate level of U.S. dollar and non U.S. dollar yield curves and the relationship between them; the pace of change in market interest rates; and management actions taken in response to the preceding conditions. The following table presents estimated EVE exposures, calculated as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, assuming an immediate and prolonged shift in interest rates, the impact of which would be spread over a number of years. ECONOMIC VALUE OF EQUITY Estimated Exposure toEconomic Value of Equity (In millions) 2008 2007 Rate change: +200 bps shock $ (1,873 ) $ (1,195 ) 200 bps shock (740 ) 48 The EVE results presented above indicate exposure to rising interest rates for both periods, although the magnitude of the exposure as of December 31, 2008 increased compared to December 31, 2007. In addition, the exposure to falling interest rates became negative at December 31, 2008. Both of these changes reflect the significantly lower market interest rates at December 31, 2008 compared to December 31, 2007. The December 31, 2008 rate environment, with U.S. interest rates near zero, prevents the downward 200 bps shock from fully occurring, as market rates are not allowed to fall below zero, and reduces the benefit of lower rates on market value of the investment portfolio. The increase in exposure for the rising rate scenario primarily reflects increased duration extension on mortgage backed securities in a rising rate environment relative to the base scenario, due to lower absolute levels of interest rates in the base scenario at December 2008 compared to December 2007. Credit Risk Credit and counterparty risk is defined as the risk of financial loss if a borrower or counterparty is either unable or unwilling to repay borrowings or settle a transaction in accordance with contractual terms. We assume credit and counterparty risk on both our on and off balance sheet exposures. The extension of credit and the acceptance of counterparty risk by State Street are governed by corporate guidelines based on the prospective customers risk profile, the markets served, counterparty and country concentrations, and regulatory compliance. Our focus on large institutional investors and their businesses requires that we assume concentrated credit risk in a variety of forms. We maintain comprehensive guidelines and procedures to monitor and manage all aspects of credit and counterparty risk that we undertake. Counterparties are evaluated on an individual basis at least annually, while significant exposures to counterparties are reviewed daily. Processes for credit approval and monitoring are in place for all credit extensions. As part of the approval and renewal process, due diligence is conducted based on the size and term of the exposure, as well as the quality of the counterparty. We provide, on a limited basis, traditional loan products and services to key customers and prospects in a manner that is intended to enhance customer relationships, increase profitability and minimize risk. We employ a relationship model in which credit decisions are based upon credit quality and the overall institutional relationship. This model is typical of financial institutions that provide credit to institutional customers in the markets that we serve. 76 Table of Contents An allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb probable credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio that can be estimated, and is reviewed regularly by management for adequacy. An internal rating system is used to assess potential risk of loss. State Streets risk rating process incorporates the use of risk rating tools informed by managements judgment. Qualitative and quantitative inputs are captured in a transparent and replicable manner, and following a formal review and approval process, an internal credit rating based on State Streets credit scale is assigned. The provision for loan losses is a charge to current earnings to maintain the overall allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate relative to the level of credit risk in the loan and lease portfolio. No provision for loan losses was recorded in 2008, 2007 or 2006. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the allowance for loan losses was $18 million. Changes in the allowance for loan losses were as follows for the years ended December 31: (In millions) 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004(1) U.S.: Balance at beginning of year $ 18 $ 18 $ 17 $ 14 $ 43 Provision for loan losses (15 ) Loan charge offs commercial and financial Recoveries commercial and financial Reclassification 1 3 (14 ) Balance at end of year U.S. 18 18 18 17 14 Non U.S.: Balance at beginning of year 1 4 18 Provision for loan losses (3 ) Reclassification (1 ) (3 ) (11 ) Balance at end of year Non U.S. 1 4 Total balance at end of year $ 18 $ 18 $ 18 $ 18 $ 18 (1) In 2004, we reclassified $25 million of the allowance for loan losses to other liabilities as a reserve for off balance sheet commitments. Subsequent to the reclassification, the reserve for off balance sheet commitments was reduced by $10 million, and recorded as an offset to other expenses. We also reversed $18 million through the provision for loan losses as a result of reduced credit risk exposures and improved credit quality. Past due loans are loans on which principal or interest payments are over 90 days delinquent, but where interest continues to be accrued. An aggregate of approximately $219 million of loans were past due as of December 31, 2008, composed of commercial real estate loans purchased from certain customers pursuant to indemnified repurchase agreements with an affiliate of Lehman Brothers. These loans continued to accrue interest, and no additional valuation adjustments or provisions for loss were recorded since their initial acquisition. Additional information about these loans is provided in the Financial Condition Loans and Lease Financing section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. There were no past due loans as of December 31, 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2004. We generally place loans on non accrual status once principal or interest payments are 60 days past due, or earlier if management determines that full collection is not probable. Loans 60 days past due, but considered both well secured and in the process of collection, may be excluded from non accrual status. For loans placed on non accrual status, revenue recognition is suspended. There were no non accrual loans at year end 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2004. We purchase securities under agreements to resell. Risk is managed through a variety of processes, including establishing the acceptability of counterparties; limiting purchases largely to low risk U.S. government securities; taking possession or control of transaction assets; monitoring levels of underlying collateral; and limiting the duration of the agreements. Securities are revalued daily to determine if we believe that additional collateral is necessary from the borrower. Most repurchase agreements are short term, with maturities of less than 90 days. We also provide customers with off balance sheet liquidity and credit enhancement facilities in the form of letters of credit, lines of credit and liquidity asset purchase agreements. These exposures are subject to an initial credit analysis, with detailed approval and review processes. These facilities are also actively monitored and reviewed annually. We maintain a separate reserve for probable credit losses related to certain of these off balance sheet activities. Management reviews the adequacy of this reserve on a regular basis. 77 Table of Contents On behalf of our customers, we lend their securities to creditworthy banks, broker/dealers and other institutions. In most circumstances, we indemnify our customers for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities. Though these transactions are collateralized, the substantial volume of these activities necessitates detailed credit based underwriting and monitoring processes. The aggregate amount of indemnified securities on loan totaled $324.59 billion at December 31, 2008, and $558.37 billion at December 31, 2007. We require the borrowers to provide collateral in an amount equal to or in excess of 100% of the fair market value of the securities borrowed. Collateral received in connection with our securities lending services is held by us as agent and is not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. The securities on loan and the collateral are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary. We held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $333.07 billion and $572.93 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The collateral held by us is invested on behalf of our customers. In certain cases, the collateral is invested in third party repurchase agreements, for which we indemnify the customer against loss of the principal invested. We require the repurchase agreement counterparty to provide collateral in an amount equal to or in excess of 100% of the amount of the repurchase agreement. The indemnified repurchase agreements and the related collateral are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. Of the collateral of $333.07 billion at December 31, 2008 and $572.93 billion at December 31, 2007 referenced above, $68.37 billion at December 31, 2008 and $106.13 billion at December 31, 2007 were invested in indemnified repurchase agreements. We held, as agent, $71.87 billion and $111.02 billion as collateral for indemnified investments in repurchase agreements at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. Processes for credit approval and monitoring are in place for other credit extensions. As part of the approval and renewal process, due diligence is conducted based on the size and term of the exposure, as well as the quality of the counterparty. Exposures to these entities are aggregated and evaluated by ERM. Investments in debt and equity securities, including investments in affiliates, are monitored regularly by Corporate Finance and ERM. Procedures are in place for evaluating potentially impaired securities, as discussed in notes 1 and 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. Operational Risk We define operational risk as the potential for loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events. As a leading provider of services to institutional investors, we conduct a broad array of complex and specialized asset servicing, processing and fiduciary activities that give rise to operational risk. Consequently, active management of operational risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business. Our Operational Risk Policy Statement defines operational risk and details roles and responsibilities for managing operational risk. The Policy Statement is reinforced by the Operational Risk Guidelines, which codify our approach to operational risk. The Guidelines document our practices and provide a mandate within which programs, processes, and regulatory elements are implemented to ensure that operational risk is identified, measured, managed and controlled in a consistent manner across State Street. Responsibility for the management of operational risk lies with every individual at State Street. We maintain an operational risk governance structure designed to ensure that responsibilities are clearly defined and to provide independent oversight of operational risk management. The Executive Committee of the Board sets operational risk policy and oversees implementation of the operational risk framework. ERM develops corporate programs to manage operational risk and oversees the overall operational risk program. Businesses own operational risk and periodically review the status of the business controls, which are designed to provide a sound operational environment. The businesses also identify, manage, and report on operational risk. The MRC and the Operational Risk Committee review operational risk related information and policies, provide oversight designed to ensure compliance with the operational risk program, and escalate operational risk issues of note to the Executive Committee of the Board. Corporate Audit performs independent reviews of the application of operational risk management practices and methodologies and reports to the Examining and Audit Committee of the Board. Our discipline in managing operational risk, which is a result of this emphasis on policy, guidelines, oversight, and independent review, provides the structure to identify, evaluate, control, monitor, measure, mitigate and report operational risk. 78 Table of Contents Business Risk We define business risk as the risk of adverse changes in our earnings related to business factors, including changes in the competitive environment, changes in the operational economics of business activities and the potential effect of strategic and reputation risks, not already captured as market, interest rate, credit or operational risks. We incorporate business risk into our assessment of our economic capital needs. Active management of business risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business, and responsibility for the management of business risk lies with every individual at State Street. Separating the effects of a potential material adverse event into operational and business risk is sometimes difficult. For instance, the direct financial impact of an unfavorable event in the form of fines or penalties would be classified as an operational risk loss, while the impact on our reputation and the potential loss of customers and corresponding decline in revenue would be classified as a business risk loss. An additional example of business risk is the integration of a major acquisition. Failure to successfully integrate the operations of an acquired business, and the resultant inability to retain customers, would be classified as a business risk loss. Business risk is managed with a long term focus. Techniques include the development of business plans and appropriate management oversight. The potential impact of the various elements of business risk is difficult to quantify with any degree of precision. We use a combination of historical earnings volatility, scenario analysis, stress testing and management judgment to help assess the potential effect on State Street attributable to business risk. Management and control of business risks are generally the responsibility of the business units as part of their overall and strategic planning and internal risk management processes. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS In the normal course of business, we utilize three types of special purpose entities, referred to as SPEs. One type of SPE is utilized in connection with our involvement as collateral manager with respect to managed investment vehicles. Since we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of these managed investment vehicles under existing accounting standards, we do not record these vehicles in our consolidated financial statements. A second type of SPE is utilized in connection with our tax exempt investment program, under which trusts structure and sell certificated interests in pools of tax exempt investment grade assets to our mutual fund customers. These trusts are recorded in our consolidated financial statements, since we treat the underlying transactions as secured borrowings, not as sales. A third type of SPE is utilized in connection with our asset backed commercial paper program, under which we administer four third party asset backed commercial paper conduits, which sell commercial paper to our institutional customers, primarily mutual fund customers, as short term investments. Since we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of these conduits under existing accounting standards, we do not record the conduits in our consolidated financial statements. Additional information about the activities of the above described SPEs is provided in note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. In the normal course of business, we hold assets under custody and assets under management in a custodial or fiduciary capacity for our customers, and, in accordance with GAAP, we do not record these assets in our consolidated statement of condition. Similarly, collateral funds associated with our securities finance activities are held by us as agent; therefore, we do not record these assets in our consolidated statement of condition. Additional information about these and other off balance sheet activities is provided in note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. In the normal course of business, we utilize derivative financial instruments to support our customers needs, to conduct trading activities and to manage our interest rate and foreign currency risk. Additional information about our use of derivatives is in note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8. RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS Information with respect to recent accounting developments is provided in note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K under Item 8.
