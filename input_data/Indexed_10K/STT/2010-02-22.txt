ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS GENERAL State Street Corporation is a financial holding company organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. All references in this Managements Discussion and Analysis to the parent company are to State Street Corporation. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this Managements Discussion and Analysis to State Street, we, us, our or similar terms mean State Street Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. State Street Bank and Trust Company is referred to as State Street Bank. At December 31, 2009, we had total assets of $157.95 billion, total deposits of $90.06 billion, total shareholders equity of $14.49 billion and employed 27,310. With $18.79 trillion of assets under custody and administration and $1.91 trillion of assets under management at year end 2009, we are a leading specialist in meeting the needs of institutional investors worldwide. On December 22, 2009, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire the global custody, depository banking, correspondent banking and fund administration businesses of Intesa Sanpaolo, or Intesa, a securities services provider with operations in Italy and Luxembourg, for approximately 1.28 billion in a cash transaction. We also expect to provide additional balance sheet capital of approximately 400 million in cash at closing. Intesa had approximately 343 billion of average assets under custody, and approximately 141 billion of average assets under depository bank services, during the first half of 2009. The U.S. dollar equivalent of these amounts will be determined at closing, and will depend on the currency exchange rate at that time. In January 2010, we entered into derivative contracts to minimize the impact of an adverse change in the currency exchange rate on the U.S. dollar equivalent purchase price. We expect to finance the acquisition with internal liquidity. The acquisition agreement also includes a long term investment servicing arrangement with Intesa to service all of its investment management affiliates, including Eurizon Capital, the largest fund manager in Italy with approximately 135 billion of assets under management as of September 30, 2009. We expect to close the acquisition during the second quarter of 2010, subject to regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other closing conditions. On December 1, 2009, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Mourant International Finance Administration, or MIFA, in a cash transaction. Headquartered in Jersey in the Channel Islands with approximately $170 billion of assets under administration and operations in locations including Dublin, Singapore and New York, MIFA is a provider of fund administration services, particularly for alternative investments, such as private equity, real estate and hedge funds. We expect to close the acquisition during the first half of 2010, subject to regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other closing conditions. We report two lines of business: Investment Servicing and Investment Management. These lines of business provide a broad range of products and services for our customers, which include mutual funds, collective investment funds and other investment pools, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, foundations, endowments and investment managers. Investment Servicing provides services to support institutional investors, such as custody, product and participant level accounting, daily pricing and administration; master trust and master custody; recordkeeping; shareholder services, including mutual fund and collective investment fund shareholder accounting; foreign exchange, brokerage and other trading services; securities finance; deposit and short term investment facilities; loans and lease financing; investment manager and alternative investment manager operations outsourcing; and performance, risk and compliance analytics. Investment Management provides a broad array of services for managing financial assets, such as investment research services and investment management, including passive and active U.S. and non U.S. equity and fixed income strategies. For additional information about our lines of business, see the Line of Business Information section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis and note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. This Managements Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. Certain previously reported amounts presented have been reclassified to conform to current period classifications. We 32 Table of Contents prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., referred to as GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the application of certain accounting policies that materially affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Accounting policies that require management to make assumptions that are difficult, subjective or complex about matters that are uncertain and may change in subsequent periods are discussed in more depth in the Significant Accounting Estimates section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. Certain financial information provided in this Managements Discussion and Analysis, or in other public statements, announcements or reports filed with the SEC, is prepared on both a GAAP basis and a non GAAP basis, the latter of which we refer to as operating basis. Management measures and compares certain financial information on an operating basis, as it believes that this presentation supports meaningful comparisons from period to period and the analysis of comparable financial trends with respect to State Streets normal ongoing business operations. Management believes that operating basis financial information, which reports revenue from non taxable sources on a fully taxable equivalent basis and excludes the impact of revenue and expenses outside of the normal course of our business, facilitates an investors understanding and analysis of State Streets underlying financial performance and trends in addition to financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. This Managements Discussion and Analysis contains statements that are considered forward looking statements within the meaning of U.S. federal securities laws. Forward looking statements are based on our current expectations about revenue and market growth, acquisitions and divestitures, new technologies, services and opportunities, earnings and other factors. These forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially. We undertake no obligation to revise the forward looking statements contained in this Managements Discussion and Analysis to reflect events after the time we file this Form 10 K with the SEC. Additional information about forward looking statements and related risks and uncertainties is included in Risk Factors included under Item 1A. 33 Table of Contents OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL RESULTS Years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007(1) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Total fee revenue $ 5,935 $ 7,747 $ 6,633 Net interest revenue 2,564 2,650 1,730 Gains (Losses) related to investment securities, net 141 (54 ) (27 ) Gain on CitiStreet interest, net of exit and other associated costs 350 Total revenue 8,640 10,693 8,336 Provision for loan losses 149 Expenses: Expenses from operations 5,667 6,780 5,768 Provision for legal exposure, net 250 467 (2) Provision for investment account infusion 450 Restructuring charges 306 Provision for indemnification exposure 200 Merger and integration costs 49 115 198 Total expenses 5,966 7,851 6,433 Income before income tax expense and extraordinary loss 2,525 2,842 1,903 Income tax expense 722 1,031 642 Income before extraordinary loss 1,803 1,811 1,261 Extraordinary loss, net of taxes (3,684 ) Net income (loss) $ (1,881 ) $ 1,811 $ 1,261 Adjustments to net income (loss)(3) (163 ) (22 ) Net income before extraordinary loss available to common shareholders $ 1,640 $ 1,789 $ 1,261 Net income (loss) available to common shareholders $ (2,044 ) $ 1,789 $ 1,261 Earnings per common share before extraordinary loss: Basic $ 3.50 $ 4.32 $ 3.49 Diluted 3.46 4.30 3.45 Earnings (Loss) per common share: Basic $ (4.32 ) $ 4.32 $ 3.49 Diluted (4.31 ) 4.30 3.45 Average common shares outstanding (in thousands): Basic 470,602 413,182 360,675 Diluted 474,003 416,100 365,488 Return on common shareholders equity before extraordinary loss(4) 13.2 % 14.8 % 13.4 % (1) Financial results for 2007 include results for the third and fourth quarters of 2007 of the acquired business of Investors Financial Services Corp., which we acquired on July 1, 2007. (2) Amount was composed of a provision for legal exposure of $600 million, a reduction of salaries and benefits expense of $141 million, and other expenses of $8 million; refer to the Comparison of 2008 and 2007 section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. (3) Adjustments were related to preferred stock issued in connection with the U.S. Treasurys TARP program in 2008 and redeemed in 2009. (4) For 2009, return on common shareholders equity was determined by dividing net income before extraordinary loss available to common shareholders by average common shareholders equity for the year. 34 Table of Contents Financial Highlights For 2009, we recorded a net loss available to common shareholders of $2.04 billion, or $4.31 per diluted share. This included income before the extraordinary loss of $1.64 billion, or $3.46 per diluted share, and an after tax extraordinary loss of $3.68 billion, or $7.77 per diluted share, related to the consolidation of the asset backed commercial paper conduits that we administer onto our balance sheet in May 2009. Net income available to common shareholders before the extraordinary loss decreased 8% to $1.64 billion compared to $1.79 billion in 2008, and associated diluted earnings per common share decreased 20% to $3.46 per share from $4.30 per share in 2008. Return on common equity before the extraordinary loss was 13.2% compared to 14.8% for 2008. Total revenue declined 19% compared to 2008. A 23% decline in total fee revenue from 2008 levels was partly offset by an increase in net gains from investment securities. The decline in total revenue also reflected the absence of the $350 million gain from the sale of our joint venture interest in CitiStreet in 2008. Servicing and management fees were down 13% and 20%, respectively, from 2008, mainly due to the impact of declines in equity market valuations, partly offset by the impact of new business on current period revenue. Trading services revenue declined 25% to $1.09 billion from $1.47 billion, primarily as a result of lower foreign exchange trading volumes, offset by an increase in brokerage fees and other trading services revenue from higher transitions and electronic trading revenues attributable to higher volumes. Securities finance revenue was down 54% to $570 million from $1.23 billion, as a result of lower spreads and lending volumes. Processing fees and other revenue decreased 38% to $171 million from $277 million due to lower product related revenue. Net interest revenue decreased 3% to $2.56 billion compared to $2.65 billion for 2008, or 2% on a fully taxable equivalent basis ($2.69 billion compared to $2.75 billion, reflecting increases from tax equivalent adjustments of $126 million and $104 million, respectively). These decreases were primarily due to the impact of lower levels of customer deposits and lower interest rate spreads, largely offset by $621 million of discount accretion recorded in connection with the conduit assets added to our balance sheet in May 2009. Net interest margin increased 11 basis points, from 2.08% in 2008 to 2.19% in 2009. Total expenses of $5.97 billion decreased 24% from 2008, and included merger and integration costs of $49 million associated with the July 2007 Investors Financial acquisition and an additional provision of $250 million associated with the reserve for litigation exposure related to SSgA fixed income strategies, more fully discussed below. Total expenses in 2009 compared to $7.85 billion in 2008, which included the following: merger and integration costs associated with the July 2007 Investors Financial acquisition ($115 million); a charge associated with a cash infusion into SSgA investment management accounts ($450 million); restructuring charges associated with the reduction in workforce and other cost initiatives ($306 million); and a provision for estimated net exposure on an indemnification obligation associated with collateralized repurchase agreements ($200 million). Expenses from operations of $5.67 billion ($5.97 billion net of $299 million delineated above) decreased 16% compared to 2008 expenses from operations of $6.78 billion ($7.85 billion net of $1.07 billion delineated above), mainly as a result of a reduction in salaries and benefits expense associated with our previously announced workforce reduction as well as lower accruals for cash incentive compensation. Our financial results for 2009 reflected the following: Effective May 15, 2009, we elected to take action that resulted in the consolidation onto our balance sheet, for financial reporting purposes, of all of the assets and liabilities of the four third party owned, special purpose, multi seller asset backed commercial paper conduits that we administer, and recorded a related after tax extraordinary loss of approximately $3.68 billion in our consolidated statement of income (see note 11); In May 2009, we completed two public securities offerings. First, we issued approximately 58.97 million shares of our common stock at an offering price of $39 per share, and received aggregate proceeds from the offering, net of underwriting commissions and related offering costs, of approximately $2.23 billion. Second, we issued $500 million of 4.30% fixed rate senior unsecured notes due 2014. We completed these offerings primarily in connection with our intention to conclude our participation in the U.S. Treasurys TARP Capital Purchase Program, with the remaining proceeds intended for general corporate purposes; 35 Table of Contents In June 2009, we redeemed the $2 billion preferred stock portion of the equity investment issued to Treasury in October 2008 under the TARP Capital Purchase Program, reducing retained earnings, and as a result earnings available to common shareholders, by approximately $106 million for 2009, by accelerating the accretion of the remaining discount on the preferred stock into 2009. In July 2009, we repurchased the related warrant to purchase shares of our common stock from Treasury for $60 million, concluding our participation in the program (see note 12); We recorded interest revenue of $621 million in 2009 associated with discount accretion on investment securities added in connection with the May 2009 conduit consolidation (see the Net Interest Revenue section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis and note 11); During the third quarter of 2009, we recorded an additional provision for legal exposure of $250 million, to increase the reserve initially established in 2007 associated with certain active fixed income strategies managed by SSgA. We settled regulatory inquiries by the SEC, the Massachusetts Secretary of State and the Massachusetts Attorney Generals Office related to this exposure in February 2010, and the reserve remaining at that time was sufficient to cover the cost of the settlements (see notes 10 and 20); and We recorded provisions for loan losses of $149 million, of which $124 million related to commercial real estate loans acquired in 2008 pursuant to indemnification obligations, reflecting managements change in expectations of future principal and interest cash flows with respect to certain of the loans (see note 4). CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This section discusses our consolidated results of operations for 2009 compared to 2008, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included under Item 8. A comparison of consolidated results of operations for 2008 with those for 2007 is provided in the Comparison of 2008 and 2007 section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. TOTAL REVENUE Years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 % Change2008 2009 (Dollars in millions) Fee revenue: Servicing fees $ 3,276 $3,745 $ 3,388 (13 )% Management fees 824 1,028 1,141 (20 ) Trading services 1,094 1,467 1,152 (25 ) Securities finance 570 1,230 681 (54 ) Processing fees and other 171 277 271 (38 ) Total fee revenue 5,935 7,747 6,633 (23 ) Net interest revenue: Interest revenue 3,286 4,879 5,212 (33 ) Interest expense 722 2,229 3,482 (68 ) Net interest revenue 2,564 2,650 1,730 (3 ) Gains (Losses) related to investment securities, net 141 (54 ) (27 ) Gain on sale of CitiStreet interest, net of exit and other associated costs 350 Total revenue $ 8,640 $ 10,693 $ 8,336 (19 ) Our broad range of services generates fee revenue and net interest revenue. Fee revenue generated by our investment servicing and investment management businesses is augmented by securities finance, trading services and processing fee and other revenue. We earn net interest revenue from customers deposits and short term investment activities, by providing deposit services and short term investment vehicles, such as repurchase agreements and commercial paper, to meet customers needs for high grade liquid investments, and investing these sources of funds and additional borrowings in assets yielding a higher rate. 36 Table of Contents Fee Revenue Servicing and management fees collectively composed approximately 69% of our total fee revenue for 2009 and 62% for 2008. These fees are a function of several factors, including the mix and volume of assets under custody and administration and assets under management, securities positions held and the volume of portfolio transactions, and the types of products and services used by customers, and are generally affected by changes in worldwide equity and fixed income valuations. Generally, servicing fees are affected, in part, by changes in daily average valuations of assets under custody and administration, while management fees are affected by changes in month end valuations of assets under management. Additional factors, such as the level of transaction volumes, changes in service level, balance credits, customer minimum balances, pricing concessions and other factors, may have a significant effect on servicing fee revenue. Generally, management fee revenue is more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue. Management fees for enhanced index and actively managed products are generally earned at higher rates than those for passive products. Enhanced index and actively managed products may also involve performance fee arrangements. Performance fees are generated when the performance of certain managed funds exceeds benchmarks specified in the management agreements. Generally, we experience more volatility with performance fees than with more traditional management fees. In light of the above, we estimate, assuming all other factors remain constant, that a 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity values would result in a corresponding change in our total revenue of approximately 2%. If fixed income security values were to increase or decrease by 10%, we would anticipate a corresponding change of approximately 1% in our total revenue. We would expect the foregoing relationships to exist in normalized financial markets. These relationships were not experienced in 2008 or 2009, in light of the global financial markets disruption that began in 2007. These disrupted conditions adversely affected our servicing and management fee revenues for 2008 and 2009, which are based, in part, on the value of assets under custody and administration or assets under management as described earlier in this section. In addition, our revenues from trading services and securities finance during 2009 were adversely affected by a reduction in the significant volatility in the financial markets experienced during 2008 associated with the aforementioned disruption. Even though the market disruption lessened during this years third and fourth quarters, the impact of market conditions on our total revenue for the year was more significant than we would anticipate in normalized markets. The following table presents selected equity market indices for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Daily averages and the averages of month end indices demonstrate worldwide changes in equity market valuations that affect servicing and management fee revenue, respectively. Year end indices affect the value of assets under custody and administration and assets under management at those dates. The index names listed in the table are service marks of their respective owners.

Servicing Fees Servicing fees include fee revenue from U.S. mutual funds, collective investment funds worldwide, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, foundations, endowments, and other investment pools. Products and services include custody; product and participant level accounting; daily pricing and administration; recordkeeping; investment manager and alternative investment manager operations outsourcing services; master trust and master custody; and performance, risk and compliance analytics. The 13% decline in servicing fees from 2008 primarily resulted from the impact of declines in daily average equity market valuations, partly offset by the impact of new business on current period revenue. For 2009, servicing fees generated from customers outside the U.S. were approximately 37% of total servicing fees compared to approximately 41% for 2008. We are the largest provider of mutual fund custody and accounting services in the United States. We distinguish ourselves from other mutual fund service providers by offering customers a broad array of integrated products and services, including accounting, daily pricing and fund administration. We calculate more than 40% of the U.S. mutual fund prices provided to NASDAQ that appear daily in The Wall Street Journal and other publications with an accuracy rate of 99.9%. We have a leading position for servicing U.S. tax exempt assets for corporate and public pension funds. We provide trust and valuation services for more than 5,000 daily priced portfolios, making us a leader for both monthly and daily valuation services. We are a leading service provider outside of the U.S. as well. In Germany, we provide Depotbank services for approximately 13% of retail and institutional fund assets. In the United Kingdom, we provide custody services for 14% of pension fund assets and provide administration services for approximately 16% of mutual fund assets. We service more than $650 billion of offshore assets, primarily domiciled in Ireland, Luxembourg and Toronto. We have more than $800 billion in assets under administration in the Asia/Pacific region, and hold over 85% of the trust assets held by non domestic trust banks in that region. 38 Table of Contents At year end 2009, our total assets under custody and administration were $18.79 trillion, compared to $15.91 trillion a year earlier. The increase compared to 2008 was primarily the result of increases in equity market valuations and a higher level of new business. The value of assets under custody and administration is a broad measure of the relative size of various markets served. Changes in the value of assets under custody and administration do not necessarily result in proportional changes in revenue. Assets under custody and administration consisted of the following at December 31: ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY AND ADMINISTRATION As of December 31, 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2008 2009AnnualGrowthRate 2005 2009CompoundAnnualGrowthRate (Dollars in billions) Mutual funds $ 4,734 $ 4,093 $ 5,200 $ 4,007 $ 3,301 16 % 9 % Collective funds 3,580 2,679 3,968 1,947 1,489 34 25 Pension products 4,395 3,621 5,246 4,914 4,334 21 Insurance and other products 6,086 5,514 5,799 4,780 4,083 10 10 Total $ 18,795 $ 15,907 $ 20,213 $ 15,648 $ 13,207 18 9 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT MIX OF ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY AND ADMINISTRATION As of December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (In billions) Equities $ 8,828 $ 6,691 $ 9,532 Fixed income 7,236 6,689 7,739 Short term and other investments 2,731 2,527 2,942 Total $ 18,795 $ 15,907 $ 20,213 GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY AND ADMINISTRATION(1) As of December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (In billions) United States $ 14,585 $ 12,424 $ 15,335 Other Americas 606 536 830 Europe/Middle East/Africa 2,773 2,391 3,233 Asia/Pacific 831 556 815 Total $ 18,795 $ 15,907 $ 20,213 (1) Geographic mix is based on the location where the assets are serviced. Management Fees We provide a broad range of investment management strategies, specialized investment management advisory services and other financial services for corporations, public funds, and other sophisticated investors. These services are offered through SSgA. Based upon assets under management, SSgA is the largest manager of institutional assets worldwide, the largest manager of assets for tax exempt organizations (primarily pension plans) in the United States, and the third largest investment manager overall in the world. SSgA offers a broad array of investment management strategies, including passive and active, such as enhanced indexing and hedge fund strategies, using quantitative and fundamental methods for both U.S. and global equities and fixed income securities. SSgA also offers exchange traded funds, or ETFs, such as the SPDR&reg; Gold ETF. The 20% decline in management fees from 2008 resulted primarily from the impact of declines in average month end equity market valuations and the impact of a higher percentage of assets invested in lower rate passive strategies, partly offset by the impact of new business on current period revenue. Average month end 39 Table of Contents equity market valuations, individually presented in the foregoing INDEX table, were down an average of 19% compared to 2008. Management fees generated from customers outside the United States were approximately 33% of total management fees for 2009, down from 40% for 2008. At year end 2009, assets under management were $1.91 trillion, compared to $1.44 trillion at year end 2008. While certain management fees are directly determined by the value of assets under management and the investment strategy employed, management fees reflect other factors as well, including our relationship pricing for customers who use multiple services, and the benchmarks specified in the respective management agreements related to performance fees. The overall increase in assets under management at December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008 primarily reflected an aggregate increase in net new business of approximately $248 billion, compared to an aggregate net loss of business of approximately $55 billion during 2008, and increases in equity market valuations. Our levels of assets under management were affected by a number of factors, including investor issues related to SSgAs active fixed income strategies, restrictions on redemptions related to funds engaged in securities lending, and the relative under performance of certain of our passive equity products. The increase in net new business of $248 billion for 2009 reflected new business awarded to us during 2009, primarily in passive strategies, which was installed prior to December 31, 2009.

We offer a complete range of foreign exchange services under an account model that focuses on the global requirements of our customers for our proprietary research and the execution of trades in any time zone. Foreign exchange trading revenue is influenced by three principal factors: the volume and type of customer foreign exchange transactions; currency volatility; and the management of currency market risks. For 2009, foreign exchange trading revenue totaled $677 million, a 37% decrease from 2008 revenue of $1.08 billion, mainly driven by a 16% decline in customer volumes and a 4% decrease in currency volatility, as the financial markets were relatively more stable during 2009 than during 2008. We also offer a range of brokerage and other trading products tailored specifically to meet the needs of the global pension community, including transition management, commission recapture and self directed brokerage. These products are differentiated by our position as an agent of the institutional investor. Brokerage and other trading fees of $417 million were higher by 8% compared to $385 million in 2008. The increase was attributable to higher brokerage revenue, principally from growth in fixed income transition management and equity trading, as well as to an increase in revenues from electronic trading services associated with higher volumes. Securities Finance Securities finance provides liquidity to the financial markets, as well as an effective means for customers to earn revenue on their securities portfolios. By acting as a lending agent and coordinating loans between lenders and borrowers, we lend securities and provide liquidity to customers around the world. Borrowers provide collateral in the form of cash or securities to State Street in return for loaned securities. Borrowers are generally required to provide collateral equal to a contractually agreed percentage of the fair value of the loaned securities. As the fair value of the loaned securities changes, additional collateral is provided by the borrower or collateral is returned to the borrower. Such movements are typically referred to as daily mark to market collateral adjustments. For cash collateral, we pay a usage fee to the provider of the cash collateral, and invest the cash collateral in certain investment vehicles or managed accounts as directed by the owner of the loaned securities. In some cases, the investment vehicles or managed accounts may be managed by SSgA. The spread between the yield on the investment vehicle and the usage fee paid to the provider of the collateral is split between the lender of the securities and State Street as agent. For non cash collateral, the borrower pays a fee for the loaned securities, and the fee is split between the lender of the securities and State Street. Securities finance revenue, composed of our split of both the spreads related to cash collateral and the fees related to non cash collateral, is principally a function of the volume of securities on loan and the interest rate spreads and fees earned on the underlying collateral. For 2009, securities finance revenue decreased 54% from a year earlier, primarily as a result of compression of spreads across all lending programs as well as a 32% decrease in the average volume of securities on loan during 2009 compared to 2008. 41 Table of Contents Market influences are expected to continue to affect our revenue from, and the profitability of, our securities lending activities in 2010. Over the past 18 months, the aggregate volume of securities on loan under our direct lending program has decreased significantly, from an average of approximately $670 billion of aggregate securities on loan during the second quarter of 2008 to approximately $440 billion during the fourth quarter of 2008 and approximately $405 billion during the fourth quarter of 2009. This decline in average lending volume reflects both the general de leveraging of the securities markets following the Lehman bankruptcy proceedings and, to a lesser degree, regulatory measures affecting securities lending. At the same time, during 2009, the spreads, described above, earned by participants decreased significantly, reflecting prevailing interest rates and government actions to stimulate the economy. Until securities lending volumes and spreads return to more normal levels, our revenues from securities lending activities will be adversely affected, which in turn may discourage customers who exited securities lending in 2007 and 2008 from returning to the practice. Purported class actions have been filed regarding certain collateral pools underlying funds managed by SSgA, and we are responding to inquiries from the SEC and other regulatory authorities in connection with our cash collateral pools. Additional information is included in the Risk Factors and Legal Proceedings sections included under Items 1A and 3, respectively. Processing Fees and Other Processing fees and other revenue includes diverse types of fees and other revenue, including fees from our structured products business, fees from software licensing and maintenance, equity income from our joint venture investments, gains and losses on sales of leased equipment and other assets, and amortization of investments in tax advantaged financings. Processing fees and other revenue was $171 million for 2009, a decrease of 38% compared to 2008. This decrease was mainly the result of declines in fees from our deposit service and structured products businesses, including our tax exempt investment and conduit commercial paper programs, the latter the result of the May 2009 conduit consolidation. Prior to the conduit consolidation, we earned administrative fees for providing administrative services to each of the conduits, which generally represented the conduits residual earnings after the payment of interest on outstanding commercial paper and the payment of other fees to independent third parties. We earned fee revenue of approximately $19 million for 2009 up to the date of the consolidation, compared to $59 million for all of 2008 and $63 million for all of 2007. Since the conduits assets and liabilities are now recorded in our consolidated balance sheet, the conduits business activities generate net interest revenue rather than processing fees and other revenue. More information about the impact of the conduit consolidation on our net interest revenue is provided in the Net Interest Revenue section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. 42 Table of Contents NET INTEREST REVENUE Years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 AverageBalance InterestRevenue/Expense Rate AverageBalance InterestRevenue/Expense Rate AverageBalance InterestRevenue/Expense Rate (Dollars in millions; fullytaxable equivalent basis) Interest bearing deposits with banks $ 24,162 $ 156 .64 % $ 24,003 $ 760 3.17 % $ 7,433 $ 416 5.60 % Securities purchased under resale agreements 3,701 24 .65 10,195 276 2.71 12,466 664 5.32 Federal funds sold 68 .29 2,700 63 2.33 1,936 92 4.77 Trading account assets 1,914 20 1.02 2,423 78 3.22 972 55 5.60 Investment securities 81,190 2,943 3.63 72,227 3,163 4.38 70,990 3,649 5.14 Investment securities purchased under AMLF(1) 882 25 2.86 9,193 367 4.00 Loans and leases(2) 9,703 242 2.49 11,884 276 2.32 10,753 394 3.67 Other interest earning assets 1,303 2 .15 Total interest earning assets $ 122,923 $ 3,412 2.78 $ 132,625 $ 4,983 3.75 $ 104,550 $ 5,270 5.04 Interest bearing deposits: U.S $ 7,616 $ 61 .81 % $ 11,216 $ 223 1.99 % $ 7,557 $ 313 4.13 % Non U.S 61,551 134 .22 68,291 1,103 1.62 60,663 1,985 3.27 Securities sold under repurchase agreements 11,065 3 .03 14,261 177 1.24 16,132 701 4.35 Federal funds purchased 956 .04 1,026 18 1.77 1,667 86 5.15 Short term borrowings under AMLF(1) 877 18 2.02 9,170 299 3.26 Other short term borrowings 16,847 197 1.17 5,996 180 2.99 4,225 172 4.09 Long term debt 7,917 304 3.84 4,106 229 5.59 3,402 225 6.62 Other interest bearing liabilities 1,131 5 .46 Total interest bearing liabilities $ 107,960 $ 722 .67 $ 114,066 $ 2,229 1.95 $ 93,646 $ 3,482 3.72 Interest rate spread 2.11 % 1.80 % 1.32 % Net interest revenue fully taxable equivalent basis(3) $ 2,690 $ 2,754 $ 1,788 Net interest margin fully taxable equivalent basis 2.19 % 2.08 % 1.71 % Net interest revenue GAAP basis $ 2,564 $ 2,650 $ 1,730 (1) Amounts represent averages of asset backed commercial paper purchases from eligible unaffiliated money market mutual funds under the Federal Reserves Asset Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, or AMLF, and associated borrowings. Additional information about the AMLF, which recently expired, is provided in note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. (2) Interest revenue for 2008 reflected a cumulative reduction of $98 million recorded in connection with our SILO lease transactions. Additional information about our SILO lease transactions is provided in note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. (3) Amounts include fully taxable equivalent adjustments of $126 million for 2009, $104 million for 2008 and $58 million for 2007. Net interest revenue is defined as the total of interest revenue earned on interest earning assets less interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities. Interest earning assets, which consist of investment securities, loans and leases and other liquid assets, are financed primarily by customer deposits and short term borrowings. Net interest margin represents the relationship between net interest revenue and average interest earning assets. Changes in the components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are discussed in more detail below. Additional detail about the components of interest revenue and interest expense is provided in note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. 43 Table of Contents For 2009, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, net interest revenue decreased 2% (3% on a GAAP basis) compared to 2008. This decline was generally the result of lower rates on floating rate investment securities and both lower volumes and lower rate spreads on customer deposits, as well as the re investment of amortizing and maturing investment securities into short term interest bearing deposits rather than investment securities during the first half of 2009, in connection with our previously announced plan to improve our tangible common equity. The decrease in fully taxable equivalent net interest revenue was partially offset by discount accretion, described below, on securities added in connection with the May 2009 conduit consolidation. Average aggregate interest bearing deposits decreased 13% compared to 2008, primarily due to the current low yield environment and a decrease in customers cash balances more reflective of historical levels as global market disruptions lessened. In May 2009, we elected to take action that required the consolidation onto our balance sheet, for financial reporting purposes, of the assets and liabilities of the asset backed commercial paper conduits that we sponsored and administered. Upon consolidation, the aggregate fair value of the conduits investment securities was established as their carrying amount, resulting in a discount to the assets par value. To the extent that the expected future cash flows from the securities exceed their carrying amount, the portion of the discount not related to credit will accrete into interest revenue over the securities remaining terms. The timing and ultimate recognition of this accretion will depend on factors including future credit conditions and the timing of underlying collateral prepayment, the predictability of which is challenged by the continuing global financial markets disruption. During 2009, we recorded discount accretion in interest revenue of approximately $621 million, and we anticipate that discount accretion will continue to be a material component of our net interest revenue for 2010. Because the rate of recognition of discount accretion is dependent, in part, on the rate of underlying prepayments, which is beyond our control, the volatility of our net interest revenue may increase. Interest bearing deposits with banks, including cash balances held at the Federal Reserve to satisfy reserve requirements, averaged $24.16 billion for 2009, relatively flat compared to $24.00 billion in 2008. An average of $12.42 billion was held at the Federal Reserve Bank during 2009, an increase of $6.06 billion compared to $6.36 billion for 2008, with the balances in both periods exceeding minimum reserve requirements. This increase resulted from our investment of excess liquidity, beginning in the second half of 2008, in reserve balances held at the Federal Reserve Bank. Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2008, these balances earn a minimal rate of interest, which rate is subject to change at the Federal Reserves discretion. Average securities purchased under resale agreements decreased 64%, or $6.49 billion, from $10.20 billion for 2008 to $3.70 billion for 2009. Average federal funds sold decreased $2.63 billion, or 97%, to $68 million for 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease in federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements was mainly due to the re allocation of liquidity to U.S. Treasury securities in the investment securities portfolio and the placement of excess liquidity at the Federal Reserve, as described above, and other central banks. Average trading account assets decreased 21%, or $509 million, from $2.42 billion for 2008 to $1.91 billion in 2009, due to the absence of conduit asset backed commercial paper which was eliminated for financial reporting purposes when the conduits were consolidated onto our balance sheet as described above. Our average investment securities portfolio increased 12%, or $8.96 billion, from $72.23 billion in 2008 to approximately $81.19 billion in 2009, due to the effect of the conduit consolidation and an increase in U.S. Treasury and agency securities, as well as the re investment of amortizing and maturing securities, partially offset by sales. During the second half of 2009, we re initiated our investment strategy of investing in AAA and AA rated securities. Securities rated AAA and AA comprised approximately 80% of the investment securities portfolio, with approximately 69% AAA rated, at December 31, 2009, compared to 89% AAA and AA rated and 78% AAA rated, respectively, at December 31, 2008. Loans and leases averaged $9.70 billion for the 2009, down 18% from $11.88 billion for 2008. The decrease was primarily related to lower levels of short term liquidity required by customers, partially offset by the structured asset backed loans added in connection with the conduit consolidation. Approximately 31% of the average loan and lease portfolio, compared to 67% for 2008, was composed of U.S. and non U.S. short duration advances that provide liquidity to customers in support of their transaction flows, which averaged approximately $2.97 billion for 2009, down $5.03 billion, or 63%, from $8.00 billion for 2008. The lower levels of liquidity we 44 Table of Contents provided to customers during 2009 were due to a decrease in customer demand and not a reduction in credit availability from, or committed lines provided by, State Street. As transaction flows returned to more normalized levels compared to the extraordinarily high levels experienced in 2008, customer demand for short term liquidity declined. Average interest bearing deposits decreased $10.34 billion, or 13%, from $79.51 billion to $69.17 billion for 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease was due to lower levels of U.S. and non U.S. deposits, including foreign transaction deposits, which were particularly high during 2008. This decrease also reflected the current low yield interest rate environment and a decrease in customers cash balances, the latter more reflective of historical levels as global market disruptions lessened. Average other short term borrowings increased $10.85 billion, or 181%, to $16.85 billion for 2009 primarily due to the addition of commercial paper in connection with the conduit consolidation and borrowings under the Federal Reserves term auction facility, which is a secured lending program available to financial institutions, to fund conduit assets. Average long term debt increased $3.81 billion, or 93%, to $7.92 billion for 2009 due to the issuance of an aggregate of approximately $4 billion of unsecured senior notes by State Street and State Street Bank in March 2009 under the FDICs Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, or TLGP, and the issuance by State Street of $500 million of unsecured senior notes in May 2009. Several factors could affect future levels of our net interest revenue and margin, including the mix of customer liabilities, actions of the various central banks, changes in U.S. and non U.S. interest rates, the shapes of the various yield curves around the world and the amount of discount accretion on the investment securities added to our consolidated balance sheet in connection with the conduit consolidation. Based on market conditions, we re initiated our investment strategy of re investing proceeds from amortizing and maturing securities in highly rated investment securities, such as U.S. Treasuries and federal agency mortgage backed securities and asset backed securities, which enhanced our net interest revenue and margin during the second half of 2009. The pace at which we continue to re invest and the types of securities purchased will depend on market conditions over time. These factors and the level of interest rates worldwide are expected to dictate what impact the re investment program will have on our net interest revenue and net interest margin in the future. Gains (Losses) Related to Investment Securities, Net We recorded net gains of $368 million from sales of available for sale securities for 2009, compared to net gains of $68 million for 2008. The aggregate unrealized loss on securities for which other than temporary impairment was recorded in 2009 was $1.15 billion. Of this total, $928 million related to factors other than credit, and was recognized, net of taxes, as a component of other comprehensive income in our consolidated statement of condition. We recorded losses from other than temporary impairment related to credit of the remaining $227 million in our 2009 consolidated statement of income, compared to $122 million in 2008, which resulted from our assessment of impairment. 45 Table of Contents For 2009, the $227 million of losses was composed of $151 million associated with expected credit losses, $54 million related to managements decision to sell the impaired securities prior to their recovery in value, and $22 million associated with adverse changes in the timing of expected future cash flows from the securities. The majority of the impairment losses related to non agency mortgage backed securities which management concluded had experienced credit losses. These securities are reported as asset backed securities in note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. Years ended December 31, 2009 2008 (In millions) Net gains from sales of available for sale securities $ 368 $ 68 Losses from other than temporary impairment (1,155 ) (122 ) Losses not related to credit(1) 928 Net impairment losses (227 ) (122 ) Gains (Losses) related to investment securities, net $ 141 $ (54 ) (1) These losses were not recorded in our consolidated results of operations, but were recognized as a component of other comprehensive income, net of related taxes, in our consolidated balance sheet; refer to the following discussion and to note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. Management regularly reviews the investment securities portfolio to identify other than temporary impairment of individual securities. Pursuant to the provisions of a new accounting standard, which we adopted effective April 1, 2009, impairment related to expected losses represents the difference between the discounted values of the expected future cash flows from the securities compared to their current amortized cost basis, with each discount rate commensurate with the effective yield on the underlying security. For debt securities held to maturity, other than temporary impairment remaining after credit related impairment (which credit related impairment is recorded in our consolidated statement of income) is recognized, net of taxes, as a component of other comprehensive income in the shareholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheet, and is accreted prospectively over the remaining terms of the securities based on the timing of their estimated future cash flows. For other than temporary impairment of debt securities that results from managements decision to sell the security prior to its recovery in value, the entire difference between the securitys fair value and its amortized cost basis is recorded in our consolidated statement of income. The aforementioned accounting for other than temporary impairment was adopted by us, pursuant to new accounting standards, effective April 1, 2009. Prior to that date, we recognized losses from other than temporary impairment of debt and equity securities for either a change in managements intent to hold the securities or expected credit losses, and such impairment losses, which reflected the entire difference between the fair value and amortized cost basis of each individual security, were recorded in our consolidated statement of income. Additional information about investment securities, the gross gains and losses that compose the net sale gains and our process to identify other than temporary impairment, is provided in note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. 46 Table of Contents PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES We recorded provisions for loan losses of $149 million during 2009. Of the aggregate provisions, $124 million resulted from changes in managements expectations with respect to future principal and interest cash flows from certain of the commercial real estate loans acquired in 2008 in connection with indemnification obligations. The changes in managements expectations were primarily based on its assessment of the impact of the deteriorating economic conditions in the commercial real estate markets on certain of these loans during 2009. Future changes in expectations with respect to collection of principal and interest on these loans could result in additional provisions for loan losses.

The increase in information systems and communications expense for 2009 reflected higher levels of spending on telecommunications hardware and software. Transaction processing services expense, which is volume related and includes equity trading services and fees related to securities settlement, sub custodian services and external contract services, decreased due to lower volumes in the investment servicing business and lower costs related to external contract services. Occupancy expense increased slightly from 2008, mainly as a result of higher occupancy costs domestically and in Europe. The provision for legal exposure of $250 million resulted from an increase in the reserve initially established in 2007 associated with certain active fixed income strategies managed by SSgA. We settled regulatory inquiries related to this exposure in February 2010. The provision and subsequent settlement are more fully discussed in notes 20 and 10, respectively, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. In December 2008, we announced a plan to reduce our operating costs and support our long term growth while aligning the organization to meet the challenges and opportunities presented by the then current market environment. As a primary component of this plan, we initiated a reduction of approximately 8% of our global workforce, which we substantially completed at the end of the first quarter of 2009, and during 2008, recorded 47 Table of Contents aggregate restructuring charges of $306 million. Additional information with respect to the charges, and activity during 2009 in the related balance sheet reserve, is provided in note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. During 2009, in connection with the Investors Financial acquisition, we recorded merger and integration costs of $49 million, compared to $115 million for 2008. These costs consisted only of direct and incremental costs to integrate the acquired Investors Financial business into our operations, and did not include ongoing expenses of the combined organization. The costs were primarily related to employee retention and system and customer integration. The decrease in aggregate other expenses (professional services, securities processing, amortization of other intangible assets, regulator fees and assessments and other) from $1.2 billion for 2008 to $916 million for 2009 resulted primarily from a 39% decrease in securities processing costs due to lower processing volume and a 27% decrease in professional services spending, primarily legal and consulting costs. This overall decrease was offset slightly by higher regulatory assessments associated with the increased cost of deposit insurance. Income Taxes Income tax expense before the extraordinary loss totaled $722 million for 2009, compared to $1.03 billion a year ago. Our overall effective tax rate for 2009 was 28.6%, compared to 36.2% for 2008. The decline in both income tax expense and the effective rate was generally the result of an increase in the proportion of earnings from certain of our non U.S. subsidiaries, where managements intention is to reinvest those earnings indefinitely overseas. Our intent to reinvest these earnings overseas is consistent with our business strategy to pursue growth in non U.S. markets, and allowed us to reduce taxes accrued with respect to 2009 earnings, as well as certain taxes accrued in prior periods. Information about income tax contingencies related to our SILO lease transactions is provided in note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. LINE OF BUSINESS INFORMATION We have two lines of business: Investment Servicing and Investment Management. Given our services and management organization, the results of operations for these lines of business are not necessarily comparable with those of other companies, including companies in the financial services industry. Information about revenues, expenses and capital allocation methodologies with respect to these lines of business is provided in note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. 48 Table of Contents The following is a summary of our line of business results. The amounts in the Divestitures columns represent the operating results of our joint venture interest in CitiStreet prior to our sale of that interest in July 2008. The amounts presented in the Other column for 2009 represent net interest revenue earned in connection with our participation in the Federal Reserves AMLF, the provision for loan losses associated with the commercial real estate loans acquired in 2008 and merger and integration costs recorded in connection with our July 2007 acquisition of Investors Financial. The amounts in the Other column for 2008 represent the net interest revenue associated with our participation in the AMLF; the gain on the sale of our joint venture interest in CitiStreet; the restructuring charges recorded primarily in connection with our plan to reduce our expenses from operations; the provision related to our estimated net exposure for customer indemnification associated with collateralized repurchase agreements; and merger and integration costs recorded in connection with the Investors Financial acquisition. The amounts in the Other column for 2007 represent merger and acquisition costs recorded in connection with the Investors Financial acquisition. The amounts in the Divestitures and Other columns were not allocated to State Streets business lines.

Servicing fees decreased partly as a result of the impact of declines in the equity markets, partly offset by the impact of new business on current period revenue. The decrease in trading services revenue primarily reflected a decrease in foreign exchange trading revenue, caused primarily by lower levels of volatility and customer volumes, partly offset by higher revenue from 49 Table of Contents transition management and higher levels of fees from electronic trading attributable to higher volumes. Securities finance revenue decreased primarily due to compression of credit spreads as well as lower volumes of assets on loan. Processing fees and other revenue declined primarily as a result of the May 2009 consolidation of the conduits, as fees generated from administrative services provided to the conduits were no longer recorded subsequent to the consolidation. Servicing fees, trading services revenue and gains (losses) related to investment securities, net, for our Investment Servicing business line are identical to the respective consolidated results. Refer to the Servicing Fees, Trading Services and Gains (Losses) Related to Investment Securities, Net captions in the Total Revenue section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis for a more in depth discussion. A discussion of processing fees and other revenue is provided under the caption Processing Fees and Other in the Total Revenue section. Net interest revenue remained relatively flat compared to 2008, as the negative impact of lower rates on the yields generated by floating rate assets was offset by discount accretion recorded subsequent to the consolidation of the conduits. A portion of net interest revenue is recorded in the Investment Management business line based on the volume of customer liabilities attributable to that business. Total expenses declined 14% from 2008, primarily driven by the reduction in the accrual of cash incentive compensation, lower levels of salaries and benefits costs and lower costs related to contract services. Investment Management Total revenue for 2009 decreased 24% compared to 2008, reflecting the impact of a 23% decrease in total fee revenue and a 34% decrease in net interest revenue. The 20% decline in management fees, generated by SSgA, resulted primarily from the impact of declines in equity market valuations, partly offset by the impact of new business on current period revenue. Securities finance revenue decreased primarily due to compression of credit spreads as well as lower volumes of assets on loan. Management fees for the Investment Management business line are identical to the respective consolidated results. Refer to the Management Fees caption in the Total Revenue section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis for a more in depth discussion. Expenses from operations declined 29% from 2008, primarily due to lower accruals of cash incentive compensation and reductions in staffing levels, as well as lower levels of professional fees. The $250 million and $450 million provisions for legal exposure and investment account infusion, respectively, are discussed in the Expenses section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis and in note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. Certain funds managed by SSgA that engage in securities lending continue to invest in cash collateral pools underlying these funds, the net asset values of which remain less than $1.00 per unit. These funds have imposed limitations on participant redemptions. Our continuation of the limitations on participant redemptions and the difference between the net asset value used for purchase and redemption transactions ($1.00 per unit) and the net asset value of the pools could, if either or both continue, adversely effect SSgAs reputation, the marketing of its lending funds and its future results of operations. Refer to a discussion of the funds and the underlying cash collateral pools in the Risk Factors section included under Item 1A. Purported class actions have been filed regarding certain collateral pools underlying funds managed by SSgA, and we are responding to inquiries from the SEC and other regulatory authorities in connection with our cash collateral pools. Refer to the Risk Factors and Legal Proceedings sections included under Items 1A and 3, respectively. 50 Table of Contents COMPARISON OF 2008 AND 2007 OVERVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 % Change (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Total fee revenue $ 7,747 $ 6,633 17 % Net interest revenue 2,650 1,730 53 Gains (Losses) related to investment securities, net (54 ) (27 ) Gain on sale of CitiStreet interest, net of exit and other associated costs 350 Total revenue 10,693 8,336 28 Total expenses 7,851 6,433 22 Income before income tax expense 2,842 1,903 49 Income tax expense 1,031 642 61 Net income 1,811 1,261 44 Adjustment to net income (loss)(1) (22 ) Net income available to common shareholders $ 1,789 $ 1,261 42 Earnings per common share: Basic $ 4.32 $ 3.49 24 Diluted 4.30 3.45 25 Earnings per common share: Basic $ 4.32 $ 3.49 Diluted 4.30 3.45 Return on common shareholders equity 14.8 % 13.4 % (1) Adjustment was related to preferred stock issued in connection with the U.S. Treasurys TARP Program.

The growth in trading services revenue was the result of higher levels of currency volatility in foreign exchange trading, as well as the contribution of revenue of both the acquired Investors Financial business (with 51 Table of Contents respect to foreign exchange) and the acquired Currenex business (with respect to brokerage and other) for a full year. Brokerage and other trading revenue increased 10% from 2007 to 2008, due to higher revenues from electronic trading, both from the acquired Currenex business and from our Global Link product, as well as an increase in brokerage revenue, principally transition management and equity trading. Securities finance revenue for 2008 was up 81% compared to 2007, primarily as a result of wider credit spreads across all lending programs. Spreads benefited from the Federal Reserves aggregate 400 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate during 2008, as well as from the continued disruption of the global fixed income securities markets. The increases were offset partially by a decline in lending volumes. The 11% increase in servicing fees was the result of the inclusion of servicing fee revenue from the acquired Investor Financial business for a full year, the impact of new business on 2008 revenue and higher transaction volumes. Approximately 41% of our servicing fees were derived from non U.S. customers in each of 2008 and 2007. Management fees decreased 10% from 2007 to 2008, $1.14 billion to $1.03 billion respectively, primarily from the impact of declines in average month end equity market valuations and performance fees. Approximately 40% of our management fees were derived from customers outside the U.S. in 2008, down from 41% for 2007. Assets under management decreased to $1.44 trillion at December 31, 2008, down $535 billion from $1.98 trillion a year earlier, as we experienced a net loss of business and, more significantly, market depreciation. The increase in net interest revenue was the result of several favorable trends. Interest earning assets and related net interest revenue from the acquired Investors Financial business and widening spreads on fixed rate and tax exempt investment securities were the primary reasons for the growth. In addition, transaction deposit volume increased, particularly with respect to non U.S. deposits. EXPENSES Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 % Change (Dollars in millions) Salaries and employee benefits $ 3,842 $ 3,256 18 % Information systems and communications 633 546 16 Transaction processing services 644 619 4 Occupancy 465 408 14 Provision for legal exposure 600 Provision for investment account infusion 450 Restructuring charges 306 Merger and integration costs 115 198 (42 ) Professional services 360 236 53 Amortization of other intangible assets 144 92 57 Customer indemnification obligation 200 Other 692 478 45 Total expenses $ 7,851 $ 6,433 22 The increase in salaries and employee benefits for 2008 compared to 2007 was driven primarily by the contribution of a full year of salaries and benefits expense from the acquired Investors Financial business, the impact of higher staffing levels to support new business, higher average salaries and benefits expense and increased contract services spending. The increases were offset by a decline in accruals for cash incentive compensation. Information systems and communications expense increased due to the addition of expenses from the acquired Investors Financial business, as well as increased spending on telecommunications hardware and software. Transaction processing services expenses increased over 2007, and resulted primarily from higher transaction volumes and costs of external contract services, primarily in Europe. 52 Table of Contents The increase in occupancy expense from 2007 to 2008 was primarily the result of leased space acquired to support growth in the alternative investments servicing and investment manager operations outsourcing businesses, as well as higher occupancy costs in support of growth in Europe, including our then new facility in the U.K. During 2008, we elected to provide support to certain investment accounts managed by SSgA through the purchase of asset and mortgage backed securities and a cash infusion, which resulted in an income statement provision of $450 million. This change is more fully described in note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. In 2008, we announced a plan to reduce our operating costs and support our long term growth while aligning the organization to meet the challenges and opportunities presented by the current market environment, and subsequently recorded aggregate restructuring charges of $306 million. This change is more fully described in note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. For 2008, in connection with the Investors Financial acquisition, we recorded merger and integration costs of $115 million, compared to $198 million for 2007. These costs consisted only of direct and incremental costs to integrate the acquired Investors Financial business into our operations, and did not include ongoing expenses of the combined organization. The costs were primarily related to employee retention and system and customer integration. During 2008, we recorded a $200 million provision related to our estimated net exposure on an indemnification obligation associated with collateralized repurchase agreements. The reserve was based on the cost of satisfying the indemnification obligation net of the fair value of the collateral. This provision is more fully described in note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. The increase in aggregate other expenses resulted from a 53% increase in professional services spending, primarily legal and consulting costs, amortization of other intangible assets for the full year in connection with the acquisitions of Investors Financial and Currenex, higher securities processing costs and higher regulatory fees and assessments, the latter mainly fees and assessments paid in connection with our participation in certain federal government and banking regulatory agency programs. Income Taxes The increase in income tax expense for 2008 compared to 2007 resulted from the a higher level of pre tax earnings for 2008, partially offset by a net benefit related to the aggregate pre tax impact of significant transactions outside the ordinary course of our business. The overall effective tax rate for 2008 was 36.2% compared to 33.7% for 2007. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, and we apply accounting policies that affect the determination of amounts reported in these financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. The majority of these accounting policies do not involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates in their application, or the variability of the estimates is not material to the consolidated financial statements. However, certain of these accounting policies, by their nature, require management to make judgments, involving significant estimates and assumptions, about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements, and changes in this information over time could materially affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses reported in subsequent financial statements. Based on the sensitivity of reported financial statement amounts to the underlying estimates and assumptions, the relatively more significant accounting policies applied by State Street have been identified by management as those associated with fair value measurements; interest revenue recognition and other than temporary impairment; 53 Table of Contents and goodwill and other intangible assets. These accounting policies require the most subjective or complex judgments, and underlying estimates and assumptions could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. An understanding of the judgments, estimates and assumptions underlying these accounting policies is essential in order to understand our reported consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The following is a brief discussion of the above mentioned significant accounting policies. Management of State Street has discussed these significant accounting estimates with the Examining and Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Fair Value Measurements We carry certain of our financial assets and liabilities at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, including trading account assets, investment securities available for sale and various types of derivative instruments. As discussed in further detail below, changes in the fair value of these financial assets and liabilities are recorded either as components of our consolidated statement of income, or as components of other comprehensive income within shareholders equity in our consolidated statement of condition. In addition to those financial assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value in our consolidated financial statements, we disclose the estimated fair value in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of other of our financial assets and liabilities that are carried at amortized cost in our consolidated statement of condition. We estimate the fair value of these financial assets and liabilities using the definition of fair value described below. At December 31, 2009, approximately $77.36 billion of our financial assets and approximately $4.77 billion of our financial liabilities were carried at fair value, compared to $66.92 billion and $12.36 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2008. The amounts at December 31, 2009 represented approximately 49% of our consolidated total assets and approximately 3% of our consolidated total liabilities, compared to 39% and 8%, respectively, at December 31, 2008. The increase in the relative percentage of consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2009 resulted primarily from the addition of investment securities in connection with the conduit consolidation and portfolio purchases of investment securities. The decrease in the relative percentage of consolidated total liabilities as of December 31, 2009 resulted from lower levels of derivatives related to our foreign exchange activities. As described in more detail in note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, we adopted new accounting standards that govern fair value measurement effective January 1, 2008. These accounting standards do not require us to measure our financial assets and liabilities at fair value, but provide a consistent definition of fair value and provide a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP. These standards also provided for the election of a fair value option for assets and liabilities not previously carried at fair value on a recurring basis. In connection with our application of these accounting standards, we have not elected the fair value option for any of our financial assets or financial liabilities since adoption, although we may do so in the future. The accounting standards define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. When we measure fair value for our financial assets and liabilities, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. When possible, we look to active and observable markets to measure the fair value of identical, or similar, financial assets or liabilities. When identical financial assets and liabilities are not traded in active markets, we look to market observable data for similar assets and liabilities. In some instances, certain assets and liabilities are not actively traded in observable markets, and as a result we use alternative valuation techniques to measure their fair value. In accordance with the standards, we categorize the financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value in our consolidated statement of condition on a recurring basis based upon the standards three level valuation hierarchy. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or 54 Table of Contents liabilities (level 1) and the lowest priority to valuation methods using significant unobservable inputs (level 3). We categorized approximately 13% of our financial assets carried at fair value in level 1, 77% in level 2 and 10% in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, including the effect of master netting agreements. We categorized approximately 97% of our financial liabilities carried at fair value in level 2, with the remaining 3% in level 3, including the effect of master netting agreements. The fair value of the investment securities categorized in level 1 was composed of U.S. Treasury securities, specifically Treasury bills, which have a maturity of one year or less. Fair value was measured by management using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical securities. The fair value of the investment securities categorized in level 2 was measured by management primarily using information obtained from independent third parties. Information obtained from third parties is subject to review by management as part of a validation process. Management utilizes a process to review information provided by third parties, including an understanding of underlying assumptions and the level of market participant information used to support those assumptions. In addition, management compares significant assumptions used by third parties to available market information. Such information may include known trades or, to the extent that trading activity is limited, comparisons to market research information pertaining to credit expectations, execution prices and the timing of cash flows. The fair value of the derivative instruments categorized in level 2 predominantly represented foreign exchange contracts used in our trading activities, for which fair value was measured by management using discounted cash flow techniques with inputs consisting of observable spot and forward points, as well as observable interest rate curves. With respect to derivative instruments, we evaluated the impact on valuation of the credit risk of our counterparties and our own credit. We considered factors such as the likelihood of default by us and our counterparties, our current and potential future net exposures and remaining maturities in determining the appropriate measurements of fair value. Valuation adjustments associated with these factors were not significant for 2009 or 2008. While the substantial majority of our financial assets categorized in level 3 were composed of asset backed securities available for sale, level 3 also included foreign exchange derivatives. The aggregate fair value of our financial assets and liabilities categorized in level 3 as of December 31, 2009, compared to December 31, 2008, decreased approximately 29%, and was primarily composed of transfers of asset backed securities, principally those collateralized by student loans, to level 2. Interest Revenue Recognition and Other Than Temporary Impairment A significant portion of the assets carried in our consolidated balance sheet is our portfolio of fixed income investment securities. At December 31, 2009, this portfolio included securities added as a result of the May 2009 conduit consolidation. Additional information with respect to the conduits and the consolidation is provided in note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. As discussed below, the estimation of future cash flows from the securities is a significant factor in the recognition of both interest revenue and other than temporary impairment with respect to our fixed income investment securities. Expectations of defaults and prepayments are the most significant estimates underlying our determination of expected future cash flows. In determining these estimates, management relies on relevant and reliable information, including but not limited to deal structure, including optional and mandatory calls, market interest rate curves, industry standard asset class specific prepayment models, recent prepayment history, independent credit ratings, and recent actual and projected credit losses. Management considers this information based on its relevance and uses its best judgment in order to determine its assumptions for underlying cash flow expectations and resulting estimates. Management reviews its underlying assumptions and determines expected future cash flow estimates at least quarterly. Additional detail with respect to the sensitivity of these default and prepayment assumptions is provided in the Financial Condition Investment Securities section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. 55 Table of Contents Interest Revenue Recognition Our investment portfolio, excluding the conduit assets, consists of securities which were not typically acquired at significant discounts or premiums to their face amount. In connection with the conduit consolidation, we recorded certain of the conduits investment securities at a significant discount to their face amount. To the extent that future cash flows from these securities is expected to exceed their recorded carrying amounts, the portion of the discount not related to credit will be accreted into interest revenue in our consolidated statement of income over the securities remaining lives. As a result of the magnitude of the discount, the estimates associated with the timing and amount of the accretion of these security discounts into interest revenue have become significant. A portion of the conduit securities, primarily asset backed securities, had expected credit losses on the date of consolidation, or were considered to be certain beneficial interests in a securitization that are not of high credit quality, and therefore are accounted for pursuant to specific accounting guidance. As a result, interest revenue recognition for these securities differs from the accounting for the remainder of our portfolio. The accounting for these securities requires an estimation of the timing and amount of each of the securities expected future principal, interest and other contractual cash flows, and the calculation of an effective yield based upon these estimates is used to record interest revenue. Generally, the timing and amount of these securities future cash flows are inherently uncertain, due to the unknown timing and amount of principal payments (including potential credit losses) and the variability of future interest rates. Other Than Temporary Impairment Existing accounting standards also require the use of cash flow estimates to evaluate other than temporary impairment of our investment securities. The amount and timing of expected cash flows is a significant estimate in the determination of other than temporary impairment. Additional information with respect to managements assessment of impairment is provided in note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill is created when the purchase price exceeds the assigned value of net assets of acquired businesses, and represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements being acquired. Other acquired identifiable intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair value. Goodwill is not amortized. Other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, and both goodwill and other intangible assets are subject to an impairment adjustment if events or circumstances indicate the potential inability to realize the carrying amount. As required by GAAP, we evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually, based on undiscounted cash flows. Substantially all of the goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in our consolidated statement of condition have resulted from business acquisitions of our Investment Servicing line of business. The remainder is recorded by Investment Management. The sustained value of the majority of goodwill is supported ultimately by revenue from our investment servicing business. A decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth, or our inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods, could lead to a perceived impairment of goodwill, which would be evaluated and, if necessary, be recorded as a write down of the reported amount of goodwill through a charge to earnings in our consolidated statement of income. On an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances dictate, management reviews goodwill and evaluates events or other developments that may indicate impairment in the carrying amount. We perform this evaluation at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our two major business lines. The evaluation methodology for potential impairment is inherently complex and involves significant management judgment in the use of estimates and assumptions. 56 Table of Contents We evaluate goodwill for impairment using a two step process. First, we compare the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, no impairment exists. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, then we compare the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, then goodwill impairment is recognized by writing the goodwill down to the implied fair value. The implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, as if the unit had been acquired in a business combination and the overall fair value of the unit was the purchase price. To determine the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit being evaluated for goodwill impairment, we use one of two principal methodologies a market approach, based on a comparison of the reporting unit to publicly traded companies in similar lines of business; or an income approach, based on the value of the cash flows the business can be expected to generate in the future. Events that may indicate impairment include significant or adverse changes in the business, economic or political climate; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; unanticipated competition; and a more likely than not expectation that we will sell or otherwise dispose of a business to which the goodwill or other intangible assets relate. Additional information about goodwill and other intangible assets, including information by line of business, is provided in note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. Our evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment in 2009 indicated that none was impaired. Goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in our consolidated statement of condition at December 31, 2009 totaled approximately $4.55 billion and $1.81 billion, respectively. 57 Table of Contents FINANCIAL CONDITION Years ended December 31, 2009AverageBalance 2008AverageBalance (In millions) Assets: Interest bearing deposits with banks $ 24,162 $ 24,003 Securities purchased under resale agreements 3,701 10,195 Federal funds sold 68 2,700 Trading account assets 1,914 2,423 Investment securities 81,190 72,227 Investment securities purchased under AMLF(1) 882 9,193 Loans 9,703 11,884 Other earning assets 1,303 Total interest earning assets 122,923 132,625 Cash and due from banks 2,237 5,096 Other assets 21,650 23,976 Total assets $ 146,810 $ 161,697 Liabilities and shareholders equity: Interest bearing deposits: U.S. $ 7,616 $ 11,216 Non U.S. 61,551 68,291 Total interest bearing deposits 69,167 79,507 Securities sold under repurchase agreements 11,065 14,261 Federal funds purchased 956 1,026 Short term borrowings under AMLF(1) 877 9,170 Other short term borrowings 16,847 5,996 Long term debt 7,917 4,106 Other interest bearing liabilities 1,131 Total interest bearing liabilities 107,960 114,066 Non interest bearing deposits 15,443 20,609 Other liabilities 10,090 14,614 Shareholders equity 13,317 12,408 Total liabilities and shareholders equity $ 146,810 $ 161,697 (1) Amounts represent averages of asset backed commercial paper purchases and related borrowings in connection with our participation in the AMLF. Additional information about the AMLF, which recently expired, is provided in note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. Overview of Consolidated Statement of Condition The structure of our consolidated statement of condition, or balance sheet, is primarily driven by the liabilities generated by our core Investment Servicing and Investment Management businesses. As our customers execute their worldwide cash management and investment activities, they use short term investments and deposits that constitute the majority of our liabilities. These liabilities are generally in the form of non interest bearing demand deposits; interest bearing transaction account deposits, which are denominated in a variety of currencies; and repurchase agreements, which generally serve as short term investment alternatives for our customers. Our customers needs and our operating objectives determine the volume, mix and currency denomination of our consolidated balance sheet. Deposits and other liabilities generated by customer activities are invested in assets that generally match the liquidity and interest rate characteristics of the liabilities. As a result, our assets consist primarily of securities held in our available for sale or held to maturity portfolios and short term money market instruments, such as interest bearing deposits, federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale 58 Table of Contents agreements. The actual mix of assets is determined by the characteristics of the customer liabilities and our desire to maintain a well diversified portfolio of high quality assets. Managing our consolidated balance sheet structure is conducted within specific Board approved policies for interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity. Additional information about our average balance sheet, primarily our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, is included in the Consolidated Results of Operations Net Interest Revenue section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. Investment Securities The carrying values of investment securities by type were as follows as of December 31: (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 Available for sale: U.S. Treasury and federal agencies: Direct obligations $ 11,162 $ 11,579 $ 8,181 Mortgage backed securities 14,936 10,798 14,585 Asset backed securities: Credit cards 6,607 3,090 3,276 Student loans(1) 11,928 7,860 9,006 Sub prime 3,197 3,859 5,683 Other 2,797 1,464 2,067 Total asset backed 24,529 16,273 20,032 Collateralized mortgage obligations 2,409 1,441 11,892 State and political subdivisions 5,937 5,712 5,813 Non U.S. debt securities 10,311 5,714 6,766 Other debt securities 2,234 2,160 2,312 Money market mutual funds 1,110 344 243 Non U.S. equity securities 35 123 320 Other equity securities 36 19 182 Total $ 72,699 $ 54,163 $ 70,326 Held to maturity purchased under AMLF: Asset backed commercial paper $ $ 6,087 $ Held to maturity: U.S. Treasury and federal agencies: Direct obligations $ 500 $ 501 $ 757 Mortgage backed securities 620 810 940 Asset backed securities: Credit cards 20 Other 447 321 Total asset backed 467 321 Collateralized mortgage obligations 8,262 9,979 2,190 State and political subdivisions 206 382 180 Non U.S. debt securities 10,822 3,774 166 Total $ 20,877 $ 15,767 $ 4,233 (1) Substantially composed of securities guaranteed by the federal government with respect to the payment of principal and interest. We manage our investment securities portfolio to align with interest rate and duration characteristics of our customer liabilities and in the context of our overall balance sheet structure, which is maintained within internally approved risk limits, and in consideration of the global interest rate environment. 59 Table of Contents We consider a well diversified, high credit quality investment securities portfolio to be an important element in the management of our consolidated balance sheet. The portfolio continues to be concentrated in securities with high credit quality, with approximately 80% of the carrying value of the portfolio AAA or AA rated. The percentages of the carrying value of the investment securities portfolio by external credit rating, excluding securities purchased under the AMLF for 2008, were as follows as of December 31: 2009 2008 AAA(1)(2) 69 % 78 % AA 11 11 A 7 5 BBB 4 4 BB(2) 8 1 Non rated 1 1 100 % 100 % (1) Includes U.S. Treasury securities. (2) Change in percentage compared to 2008 generally resulted from downgrades of securities. The investment portfolio of approximately 9,700 securities is also diversified with respect to asset class. Approximately 73% of the carrying value of the portfolio is composed of mortgage backed and asset backed securities. The largely floating rate asset backed portfolio consists primarily of credit card and student loan backed securities. Mortgage backed securities are split between securities of Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and U.S. and non U.S. large issuer collateralized mortgage obligations. During 2009, 1,259 securities were downgraded. The 2009 downgrades included 425 municipal securities (state and political subdivisions), 272 of which were based on downgrades of the underlying third party financial guarantor. The carrying amounts, by contractual maturity, of debt securities available for sale and held to maturity, and the related weighted average contractual yields, were as follows as of December 31, 2009: Under 1 Year 1 to 5 Years 6 to 10 Years Over 10 Years (Dollars in millions) Amount Yield Amount Yield Amount Yield Amount Yield Available for sale(1): U.S. Treasury and federal agencies: Direct obligations $ 10,001 $ 398 1.02 % $ 183 3.72 % $ 580 3.13 % Mortgage backed securities 89 4.16 % 582 4.27 8,489 3.99 5,776 2.95 Asset backed securities 569 1.36 10,304 0.76 8,545 0.64 5,111 0.74 Collateralized mortgage obligations 58 5.26 656 5.13 199 5.61 1,496 2.02 State and political subdivisions(2) 354 6.65 2,168 6.45 2,126 6.14 1,289 5.88 Non U.S. debt securities 2,899 3.34 1,896 1.45 1,509 1.69 4,007 0.94 Other debt securities 303 5.22 1,240 5.38 657 5.32 34 0.84 Total $ 14,273 $ 17,244 $ 21,708 $ 18,293 Held to maturity(1): U.S. Treasury and federal agencies: Direct obligations $ 500 4.38 % Mortgage backed securities $ 48 4.46 % $ 199 4.88 % $ 373 5.38 % Asset backed securities 49 0.46 79 0.83 112 1.71 227 0.94 Collateralized mortgage obligations 600 4.71 2,945 4.94 1,904 4.10 2,813 4.07 State and political subdivisions(2) 56 5.76 135 7.47 14 6.39 1 7.25 Non U.S. debt securities 1,214 1.10 2,912 1.07 411 3.66 6,285 2.66 Total $ 2,419 $ 6,119 $ 2,640 $ 9,699 (1) The maturities of mortgage backed securities, asset backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are based upon contractual principal payments. (2) Yields have been calculated on a fully taxable equivalent basis, using applicable federal and state income tax rates. 60 Table of Contents Impairment Net unrealized losses on securities available for sale were as follows as of December 31: (In millions) 2009 2008 Fair value $ 72,699 $ 54,163 Amortized cost 74,843 60,786 Net unrealized loss, pre tax $ (2,144 ) $ (6,623 ) Net unrealized loss, after tax $ (1,316 ) $ (4,057 ) The above net unrealized loss amounts at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 excluded the remaining net unrealized loss of $1.01 billion, or $635 million after tax, and $2.27 billion, or $1.39 billion after tax, respectively, related to reclassifications of securities available for sale to securities held to maturity. These after tax amounts are recorded in other comprehensive income. The decline in the remaining after tax unrealized loss amounts related to transferred securities resulted from amortization and from the recognition of losses from other than temporary impairment on certain of the securities. We conduct periodic reviews of individual securities to assess whether other than temporary impairment exists. To the extent that other than temporary impairment is identified, the impairment is broken into a credit component and a non credit component. The credit component is recognized in our consolidated statement of income, and the non credit component is recognized in other comprehensive income to the extent that management does not intend to sell the security (see note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8). The assessment of other than temporary impairment involves an evaluation of economic and security specific factors, which are more fully described in note 3. Such factors are based upon estimates, derived by management, which contemplate current market conditions and security specific performance. To the extent that market conditions are worse than managements expectations, other than temporary impairment could increase, in particular the credit component that would be recognized in our consolidated statement of income. National housing prices, according to the Case Shiller National HPI, have declined to date approximately 30% peak to current. Management currently estimates that national housing prices will continue to decline and bottom out during the second half of 2010, consistent with a peak to trough housing price decline of approximately 37%. As an indication of the sensitivity of our portfolio with respect to our more significant assumptions underlying our assessment of impairment, if we were to increase our default estimates to 110% of managements current expectations with a corresponding slowing of prepayment speeds to 90% of managements current expectations, credit related other than temporary impairment could increase by approximately $120 million to $125 million, which impairment would be recorded in our consolidated statement of income. Excluding the securities for which other than temporary impairment was recorded, management considers the aggregate decline in fair value of the remaining securities and the resulting net unrealized losses to be temporary and not the result of any material changes in the credit characteristics of the securities. Additional information about our assessment of impairment is provided in note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. 61 Table of Contents Loans and Lease Financing U.S. and non U.S. loans and lease financing, and average loans and lease financing, were as follows for the years ended December 31 (excluding the allowance for losses): (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 U.S.: Commercial and financial $ 6,239 $ 6,397 $ 9,402 $ 3,480 $ 2,298 Purchased receivables 786 Lease financing 408 407 396 415 404 Total U.S. 7,433 6,804 9,798 3,895 2,702 Non U.S.: Commercial and financial 471 890 4,420 3,137 1,854 Purchased receivables 1,596 Lease financing 1,308 1,437 1,584 1,914 1,926 Total non U.S. 3,375 2,327 6,004 5,051 3,780 Total loans $ 10,808 $ 9,131 $ 15,802 $ 8,946 $ 6,482 Average loans and lease financing $ 9,703 $ 11,884 $ 10,753 $ 7,670 $ 6,013 U.S. commercial and financial loans at December 31, 2009 and 2008 included approximately $600 million and $800 million, respectively, of commercial real estate loans acquired in 2008 pursuant to indemnified repurchase agreements with an affiliate of Lehman. The loans, which are primarily collateralized by direct and indirect interests in commercial real estate, were recorded at their then current fair value on the date acquired. Fair value represented managements expectation, as of the date of acquisition, with respect to future collection of principal and interest, using appropriate market discount rates as of the date of acquisition. As of the date of acquisition, management considered it probable that all contractual payments would not be collected, and accordingly reflected that assumption in the measurement of the loans aggregate fair value. Pursuant to current accounting standards, management is required to periodically reassess its cash flow expectations with respect to these loans, and recognize the impact of any changes in expected future cash flows in consolidated results of operations through an adjustment to a valuation allowance and, in some cases, an adjustment to the yield of the loans. If expected future cash flows from these loans are adversely affected by further deterioration of conditions in the commercial real estate markets or by other factors, we could be required to record additional adjustments to the valuation allowance in our consolidated results of operations. We define past due loans as loans on which principal or interest payments are over 90 days delinquent, but for which interest continues to be accrued. Although a portion of these commercial real estate loans is 90 days or more contractually past due, we do not report them as past due loans, because under current accounting standards, the interest earned on these loans is based on an accretable yield resulting from managements expectations with respect to the future cash flows for each loan relative to both the timing and collection of principal and interest as of the reporting date, not the loans contractual payment terms. These cash flow estimates are updated quarterly to reflect changes in managements expectations, which consider market conditions. We generally place loans on non accrual status once principal or interest payments are 60 days past due, or earlier if management determines that full collection is not probable. Loans 60 days past due, but considered both well secured and in the process of collection, may be excluded from non accrual status. For loans placed on non accrual status, revenue recognition is suspended. At December 31, 2009, approximately $2.3 million of the aforementioned commercial real estate loans had been placed by management on non accrual status, as the yield associated with these loans, determined when the loans were acquired, was deemed to be non accretable. This determination was based on managements expectations of the future collection of principal and interest from the loans. Future changes in expectations with respect to collection of principal and interest on these loans could result in additional non accrual loans and provisions for loan losses. There were no non accrual loans at year end 2008, 2007, 2006 or 2005. 62 Table of Contents The aggregate increase in loans and lease financing from 2008 reflected the addition of $2.38 billion of structured asset backed loans, presented in the preceding table as purchased receivables, in connection with the May 2009 conduit consolidation, partially offset by a decrease in short duration advances, which result primarily from securities settlement activities of our customers. Such advances included in loans were $2.07 billion and $4.64 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Average advances were approximately $2.97 billion and $8.00 billion for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower levels of these advances for 2009 resulted from a decrease in customer demand and not a reduction in credit availability from, or committed lines provided by, State Street. As transaction flows returned to more normalized levels compared to the extraordinarily high levels experienced in 2008, customer demand for such short term advances declined. These advances do not represent significant credit risk because of their short term nature, which is generally overnight, the lack of significant concentration, and their occurrence in the normal course of the cash and securities settlement process. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, unearned income included in lease financing was $907 million and $1.04 billion for non U.S. leases, respectively, and $183 million and $199 million for U.S. leases, respectively. Maturities for loan and lease financing categories were as follows as of December 31, 2009: YEARS (In millions) Total Under 1 1 to 5 Over 5 U.S.: Commercial and financial $ 6,239 $ 5,844 $ 324 $ 71 Purchased receivables 786 786 Lease financing 408 408 Total U.S. 7,433 6,630 324 479 Non U.S.: Commercial and financial 471 471 Purchased receivables 1,596 1,561 35 Lease financing 1,308 20 1,288 Total non U.S. 3,375 2,032 20 1,323 Total $ 10,808 $ 8,662 $ 344 $ 1,802 The following table presents the classification of loans and leases due after one year according to sensitivity to changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2009: (In millions) Loans and leases with predetermined interest rates $ 1,716 Loans and leases with floating or adjustable interest rates 430 Total $ 2,146 63 Table of Contents At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the allowance for loan losses was $79 and $18 million, respectively. Changes in the allowance for loan losses were as follows for the years ended December 31: (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 U.S.: Balance at beginning of year $ 18 $ 18 $ 18 $ 17 $ 14 Provision for loan losses 149 Loan charge offs commercial and financial (91 ) Recoveries commercial and financial 3 Reclassification 1 3 Balance at end of year U.S. 79 18 18 18 17 Non U.S.: Balance at beginning of year 1 4 Reclassification (1 ) (3 ) Balance at end of year Non U.S. 1 Total balance at end of year $ 79 $ 18 $ 18 $ 18 $ 18 Of the aggregate provision for loan losses recorded in 2009, $124 million was associated with certain of the commercial real estate loans acquired in 2008 pursuant to indemnification obligations. This portion of the provision was reflective of changes in managements expectations with respect to future principal and interest cash flows from these loans. The changes in expectations were primarily based on the assessment of the impact of the deteriorating economic conditions in the commercial real estate markets on these loans during 2009. Of the remaining provision of $25 million, $16 million related to the results of the Federal Reserves Shared National Credit review. The charge offs of $91 million in 2009 primarily related to the commercial real estate loans, as management considered certain of these loans no longer collectible. Cross Border Outstandings Cross border outstandings, as defined by bank regulatory rules, are amounts payable to State Street by residents of foreign countries, regardless of the currency in which the claim is denominated, and local country claims in excess of local country obligations. These cross border outstandings consist primarily of deposits with banks, loan and lease financing and investment securities. In addition to credit risk, cross border outstandings have the risk that, as a result of political or economic conditions in a country, borrowers may be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations of principal and or interest when due because of the unavailability of, or restrictions on, foreign exchange needed by borrowers to repay their obligations. Cross border outstandings to countries in which we do business which amounted to at least 1% of our consolidated total assets were as follows as of December 31: (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 United Kingdom $ 8,116 $ 5,836 $ 5,951 Australia 5,767 2,044 3,567 Canada 2,322 4,565 Netherlands 1,783 Germany 1,623 2,944 Total cross border outstandings $ 19,611 $ 7,880 $ 17,027 The total cross border outstandings presented in the table represented 12%, 9% and 12% of our consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Aggregate cross border outstandings to 64 Table of Contents countries which totaled between .75% and 1% of our consolidated total assets at December 31, 2009 amounted to $1.26 billion (Italy). Aggregate cross border outstandings to countries which totaled between .75% and 1% of our consolidated total assets at December 31, 2008 amounted to $3.45 billion (Canada and Germany). There were no cross border outstandings to countries which totaled between .75% and 1% of our consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2007. Capital The management of regulatory and economic capital both involve key metrics evaluated by management to assess whether our actual level of capital is commensurate with our risk profile, is in compliance with all regulatory requirements, and is sufficient to provide us with the financial flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives. Regulatory Capital Our objective with respect to regulatory capital management is to maintain a strong capital base in order to provide financial flexibility for our business needs, including funding corporate growth and supporting customers cash management needs, and to provide protection against loss to depositors and creditors. We strive to maintain an optimal level of capital, commensurate with our risk profile, on which an attractive return to shareholders is expected to be realized over both the short and long term, while protecting our obligations to depositors and creditors and satisfying regulatory capital adequacy requirements. Our capital management process focuses on our risk exposures, our regulatory capital requirements, the evaluations of the major independent credit rating agencies that assign ratings to our public debt and our capital position relative to our peers. Our Capital Committee, working in conjunction with our Asset and Liability Committee, referred to as ALCO, oversees the management of regulatory capital, and is responsible for ensuring capital adequacy with respect to regulatory requirements, internal targets and the expectations of the major independent credit rating agencies. The primary regulator of both State Street and State Street Bank for regulatory capital purposes is the Federal Reserve. Both State Street and State Street Bank are subject to the minimum capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve and defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991. State Street Bank must meet the regulatory capital thresholds for well capitalized in order for the parent company to maintain its status as a financial holding company. Regulatory capital ratios and related regulatory guidelines for State Street and State Street Bank were as follows as of December 31: REGULATORYGUIDELINES STATESTREET STATESTREETBANK Minimum WellCapitalized 2009 2008(2) 2009 2008(2) Regulatory capital ratios: Tier 1 risk based capital 4 % 6 % 17.7 % 20.3 % 17.3 % 19.8 % Total risk based capital 8 10 19.1 21.6 19.0 21.3 Tier 1 leverage ratio(1) 4 5 8.5 7.8 8.2 7.6 (1) Regulatory guideline for well capitalized applies only to State Street Bank. (2) Tier 1 and total risk based capital and tier 1 leverage ratios exclude the impact, where applicable, of the asset backed commercial paper purchased under the Federal Reserves AMLF, as permitted by the AMLFs terms and conditions. At December 31, 2009, State Streets and State Street Banks tier 1 and total risk based capital ratios decreased compared to year end 2008. With respect to State Street, the loss associated with the May 2009 conduit consolidation and the June 2009 redemption of the equity received from the U.S. Treasury in connection with the TARP Capital Purchase Program, partly offset by the aggregate impact of the May 2009 public offering 65 Table of Contents of common stock and 2009 net income before the conduit loss, reduced tier 1 and total risk based capital. With respect to State Street Bank, the loss associated with the conduit consolidation, partly offset by the impact of 2009 net income before the conduit loss, reduced tier 1 and total risk based capital. The impact on the ratios of the decreases in tier 1 and total risk based capital described above was partly offset by decreases in total risk weighted assets for both entities, as increases in investment securities from both the conduit consolidation and our investment portfolio re investment program were more than offset by a reduction in aggregate balance sheet assets, generally due to lower levels of excess liquidity, as noninterest bearing customer deposits returned to more normal levels during the second half of 2009 as market conditions stabilized. All ratios for State Street and State Street Bank exceeded the regulatory minimum and well capitalized thresholds. Capital Purchase Program In October 2008, in connection with the U.S. Treasurys capital purchase program, we issued 20,000 shares of our Series B fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock, $100,000 liquidation preference per share, and a warrant to purchase 5,576,208 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $53.80 per share, to Treasury, and received aggregate proceeds of $2 billion. The aggregate proceeds were allocated to the preferred stock and the warrant based on their relative fair values on the date of issuance. As a result, approximately $1.88 billion and $121 million, respectively, were allocated to the preferred stock and the warrant. The difference between the initial value of $1.88 billion allocated to the preferred stock and the liquidation amount of $2 billion was intended to be charged to retained earnings and credited to the preferred stock over the period that the preferred stock was outstanding, using the effective yield method. The preferred shares qualified as tier 1 regulatory capital, and paid cumulative quarterly dividends at a rate of 5% per year. The warrant was immediately exercisable, and originally had a 10 year term. The exercise price of $53.80 per share was based upon the average of the closing prices of our common stock during the 20 trading day period prior to our election to participate in the program. In June 2009, subsequent to the May 2009 public offering described below under Common Stock, we repaid the full amount of Treasurys $2 billion equity investment by redeeming all of the outstanding shares of the Series B preferred stock at its aggregate liquidation amount plus accrued dividends, or approximately $2 billion. The excess of the aggregate liquidation amount over the then $1.89 billion carrying value of the preferred stock, which totaled approximately $106 million, was prepaid and recorded as a reduction of retained earnings. In July 2009, we repurchased the common stock warrant, issued to Treasury as part of its overall investment, at its fair value of $60 million. The number of shares underlying the warrant then held by Treasury had been reduced by one half of the original number of common shares underlying the warrant as a result of the May 2009 public offering described below under Common Stock. The repurchase of the warrant reduced shareholders equity, because it was recorded as a reduction of surplus. Common Stock In May 2009, we completed a public offering of approximately 58.97 million shares of our common stock. The offering price was $39 per share, and aggregate proceeds from the offering, net of underwriting commissions and related offering costs, totaled approximately $2.23 billion. Underwriting commissions totaled approximately $69 million. In June 2008, we completed a public offering of approximately 40.55 million shares of our common stock. The public offering price was $70 per share, and aggregate proceeds from the offering, net of underwriting commissions and related offering costs, totaled approximately $2.75 billion. Underwriting commissions totaled approximately $85 million. Of the total shares issued, approximately 7.39 million shares were issued out of treasury stock, and the remaining 33.16 million shares were newly issued. No shares of our common stock were purchased during 2009 under existing Board authorization. As of December 31, 2009, approximately 13.25 million shares remained available for future purchase under the Board authorization. In January 2008, under an existing authorization by our Board of Directors, we purchased 66 Table of Contents 552,000 shares of our common stock, at an average historical cost per share of approximately $75, in connection with a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program that concluded on January 18, 2008. We generally employ third party broker/dealers to acquire shares on the open market in connection with our common stock purchase program. Funds for cash distributions to our shareholders by the parent company are derived from a variety of sources. The level of dividends to shareholders on our common stock, which totaled $20 million ($0.04 per share) in 2009 (compared to $400 million and $0.95 per share in 2008), is reviewed regularly and determined by the Board of Directors considering our liquidity, capital adequacy and recent earnings history and prospects, as well as economic conditions and other factors deemed relevant. During the first quarter of 2009, in light of the continued disruption in the global capital markets experienced since the middle of 2007, and as part of a plan to strengthen our tangible common equity, we announced a reduction of our quarterly dividend on our common stock to $0.01 per share. Federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid by subsidiary banks to the parent holding company. In addition, banking regulators have the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends if they deem such payment to be an unsafe or unsound practice. Information concerning limitations on dividends from our subsidiary banks is provided in note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. Other The current minimum regulatory capital requirements enforced by the U.S. banking regulators are based on a 1988 international accord, commonly referred to as Basel I, which was developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. In 2004, the Basel Committee released the final version of its new capital adequacy framework, referred to as Basel II. Basel II governs the capital adequacy of large, internationally active banking organizations, such as State Street, that generally rely on sophisticated risk management and measurement systems, and requires these organizations to enhance their measurement and management of the risks underlying their business activities and to better align regulatory capital requirements with those risks. Basel II comprises a three pillar framework for addressing capital adequacy minimum regulatory capital requirements, which incorporate the measurement of credit risk, market risk and operational risk; supervisory review, which addresses the need for a banking organization to assess its capital adequacy position relative to its overall risk profile, including additional risks related to interest rate sensitivity, business model strategies and overall diversification benefits, rather than only with respect to its minimum capital requirements; and market discipline, which imposes more detailed public disclosure requirements on a banking organization intended to allow the assessment of key information about the organizations risk profile and its associated level of regulatory capital. In December 2007, U.S. banking regulators jointly issued final rules to implement the Basel II framework in the U.S. Implementation is subject to multi year transition periods during which floors are established to limit the amounts by which minimum required capital may decrease. The framework does not supersede or change the existing prompt corrective action and leverage capital requirements applicable to banking organizations in the U.S., and explicitly preserves the regulators authority to require organizations to hold additional capital where appropriate. Basel IIs global regulatory reach, combined with recent market dynamics affecting a broad spectrum of financial institutions worldwide, make it likely further regulatory changes will be proposed in the future. State Street has established a comprehensive program to implement the Basel II framework and underlying regulatory requirements within the prescribed time frames. We anticipate adopting the most advanced approaches for assessing our capital adequacy under the requirements. Economic Capital We define economic capital as the capital required to protect holders of our senior debt, and obligations higher in priority, against unexpected economic losses over a one year period at a level consistent with the solvency of a firm with our target AA senior debt rating. Economic capital requirements are one of several important measures used by management and the Board to assess the adequacy of our capital levels in relation to State Streets risk profile. Our Capital Committee is responsible for overseeing our economic capital process. 67 Table of Contents The framework and methodologies used to quantify economic capital for each of the risk types described below have been developed by our Enterprise Risk Management, Global Treasury and Corporate Finance groups and are designed to be generally consistent with our risk management principles and the new Basel II regulatory capital adequacy framework. This economic capital framework has been approved by senior management and the Risk and Capital Committee of the Board. Due to the evolving nature of quantification techniques, we expect to periodically refine the methodologies, assumptions, and data used to estimate our economic capital requirements, which could result in a different amount of capital needed to support our business activities. We quantify capital requirements for the risks inherent in our business activities and group them into one of the following broadly defined categories: Market risk: the risk of adverse financial impact due to fluctuations in market prices, primarily as they relate to our trading activities; Interest rate risk: the risk of loss in non trading asset and liability management positions, primarily the impact of adverse movements in interest rates on the repricing mismatches that exist between balance sheet assets and liabilities; Credit risk: the risk of loss that may result from the default or downgrade of a borrower or counterparty; Operational risk: the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events, which is consistent with the Basel II definition; and Business risk: the risk of negative earnings resulting from adverse changes in business factors, including changes in the competitive environment, changes in the operational economics of our business activities, and the effect of strategic and reputation risks. Economic capital for each of these five categories is estimated on a stand alone basis using statistical modeling techniques applied to internally generated and, in some cases, external data. These individual results are then aggregated at the State Street consolidated level. A capital reduction, or diversification benefit, is then applied to reflect the unlikely event of experiencing an extremely large loss in each risk type at the same time. Liquidity The objective of liquidity management is to ensure that we have the ability to meet our financial obligations in a timely and cost effective manner, and that we maintain sufficient flexibility to fund strategic corporate initiatives as they arise. Effective management of liquidity involves assessing the potential mismatch between the future cash needs of our customers and our available sources of cash under normal and adverse economic and business conditions. Significant uses of liquidity, described more fully below, consist primarily of meeting deposit withdrawals and funding outstanding commitments to extend credit or to purchase securities as they are drawn upon. Liquidity is provided by the maintenance of broad access to the global capital markets and by our consolidated balance sheet asset structure. Our Global Treasury group is responsible for the day to day management of our global liquidity position, which is conducted within risk guidelines established and monitored by ALCO. Management maintains a liquidity measurement framework to assess the sources and uses of liquidity that is monitored by Global Treasury and our Enterprise Risk Management group. Embedded in this framework is a process that outlines several levels of potential risk to our liquidity and identifies triggers that we use as early warning signals of a possible difficulty. These triggers are a combination of internal and external measures of potential increases in cash needs or decreases in available sources of cash and possible impairment of our ability to access the global capital markets. Another important component of the framework is a contingency funding plan that is designed to identify and manage through a potential liquidity crisis. The plan defines roles, responsibilities and management actions to be undertaken in the event of deterioration in our liquidity profile caused by either a State Street specific event or a broader disruption in the capital markets. Specific actions are linked to the levels of triggers. We generally manage our liquidity risk on a global basis at the consolidated level. We also manage parent company liquidity, and in certain cases branch liquidity, separately. State Street Bank generally has broader 68 Table of Contents access to funding products and markets limited to banks, specifically the federal funds market and the Federal Reserves discount window and term auction facility. The parent company is managed to a more conservative liquidity profile, reflecting narrower market access. We typically hold enough cash, primarily in the form of interest bearing deposits with subsidiary banks, to meet current debt maturities and cash needs, as well as those projected over the next one year period. Sources of liquidity come from two primary areas: access to the global capital markets and liquid assets carried on our consolidated balance sheet. Our ability to source incremental funding at reasonable rates of interest from wholesale investors in the capital markets is the first source of liquidity we would tap to accommodate the uses of liquidity described below. On balance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our liquidity management strategy. These assets provide liquidity through maturities of the assets, but more importantly, they provide us with the ability to raise funds by pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales. Each of these sources of liquidity is used in the management of daily cash needs and in a crisis scenario, in which we would need to accommodate potential large, unexpected demand for funds. Uses of liquidity result from the following: withdrawals of unsecured customer deposits; draw downs on unfunded commitments to extend credit or to purchase securities, generally provided through lines of credit; and short duration advance facilities. Customer deposits are generated largely from our investment servicing activities, and are invested in a combination of term investment securities and short term money market assets whose mix is determined by the characteristics of the deposits. Most of the customer deposits are payable upon demand or are short term in nature, which means that withdrawals can potentially occur quickly and in large amounts. Similarly, customers can request disbursement of funds under commitments to extend credit, or can overdraw deposit accounts rapidly and in large volumes. In addition, a large volume of unanticipated funding requirements, such as large draw downs of existing lines of credit, could require additional liquidity. Material risks to sources of short term liquidity could include, among other things, adverse changes in the perception in the financial markets of our financial condition or liquidity needs, and downgrades by major independent credit rating agencies of our deposits and our debt securities, which would restrict our ability to access the capital markets and could lead to withdrawals of unsecured deposits by our customers. In managing our liquidity, we have issued term wholesale certificates of deposit and invested those funds in short term money market assets where they would be available to meet cash needs. This portfolio stood at $5.74 billion at December 31, 2009, compared to $1.93 billion at December 31, 2008. In connection with our management of liquidity where we seek to maintain access to sources of back up liquidity at reasonable costs, we have participated in the Federal Reserves term auction facility, or TAF, which is a secured lending program available to financial institutions. As of December 31, 2009, State Street Banks borrowings under the TAF totaled $2.0 billion, compared to $5.0 billion as of December 31, 2008. The highest TAF balances borrowed by State Street Bank during 2009 and 2008 were $10.0 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively. The average borrowings for both years were approximately $4.9 billion and approximately $1.0 billion, respectively. The higher aggregate certificate of deposit and TAF balances as of December 31, 2009 were attributable to the impact of the May 2009 conduit consolidation. Prior to the consolidation, the conduits funded their asset purchases through the issuance of asset backed commercial paper. Subsequent to the consolidation, State Street Bank has funded the conduits assets with the aforementioned sources, as well as the issuance of conduit asset backed commercial paper. As of December 31, 2009, asset backed commercial paper issued to third parties by the conduits totaled approximately $12.07 billion. While maintenance of our high investment grade credit rating is of primary importance to our liquidity management program, on balance sheet liquid assets represent significant liquidity that we can directly control, and provide a source of cash in the form of principal maturities and the ability to borrow from the capital markets using our securities as collateral. Our liquid assets consist primarily of cash balances at central banks in excess of regulatory requirements and other short term liquid assets, such as federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits with banks, the latter of which are multicurrency instruments invested with major multinational banks; and high quality, marketable investment securities not already pledged, which generally are more liquid than other types of assets and can be sold or borrowed against to generate cash quickly. As of December 31, 2009, the 69 Table of Contents value of our liquid assets, as defined, totaled $75.98 billion, compared to $85.81 billion as of December 31, 2008. The decrease was mainly attributable to unusually high 2008 deposit balances, as we experienced a significant increase in customer deposits during the second half of 2008 as the credit markets worsened. As customers accumulated liquidity, they placed cash with us, and these incremental customer deposits remained with State Street Bank at December 31, 2008. During 2009, as markets normalized, deposit levels moderated as customers returned to investing their cash, and our liquid asset levels declined accordingly. Due to the unusual size and volatile nature of these customer deposits, we maintained approximately $22.45 billion at central banks as of December 31, 2009, in excess of regulatory required minimums. Securities carried at $40.96 billion as of December 31, 2009, compared to $42.74 billion as of December 31, 2008, were designated as pledged for public and trust deposits, borrowed funds and for other purposes as provided by law, and are excluded from the liquid assets calculation, unless pledged to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Liquid assets included securities pledged to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston to secure State Street Banks ability to borrow from their discount window should the need arise. This access to primary credit is an important source of back up liquidity for State Street Bank. As of December 31, 2009, we had no outstanding primary credit borrowings from the discount window. Based upon our level of liquid assets and our ability to access the capital markets for additional funding when necessary, including our ability to issue debt and equity securities under our current universal shelf registration, management considers overall liquidity at December 31, 2009 to be sufficient to meet State Streets current commitments and business needs, including supporting the liquidity of the commercial paper conduits and accommodating the transaction and cash management needs of our customers. As referenced above, our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the maintenance of high investment grade ratings on our debt, as measured by the major independent credit rating agencies. Factors essential to retaining high credit ratings include diverse and stable core earnings; strong risk management; strong capital ratios; diverse liquidity sources, including the global capital markets and customer deposits; and strong liquidity monitoring procedures. High ratings on debt minimize borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by ensuring the largest possible market for our debt. A downgrade or reduction of these credit ratings could have an adverse impact to our ability to access funding at favorable interest rates. The following table presents information about State Streets and State Street Banks credit ratings as of February 22, 2010.

We have, as discussed previously, issued in the past, and we may issue in the future, securities pursuant to the shelf registration. The issuance of debt or equity securities will depend on future market conditions, funding needs and other factors. 70 Table of Contents We currently maintain a corporate commercial paper program, unrelated to the conduits asset backed commercial paper program, under which we can issue up to $3 billion with original maturities of up to 270 days from the date of issue. At December 31, 2009, we had $2.78 billion of commercial paper outstanding, compared to $2.59 billion at December 31, 2008. Additional information about our corporate commercial paper program is provided in note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. In connection with our participation in the FDICs Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, or TLGP, in which we elected to participate in December 2008, the parent company was eligible to issue up to approximately $1.67 billion of unsecured senior debt during 2009, backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. As of December 31, 2009, the parent companys outstanding unsecured senior debt issued under the TLGP was $1.5 billion. Additional information with respect to this outstanding debt is provided in note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. The guarantee of this outstanding debt under the TLGP expires on April 30, 2012, the maturity date of the debt. State Street Bank currently has Board authority to issue bank notes up to an aggregate of $5 billion, and up to $1 billion of subordinated bank notes. In connection with State Street Banks participation in the TLGP, in which State Street Bank elected to participate in December 2008, State Street Bank was eligible to issue up to approximately $2.48 billion of unsecured senior notes during 2009, backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. As of December 31, 2009, State Street Banks outstanding unsecured senior notes issued under the TLGP, and pursuant to the aforementioned Board authority, totaled $2.45 billion. Additional information with respect to these outstanding bank notes is provided in note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. The guarantee of State Street Banks outstanding debt under the TLGP expires on the maturity date of each respective debt issuance, as follows $1 billion on March 15, 2011, and $1.45 billion on September 15, 2011. State Street Bank currently maintains a line of credit with a financial institution of CAD $800 million, or approximately $761 million as of December 31, 2009, to support its Canadian securities processing operations. The line of credit has no stated termination date and is cancelable by either party with prior notice. As of December 31, 2009, no balance was outstanding on this line of credit.

The obligations presented in the table above are recorded in our consolidated statement of condition at December 31, 2009, except for interest on long term debt. The table does not include obligations which will be settled in cash, primarily in less than one year, such as deposits, federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements and other short term borrowings. Additional information about deposits, federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements and other short term borrowings is provided in notes 7 and 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. The table does not include obligations related to derivative instruments, because the amounts included in our consolidated statement of condition at December 31, 2009 related to derivatives do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid under the contracts upon settlement. Additional information about derivative contracts is provided in note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. We have obligations under pension and other post retirement benefit plans, more fully described in note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, which are not included in the above table. 71 Table of Contents Additional information about contractual cash obligations related to long term debt and operating and capital leases is provided in notes 9 and 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Risk Management The global scope of our business activities requires that we balance what we perceive to be the primary risks in our businesses with a comprehensive and well integrated risk management function. The measurement, monitoring and mitigation of risks are essential to the financial performance and successful management of our businesses. These risks, if not effectively managed, can result in current losses to State Street as well as erosion of our capital and damage to our reputation. Our systematic approach also allows for a more precise assessment of risks within a framework for evaluating opportunities for the prudent use of capital. We have a disciplined approach to risk management that involves all levels of management. The Board provides extensive review and oversight of our overall risk management programs, including the approval of key risk management policies and the periodic review of State Streets key risk indicators. These indicators are designed to identify major business activities of State Street with significant risk content, and to establish quantifiable thresholds for risk measurement. Key risk indicators are reported regularly to the Risk and Capital Committee of the Board and are reviewed periodically for appropriateness. Modifications to the indicators are made to reflect changes in our business activities or refinements to existing measurements. Enterprise Risk Management, or ERM, a dedicated corporate group, provides oversight, support and coordination across business units and is responsible for the formulation and maintenance of enterprise wide risk management policies and guidelines. In addition, ERM establishes and reviews approved limits, and with business line management, monitors key risks. The Chief Risk Officer meets regularly with the Board or a Board committee, as appropriate, and has the authority to escalate issues as necessary. The execution of duties in the management of people, products, business operations and processes is the responsibility of business unit managers. The function of risk management is designing, orchestrating and directing the implementation of risk management programs and processes consistent with corporate and regulatory standards. Accordingly, risk management is a shared responsibility between ERM and the business lines and requires joint efforts in goal setting, program design and implementation, resource management, and performance evaluation between business and functional units. 72 Table of Contents Responsibility for risk management is overseen by a series of management committees. The Major Risk Committee, or MRC, is responsible for the formulation and recommendation of policies, and the approval of guidelines and programs governing the identification, analysis, measurement and control of material risks across State Street. Chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, the MRC focuses on the review of business activities with significant risk content and the assessment of risk management programs and initiatives. Our Capital Committee, chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, oversees the management of our regulatory and economic capital, the determination of the framework for capital allocation and strategies for capital structure and debt and equity issuances. ALCO, chaired by the Treasurer, oversees the management of our consolidated balance sheet, including management of our global liquidity and interest rate risk positions. The Fiduciary Review Committee reviews the criteria for the acceptance of fiduciary duties, and assists our business lines with their fiduciary responsibilities executed on behalf of customers. The Credit Committee, chaired within ERM, acts as the credit policy committee for State Street. The Operational Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, provides cross business oversight of operational risk to identify, measure, manage and control operational risk in an effective and consistent manner across State Street. The Model Assessment Committee, chaired within ERM, provides recommendations concerning technical modeling issues and independently validates qualifying financial models utilized by our businesses. Several other committees with specialized risk management functions report to the MRC. Corporate Audit serves in a complementary role to our program of risk management, providing the Board and management with continuous monitoring and control audits to assess adherence to State Streets policies and procedures and the effectiveness of its system of internal controls. Additionally, the internal control environment is evaluated through external examinations and regulatory compliance efforts. The Corporate Compliance, Regulatory and Industry Affairs, and Legal groups also serve essential roles in risk management. Corporate Compliance is responsible for the design, implementation and oversight of policies, guidelines and programs to support our compliance with applicable laws and regulations wherever we conduct business. The Regulatory and Industry Affairs group monitors proposed changes in rules and legislation, and the Legal group provides counsel that enables us to deal with complex legal and regulatory environments, maximize business opportunities and minimize legal, regulatory and other risks. While we believe that our risk management program is effective in managing the risks in our businesses, external factors may create risks that cannot always be identified or anticipated. Market Risk Market risk is defined as the risk of adverse financial impact due to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and other market driven factors and prices. State Street is exposed to market risk in both its trading and non trading, or asset and liability management, activities. The market risk management processes related to these activities, discussed in further detail below, apply to both on balance sheet and off balance sheet exposures. We primarily engage in trading and investment activities to serve our customers needs and to contribute to overall corporate earnings and liquidity. In the conduct of these activities, we are subject to, and assume, market risk. The level of market risk that we assume is a function of our overall objectives and liquidity needs, customer requirements and market volatility. Interest rate risk, a component of market risk, is more thoroughly discussed in the Asset and Liability Management portion of this Market Risk section. Trading Activities Market risk associated with foreign exchange and other trading activities is managed through corporate guidelines, including established limits on aggregate and net open positions, sensitivity to changes in interest rates, and concentrations, which are supplemented by stop loss thresholds. We use a variety of risk management tools and methodologies, including value at risk, to measure, monitor and manage market risk. All limits and measurement techniques are reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a regular basis by business managers, the market risk management group and the Trading and Market Risk Committee. 73 Table of Contents We use a variety of derivative financial instruments to support our customers needs, conduct trading activities and manage our interest rate and currency risk. These activities are designed to create trading revenue and to hedge potential earnings volatility. In addition, we provide services related to derivatives in our role as both a manager and a servicer of financial assets. Our customers use derivatives to manage the financial risks associated with their investment goals and business activities. With the growth of cross border investing, customers have an increasing need for foreign exchange forward contracts to convert currency for international investments and to manage the currency risk in their international investment portfolios. As an active participant in the foreign exchange markets, we provide foreign exchange forward contracts and options in support of these customer needs. As part of our trading activities, we assume positions in the foreign exchange and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and using derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange and interest rate options and interest rate swaps. As of December 31, 2009, the aggregate notional amount of these derivatives was $588.86 billion, of which $565.66 billion were foreign exchange forward and spot contracts. In the aggregate, long and short foreign exchange forward positions are closely matched to minimize currency and interest rate risk. All foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at current market rates. Additional information about trading derivatives is provided in note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. As noted above, we use a variety of risk measurement tools and methodologies, including value at risk, or VaR, which is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical confidence interval. We use a risk measurement system to estimate VaR daily. We have adopted standards for estimating VaR, and we maintain capital for market risk in accordance with applicable regulatory guidelines. VaR is estimated for a 99% one tail confidence interval and an assumed one day holding period using a historical observation period of two years. A 99% one tail confidence interval implies that daily trading losses should not exceed the estimated VaR more than 1% of the time, or less than three business days out of a year. The methodology uses a simulation approach based on historically observed changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates (domestic and foreign) and foreign exchange implied volatilities, and takes into account the resulting diversification benefits provided from the mix of our trading positions. Like all quantitative risk measures, VaR is subject to limitations and assumptions inherent in our methodology. Our methodology gives equal weight to all market rate observations regardless of how recently the market rates were observed. The estimate is calculated using static portfolios consisting of trading positions held at the end of each business day. Therefore, implicit in the VaR estimate is the assumption that no intraday actions are taken by management during adverse market movements. As a result, the methodology does not include risk associated with intraday changes in positions or intraday price volatility. The following table presents VaR with respect to our trading activities, for trading positions held during the periods indicated, as measured by our VaR methodology. The generally lower total VaR amounts compared to component VaR amounts primarily relate to diversification benefits across risk types. Amounts presented for 2008 have been restated to conform to current year methodology.

This information is reviewed and used to confirm that all relevant trading positions are properly modeled. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we did not experience any actual trading losses in excess of our end of day VaR estimate. 74 Table of Contents During 2009, our VaR measurement methodology was extended to measure VaR associated with certain assets classified as trading account assets in our consolidated balance sheet. These assets are not held in connection with typical trading activities, and thus are not reflected in the foregoing VaR table. In the table below, the VaR associated with these investments is reported as VaR for non trading assets. Total regulatory VaR is calculated as the sum of the VaR for trading assets and the VaR for non trading assets, with no diversification benefits recognized. The average, maximum and minimum amounts are calculated for each line item separately.

Asset and Liability Management Activities The primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable and growing net interest revenue, or NIR, under varying economic environments, while protecting the economic values of our balance sheet assets and liabilities from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates. Most of our NIR is earned from the investment of deposits generated by our Investment Servicing and Investment Management businesses. We structure our balance sheet assets to generally conform to the characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities, but we manage our overall interest rate risk position in the context of current and anticipated market conditions and within internally approved risk guidelines. Our overall interest rate risk position is maintained within a series of policies approved by the Board and guidelines established and monitored by ALCO. Our Global Treasury group has responsibility for managing State Streets day to day interest rate risk. To effectively manage the consolidated balance sheet and related NIR, Global Treasury has the authority to take a limited amount of interest rate risk based on market conditions and its views about the direction of global interest rates over both short term and long term time horizons. Global Treasury manages our exposure to changes in interest rates on a consolidated basis organized into three regional treasury units, North America, Europe and Asia/Pacific, to reflect the growing, global nature of our exposures and to capture the impact of change in regional market environments on our total risk position. Our investment activities and our use of derivative financial instruments are the primary tools used in managing interest rate risk. We invest in financial instruments with currency, repricing, and maturity characteristics we consider appropriate to manage our overall interest rate risk position. In addition to on balance sheet assets, we use certain derivatives, primarily interest rate swaps, to alter the interest rate characteristics of specific balance sheet assets or liabilities. The use of derivatives is subject to ALCO approved guidelines. Additional information about our use of derivatives is provided in note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. As a result of growth in our non U.S. operations, non U.S. dollar denominated customer liabilities are a significant portion of our consolidated balance sheet. This growth results in exposure to changes in the shape and level of non U.S. dollar yield curves, which we include in our consolidated interest rate risk management process. Because no one individual measure can accurately assess all of our exposures to changes in interest rates, we use several quantitative measures in our assessment of current and potential future exposures to changes in 75 Table of Contents interest rates and their impact on net interest revenue and balance sheet values. Net interest revenue simulation is the primary tool used in our evaluation of the potential range of possible net interest revenue results that could occur under a variety of interest rate environments. We also use market valuation and duration analysis to assess changes in the economic value of balance sheet assets and liabilities caused by assumed changes in interest rates. Finally, gap analysis the difference between the amount of balance sheet assets and liabilities re pricing within a specified time period is used as a measurement of our interest rate risk position. To measure, monitor, and report on our interest rate risk position, we use (1) NIR simulation, or NIR at risk, which measures the impact on NIR over the next twelve months to immediate, or rate shock, and gradual, or rate ramp, changes in market interest rates; and (2) economic value of equity, or EVE, which measures the impact on the present value of all NIR related principal and interest cash flows of an immediate change in interest rates. NIR at risk is designed to measure the potential impact of changes in market interest rates on NIR in the short term. EVE, on the other hand, is a long term view of interest rate risk, but with a view toward liquidation of State Street. Both of these measures are subject to ALCO established guidelines, and are monitored regularly, along with other relevant simulations, scenario analyses and stress tests by both Global Treasury and ALCO. In calculating our NIR at risk, we start with a base amount of NIR that is projected over the next twelve months, assuming that the then current yield curve remains unchanged over the period. Our existing balance sheet assets and liabilities are adjusted by the amount and timing of transactions that are forecasted to occur over the next twelve months. That yield curve is then shocked, or moved immediately, &plusmn;100 basis points in a parallel fashion, or at all points along the yield curve. Two new twelve month NIR projections are then developed using the same balance sheet and forecasted transactions, but with the new yield curves, and compared to the base scenario. We also perform the calculations using interest rate ramps, which are &plusmn;100 basis point changes in interest rates that are assumed to occur gradually over the next twelve month period, rather than immediately as we do with interest rate shocks. EVE is based on the change in the present value of all NIR related principal and interest cash flows for changes in market rates of interest. The present value of existing cash flows with a then current yield curve serves as the base case. We then apply an immediate parallel shock to that yield curve of &plusmn;200 basis points and recalculate the cash flows and related present values. A large shock is used to better capture the embedded option risk in our mortgage backed securities that results from the borrowers prepayment opportunity. Key assumptions used in the models described above include the timing of cash flows; the maturity and repricing of balance sheet assets and liabilities, especially option embedded financial instruments like mortgage backed securities; changes in market conditions; and interest rate sensitivities of our customer liabilities with respect to the interest rates paid and the level of balances. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the models cannot precisely predict future NIR or predict the impact of changes in interest rates on NIR and economic value. Actual results could differ from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and market conditions, changes in spreads and management strategies, among other factors. Projections of potential future streams of NIR are assessed as part of our forecasting process. 76 Table of Contents The following table presents the estimated exposure of NIR for the next twelve months, calculated as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, due to an immediate &plusmn;100 basis point shift in then current interest rates. Estimated incremental exposures presented below are dependent on managements assumptions about asset and liability sensitivities under various interest rate scenarios, such as those previously discussed, and do not reflect any actions management may undertake in order to mitigate some of the adverse effects of interest rate changes on State Streets financial performance. NIR AT RISK Estimated Exposure toNet Interest Revenue (In millions) 2009 2008 Rate change: +100 bps shock $ (165 ) $ 7 100 bps shock (330 ) (439 ) +100 bps ramp (128 ) (29 ) 100 bps ramp (112 ) (166 ) The more significant NIR sensitivity over the next 12 months for an upward 100 bp shock at December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008 was primarily the result of expected purchases of fixed rate investment securities associated with the aforementioned proposed acquisition of Intesa Sanpaola and the expected addition of fixed to floating interest rate swaps to hedge long term debt. NIR sensitivity to a downward 100 bp shock became less sensitive at December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008. Contributing factors included growth in average noninterest bearing deposits and less responsiveness in non U.S. deposit yields to a downward rate shock. The year over year changes in NIR at risk exposure to upward 100 bp and downward 100 bp ramps were directionally the same as for the shocks, although the change was less pronounced, due to the gradual shift in market rates inherent in the ramp scenarios. Other important factors that impact the levels of NIR are balance sheet size and mix; interest rate spreads; the slope and interest rate level of U.S. dollar and non U.S. dollar yield curves and the relationship between them; the pace of change in market interest rates; and management actions taken in response to the preceding conditions. The following table presents estimated EVE exposures, calculated as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, assuming an immediate and prolonged shift in interest rates, the impact of which would be spread over a number of years. ECONOMIC VALUE OF EQUITY Estimated Exposure toEconomic Value of Equity (In millions) 2009 2008 Rate change: +200 bps shock $ (1,205 ) $ (1,873 ) 200 bps shock (434 ) (740 ) The change in EVE sensitivity for an upward 200 bp shock at December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008 was mainly attributable to maturities and sales of fixed rate investment securities coupled with our re investment in floating rate investment securities, which reduced overall portfolio duration. With respect to the change in EVE sensitivity for a downward 200 bp shock at December 31, 2008 compared to December 31, 2009, deposit yields and short term market interest rates moved lower during 2009, preventing the effect of the shock from fully occurring, and limiting the benefit of lower rates on the estimated fair value of customer deposits. 77 Table of Contents Credit Risk Credit and counterparty risk is defined as the risk of financial loss if a borrower or counterparty is either unable or unwilling to repay borrowings or settle a transaction in accordance with contractual terms. We assume credit and counterparty risk on both our on and off balance sheet exposures. The extension of credit and the acceptance of counterparty risk by State Street are governed by corporate guidelines based on the prospective customers risk profile, the markets served, counterparty and country concentrations, and regulatory compliance. Our focus on large institutional investors and their businesses requires that we assume concentrated credit risk for a variety of products and durations. We maintain comprehensive guidelines and procedures to monitor and manage all aspects of credit and counterparty risk that we undertake. Counterparties are evaluated on an individual basis at least annually, while significant exposures to counterparties are reviewed daily. Processes for credit approval and monitoring are in place for all credit extensions. As part of the approval and renewal process, due diligence is conducted based on the size and term of the exposure, as well as the creditworthiness of the counterparty. At any point in time, having one or more counterparties to which our exposure exceeds 10% of our consolidated total shareholders equity, exclusive of unrealized gains or losses, is not unusual. Exposure to these entities are aggregated and evaluated by ERM. We provide, on a limited basis, traditional loan products and services to key customers and prospects in a manner that is intended to enhance customer relationships, increase profitability and manage risk. We employ a relationship model in which credit decisions are based upon credit quality and the overall institutional relationship. An allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb probable credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio that can be estimated, and is reviewed regularly by management for adequacy. An internal rating system is used to assess potential risk of loss. State Streets risk rating process incorporates the use of risk rating tools in conjunction with managements judgment. Qualitative and quantitative inputs are captured in a transparent and replicable manner, and following a formal review and approval process, an internal credit rating based on State Streets credit scale is assigned. The provision for loan losses is a charge to current earnings to maintain the overall allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate relative to the level of credit risk in the loan and lease portfolio. Information about provisions for loan losses is included in the Provision for Loan Losses section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. We purchase securities under agreements to resell. Risk is managed through a variety of processes, including establishing the acceptability of counterparties; limiting purchases largely to low risk U.S. government securities; taking possession or control of transaction assets; monitoring levels of underlying collateral; and limiting the duration of the agreements. Securities are revalued daily to determine if we believe that additional collateral is necessary from the borrower. Most repurchase agreements are short term, with maturities of less than 90 days. We also provide customers with off balance sheet liquidity and credit enhancement facilities in the form of letters and lines of credit. These exposures are subject to an initial credit analysis, with detailed approval and review processes. These facilities are also actively monitored and reviewed annually. We maintain a separate reserve for probable credit losses related to certain of these off balance sheet activities. Management reviews the adequacy of this reserve on a regular basis. On behalf of our customers, we lend their securities to creditworthy banks, broker/dealers and other institutions. In most circumstances, we indemnify our customers for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities. Though these transactions are collateralized, the substantial volume of these activities necessitates detailed credit based underwriting and monitoring processes. The aggregate amount of indemnified securities on loan totaled $365.25 billion at December 31, 2009, and $324.59 billion at December 31, 2008. We require the borrowers to provide collateral in an amount equal to or in excess of 100% of the fair market value of the securities borrowed. Collateral received in connection with our securities lending services is held by us as agent and is not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. The securities on loan and the collateral are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary. We held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $375.92 billion and $333.07 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 78 Table of Contents The collateral held by us is invested on behalf of our customers. In certain cases, the collateral is invested in third party repurchase agreements, for which we indemnify the customer against loss of the principal invested. We require the repurchase agreement counterparty to provide collateral in an amount equal to or in excess of 100% of the amount of the repurchase agreement. The indemnified repurchase agreements and the related collateral are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. Of the collateral of $375.92 billion at December 31, 2009 and $333.07 billion at December 31, 2008 referenced above, $77.73 billion at December 31, 2009 and $68.37 billion at December 31, 2008 was invested in indemnified repurchase agreements.

Investments in debt and equity securities, including investments in affiliates, are monitored regularly by Corporate Finance and ERM. Procedures are in place for assessing impaired securities, as discussed in notes 1 and 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. Operational Risk We define operational risk as the potential for loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events. As a leading provider of services to institutional investors, we provide a broad array of services, including research, investment management, trading services and investment servicing, that give rise to operational risk. Consequently, active management of operational risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business. Our Operational Risk Policy Statement defines operational risk and details roles and responsibilities for managing operational risk. The Policy Statement is reinforced by the Operational Risk Guidelines, which codify our approach to operational risk. The Guidelines document our practices and provide a mandate within which programs, processes, and regulatory elements are implemented to ensure that operational risk is identified, measured, managed and controlled in a consistent manner across State Street. Responsibility for the management of operational risk lies with every individual at State Street. We maintain an operational risk governance structure designed to ensure that responsibilities are clearly defined and to provide independent oversight of operational risk management. The Risk and Capital Committee of the Board sets operational risk policy and oversees implementation of the operational risk framework. ERM develops corporate programs to manage operational risk and oversees the overall operational risk program. Business units take responsibility for their own operational risk and periodically review the status of the business controls, which are designed to provide a sound operational environment. The business units also identify, manage, and report on operational risk. The MRC and the Operational Risk Committee review operational risk related information and policies, provide oversight of the operational risk program, and escalate operational risk issues of note to the Risk and Capital Committee. Corporate Audit performs independent reviews of the application of operational risk management practices and methodologies and reports to the Examining and Audit Committee of the Board. Our discipline in managing operational risk, which is a result of this emphasis on policy, guidelines, oversight, and independent review, provides the structure to identify, evaluate, control, monitor, measure, mitigate and report operational risk. Business Risk We define business risk as the risk of adverse changes in our earnings related to business factors, including changes in the competitive environment, changes in the operational economics of business activities and the potential effect of strategic and reputation risks, not already captured as market, interest rate, credit or operational risks. We incorporate business risk into our assessment of our economic capital needs. Active management of business risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business, and responsibility for the management of business risk lies with every individual at State Street. Separating the effects of a potential material adverse event into operational and business risk is sometimes difficult. For instance, the direct financial impact of an unfavorable event in the form of fines or penalties would be classified as an operational risk loss, while the impact on our reputation and the potential loss of customers 79 Table of Contents and corresponding decline in revenue would be classified as a business risk loss. An additional example of business risk is the integration of a major acquisition. Failure to successfully integrate the operations of an acquired business, and the resultant inability to retain customers, would be classified as a business risk loss. Business risk is managed with a long term focus. Techniques include the development of business plans and appropriate management oversight. The potential impact of the various elements of business risk is difficult to quantify with any degree of precision. We use a combination of historical earnings volatility, scenario analysis, stress testing and management judgment to help assess the potential effect on State Street attributable to business risk. Management and control of business risks are generally the responsibility of the business units as part of their overall and strategic planning and internal risk management processes. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS In the normal course of our business, we utilize three types of special purpose entities, referred to as SPEs. One type of SPE is utilized in connection with our involvement as collateral manager with respect to managed investment vehicles. Since we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of these managed investment vehicles under current accounting standards, we do not record these vehicles in our consolidated financial statements. A second type of SPE is utilized in connection with our asset backed commercial paper program, under which conduits administered by us sell commercial paper to our institutional customers, primarily mutual fund customers, as short term investments. In May 2009, as a result of actions we elected to take, we determined that we were the primary beneficiary of these conduits under current accounting standards, and were required by these standards to consolidate them into our consolidated financial statements. A third type of SPE is utilized in connection with our tax exempt investment program, under which partnership trusts structure and sell certificated interests in pools of tax exempt investment grade assets to our mutual fund customers. These trusts are recorded in our consolidated financial statements, since we treat the underlying transactions as secured borrowings, not as sales. Additional information about the activities of the above described SPEs, including information with respect to the consolidation of the conduits, is provided in note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. In the normal course of our business, we hold assets under custody and administration and assets under management in a custodial or fiduciary capacity for our customers, and, in accordance with GAAP, we do not record these assets in our consolidated statement of condition. Similarly, collateral funds associated with our securities finance activities are held by us as agent; therefore, we do not record these assets in our consolidated statement of condition. Additional information about these off balance sheet activities is provided in note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. In the normal course of our business, we utilize derivative financial instruments to support our customers needs, to conduct our trading activities and to manage our interest rate and foreign currency risk. Additional information about our use of derivative instruments is provided in note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS Information with respect to recent accounting developments is provided in note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The information set forth in the Market Risk section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included under Item 7, is incorporated by reference herein. 80 Table of Contents
