ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS GENERAL State Street Corporation is a financial holding company organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. All references in this Managements Discussion and Analysis to the parent company are to State Street Corporation. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this Managements Discussion and Analysis to State Street, we, us, our or similar terms mean State Street Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. State Street Bank and Trust Company is referred to as State Street Bank. At December 31, 2010, we had total assets of $160.51 billion, total deposits of $98.35 billion, total shareholders equity of $17.79 billion and employed 28,670. With $21.53 trillion of assets under custody and administration and $2.01 trillion of assets under management at year end 2010, we are a leading specialist in meeting the needs of institutional investors worldwide. We report two lines of business: Investment Servicing and Investment Management. These lines of business provide a broad range of products and services for our clients, which include mutual funds, collective investment funds and other investment pools, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, foundations, endowments and investment managers. Investment Servicing provides services to support institutional investors, such as custody, product and participant level accounting, daily pricing and administration; master trust and master custody; recordkeeping; shareholder services, including mutual fund and collective investment fund shareholder accounting; foreign exchange, brokerage and other trading services; securities finance; deposit and short term investment facilities; loan and lease financing; investment manager and alternative investment manager operations outsourcing; and performance, risk and compliance analytics. Investment Management provides a broad array of services for managing financial assets, such as investment research services and investment management, including passive and active U.S. and non U.S. equity and fixed income strategies. For additional information about our lines of business, see the Line of Business Information section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis and note 24 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. This Managements Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. Certain previously reported amounts presented have been reclassified to conform to current period classifications. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., referred to as GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the application of certain accounting policies that materially affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Accounting policies that require management to make assumptions that are difficult, subjective or complex about matters that are uncertain and may change in subsequent periods are discussed in more depth in the Significant Accounting Estimates section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. Certain financial information provided in this Managements Discussion and Analysis, or in other public statements, announcements or reports filed by us with the SEC, is prepared on both a GAAP basis and a non GAAP basis, the latter of which we refer to as operating basis. Management measures and compares certain financial information on an operating basis, as it believes that this presentation supports meaningful comparisons from period to period and the analysis of comparable financial trends with respect to State Streets normal ongoing business operations. Management believes that operating basis financial information, which reports revenue from non taxable sources on a fully taxable equivalent basis and excludes the impact of revenue and expenses outside of the normal course of our business, facilitates an investors understanding and analysis of State Streets underlying financial performance and trends in addition to financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. This Managements Discussion and Analysis contains statements that are considered forward looking statements within the meaning of U.S. securities laws. Forward looking statements are based on our current expectations about revenue and market growth, acquisitions and divestitures, new technologies, services, 35 Table of Contents opportunities, earnings and other matters that do not relate strictly to historical facts. These forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially. We undertake no obligation to revise the forward looking statements contained in this Managements Discussion and Analysis to reflect events after the time we file this Form 10 K with the SEC. Additional information about forward looking statements and related risks and uncertainties is provided in Risk Factors included under Item 1A.

Additional information is provided under Consolidated Results of Operations, which follows this section. Our financial results for 2010 reflected the following: During the second quarter of 2010, we completed our acquisitions of Intesa Sanpaolos securities services business (May 17, 2010) and Mourant International Finance Administration (April 1, 2010). For full year 2010, from their respective acquisition dates through December 31, 2010, the acquired Intesa and MIFA businesses added in the aggregate approximately $300 million of revenue and $235 million of expenses, excluding merger and integration costs, to our consolidated statement of income. We also recorded aggregate merger and integration costs of $57 million in connection with these two acquisitions in 2010, from their respective acquisition dates through December 31, 2010 (see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8). During the second quarter of 2010, we recorded an aggregate pre tax charge of $414 million, including associated legal costs of $9 million, in our consolidated statement of income related to the following: a pre tax charge of $330 million to provide for a one time cash contribution to certain cash collateral pools and liquidity trusts underlying SSgA managed investment funds engaged in securities lending (see the Investment Management section under Line of Business Information in this Managements Discussion and Analysis), and a pre tax charge of $75 million to establish a reserve to address potential inconsistencies in connection with our implementation of the redemption restrictions applicable to the cash collateral pools underlying our agency lending program (see the Securities Finance section under Consolidated Results of Operations Total Revenue in this Managements Discussion and Analysis). During the fourth quarter of 2010, as previously reported, we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of approximately $156 million in our consolidated statement of income, related primarily to a reduction in force of approximately 1,400 employees that began in December 2010 and is intended to be completed by the end of 2011, as well as actions taken in 2010 to reduce our occupancy costs. The charges were part of a global multi year program that began during the fourth quarter of 2010, and which will include operational and information technology enhancements and targeted cost initiatives (see the Expenses section under Consolidated Results of Operations in this Managements Discussion and Analysis). During the fourth quarter of 2010, as previously reported, we recorded a pre tax loss of approximately $344 million in our consolidated statement of income associated with the sale of approximately $11 billion of mortgage and asset backed investment securities. The securities were sold in connection with a repositioning of our investment portfolio to allow for enhanced capital ratios under evolving regulatory capital standards, increased balance sheet flexibility, and a reduction of our exposure to certain asset classes (see the Investment Securities section under Financial Condition in this Managements Discussion and Analysis). Total revenue increased 4% compared to 2009. A 10% increase in total fee revenue from 2009 levels and a 5% increase in net interest revenue were partly offset by higher net losses related to investment securities, which resulted from the above mentioned securities portfolio repositioning completed during the fourth quarter of 2010. Servicing and management fees were up 18% and 8%, respectively, from 2009. Servicing fee revenue increased mainly due to the impact of new business, the addition of revenue from the acquired Intesa and MIFA businesses and improvement in equity market valuations. Management fee revenue increased primarily due to the improvement in equity markets as well as the impact of new business. Trading services revenue increased 1%, primarily as a result of higher electronic trading revenues in brokerage and other fees, offset slightly by the impact of lower levels of foreign exchange trading volatility. Securities finance revenue was down 44% as a result of continued lower spreads and securities lending demand. Processing fees and other revenue increased 104% due to higher net revenue from structured products and higher net revenue related to certain tax advantaged investments. 37 Table of Contents In 2010, we recorded net interest revenue of $2.70 billion, which included $712 million of discount accretion related to investment securities added to our consolidated statement of condition in connection with the May 2009 conduit consolidation (see the Net Interest Revenue section under Consolidated Results of Operations in this Managements Discussion and Analysis and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8). Net interest revenue increased 5% on both a GAAP and fully taxable equivalent basis (the latter $2.83 billion compared to $2.69 billion, reflecting increases from tax equivalent adjustments of $129 million and $126 million, respectively). These increases were primarily the result of the impact of the Intesa deposits added in May 2010 in connection with that acquisition, spread improvement and increased volume associated with non U.S. investment securities and higher discount accretion ($712 million for 2010 compared to $621 million for 2009), offset by a decreased spread on our long term cost of borrowing and spread compression in our floating rate investment securities. Net interest margin increased 5 basis points, from 2.19% in 2009 to 2.24% in 2010. Total expenses of $6.84 billion increased 15% from $5.97 billion in 2009, and included merger and integration costs of $89 million associated with acquisitions, as well as the previously referenced pre tax charges of $414 million related to our securities lending business and $156 million related to our global multi year program. Expenses from operations of $6.18 billion ($6.84 billion net of $659 million delineated above) increased 9% compared to 2009 expenses from operations of $5.67 billion ($5.97 billion net of $299 million composed of a $250 million provision for legal exposure and $49 million of merger and integration costs), mainly as a result of increases in salaries and benefits expense associated with higher levels of incentive compensation accruals and the addition of expenses from the Intesa and MIFA acquisitions. Salaries and benefits expenses in 2009 were abnormally low, as we did not accrue cash incentive compensation for the first half of 2009 as part of our plan to increase tangible common equity. For 2010, net income available to common shareholders decreased 6% to $1.54 billion, or $3.09 per diluted share, compared to net income before extraordinary loss available to common shareholders of $1.64 billion, or $3.46 per diluted share, for 2009. The after tax extraordinary loss of $3.68 billion, or $7.77 per diluted share, was related to the consolidation of the asset backed commercial paper conduits completed in May 2009. Return on common equity was 9.5% compared to 13.2% for 2009, the latter before the extraordinary loss. During 2010, we won mandates for approximately $1.37 trillion in assets to be serviced; of the total, $976 billion was installed prior to December 31, 2010, with the remainder expected to be installed in subsequent periods. The new business not installed by December 31, 2010 was not included in assets under custody and administration at that date, and had no impact on servicing fee revenue for 2010, as the assets are not included until their installation is complete and we begin to service them. Once installed, the assets generate servicing fee revenue in subsequent periods. We will provide various services for these assets including accounting, fund administration, custody, foreign exchange, securities finance, transfer agency, performance analytics, compliance reporting and monitoring, hedge fund servicing, private equity administration, real estate administration, depository banking services, wealth management services and investment manager operations outsourcing. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This section discusses our consolidated results of operations for 2010 compared to 2009, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included under Item 8. A comparison of consolidated results of operations for 2009 with those for 2008 is provided in the Comparison of 2009 and 2008 section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. 38 Table of Contents TOTAL REVENUE Years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2009 2010 (Dollars in millions) Fee revenue: Servicing fees $ 3,938 $3,334 $ 3,798 18 % Management fees 829 766 975 8 Trading services 1,106 1,094 1,467 1 Securities finance 318 570 1,230 (44 ) Processing fees and other 349 171 277 104 Total fee revenue 6,540 5,935 7,747 10 Net interest revenue: Interest revenue 3,462 3,286 4,879 5 Interest expense 763 722 2,229 6 Net interest revenue 2,699 2,564 2,650 5 Gains (Losses) related to investment securities, net (286 ) 141 (54 ) Gain on sale of CitiStreet interest, net of exit and other associated costs 350 Total revenue $ 8,953 $ 8,640 $ 10,693 4 Our broad range of services generates fee revenue and net interest revenue. Fee revenue generated by our investment servicing and investment management businesses is augmented by securities finance, trading services and processing fees and other revenue. We earn net interest revenue from client deposits and short term investment activities by providing deposit services and short term investment vehicles, such as repurchase agreements and commercial paper, to meet clients needs for high grade liquid investments, and investing these sources of funds and additional borrowings in assets yielding a higher rate. Fee Revenue Servicing and management fees collectively composed approximately 73% of our total fee revenue for 2010 and 69% for 2009. These fees are influenced by several factors, including the mix and volume of assets under custody and administration and assets under management, securities positions held and the volume of portfolio transactions, and the types of products and services used by clients, and are generally affected by changes in worldwide equity and fixed income security valuations. Generally, servicing fees are affected, in part, by changes in daily average valuations of assets under custody and administration, while management fees are affected by changes in month end valuations of assets under management. Additional factors, such as the level of transaction volumes, changes in service level, balance credits, client minimum balances, pricing concessions and other factors, may have a significant effect on servicing fee revenue. Generally, management fee revenue is more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue. Management fees for enhanced index and actively managed products are generally earned at higher rates than those for passive products. Enhanced index and actively managed products may also involve performance fee arrangements. Performance fees are generated when the performance of certain managed funds exceeds benchmarks specified in the management agreements. Generally, we experience more volatility with performance fees than with more traditional management fees. In light of the above, we estimate, assuming all other factors remain constant, that a 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity values would result in a corresponding change in our total revenue of approximately 2%. If fixed income security values were to increase or decrease by 10%, we would anticipate a corresponding change of approximately 1% in our total revenue. We would expect the foregoing relationships to exist in normalized financial markets, which we have not experienced since mid 2007. The disrupted conditions that began during the second half of 2007 have adversely affected our market driven revenues, particularly those from foreign exchange trading services and securities finance. Even though the financial markets began to 39 Table of Contents improve during the second half of 2009, the effect of the disrupted conditions on our total revenue, particularly our market driven revenue, has been more significant through 2010 than we would anticipate in normalized markets. The following table presents selected equity market indices for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Daily averages and the averages of month end indices demonstrate worldwide changes in equity market valuations that affect servicing and management fee revenue, respectively. Year end indices affect the value of assets under custody and administration and assets under management at those dates. The index names listed in the table are service marks of their respective owners.

Servicing Fees Servicing fees include fee revenue from U.S. mutual funds, collective investment funds worldwide, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, foundations, endowments, and other investment pools. Products and services include custody; product and participant level accounting; daily pricing and administration; recordkeeping; investment manager and alternative investment manager operations outsourcing; master trust and master custody; and performance, risk and compliance analytics. We are the largest provider of mutual fund custody and accounting services in the U.S. We distinguish ourselves from other mutual fund service providers by offering customers a broad array of integrated products and services, including accounting, daily pricing and fund administration. We calculate more than 40% of the U.S. mutual fund prices provided to NASDAQ that appear daily in The Wall Street Journal and other publications with an accuracy rate of 99.97%. We service U.S. tax exempt assets for corporate and public pension funds, and we provide trust and valuation services for more than 5,000 daily priced portfolios. We are a service provider outside of the U.S. as well. In Germany, we provide Depotbank services for retail and institutional fund assets. In the U.K., we provide custody services for pension fund assets and administration services for mutual fund assets. We service approximately $700 billion of offshore assets, primarily domiciled in Ireland, Luxembourg and Toronto. We have more than $970 billion in assets under administration in the Asia/Pacific region, and in Japan, we hold approximately 92% of the trust assets held by non domestic trust banks in that region. We are an alternative asset servicing provider worldwide, with approximately $660 billion of assets under administration. We are also a hedge fund administration provider worldwide, as well as a worldwide provider of private equity administration services and real estate administration services. 40 Table of Contents The 18% increase in servicing fees from 2009 primarily resulted from the impact of new business awarded to us and installed during 2010 and prior periods on current period revenue, the addition of revenue generated by the acquired Intesa and MIFA businesses from May 17 and April 1, respectively, through December 31 and increases in daily average equity market valuations. For 2010, servicing fees generated outside the U.S. were approximately 41% of total servicing fees compared to approximately 37% for 2009. At year end 2010, our total assets under custody and administration were $21.53 trillion, compared to $18.79 trillion a year earlier. The increase compared to 2009 was primarily the result of increases in equity market valuations and a higher level of new servicing business won and installed prior to December 31, 2010, as well as the effects of the Intesa and MIFA acquisitions. These asset levels as of year end did not reflect new business awarded to us during 2010 that had not been installed prior to December 31, 2010. The value of assets under custody and administration is a broad measure of the relative size of various markets served. Changes in the values of assets under custody and administration do not necessarily result in proportional changes in our servicing fee revenue. Assets under custody and administration consisted of the following as of December 31: ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY AND ADMINISTRATION As of December 31, 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2009 2010AnnualGrowthRate 2006 2010CompoundAnnualGrowthRate (Dollars in billions) Mutual funds $ 5,540 $ 4,734 $ 4,093 $ 5,200 $ 4,007 17 % 8 % Collective funds 4,350 3,580 2,679 3,968 1,947 22 22 Pension products 4,726 4,395 3,621 5,246 4,914 8 (1 ) Insurance and other products 6,911 6,086 5,514 5,799 4,780 14 10 Total $ 21,527 $ 18,795 $ 15,907 $ 20,213 $ 15,648 15 8 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT MIX OF ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY AND ADMINISTRATION As of December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (In billions) Equities $ 11,000 $ 8,828 $ 6,691 Fixed income 7,875 7,236 6,689 Short term and other investments 2,652 2,731 2,527 Total $ 21,527 $ 18,795 $ 15,907 GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY AND ADMINISTRATION(1) As of December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (In billions) United States $ 15,889 $ 14,585 $ 12,424 Other Americas 599 606 536 Europe/Middle East/Africa 4,067 2,773 2,391 Asia/Pacific 972 831 556 Total $ 21,527 $ 18,795 $ 15,907 (1) Geographic mix is based on the location at which the assets are custodied or serviced. Management Fees Through State Street Global Advisors, or SSgA, we provide a broad range of investment management strategies, specialized investment management advisory services and other financial services for corporations, public funds, and other sophisticated investors. Based on assets under management, SSgA is the largest manager 41 Table of Contents of institutional assets worldwide, the largest manager of assets for tax exempt organizations (primarily pension plans) in the U.S., and the third largest investment manager overall in the world. SSgA offers a broad array of investment management strategies, including passive and active, such as enhanced indexing and hedge fund strategies, using quantitative and fundamental methods for both U.S. and global equities and fixed income securities. SSgA also offers exchange traded funds, or ETFs, such as the SPDR&reg; ETF brand. The 8% increase in management fees from 2009 resulted primarily from the impact of increases in average month end equity market valuations and, to a lesser extent, the impact of new business won and installed in prior periods on current period revenue. Average month end equity market valuations, individually presented in the foregoing INDEX table, were up an average of 20% compared to 2009. Management fees generated outside the U.S. were approximately 34% of total management fees for 2010, down from 36% for 2009. At year end 2010, assets under management were $2.01 trillion, compared to $1.95 trillion at year end 2009. Such amounts include assets of the SPDR&reg; Gold ETF, for which we act as distribution agent rather than investment manager, and certain assets managed for the U.S. government under programs adopted during the financial crisis. While certain management fees are directly determined by the value of assets under management and the investment strategy employed, management fees reflect other factors as well, including our relationship pricing for clients who use multiple services, and the benchmarks specified in the respective management agreements related to performance fees. During 2010, we benefited from the continued focus in the institutional markets on passive strategies, particularly passive equities and exchange traded funds, where we had year to year increases in assets under management of 30% and 24%, respectively. These increases were partly offset by continued weakness in our sales of active products and a reduction in managed cash balances, which in part reflected the effect of reductions of securities lending volumes associated with continued weak loan demand. The overall increase in assets under management at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009, which can be seen in the tables that follow this discussion, reflected appreciation in the values of the assets managed, partly offset by a net loss of asset management business. Our levels of assets under management were affected by a number of factors, including reaction to prior issues related to SSgAs active fixed income strategies, restrictions on redemptions related to funds engaged in securities lending, and the relative under performance of certain of our passive equity products. The net loss of business of $68 billion for 2010 presented in the table on page 43 does not reflect new business awarded to us during 2010 that had not been installed prior to December 31, 2010. This new business will be reflected in assets under management in future periods after installation, and will generate management fee revenue in subsequent periods. 42 Table of Contents Assets under management consisted of the following as of December 31: ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT As of December 31, 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2009 2010AnnualGrowthRate 2006 2010CompoundAnnualGrowthRate (Dollars in billions) Passive: Equities $ 655 $ 504 $ 344 $ 522 $ 504 30 % 7 % Fixed income 361 395 200 178 144 (9 ) 26 Exchange traded funds(1) 255 205 170 171 111 24 23 Other 210 211 163 171 122 15 Total Passive 1,481 1,315 877 1,042 881 13 14 Active: Equities 55 66 72 179 152 (17 ) (22 ) Fixed income 20 25 32 38 34 (20 ) (12 ) Other 28 28 17 105 114 (30 ) Total Active 103 119 121 322 300 (13 ) (23 ) Cash 426 517 468 632 577 (18 ) (7 ) Total $ 2,010 $ 1,951 $ 1,466 $ 1,996 $ 1,758 3 3 (1) Includes SPDR&reg; Gold Fund, for which State Street is not the investment manager but acts as distribution agent.

We offer a complete range of foreign exchange services under an account model that focuses on the global requirements of our clients for our proprietary research and the execution of trades in any time zone. 43 Table of Contents Foreign exchange trading revenue is influenced by three principal factors: the volume and type of client foreign exchange transactions; currency volatility; and the management of currency market risks. For 2010, foreign exchange trading revenue totaled $597 million, a 12% decrease from revenue of $677 million in 2009, primarily the result of lower spreads on foreign exchange trades and a decline in currency volatility, partly offset by higher client volumes. 60% of our total foreign exchange trading revenue for 2010 was earned in the second and fourth quarters, and such revenue for the fourth quarter increased 60% compared to the third quarter. We also offer a range of brokerage and other trading products tailored specifically to meet the needs of the global pension community, including transition management, commission recapture and self directed brokerage. These products are differentiated by our position as an agent of the institutional investor. Brokerage and other trading fees of $509 million were 22% higher compared to $417 million in 2009, with the increase largely attributable to higher electronic trading volumes. Securities Finance Our securities finance business consists of two components: investment funds with a broad range of investment objectives which are managed by SSgA and engage in agency securities lending, which we refer to as the SSgA lending funds; and an agency lending program for third party investment managers and asset owners, which we refer to as the agency lending funds. Additional information with respect to the SSgA lending funds is also provided under Line of Business Information Investment Management in this Managements Discussion and Analysis. Our securities finance business provides liquidity to the financial markets, as well as an effective means for clients to earn incremental revenue on their securities portfolios. By acting as a lending agent and coordinating loans between lenders and borrowers, we lend securities and provide liquidity to clients worldwide. Borrowers provide collateral in the form of cash or securities to State Street in return for loaned securities. Borrowers are generally required to provide collateral equal to a contractually agreed percentage equal to or in excess of the fair value of the loaned securities. As the fair value of the loaned securities changes, additional collateral is provided by the borrower or collateral is returned to the borrower. Such movements are typically referred to as daily mark to market collateral adjustments. We also participate in securities lending transactions as a principal, rather than an agent. As principal, we borrow securities from the lending client and then lend such securities to the subsequent borrower, either a State Street client or a broker/dealer. Our involvement as principal is utilized when the lending client is unable to transact directly with the market and requires us to execute the transaction and furnish the securities. We provide our credit rating to the transaction as well as our ability to source securities through our assets under custody and administration. For cash collateral, our clients pay a usage fee to the provider of the cash collateral, and we invest the cash collateral in certain investment vehicles or managed accounts as directed by the owner of the loaned securities. In some cases, the investment vehicles or managed accounts may be managed by SSgA. The spread between the yield on the investment vehicle and the usage fee paid to the provider of the collateral is split between the lender of the securities and State Street as agent. For non cash collateral, the borrower pays a fee for the loaned securities, and the fee is split between the lender of the securities and State Street. Securities finance revenue, composed of our split of both the spreads related to cash collateral and the fees related to non cash collateral, is principally a function of the volume of securities on loan and the interest rate spreads and fees earned on the underlying collateral. For 2010, securities finance revenue decreased 44% from 2009, substantially the result of lower spreads across all lending programs, as average lending volumes were essentially flat year to year ($396 billion for 2010 compared to $406 billion for 2009). Beginning in 2007, the market value per unit of the assets held in the certain of the collateral pools underlying both the agency lending program and SSgA lending funds fell below $1.00. However, we continued to transact purchases into and redemptions out of these pools at $1.00 per unit and imposed restrictions on redemptions from the SSgA lending funds and certain of the agency lending collateral pools. 44 Table of Contents We continued to transact purchase and redemptions at $1.00 per unit for a number of reasons, including that none of the securities in the cash collateral pools was then in default or considered to be materially impaired, and that restrictions on withdrawals from the agency lending collateral pools were and are in place, which, absent a substantial reduction in the lending program, should permit the securities in the collateral pools to be held until they recover to their par value. During 2010, we took several actions to seek a resolution to these issues: In June 2010, we contributed $330 million to the collateral pools and liquidity trusts underlying the SSgA lending funds, eliminating the difference between the market value and amortized cost of the assets held by such vehicles as of June 30, 2010. In June 2010, as a result of a review of the implementation of our policy restricting redemptions from certain agency lending collateral pools, and based on our assessment of the amount required to compensate clients for the dilutive effect of redemptions which may not have been consistent with the intent of the policy, we recorded a pre tax charge of $75 million to address these potential inconsistencies. In August 2010, SSgA removed the redemption restrictions from the SSgA lending funds. In the period subsequent to the elimination of the redemption restrictions, some clients that invested in SSgA lending funds transitioned their assets to other SSgA products that did not engage in securities lending, or, to a lesser degree, other investment managers. As a result of the elimination of the redemption restrictions and reduced utilization of lendable assets in the SSgA lending funds, the aggregate net assets of the collateral pools underlying the SSgA lending funds declined to $8 billion as of December 31, 2010 from $24 billion as of December 31, 2009. In December 2010, we divided certain agency lending collateral pools into liquidity and duration pools, and in January 2011, we removed the redemption restrictions from the liquidity pools. These actions were taken to provide greater flexibility to participants with respect to their control of their level of participation in our agency lending program. As of December 31, 2010, the aggregate net assets of these liquidity pools and duration pools were $26.2 billion and $11.8 billion, respectively, and the return obligations of participants in the agency lending program represented by interests in the duration pools exceeded the market value of the assets in the duration pools by approximately $319 million, which amount is expected to be eliminated as the assets in the duration pools mature or amortize. Market influences continued to affect our revenue from, and the profitability of, our securities lending activities during 2010, and may do so in future periods. While the average volume of securities on loan has generally stabilized over the past two years, spreads have declined significantly compared to those earned in late 2007 and throughout 2008 (which were extraordinarily high), reflecting prevailing interest rates and the effects of government actions taken to stimulate the economy. The actions taken during 2010 outlined above are expected to provide an opportunity for increased securities lending volumes, although their effect will be influenced by overall market and client specific factors and could, particularly in the short term, result in decreased lending volumes. As long as securities lending spreads remain below the more normal levels generally experienced prior to late 2007, client demand is likely to remain at a reduced level and our revenues from our securities lending activities will be adversely affected relative to the revenues we earned in 2007, 2008 (which were extraordinarily high) and 2009. While these actions are also intended to address client issues, we do not know at this time how our agency lending clients will react to these measures. For additional information, refer to Risk Factors included under Item 1A. As previously disclosed, in 2009, we determined that withdrawals by two related participants in one of the agency lending collateral pools were inconsistent with our redemption restrictions. In response, we redeemed in kind the remaining units of such participants, effectively distributing, together with prior cash withdrawals, the same amount of cash and longer dated securities that the participants would have received under the redemption restrictions. We are in litigation with these participants; see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. We also undertook a review of our implementation of the redemption restrictions with respect to other participants in the agency lending collateral pools. This review identified the potential inconsistencies, referenced above, in connection with our implementation of the redemption policy. 45 Table of Contents Processing Fees and Other Processing fees and other revenue includes diverse types of fees and revenue, including fees from our structured products business, fees from software licensing and maintenance, equity income from our joint venture investments, gains and losses on sales of leased equipment and other assets, and amortization of our investments in tax advantaged financings. Processing fees and other revenue was $349 million for 2010, an increase of 104% compared to 2009. This increase primarily resulted from higher net revenue from structured products, including fees from our tax exempt investment program, and higher net revenue related to certain tax advantaged investments.

The AMLF expired in February 2010. (2) Interest revenue for 2008 reflected a cumulative reduction of $98 million recorded in connection with our SILO lease transactions. Additional information about our SILO lease transactions is provided in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. (3) Amounts included fully taxable equivalent adjustments of $129 million for 2010, $126 million for 2009 and $104 million for 2008. 46 Table of Contents Net interest revenue is defined as the total of interest revenue earned on interest earning assets less interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities. Interest earning assets, which principally consist of investment securities, interest bearing deposits with banks, repurchase agreements, loans and leases, and other liquid assets, are financed primarily by client deposits and short term borrowings. Net interest margin represents the relationship between fully taxable equivalent net interest revenue and total average interest earning assets for the period. Revenue that is exempt from income taxes, mainly that earned from certain investment securities (state and political subdivisions), is adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent basis using a federal income tax rate of 35%, adjusted for applicable state income taxes, net of the related federal tax benefit. Changes in the components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are discussed in more detail below. Additional detail about the components of interest revenue and interest expense is provided in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. For 2010, on both a GAAP and a fully taxable equivalent basis, net interest revenue increased 5% compared to 2009 (with fully taxable equivalent net interest revenue reflective of increases from tax equivalent adjustments of $129 million and $126 million, respectively). If the discount accretion related to former conduit securities, more fully described below, is excluded, fully taxable equivalent net interest revenue for 2010 increased to $2.12 billion ($2.83 billion presented in the preceding table less accretion of $712 million) from $2.07 billion ($2.69 billion presented in the preceding table less accretion of $621 million), an increase of 2%. The increase was primarily the result of the impact of a higher portfolio allocation to fixed rate investment securities, U.S. and non U.S. investment portfolio growth, and the impact of the Intesa deposits added in May 2010 in connection with that acquisition, partly offset by lower spreads on both floating rate investment securities and non U.S. transaction deposits. In May 2009, we elected to take actions that required the consolidation onto our balance sheet, for financial reporting purposes, of the assets and liabilities of the asset backed commercial paper conduits that we sponsored and administered. Upon consolidation, the aggregate fair value of the conduits investment securities of approximately $16.6 billion on the date of consolidation was established as their carrying amount, resulting in a $6.1 billion discount to the assets aggregate par value of approximately $22.7 billion. To the extent that the expected future cash flows from the securities held by us exceed their carrying amount, the portion of the discount not related to credit will accrete into interest revenue over the securities remaining terms. Subsequent to the May 2009 consolidation, we have recorded aggregate discount accretion in interest revenue of $1.33 billion ($712 million in 2010 and $621 million in 2009). The timing and ultimate recognition of accretion depends, in part, on factors that are outside of our control, including anticipated prepayment speeds and credit quality. The impact of these factors is uncertain and can be significantly influenced by general economic and financial market conditions. The timing and recognition of accretion can also be influenced by our ongoing management of the risk and other characteristics associated with our investment portfolio, including any resulting sales of securities from which we would otherwise generate accretion. As we discussed in the Overview of Financial Results Financial Highlights section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis, and as more fully described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, during the fourth quarter of 2010, we sold approximately $11 billion of mortgage and asset backed investment securities, including $4.93 billion of former conduit securities, to reposition our investment portfolio and allow for enhanced capital ratios under evolving regulatory capital standards, increased balance sheet flexibility, and a reduction of our exposure to certain asset classes. Depending on the factors discussed above, among others, we anticipate that, until the former conduit securities remaining in our portfolio mature or are sold, discount accretion will affect our net interest revenue, and may increase the volatility of our net interest revenue and margin; however, the portfolio repositioning resulted in a significant decrease in the accretion that we expect to recognize in future periods. Assuming that we hold the remaining former conduit securities to maturity, all other things equal, we expect the former conduit securities carried in our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2010 to generate aggregate accretion in future periods of approximately $1.3 billion over their remaining terms. Interest bearing deposits with banks, including cash balances held at the Federal Reserve to satisfy reserve requirements, averaged $13.55 billion for 2010, a decrease of 44% compared to $24.16 billion for 2009. An 47 Table of Contents average of $4.98 billion was held at the Federal Reserve Bank during 2010, a decrease of 60% compared to $12.42 billion for 2009, with balances in both periods exceeding minimum reserve requirements. The overall decreases in both comparisons reflected excess liquidity held by us during 2009 due to the then ongoing financial markets instability that was re allocated to higher yielding investment securities. Average securities purchased under resale agreements decreased 20% from $3.70 billion for 2009 to $2.96 billion for 2010, mainly due to lower client demand for short term investment. Average trading account assets declined 80% from $1.91 billion for 2009 to $376 million for 2010, due to the absence of conduit asset backed commercial paper purchased by us, which was eliminated for financial reporting purposes when the conduits were consolidated onto our balance sheet in May 2009 as previously described. Our average investment securities portfolio increased 18% from $81.19 billion for 2009 to approximately $96.12 billion for 2010, generally the result of the continued execution of our re investment strategy that we began in the second half of 2009, partly offset by maturities and sales of securities during the year. In addition, as described earlier in this section, we repositioned our portfolio in December 2010 by selling approximately $11 billion of mortgage and asset backed securities. By the end of 2010, we had re invested approximately $7 billion of the proceeds from the repositioning, primarily in agency mortgage backed securities. As of December 31, 2010, securities rated AAA and AA comprised approximately 90% of our investment securities portfolio (approximately 79% rated AAA), compared to 80% AAA and AA rated (approximately 69% rated AAA) as of December 31, 2009, with the improvement primarily due to the repositioning. Loans and leases averaged $12.09 billion for 2010, up 25% from $9.70 billion for 2009. The increase was primarily due to increased client demand for short term liquidity and the addition of structured asset backed loans in connection with the May 2009 conduit consolidation. Approximately 27% of the average loan and lease portfolio, compared to 31% for 2009, was composed of U.S. and non U.S. short duration advances that provided liquidity to clients in support of their transaction flows, which averaged approximately $3.29 billion for 2010, up 11% from $2.97 billion for 2009. U.S. short duration advances averaged approximately $1.92 billion for 2010, down 13% compared to $2.21 billion for 2009. Average non U.S. short duration advances increased 80% to $1.37 billion for 2010, mainly due to activity associated with clients added in connection with the Intesa acquisition. Average interest bearing deposits increased 11%, from $69.17 billion to $76.96 billion for 2010 compared to 2009. The increases reflected the deposits added in connection with the Intesa acquisition, partly offset by the return of client deposits to levels more consistent with those experienced prior to late 2007. Average other short term borrowings decreased 19% to $13.59 billion for 2010, primarily due to the absence of borrowings under the Federal Reserves term auction facility, which is further discussed in the Liquidity section under Financial Condition in this Managements Discussion and Analysis. Average long term debt increased 10% to $8.68 billion for 2010, as a result of the full year impact of the issuance of an aggregate of approximately $4 billion of unsecured senior notes by State Street and State Street Bank in March 2009 under the FDICs Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, as well as the May 2009 issuance of unsecured senior notes, partly offset by a subordinated debt maturity in 2010. Several factors could affect future levels of our net interest revenue and margin, including the mix of client liabilities; actions of the various central banks; changes in U.S. and non U.S. interest rates; the shapes of the various yield curves around the world; the amount of discount accretion generated by the former conduit securities that remain in our investment portfolio (discussed earlier in this section); and the relative impact of the yields earned on the securities purchased by us with the proceeds from the portfolio repositioning compared to the yields earned on the securities sold. In the second half of 2009, based on market conditions, we re initiated our strategy of re investing proceeds from amortizing and maturing securities into highly rated investment securities, such as U.S. Treasuries and federal agency mortgage backed securities and asset backed securities. The pace at which we continue to re invest and the types of securities purchased will depend on market conditions over time. These factors and the level of interest rates worldwide are expected to dictate what effect the re investment program will have on future levels of our net interest revenue and net interest margin. 48 Table of Contents Gains (Losses) Related to Investment Securities, Net In connection with our ongoing management of the investment portfolio, we may, from time to time, sell investment securities, including former conduit securities, to manage risk, to reduce our risk profile, to take advantage of favorable market conditions, or for other reasons. In 2010, we recorded net realized losses of $55 million from sales of approximately $29.41 billion of investment securities, compared to net realized gains of $368 million from sales of approximately $8.27 billion of investment securities in 2009. The $55 million of net sale losses realized during 2010 included the $344 million net realized loss that resulted from the investment portfolio repositioning described below. For 2010, $1.08 billion of net gains were realized from sales of $5.53 billion of former conduit securities, composed of gross realized gains of $1.11 billion and gross realized losses of $27 million. For 2009, $104 million of net gains were realized from sales of $333 million of former conduit securities, composed of gross realized gains of $125 million and gross realized losses of $21 million. In December 2010, we undertook a repositioning of our investment securities portfolio by selling approximately $11 billion of securities, composed of $4.3 billion of asset backed securities, $4.1 billion of non agency mortgage backed securities and $2.5 billion of mortgage backed securities. The repositioning was undertaken to enhance our capital ratios under evolving regulatory capital standards, increase our balance sheet flexibility in deploying our capital, and reduce our exposure to certain asset classes. The sale resulted in a pre tax loss of approximately $344 million, which was recorded in our consolidated statement of income and is reflected in the $55 million of net sale losses described in the preceding paragraph. The repositioning included the sale of approximately $4.93 billion of former conduit securities at a net realized gain of $964 million. Of the $11 billion of securities sold in the repositioning, approximately $4.8 billion were classified as held to maturity in our consolidated statement of condition. Additional information about the sale, including the held to maturity portion, is included in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. The aggregate unrealized loss on securities for which other than temporary impairment was recorded in 2010 was $651 million. Of this total, $420 million related to factors other than credit, and was recognized, net of taxes, as a component of other comprehensive income in our consolidated statement of condition. We recorded losses from other than temporary impairment related to credit of the remaining $231 million in our 2010 consolidated statement of income, compared to $227 million in 2009, which resulted from our assessment of impairment. For 2010, the substantial majority of the impairment losses related to non agency mortgage backed securities which management concluded had experienced credit losses resulting from deterioration in financial performance of those securities during the year. The securities are reported as asset backed securities in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. Years ended December 31, 2010 2009 (In millions) Net realized gains (losses) from sales of investment securities(1) $ (55 ) $ 368 Gross losses from other than temporary impairment (651 ) (1,155 ) Losses not related to credit(2) 420 928 Net impairment losses (231 ) (227 ) Gains (Losses) related to investment securities, net $ (286 ) $ 141 Impairment associated with expected credit losses $ (203 ) $ (151 ) Impairment associated with managements intent to sell the impaired securities prior to their recovery in value (1 ) (54 ) Impairment associated with adverse changes in timing of expected future cash flows (27 ) (22 ) Net impairment losses $ (231 ) $ (227 ) (1) Amount for 2010 included the net sale loss of $344 million associated with the repositioning of the investment portfolio. (2) Pursuant to new GAAP adopted on April 1, 2009, these losses were not recorded in our consolidated statement of income, but were recognized as a component of other comprehensive income, net of related taxes, in our consolidated balance sheet; refer to the following discussion and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. 49 Table of Contents Management regularly reviews the investment securities portfolio to identify other than temporary impairment of individual securities. Pursuant to the provisions of new GAAP, which we adopted on April 1, 2009, impairment related to expected losses represents the difference between the discounted values of the expected future cash flows from the securities compared to their current amortized cost basis, with each discount rate commensurate with the effective yield on the underlying security. For debt securities held to maturity, other than temporary impairment remaining after credit related impairment (which credit related impairment is recorded in our consolidated statement of income) is recognized, net of taxes, as a component of other comprehensive income in the shareholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheet, and is accreted prospectively over the remaining terms of the securities based on the timing of their estimated future cash flows. For other than temporary impairment of debt securities that results from managements decision to sell the security prior to its recovery in value, the entire difference between the securitys fair value and its amortized cost basis is recorded in our consolidated statement of income. Prior to our adoption of new GAAP on April 1, 2009, we recognized losses from other than temporary impairment of debt and equity securities for either a change in managements intent to hold the securities or expected credit losses, and such impairment losses, which reflected the entire difference between the fair value and amortized cost basis of each individual security, were recorded in our consolidated statement of income. Additional information about investment securities, the gross gains and losses that compose the net sale gains and our process to identify other than temporary impairment, is provided in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES We recorded provisions for loan losses of $25 million in 2010 and $149 million in 2009. The substantial majority of the provisions recorded in both years resulted from changes in expectations with respect to future cash flows from certain of the commercial real estate loans acquired in 2008 in connection with indemnified repurchase agreements with an affiliate of Lehman as a result of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. The commercial real estate loans are reviewed on a quarterly basis, and any provisions for loan losses that are recorded reflect managements current expectations with respect to future cash flows from these loans, based on an assessment of economic conditions in the commercial real estate market and other factors. Future changes in expectations with respect to these loans could result in additional provisions for loan losses. 50 Table of Contents EXPENSES Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2009 2010 (Dollars in millions) Salaries and employee benefits $ 3,524 $ 3,037 $ 3,842 16 % Information systems and communications 713 656 633 9 Transaction processing services 653 583 644 12 Occupancy 463 475 465 (3 ) Securities lending charge 414 Provision for legal exposure 250 Provision for investment account infusion 450 Restructuring charges 156 306 Merger and integration costs 89 49 115 82 Other: Professional services 277 264 360 5 Amortization of other intangible assets 179 136 144 32 Provision for indemnification exposure 200 Securities processing 63 114 187 (45 ) Regulator fees and assessments 45 71 45 (37 ) Other 266 331 460 (20 ) Total other 830 916 1,396 (9 ) Total expenses $ 6,842 $ 5,966 $ 7,851 15 Number of employees at year end 28,670 27,310 28,475 The increase in salaries and employee benefits expenses for 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to the effect of our reinstatement of cash incentive compensation accruals, as we did not accrue such incentive compensation during the first half of 2009 as part of our plan to increase our tangible common equity; the addition of the employees and associated expenses of the acquired Intesa and MIFA businesses subsequent to their respective acquisition dates; and higher benefits requirements for payroll taxes, medical insurance and pensions. The increase in information systems and communications expenses for 2010 compared to 2009 reflected higher levels of spending on telecommunications hardware and software for our global infrastructure, as well as the addition of expenses from the acquired Intesa and MIFA businesses subsequent to their respective acquisition dates. Transaction processing services expenses, which are volume related and include equity trading services and fees related to securities settlement, sub custodian services and external contract services, increased due to higher levels of sub custody expenses and higher external contract services costs related to increases in transaction volumes. On June 30, 2010, we recorded an aggregate pre tax charge of $414 million, which included $9 million of associated legal costs. The charge provided for a one time cash contribution of $330 million to the cash collateral pools and liquidity trusts underlying the SSgA lending funds, which reflected the cost to us to restore the net asset value per unit of such collateral pools to $1.00 as of June 30, 2010. As a result of this contribution, SSgA removed the redemption restrictions from these SSgA lending funds in August 2010. We also established a $75 million reserve to address potential inconsistencies in connection with our implementation of redemption restrictions applicable to the collateral pools underlying our agency lending program. Our decision with respect to the one time cash contribution was based on many factors, including our assessment with respect to previously disclosed asserted and unasserted claims and our evaluation of the ultimate resolution of such claims, as well as the effect of the redemption restrictions originally imposed by SSgA on the lending funds. The contribution was not the result of any obligation by State Street to support the SSgA lending funds or the underlying collateral pools. State Street has no obligation to provide cash or other support to the SSgA lending funds or the collateral pools underlying the SSgA lending funds at any future date, and has no intention to provide any such support associated with realized or unrealized losses in the collateral pools that may arise in the future. 51 Table of Contents The $75 million reserve was based on the results of a review of our implementation of the redemption restrictions with respect to participants in the agency lending collateral pools, and our assessment of the amount required to compensate clients for the dilutive effect of redemptions which may not have been consistent with the intent of the policy. In November 2010, we announced a global multi year program designed to enhance service excellence and innovation, deliver increased efficiencies in our operating model and position us for accelerated growth. The program includes operational and information technology enhancements and targeted cost initiatives, including planned reductions in staff and a plan to reduce our occupancy costs. To implement this program, we expect to recognize aggregate restructuring charges of approximately $400 million to $450 million over four years, beginning with the fourth quarter of 2010. In connection with the program, we recorded restructuring charges of $156 million during the fourth quarter of 2010, and initiated a reduction of 1,400 employees, or approximately 5% of our global workforce, which we plan to have substantially completed by the end of 2011. The fourth quarter charges also included costs related to actions taken to reduce our occupancy costs through real estate consolidation. Excluding related restructuring charges, we expect that the program will result in an annualized reduction of our expenses from operations of between approximately $575 million and $625 million by the end of 2014. Additional information with respect to the charges, and activity during 2010 in the related balance sheet reserve, is provided in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. During 2010, we recorded merger and integration costs of $89 million, with $57 million related to Intesa and MIFA. These costs consisted only of certain transaction related costs and direct incremental costs to integrate the acquired businesses into our operations, and did not include ongoing expenses of the combined organization. Additional information about these costs is provided in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. The decrease in aggregate other expenses (professional services, amortization of other intangible assets, securities processing, regulator fees and assessments, and other) for 2010 compared to 2009 resulted primarily from the impact of an adverse judgment of $60 million rendered by a Netherlands court in 2009, the impact of $115 million of insurance recoveries received in 2010 and lower levels of FDIC assessments. This overall decrease was offset slightly by a higher level of other intangible assets amortization associated with the Intesa and MIFA acquisitions. The $115 million of insurance recoveries that reduced other expenses for 2010 was received with respect to settlement payments made by us to clients in prior periods in connection with certain active fixed income strategies managed by SSgA prior to August 2007. We account for insurance recoveries as gains in accordance with GAAP, and therefore do not record the gains until the cash is received. Income Taxes We recorded income tax expense of $530 million for 2010, compared to income tax expense before extraordinary loss of $722 million for 2009. Our effective tax rate for 2010 was 25.4% compared to 28.6% for 2009. The difference in the tax rates was primarily attributable to the restructuring of former non U.S. conduit assets in the second quarter of 2010, the partial write off of a deferred tax asset associated with certain of the investment securities sold in connection with the portfolio repositioning completed in the fourth quarter of 2010, and the absence of the impact of the non deductible portion of the SSgA related legal reserve established in 2009. Information about income tax contingencies related to our SILO lease transactions is provided in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. LINE OF BUSINESS INFORMATION We have two lines of business: Investment Servicing and Investment Management. Given our services and management organization, the results of operations for these lines of business are not necessarily comparable with those of other companies, including companies in the financial services industry. Information about our two lines of business, as well as the revenues, expenses and capital allocation methodologies with respect to these lines of business, is provided in note 24 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. 52 Table of Contents The following is a summary of our line of business results. The amounts in the Divestitures columns represent the operating results of our joint venture interest in CitiStreet prior to our sale of that interest in July 2008. The amounts presented in the Other column for 2010 represent the net loss from sales of investment securities associated with our repositioning of the portfolio, the restructuring charges associated with our global multi year program, and merger and integration costs associated with acquisitions. The amounts presented in the Other column for 2009 represent net interest revenue earned in connection with our participation in the Federal Reserves AMLF and merger and integration costs recorded in connection with our July 2007 acquisition of Investors Financial. The amounts in the Other column for 2008 represent the net interest revenue associated with our participation in the AMLF; the gain on the sale of our joint venture interest in CitiStreet; the restructuring charges recorded in that year primarily in connection with our plan to reduce our expenses from operations; the provision related to our estimated net exposure for client indemnification associated with collateralized repurchase agreements; and merger and integration costs recorded in connection with the Investors Financial acquisition. The amounts in the Divestitures and Other columns were not allocated to State Streets business lines.

The increases in total fee revenue generally related to servicing fees and processing fees and other revenue, partly offset by a decline in securities finance revenue. Servicing fees increased primarily as a result of the impact on current period revenue of new business awarded to us and installed during 2010 and prior periods, the addition of revenue from the acquired Intesa and MIFA businesses and increases in daily average equity market valuations. Processing fees and other revenue increased primarily as a result of higher net revenue from structured products, including fees from our tax exempt investment program, and higher net revenue related to certain tax advantaged investments. Trading services revenue was essentially flat compared to 2009, as higher brokerage and other fees attributable to higher levels of electronic trading volumes were offset by lower revenue from foreign exchange trades, caused primarily by lower spreads, and declines in volatility, partly offset by higher client volumes. Securities finance revenue declined primarily as a result of compression of credit spreads and slightly lower volumes of assets on loan associated with continued low levels of client demand. Servicing fees, trading services revenue and gains (losses) related to investment securities, net, for our Investment Servicing business line are identical to the respective consolidated results. Refer to the Servicing Fees, Trading Services and Gains (Losses) Related to Investment Securities, Net sections under Total Revenue in this Managements Discussion and Analysis for a more in depth discussion. A discussion of processing fees and other revenue is provided in the Processing Fees and Other section under Total Revenue. Net interest revenue increased 6% compared to 2009, primarily as a result of higher levels of investment securities associated with our re investment strategy and the impact of the Intesa deposits added in May 2010 in connection with that acquisition. A portion of net interest revenue is recorded in the Investment Management business line based on the volume of client liabilities attributable to that business. Total expenses increased 12% from 2009, primarily because of the absence of cash incentive compensation accruals during the first six months of 2009, as we did not accrue such compensation as part of our plan to increase our tangible common equity, and the addition of expenses from the acquired Intesa and MIFA businesses. Investment Management Total revenue for 2010 decreased 4% compared to 2009, generally reflective of the impact of decreases in total fee revenue, as increases in management fees and processing and other revenue were more than offset by a decline in securities finance revenue. The 8% increase in management fees, generated by SSgA, resulted from the impact of increases in average month end equity market valuations and, to a lesser extent, the impact on current period revenue of new business won and installed in prior periods. Securities finance revenue declined 71% because of lower spreads across all lending programs, reduced utilization of lendable assets in the SSgA lending funds and the transition of assets by clients from lending to non lending products. Management fees for the Investment Management business line are identical to the respective consolidated results. Refer to the Management Fees section under Total Revenue in this Managements Discussion and Analysis for a more in depth discussion. Total expenses increased 10% from 2009, primarily the result of the securities lending charge, discussed below, partly offset by the absence of the 2009 provision for legal exposure related to SSgA managed fixed income strategies. Beginning in 2007, the market value per unit of the assets held in certain of the collateral pools underlying the SSgA lending funds fell below $1.00. However, we continued to transact purchases into and redemptions out of these pools at $1.00 per unit and imposed restrictions on redemptions from the SSgA lending funds. We continued to transact purchase and redemptions at $1.00 per unit for a number of reasons, including that none of the securities in the collateral pools was then in default or considered to be materially impaired, and that withdrawals from the collateral pools were restricted, which, absent a substantial reduction in the lending program, should permit the securities in the collateral pools to be held until they recover to their par value. 54 Table of Contents In June 2010, to seek a resolution of these issues, we made a one time cash contribution of $330 million to the collateral pools and liquidity trusts underlying the SSgA lending funds, eliminating the difference between the market value and amortized cost of the assets held by such vehicles as of June 30, 2010. Consequently, in August 2010, SSgA removed the redemption restrictions from the SSgA lending funds. In the period subsequent to the elimination of the redemption restrictions, some clients that invested in SSgA lending funds transitioned their assets to other SSgA products that did not engage in securities lending, or, to a lesser degree, other investment managers. As a result of the elimination of the redemption restrictions and reduced utilization of lendable assets in the SSgA lending funds, the aggregate net assets of the collateral pools underlying the SSgA lending funds declined to approximately $8 billion as of December 31, 2010 from approximately $24 billion as of December 31, 2009. Our decision with respect to the cash contribution was based on many factors, including our assessment relative to previously disclosed asserted and unasserted claims and our evaluation of the ultimate resolution of such claims, as well as the effect of the redemption restrictions originally imposed by SSgA on the lending funds. The contribution was not the result of any obligation by State Street to support the SSgA lending funds or the underlying collateral pools. State Street has no obligation to provide cash or other support to the SSgA lending fund or the collateral pools underlying the SSgA lending funds at any future date, and has no intention to provide any such support associated with realized or unrealized losses in the collateral pools that may arise in the future.

Total revenue also reflected the absence of the $350 million gain from the sale of our joint venture interest in CitiStreet in 2008. The 12% decrease in servicing fees was the result of the impact of declines in daily average equity market valuations, partly offset by the impact of new business won and installed in prior periods on current period revenue. Approximately 37% of our servicing fees were generated outside the U.S. in 2009, compared with 41% in 2008. Assets under custody and administration were $18.79 trillion, compared to $15.91 trillion in 2008, with the increase from 2008 primarily the result of increases in equity market valuations and a higher level of new business. Management fees declined 21% from 2008 to 2009, primarily from the impact of declines in average month end equity market valuations and the impact of client investment of a higher percentage of assets in lower rate passive strategies, partly offset by the impact of new business on current period revenue. Approximately 33% of our management fees were generated outside the U.S. in 2009, down from 40% in 2008. Assets under management increased to $1.95 trillion at December 31, 2009, up $485 billion from $1.47 trillion a year earlier. Trading services revenue declined 25% primarily as a result of a decline in client volumes and currency volatility, partly offset by an increase in brokerage and other trading fees from growth in fixed income transition management and equity trading, as well as an increase in electronic trading revenues attributable to higher volumes. Securities finance revenue was down 54% as a result of compression of spreads and lower lending volumes. Processing fees and other revenue declined 38% due to lower product related revenue from deposit services and structured products, the latter specifically our tax exempt investment and conduit commercial paper programs. Net interest revenue decreased primarily due to the impact of lower average levels of client deposits and lower deposit interest rate spreads, largely offset by discount accretion recorded in connection with the former conduit assets added to our balance sheet in May 2009. We recorded net gains of $368 million from sales of available for sale securities and losses from other than temporary impairment related to credit of $227 million for 2009, compared to net sale gains of $68 million and losses from other than temporary impairment related to credit of $122 million for 2008. The aggregate 56 Table of Contents unrealized loss on securities for which other than temporary impairment was recorded in 2009 was $1.15 billion, of which $928 million related to factors other than credit, and was recognized, net of taxes, as a component of other comprehensive income in our consolidated statement of condition. As a result, net gains related to investment securities for 2009 totaled $141 million, compared to net losses of $54 million for 2008. For 2009, the $227 million of impairment losses was composed of $151 million associated with expected credit losses, $54 million related to managements decision to sell the impaired securities prior to their recovery in value, and $22 million associated with adverse changes in the timing of expected future cash flows from the securities. The majority of the impairment losses related to non agency mortgage backed securities which management concluded had experienced credit losses. The aforementioned accounting for other than temporary impairment was adopted by us, pursuant to new GAAP, effective April 1, 2009. Prior to that date, we recognized losses from other than temporary impairment of debt and equity securities for either a change in managements intent to hold the securities or expected credit losses, and such impairment losses, which reflected the entire difference between the fair value and amortized cost basis of each individual security, were recorded in our consolidated statement of income. PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES We recorded an aggregate provision for loan losses of $149 million during 2009. Of the total provision, $124 million resulted from changes in management expectations with respect to future principal and interest cash flows from certain of the commercial real estate loans acquired in 2008 pursuant to indemnified repurchase agreements with an affiliate of Lehman as a result of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. The changes in management expectations were primarily based on its assessment of the impact of the deteriorating economic conditions in the commercial real estate markets on certain of these loans during 2009. EXPENSES Years ended December 31, 2009 2008 % Change (Dollars in millions) Salaries and employee benefits $ 3,037 $ 3,842 (21 )% Information systems and communications 656 633 4 Transaction processing services 583 644 (9 ) Occupancy 475 465 2 Provision for legal exposure 250 Provision for investment account infusion 450 Restructuring charges 306 Merger and integration costs 49 115 (57 ) Professional services 264 360 (27 ) Amortization of other intangible assets 136 144 (6 ) Provision for indemnification exposure 200 Other 516 692 (25 ) Total expenses $ 5,966 $ 7,851 (24 ) Number of employees at year end 27,310 28,475 The decrease in salaries and employee benefits for 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to the effect of our reduction in force, announced in December 2008 and substantially completed in the first quarter of 2009, as well as lower accruals for cash incentive compensation in 2009 in connection with our plan to increase our tangible common equity and lower contract services spending. Information systems and communications expense increased due to higher levels of spending on telecommunications hardware and software. Transaction processing services expenses decreased due to lower volumes in the investment servicing business and lower costs related to external contract services. 57 Table of Contents The provision for legal exposure of $250 million resulted from an increase in the reserve initially established in 2007 associated with certain active fixed income strategies managed by SSgA. We settled regulatory inquiries related to this exposure in February 2010. During 2008, we elected to provide support to certain investment accounts managed by SSgA through the purchase of asset and mortgage backed securities and a cash infusion, which resulted in an income statement provision of $450 million. In addition, as referenced above, we announced a reduction in force and related actions designed to reduce our operating costs, and recorded aggregate restructuring charges of $306 million. In 2009, in connection with the Investors Financial acquisition, we recorded merger and integration costs of $49 million, compared to $115 million for 2008. These costs consisted only of certain transaction related costs and direct incremental costs to integrate the acquired Investors Financial business into our operations, primarily related to employee retention and system and client integration, and did not include ongoing expenses of the combined organization. During the second half of 2008, Lehman Brothers and certain of its affiliates filed for bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings. While we had no unsecured financial exposure to Lehman or its affiliates, we indemnified certain clients in connection with collateralized repurchase agreements with Lehman entities. In the then current market environment, the market value of the underlying collateral had declined, and to the extent that these declines resulted in aggregate collateral value falling below the aggregate indemnification obligation, we recorded a balance sheet reserve, and a corresponding provision, of $200 million in our 2008 consolidated statement of income to provide for our estimated net exposure. The reserve was based on the cost of satisfying the indemnification obligation net of the fair value of the collateral, which we acquired subsequent to the Lehman proceedings. The collateral, composed of commercial real estate loans, was recorded in loans and leases in our consolidated statement of condition. The decrease in aggregate other expenses (professional services, amortization of other intangible assets and other costs) for 2009 compared to 2008 resulted primarily from a 39% decrease in securities processing costs due to lower processing volume and a 27% decrease in professional services spending, primarily legal and consulting costs. This overall decrease was offset slightly by higher regulatory assessments associated with the increased cost of deposit insurance. Income Taxes The decrease in income tax expense for 2009 compared to 2008 resulted from an increase in the proportion of earnings from certain of our non U.S. subsidiaries, where managements intention is to reinvest those earnings indefinitely overseas, consistent with our business strategy to pursue growth in non U.S. markets. This strategy allowed us to reduce taxes accrued with respect to 2009 earnings, as well as certain taxes accrued in prior periods. The overall effective tax rate for 2009 was 28.6% compared to 36.2% for 2008. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, and we apply accounting policies that affect the determination of amounts reported in these financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. The majority of the accounting policies described in note 1 do not involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates in their application, or the variability of the estimates is not material to our consolidated financial statements. However, certain of these accounting policies, by their nature, require management to make judgments, involving significant estimates and assumptions, about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements, and changes in this information over time could materially affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses reported in subsequent financial statements. Based on the sensitivity of reported financial statement amounts to the underlying estimates and assumptions, the relatively more significant accounting policies applied by State Street have been identified by management as those associated with fair value measurements; interest revenue recognition and other than 58 Table of Contents temporary impairment; and goodwill and other intangible assets. These accounting policies require the most subjective or complex judgments, and underlying estimates and assumptions could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. An understanding of the judgments, estimates and assumptions underlying these accounting policies is essential in order to understand our reported consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The following is a brief discussion of the above mentioned significant accounting policies. Management of State Street has discussed these significant accounting estimates with the Examining & Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Fair Value Measurements We carry certain of our financial assets and liabilities at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, including trading account assets, investment securities available for sale and various types of derivative instruments. As discussed in further detail below, changes in the fair value of these financial assets and liabilities are recorded either as components of our consolidated statement of income, or as components of other comprehensive income within shareholders equity in our consolidated statement of condition. In addition to those financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, we estimate the fair values of other financial assets and liabilities that we carry at amortized cost in our consolidated statement of condition, and we disclose these fair value estimates in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. We estimate the fair values of these financial assets and liabilities using the definition of fair value described below. At December 31, 2010, approximately $87.78 billion of our financial assets and approximately $6.58 billion of our financial liabilities were carried at fair value on a recurring basis, compared to $77.36 billion and $4.77 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2009. The amounts at December 31, 2010 represented approximately 55% of our consolidated total assets and approximately 5% of our consolidated total liabilities, compared to 49% and 3%, respectively, at December 31, 2009. The increase in the relative percentage of consolidated total assets at December 31, 2010 resulted primarily from purchases of mortgage backed and other debt securities as part of our continued re investment strategy, partly offset by the net impact of the December 2010 investment portfolio repositioning. The increase in the relative percentage of consolidated total liabilities as of December 31, 2010 generally resulted from higher levels of derivatives related to our foreign exchange activities. Additional information with respect to the assets and liabilities carried by us at fair value on a recurring basis is provided in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. GAAP defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. When we measure fair value for our financial assets and liabilities, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. When possible, we look to active and observable markets to measure the fair value of identical, or similar, financial assets or liabilities. When identical financial assets and liabilities are not traded in active markets, we look to market observable data for similar assets and liabilities. In some instances, certain assets and liabilities are not actively traded in observable markets, and as a result we use alternate valuation techniques to measure their fair value. In accordance with GAAP, we categorize the financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value in our consolidated statement of condition on a recurring basis based upon a prescribed three level valuation hierarchy. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1) and the lowest priority to valuation methods using significant unobservable inputs (level 3). At December 31, 2010, we categorized approximately 8% of our financial assets carried at fair value in level 1, 85% in level 2 and 7% in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, including the effect of master netting agreements. At December 31, 2010, we categorized approximately 11% of our financial liabilities carried at fair value in level 1, 85% in level 2 and the remaining 4% in level 3, including the effect of master netting agreements. 59 Table of Contents The investment securities categorized in level 1 were substantially composed of U.S. Treasury securities, specifically Treasury bills, which have a maturity of one year or less. Fair value was measured by management using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical securities. The fair value of the investment securities categorized in level 2 was measured by management primarily using information obtained from independent third parties. Information obtained from third parties is subject to review by management as part of a validation process. Management utilizes a process to review the information provided, including an understanding of underlying assumptions and the level of market participant information used to support those assumptions. In addition, management compares significant assumptions used by third parties to available market information. Such information may include known trades or, to the extent that trading activity is limited in comparisons to market research information pertaining to credit expectations, execution prices and the timing of cash flows. Derivative instruments categorized in level 2 predominantly represented foreign exchange and interest rate contracts used in our trading activities, for which fair value was measured by management using discounted cash flow techniques with inputs consisting of observable spot and forward points, as well as observable interest rate curves. While the majority of our financial assets categorized in level 3 were composed of asset backed and other debt securities available for sale, level 3 also included certain foreign exchange derivatives. The aggregate fair value of our financial assets and liabilities categorized in level 3 as of December 31, 2010, compared to December 31, 2009, decreased approximately 22%, primarily composed of transfers of asset backed securities, principally those collateralized by credit cards and student loans, and other debt securities to level 2, as fair value was measured using prices for which observable market information became available. With respect to derivative instruments, we evaluated the impact on valuation of the credit risk of our counterparties and our own credit. We considered factors such as the likelihood of default by us and our counterparties, our current and potential future net exposures and remaining maturities in determining the appropriate measurements of fair value. Valuation adjustments associated with these factors were not significant for 2010, 2009 or 2008. Interest Revenue Recognition and Other Than Temporary Impairment A significant portion of the assets carried in our consolidated balance sheet is our portfolio of fixed income investment securities. As discussed below, the estimation of future cash flows from these securities is a significant factor in the recognition of both interest revenue and other than temporary impairment with respect to these securities. Expectations of defaults and prepayments are the most significant assumptions underlying our estimates of future cash flows. In determining these estimates, management relies on relevant and reliable information, including but not limited to deal structure, including optional and mandatory calls, market interest rate curves, industry standard asset class specific prepayment models, recent prepayment history, independent credit ratings, and recent actual and projected credit losses. Management considers this information based on its relevance and uses its best judgment in order to determine its assumptions for underlying cash flow expectations and resulting estimates. Management reviews its underlying assumptions and develops expected future cash flow estimates at least quarterly. Additional detail with respect to the sensitivity of these default and prepayment assumptions is provided in the Financial Condition Investment Securities section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. Interest Revenue Recognition Our investment portfolio, excluding the former conduit assets consolidated in 2009, consists of securities which were not typically acquired at significant discounts or premiums to their face amounts. In connection with the conduit consolidation, we recorded certain of the conduits investment securities at a significant discount to their face amount. To the extent that future cash flows from these securities are expected to exceed their recorded carrying amounts, the portion of the discount not related to credit will be accreted into interest revenue in our 60 Table of Contents consolidated statement of income over the securities remaining terms. As a result of the magnitude of the discount, the estimates associated with the timing and amount of the accretion of these security discounts into interest revenue are significant to our consolidated financial statements. A portion of the former conduit securities, primarily asset backed securities, had expected credit losses on the date of consolidation, or were considered to be certain beneficial interests in a securitization that were not of high credit quality, and therefore we account for these securities in accordance with specialized GAAP. As a result, interest revenue recognition for these securities differs from the accounting for the remainder of our portfolio. The accounting for these securities requires an estimation of the timing and amount of each of the securities expected future principal, interest and other contractual cash flows, and the calculation of an effective yield based upon these estimates is used to record interest revenue. Generally, the timing and amount of these securities future cash flows are inherently uncertain, due to unknown timing and amount of principal payments (including potential credit losses) and the variability of future interest rates. Since the conduits were consolidated, we have recorded aggregate discount accretion in interest revenue in our consolidated statement of income of $1.33 billion, composed of $712 million in 2010 and $621 million in 2009. We expect to record significantly less accretion in the future as a result of the repositioning of our investment portfolio completed during the fourth quarter of 2010, as described under Consolidated Results of Operations Total Revenue Net Interest Revenue in this Managements Discussion and Analysis. Other Than Temporary Impairment GAAP also requires the use of cash flow estimates to evaluate other than temporary impairment of our investment securities. The amount and timing of expected future cash flows are significant estimates in the determination of other than temporary impairment. Additional information with respect to managements assessment of other than temporary impairment is provided in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill is created when the purchase price exceeds the assigned value of the net assets of acquired businesses, and represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements being acquired. Other acquired identifiable intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair value. Goodwill is not amortized. Other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, and both goodwill and other intangible assets are subject to an impairment adjustment if events or circumstances indicate the potential inability to realize the carrying amount. As required by GAAP, we evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances dictate. Substantially all of the goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in our consolidated statement of condition have resulted from business acquisitions of our Investment Servicing line of business, with the remainder associated with our Investment Management line of business. The sustained value of the majority of goodwill is supported ultimately by revenue from our investment servicing business. A decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth, or our inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods, could lead to a perceived impairment of goodwill, which would be evaluated and, if necessary, be recorded as a write down of the reported amount of goodwill through a charge to earnings in our consolidated statement of income. On an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances dictate, management reviews goodwill and evaluates events or other developments that may indicate impairment of the carrying amount. We perform this evaluation at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our two major business lines. The evaluation methodology for potential impairment is inherently complex and involves significant management judgment in the use of estimates and assumptions. We evaluate goodwill for impairment using a two step process. First, we compare the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, no impairment exists. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, then we compare the 61 Table of Contents implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, then goodwill impairment is recognized by writing the goodwill down to the implied fair value. The implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, as if the unit had been acquired in a business combination and the overall fair value of the unit was the purchase price. To determine the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit being evaluated for goodwill impairment, we use one of two principal methodologies a market approach, based on a comparison of the reporting unit to publicly traded companies in similar lines of business; or an income approach, based on the value of the cash flows that the business can be expected to generate in the future. Events that may indicate impairment include significant or adverse changes in the business, economic or political climate; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; unanticipated competition; and a more likely than not expectation that we will sell or otherwise dispose of a business to which the goodwill or other intangible assets relate. Additional information about goodwill and other intangible assets, including information by line of business, is provided in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. Our evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment in 2010 indicated that $6 million of other intangible assets was impaired, which impairment was recorded in our 2010 consolidated statement of income. No impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets was recorded in 2009. In 2008, we recorded $27 million of impairment of other intangible assets in our consolidated statement of income, $23 million of which was recorded as a component of the $306 million of restructuring charges. Goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in our consolidated statement of condition at December 31, 2010 totaled approximately $5.60 billion and $2.59 billion, respectively, compared to $4.55 billion and $1.81 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2009. The increase in both amounts substantially resulted from our acquisitions of Intesa and MIFA. 62 Table of Contents FINANCIAL CONDITION Years ended December 31, 2010AverageBalance 2009AverageBalance (In millions) Assets: Interest bearing deposits with banks $ 13,550 $ 24,162 Securities purchased under resale agreements 2,957 3,701 Federal funds sold 68 Trading account assets 376 1,914 Investment securities 96,123 81,190 Investment securities purchased under AMLF(1) 882 Loans and leases 12,094 9,703 Other interest earning assets 1,156 1,303 Total interest earning assets 126,256 122,923 Cash and due from banks 2,781 2,237 Other assets 22,920 21,650 Total assets $ 151,957 $ 146,810 Liabilities and shareholders equity: Interest bearing deposits: U.S. $ 8,632 $ 7,616 Non U.S. 68,326 61,551 Total interest bearing deposits 76,958 69,167 Securities sold under repurchase agreements 8,108 11,065 Federal funds purchased 1,759 956 Short term borrowings under AMLF(1) 877 Other short term borrowings 13,590 16,847 Long term debt 8,681 7,917 Other interest bearing liabilities 940 1,131 Total interest bearing liabilities 110,036 107,960 Non interest bearing deposits 13,879 15,443 Other liabilities 11,682 10,090 Shareholders equity 16,360 13,317 Total liabilities and shareholders equity $ 151,957 $ 146,810 (1) Amounts represent averages of asset backed commercial paper purchases and associated borrowings in connection with our participation in the AMLF.

Overview of Consolidated Statement of Condition The structure of our consolidated statement of condition, or balance sheet, is primarily driven by the liabilities generated by our core Investment Servicing and Investment Management businesses. As our clients execute their worldwide cash management and investment activities, they use short term investments and deposits that constitute the majority of our liabilities. These liabilities are generally in the form of non interest bearing demand deposits; interest bearing transaction account deposits, which are denominated in a variety of currencies; and repurchase agreements, which generally serve as short term investment alternatives for our clients. Our clients needs and our operating objectives determine the volume, mix and currency denomination of our consolidated balance sheet. Deposits and other liabilities generated by client activities are invested in assets that generally match the liquidity and interest rate characteristics of the liabilities. As a result, our assets consist primarily of securities held in our available for sale or held to maturity portfolios and short term money market 63 Table of Contents instruments, such as interest bearing deposits and securities purchased under resale agreements. As our non U.S. business activities continue to grow, we have expanded our capabilities and processes to enable us to manage the liabilities generated by our core businesses and the related assets in which these liabilities are invested, in a manner that more closely aligns our businesses and related activities with the cash management, investment activities and other operations of our clients. As a result, the structure of our balance sheet continues to evolve to reflect these efforts. The actual mix of assets is determined by the characteristics of the client liabilities and our desire to maintain a well diversified portfolio of high quality assets. Managing our consolidated balance sheet structure is conducted within specific Board approved policies for interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity. Additional information about our average balance sheet, primarily our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, is included in the Consolidated Results of Operations Total Revenue Net Interest Revenue section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. Investment Securities The carrying values of investment securities by type were as follows as of December 31: (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 Available for sale: U.S. Treasury and federal agencies: Direct obligations $ 7,577 $ 11,162 $ 11,579 Mortgage backed securities 23,640 14,936 10,798 Asset backed securities: Student loans(1) 14,416 11,928 7,860 Credit cards 7,451 6,607 3,090 Sub prime 1,818 3,197 3,859 Other 1,588 2,797 1,464 Total asset backed 25,273 24,529 16,273 Non U.S. debt securities 13,045 10,311 5,714 State and political subdivisions 6,604 5,937 5,712 Collateralized mortgage obligations 1,861 2,409 1,441 Other debt securities 2,640 2,234 2,160 U.S. equity securities 1,115 1,098 314 Non U.S. equity securities 126 83 172 Total $ 81,881 $ 72,699 $ 54,163 Held to maturity purchased under AMLF: Asset backed commercial paper $ $ $ 6,087 Held to maturity: U.S. Treasury and federal agencies: Direct obligations $ 500 $ 501 Mortgage backed securities $ 413 620 810 Asset backed securities: Credit cards 20 Other 64 447 321 Total asset backed 64 467 321 Non U.S. debt securities 7,186 10,822 3,774 State and political subdivisions 134 206 382 Collateralized mortgage obligations 4,452 8,262 9,979 Total $ 12,249 $ 20,877 $ 15,767 (1) Substantially composed of securities guaranteed by the federal government with respect to the payment of principal and interest. 64 Table of Contents Additional detail about our investment securities is provided in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. We manage our investment securities portfolio to align with the interest rate and duration characteristics of our client liabilities and in the context of our overall balance sheet structure, which is maintained within internally approved risk limits, and in consideration of the global interest rate environment. We consider a well diversified, high credit quality investment securities portfolio to be an important element in the management of our consolidated balance sheet. The portfolio is concentrated in securities with high credit quality, with approximately 90% of the carrying value of the portfolio rated AAA or AA as of December 31, 2010. The percentages of the carrying value of the investment securities portfolio, by external credit rating, were as follows as of December 31: 2010 2009 AAA(1) 79 % 69 % AA 11 11 A 6 7 BBB 2 4 Below BBB 2 8 Non rated 1 100 % 100 % (1) Includes U.S. Treasury securities. The investment portfolio of approximately 9,880 securities is also diversified with respect to asset class. Approximately 76% of the aggregate carrying value of the portfolio is composed of mortgage backed and asset backed securities. The largely floating rate asset backed portfolio consists primarily of credit card and student loan backed securities. Mortgage backed securities are split between securities of Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and U.S. and non U.S. large issuer collateralized mortgage obligations. Approximately 21% of the aggregate carrying amount of the portfolio is composed of non U.S. debt securities. The following table summarizes our aggregate non U.S. debt securities, included in the preceding table of investment securities carrying values, by significant country of issuer or collateral, as of December 31, 2010: (In millions) United Kingdom $ 7,511 Australia 6,355 Netherlands 2,320 Cayman Islands 981 Germany 920 Spain 530 Other 1,614 Total non U.S. debt securities $ 20,231 Approximately 86% of the aggregate carrying value of these securities was rated AAA and AA as of December 31, 2010. As of that date, the securities had an aggregate pre tax unrealized loss of approximately $156 million and an average market to book ratio of 99.2%. The majority is floating rate securities, and accordingly the aggregate holdings have minimal interest rate risk. The underlying collateral includes U.K. prime mortgages, Netherlands mortgages and German automobiles, sectors which have an outstanding history of credit performance. 65 Table of Contents The carrying amounts, by contractual maturity, of debt securities available for sale and held to maturity, and the related weighted average contractual yields, were as follows as of December 31, 2010: Under 1 Year 1 to 5 Years 6 to 10 Years Over 10 Years (Dollars in millions) Amount Yield Amount Yield Amount Yield Amount Yield Available for sale(1) : U.S. Treasury and federal agencies: Direct obligations $ 166 1.11 % $ 5,367 1.87 % $ 1,525 3.16 % $ 519 3.12 % Mortgage backed securities 8 3.97 1,074 3.73 10,425 3.49 12,133 3.37 Asset backed securities: Student loans(2) 166 0.52 3,242 0.53 7,476 0.61 3,532 0.67 Credit cards 633 0.67 5,510 0.74 1,308 0.62 Sub prime 670 0.68 856 0.70 20 1.81 272 1.12 Other 94 0.79 843 2.84 386 0.61 265 0.59 Total asset backed 1,563 10,451 9,190 4,069 Non U.S. debt securities 3,166 2.14 3,863 2.07 1,442 1.88 4,574 2.06 State and political subdivisions(3) 410 5.74 2,521 6.55 2,684 5.96 989 5.63 Collateralized mortgage obligations 77 5.55 1,022 4.55 271 4.49 491 4.55 Other U.S. debt securities 230 5.86 1,690 4.60 681 5.55 39 0.84 Total $ 5,620 $ 25,988 $ 26,218 $ 22,814 Held to maturity(1) : U.S. Treasury and federal agencies: Mortgage backed securities $ 7 3.75 % $ 46 4.76 % $ 154 4.95 % $ 206 5.47 % Asset backed securities: Other 7 0.48 57 0.93 Total asset backed 7 57 Non U.S. debt securities 614 0.42 2,138 1.23 318 4.86 4,116 3.54 State and political subdivisions(2) 23 5.97 108 7.22 2 6.64 1 6.87 Collateralized mortgage obligations 299 5.19 2,104 3.96 647 3.99 1,402 3.16 Total $ 950 $ 4,396 $ 1,121 $ 5,782 (1) The maturities of mortgage backed securities, asset backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are based on expected principal payments.

(3) Yields have been calculated on a fully taxable equivalent basis, using applicable federal and state income tax rates. Impairment Net unrealized losses on securities available for sale were as follows as of December 31: (In millions) 2010 2009 Fair value $ 81,881 $ 72,699 Amortized cost 82,329 74,843 Net unrealized loss, pre tax $ (448 ) $ (2,144 ) Net unrealized loss, after tax $ (270 ) $ (1,316 ) The net unrealized loss amounts excluded the remaining net unrealized loss of $523 million, or $317 million after tax, and $1.01 billion, or $635 million after tax, respectively, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, 66 Table of Contents generally related to the 2008 reclassification of securities available for sale to securities held to maturity. These after tax amounts were recorded in other comprehensive income. The decline in the remaining after tax unrealized loss on transferred securities resulted primarily from amortization and from the recognition of losses from other than temporary impairment on certain of the securities. We conduct periodic reviews of individual securities to assess whether other than temporary impairment exists. To the extent that other than temporary impairment is identified, the impairment is broken into a credit component and a non credit component. The credit component is recognized in our consolidated statement of income, and the non credit component is recognized in other comprehensive income to the extent that management does not intend to sell the security (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8). Our assessment of other than temporary impairment involves an evaluation, more fully described in note 3, of economic and security specific factors. Such factors are based on estimates, derived by management, which contemplate current market conditions and security specific performance. To the extent that market conditions are worse than managements expectations, other than temporary impairment could increase, in particular the credit component that would be recorded in our consolidated statement of income. Given the exposure of our investment securities portfolio, particularly mortgage backed and asset backed securities, to residential mortgage and other consumer credit risks, the performance of the U.S. housing market is a significant driver of the portfolios credit performance. As such, our assessment of other than temporary impairment relies to a significant extent on our estimates of trends in national housing prices. Generally, indices that measure trends in national housing prices are published in arrears. As of December 31, 2009, national housing prices, according to the Case Shiller National Home Price Index, had declined by approximately 29% peak to current. Through September 30, 2010, there was a decline of approximately 1%, resulting in a peak to current decline of approximately 30%. Despite increased stabilization in housing prices, managements base assumption is that the year end 2010 information will indicate that peak to current housing prices will have declined by an additional 5% to 10%. In particular, the performance of certain mortgage products and vintages continues to deteriorate. In addition, management continues to believe that housing prices will decline further as indicated above. The combination of these factors has led to an increase in managements overall loss expectations. Our investment portfolio continues to be sensitive to managements estimates of defaults and prepayment speeds. Ultimately, other than temporary impairment is based on specific CUSIP level detailed analysis of the unique characteristics of each security. In addition, we perform sensitivity analysis across each significant product type within the non agency U.S. residential mortgage backed portfolio. For example, as it relates to our U.S. non agency prime and Alt A residential mortgage backed portfolios, if we were to increase default estimates to 110% of managements current expectations with a corresponding 10% slowdown of prepayment speeds to 90% of managements current expectations, we estimate that other than temporary impairment on these securities related to credit would increase by approximately $20 million to $40 million. This impairment would be recorded in our consolidated statement of income. As it relates to our U.S. sub prime asset backed portfolio, if we were to increase default estimates to 110% of managements current expectations with a corresponding 10% slowdown of prepayment speeds to 90% of managements current expectations, we estimate that other than temporary impairment on these securities related to credit would increase by approximately $5 million to $10 million. This impairment would be recorded in our consolidated statement of income. The sensitivity estimates discussed above are based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of housing prices and the timing of defaults. To the extent that such factors differ substantially from managements current expectations, resulting loss estimates may differ materially from those stated. Excluding the securities for which other than temporary impairment was recorded, management considers the aggregate decline in fair value of the remaining securities and the resulting net unrealized losses as of December 31, 2010 to be temporary and not the result of any material changes in the credit characteristics of the securities. Additional information about our assessment of impairment is provided in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. 67 Table of Contents Several major U.S. financial institutions are participating in a mortgage foreclosure moratorium with respect to residential mortgages. Generally, we have no direct exposure to this moratorium, since we do not originate, purchase or service residential mortgage loans. However, the rate at which existing residential mortgage foreclosure issues are resolved, as well as certain outcomes of the resolution of these issues, may affect, among other things, our investment securities portfolio. Such effects could include the timing of cash flows or the credit quality associated with the mortgages collateralizing certain of our residential mortgage backed securities, and, accordingly, could also affect the amount of other than temporary impairment that we recognize in future periods. Loans and Leases U.S. and non U.S. loans and leases, by segment, and aggregate average loans and leases, were as follows, as of and for the years ended December 31 (excluding the allowance for loan losses): (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 Institutional: U.S. $ 7,001 $ 6,637 $ 6,004 $ 9,798 $ 3,895 Non U.S. 4,192 3,571 2,327 6,004 5,051 Commercial real estate: U.S. 764 600 800 Total loans and leases $ 11,957 $ 10,808 $ 9,131 $ 15,802 $ 8,946 Average loans and leases $ 12,094 $ 9,703 $ 11,884 $ 10,753 $ 7,670 Additional detail about these loan and lease segments, including underlying classes, is provided in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. The institutional segment is composed of the following classes: investment funds, commercial and financial, purchased receivables and lease financing. Investment funds includes lending to mutual and other collective investment funds and short duration advances to fund clients to provide liquidity in support of their transaction flows associated with securities settlement activities. Aggregate short duration advances to our clients included in the institutional segment were $2.63 billion and $2.07 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Commercial and financial includes lending to corporate borrowers, including broker/dealers. Purchased receivables represents undivided interests in securitized pools of underlying third party receivables added in connection with the May 2009 conduit consolidation. Lease financing includes our investment in leveraged leases. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, unearned income included in lease financing was $168 million and $183 million, respectively, for U.S. leases and $667 million and $907 million, respectively, for non U.S. leases. The commercial real estate loans were acquired in 2008 pursuant to indemnified repurchase agreements with an affiliate of Lehman as a result of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. These loans, which are primarily collateralized by direct and indirect interests in commercial real estate, were recorded at their then current fair value, based on managements expectations with respect to future cash flows from the loans using appropriate market discount rates as of the date of acquisition. Certain of the loans are accounted for under the provisions of ASC Topic 310 30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality (formerly AICPA Statement of Position No. 03 3, Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer). The provisions of ASC Topic 310 30 require management to periodically estimate the loans expected future cash flows, and if the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected can be reasonably estimated, these cash flows are used to record interest revenue on the loans. If the loans expected future cash flows increase, the increase is recorded over the remaining terms of the loans as an increase to the loans yields. If expected future cash flows decrease, an allowance for loan losses is established and the accretable yields on the loans are maintained. In accordance with ASC Topic 310 30 and our accounting policy with respect to non accrual loans, we would place these acquired commercial real estate loans on non accrual status in the future if and when we were unable to reasonably estimate their expected future cash flows. 68 Table of Contents During 2010, in connection with the modification of one of the commercial real estate loans acquired in 2008, we executed a $180 million revolver facility with the borrower, under which $160 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2010, resulting in an aggregate loan to the borrower of $345 million as of December 31, 2010. The facility has a remaining term of seven years, with two one year extension options. The original loan is classified as a troubled debt restructuring. In addition, during 2010, as a result of a settlement related to the indemnified repurchase agreements, we acquired an additional commercial real estate loan and recorded it at its then current fair value of $16 million. Prior to its acquisition, this loan had been performing in accordance with its contractual terms and had no evidence of credit deterioration as of the acquisition date, and accordingly is not accounted for under the above described provisions of ASC Topic 310 30. As of December 31, 2010, we held an aggregate of approximately $307 million of commercial real estate loans which were modified in troubled debt restructurings. No impairment loss was recognized upon restructuring the loans, as the discounted cash flows of the modified loans exceeded the carrying amount of the original loans as of the modification date. There were no troubled debt restructurings outstanding as of December 31, 2009, 2008, 2007 or 2006. We define past due loans as loans on which principal or interest payments are over 90 days delinquent, but for which interest continues to be accrued. There were no institutional loans 90 days or more contractually past due as of December 31, 2010, 2009, 2008, 2007 or 2006. Although a portion of the commercial real estate loans is 90 days or more contractually past due, we do not report them as past due loans, because in accordance with GAAP, the interest earned on these loans is based on an accretable yield resulting from managements expectations with respect to the future cash flows for each loan relative to both the timing and collection of principal and interest as of the reporting date, not the loans contractual payment terms. These cash flow estimates are updated quarterly to reflect changes in managements expectations, which consider market conditions. We generally place loans on non accrual status once principal or interest payments are 60 days past due, or earlier if management determines that full collection is not probable. Loans 60 days past due, but considered both well secured and in the process of collection, may be excluded from non accrual status. For loans placed on non accrual status, revenue recognition is suspended. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, approximately $158 million and $2 million, respectively, of the aforementioned commercial real estate loans had been placed by management on non accrual status, as the yield associated with these loans, determined when the loans were acquired, was deemed to be non accretable. This determination was based on managements expectations of the future collection of principal and interest from the loans. Future changes in expectations with respect to collection of principal and interest on these loans could result in additional non accrual loans and provisions for loan losses. There were no non accrual loans as of December 31, 2008, 2007 or 2006. 69 Table of Contents Contractual maturities for loan and lease balances were as follows as of December 31, 2010: (In millions) Total Under 1 Year 1 to 5 Years Over 5 Years Institutional: Investment funds: U.S. $ 5,316 $ 4,974 $ 342 Non U.S. 1,478 1,478 Commercial and financial: U.S. 540 510 30 Non U.S. 190 162 28 Purchased receivables: U.S. 728 728 Non U.S. 1,471 1,471 Lease financing: U.S. 417 18 $ 399 Non U.S. 1,053 55 998 Total institutional 11,193 9,323 473 1,397 Commercial real estate: U.S. 764 107 205 452 Total loans and leases $ 11,957 $ 9,430 $ 678 $ 1,849 The following table presents the classification of loan and lease balances due after one year according to sensitivity to changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2010: (In millions) Loans and leases with predetermined interest rates $ 1,470 Loans and leases with floating or adjustable interest rates 1,057 Total $ 2,527 At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the allowance for loan losses was $100 million and $79 million, respectively.

The charge offs recorded in 2010 related to certain of the commercial real estate loans that management considered no longer collectible. The commercial real estate loans are reviewed on a quarterly basis, and any provisions for loan losses that are recorded reflect managements current expectations with respect to future cash flows from these loans, based on an assessment of economic conditions in the commercial real estate market and other factors. 70 Table of Contents Cross Border Outstandings Cross border outstandings, as defined by bank regulatory rules, are amounts payable to State Street by residents of foreign countries, regardless of the currency in which the claim is denominated, and local country claims in excess of local country obligations. These cross border outstandings consist primarily of deposits with banks, loans and lease financing and investment securities. As our non U.S. business activities have grown, our cross border outstandings have increased, as we have invested in more non U.S. assets. In addition to credit risk, cross border outstandings have the risk that, as a result of political or economic conditions in a country, borrowers may be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations of principal and or interest when due because of the unavailability of, or restrictions on, foreign exchange needed by borrowers to repay their obligations. Cross border outstandings to countries in which we do business which amounted to at least 1% of our consolidated total assets were as follows as of December 31: (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 United Kingdom $ 8,781 $ 8,116 $ 5,836 Germany 6,936 1,623 Australia 5,559 5,767 2,044 Netherlands 2,574 1,783 Canada 2,478 2,322 The aggregate cross border outstandings presented in the table represented 16%, 12% and 5% of our consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. There were no cross border outstandings to countries which totaled between 0.75% and 1% of our consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2010. Aggregate cross border outstandings to countries which totaled between 0.75% and 1% of our consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2009 amounted to $1.26 billion (Italy). Aggregate cross border outstandings to countries which totaled between 0.75% and 1% of our consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2008 amounted to $3.45 billion (Canada and Germany). Capital The management of regulatory and economic capital both involve key metrics evaluated by management to assess whether our actual level of capital is commensurate with our risk profile, is in compliance with all regulatory requirements, and is sufficient to provide us with the financial flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives. Regulatory Capital Our objective with respect to regulatory capital management is to maintain a strong capital base in order to provide financial flexibility for our business needs, including funding corporate growth and supporting clients cash management needs, and to provide protection against loss to depositors and creditors. We strive to maintain an optimal level of capital, commensurate with our risk profile, on which an attractive return to shareholders is expected to be realized over both the short and long term, while protecting our obligations to depositors and creditors and satisfying regulatory capital adequacy requirements. Our capital management process focuses on our risk exposures, our regulatory capital requirements, the evaluations of the major independent credit rating agencies that assign ratings to our public debt and our capital position relative to our peers. Our Asset, Liability and Capital Committee, referred to as ALCCO, oversees the management of our regulatory capital, and is responsible for ensuring capital adequacy with respect to regulatory requirements, internal targets and the expectations of the major independent credit rating agencies. The primary regulator of both State Street and State Street Bank for regulatory capital purposes is the Federal Reserve. Both State Street and State Street Bank are subject to the minimum capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve and defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act 71 Table of Contents of 1991. State Street Bank must meet the regulatory capital thresholds for well capitalized in order for the parent company to maintain its status as a financial holding company. Regulatory capital ratios and related regulatory guidelines for State Street and State Street Bank were as follows as of December 31: REGULATORYGUIDELINES STATESTREET STATESTREETBANK Minimum WellCapitalized 2010 2009 2010 2009 Regulatory capital ratios: Tier 1 risk based capital 4 % 6 % 20.5 % 17.7 % 18.1 % 17.3 % Total risk based capital 8 10 22.0 19.1 19.9 19.0 Tier 1 leverage ratio(1) 4 5 8.2 8.5 7.1 8.2 (1) Regulatory guideline for well capitalized applies only to State Street Bank. At December 31, 2010, State Streets and State Street Banks tier 1 and total risk based capital ratios increased compared to year end 2009. The increases for State Street and State Street Bank resulted primarily from the impact of the investment portfolio repositioning completed in December, which significantly reduced on balance sheet risk weighted assets. The decreases in the tier 1 leverage ratios for both entities were generally due to increases in adjusted quarterly average assets associated with overall balance sheet growth. At December 31, 2010, regulatory capital ratios for State Street and State Street Bank exceeded the regulatory minimum and well capitalized thresholds. In February 2011, we issued an aggregate of approximately $500 million of 4.956% junior subordinated debentures due March 15, 2018, in a remarketing of the 6.001% junior subordinated debentures due 2042 originally issued to State Street Capital Trust III in 2008 in connection with our offering of the trusts 8.25% fixed to floating rate normal automatic preferred enhanced capital securities, or normal APEX (see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8). The net proceeds from the sale of the remarketed 4.956% junior subordinated debentures were used to purchase U.S. Treasury securities maturing in March 2011, and the proceeds from the maturity of these securities will be used in March 2011 by Capital Trust III to make a final distribution to the holders of the normal APEX with respect to the original 6.001% junior subordinated debentures and to satisfy the obligation of Capital Trust III to purchase shares of our non cumulative perpetual preferred stock, series A, $100,000 liquidation preference per share, whereby the principal asset of Capital Trust III will be the shares of our preferred stock. As a result of the above described transactions, we will have outstanding the above referenced $500 million of 4.956% junior subordinated debentures due March 15, 2018 and $500 million of non cumulative perpetual preferred stock. The perpetual preferred stock will qualify as tier 1 regulatory capital, and the junior subordinated debentures will qualify as tier 2 regulatory capital, under federal regulatory capital guidelines. Common Stock No shares of our common stock were purchased during 2009 or 2010 under existing Board authorization. As of December 31, 2010, approximately 13.25 million shares remained available for future purchase under the Board authorization. We cannot currently purchase shares of our common stock without Federal Reserve approval. In January 2008, under an existing authorization by our Board of Directors, we purchased 552,000 shares of our common stock, at an average historical cost per share of approximately $75, in connection with a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program that concluded in January 2008. We generally employ third party broker/dealers to acquire shares on the open market in connection with our common stock purchase program. Funds for cash distributions to our shareholders by the parent company are derived from a variety of sources. The level of dividends to shareholders on our common stock, which totaled $20 million ($0.04 per 72 Table of Contents share) in both 2010 and 2009 (compared to $400 million, or $0.95 per share, in 2008), is reviewed regularly and determined by the Board of Directors considering our liquidity, capital adequacy and recent earnings history and prospects, as well as economic conditions and other factors deemed relevant. During the first quarter of 2009, in light of the continued disruption in the global capital markets experienced since the middle of 2007, and as part of a plan to strengthen our tangible common equity, we announced a reduction of our quarterly dividend on our common stock to $0.01 per share. Currently, any increase in our common stock dividend requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. Federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid by subsidiary banks to the parent holding company. In addition, banking regulators have the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends. Information concerning limitations on dividends from our subsidiary banks is provided in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. Other The current minimum regulatory capital requirements enforced by the U.S. banking regulators are based on a 1988 international accord, commonly referred to as Basel I, which was developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. In 2004, the Basel Committee released the final version of its new capital adequacy framework, referred to as Basel II. Basel II governs the capital adequacy of large, internationally active banking organizations, such as State Street, that generally rely on sophisticated risk management and measurement systems, and requires these organizations to enhance their measurement and management of the risks underlying their business activities and to better align regulatory capital requirements with those risks. Basel II adopts a three pillar framework for addressing capital adequacy minimum capital requirements, which incorporate the measurement of credit risk, market risk and operational risk; supervisory review, which addresses the need for a banking organization to assess its capital adequacy position relative to its overall risk, rather than only with respect to its minimum capital requirement; and market discipline, which imposes public disclosure requirements on a banking organization intended to allow the assessment of key information about the organizations risk profile and its associated level of regulatory capital. In December 2007, U.S. banking regulators jointly issued final rules to implement the Basel II framework in the U.S. The framework does not supersede or change the existing prompt corrective action and leverage capital requirements applicable to banking organizations in the U.S., and explicitly reserves the regulators authority to require organizations to hold additional capital where appropriate. Prior to full implementation of the Basel II framework, State Street is required to complete a defined qualification period, during which it must demonstrate that it complies with the related regulatory requirements to the satisfaction of the Federal Reserve, State Streets and State Street Banks primary U.S. banking regulator. State Street is currently in the qualification period for Basel II. In addition, in response to the recent financial crisis and ongoing global financial market dynamics, the Basel Committee has proposed new guidelines, referred to as Basel III. Basel III would establish more stringent capital and liquidity requirements, including higher minimum regulatory capital ratios, new capital buffers, higher risk weighted asset calibrations, more restrictive definitions of qualifying capital, a liquidity coverage ratio and a net stable funding ratio. These requirements, as well as related provisions of the Dodd Frank Act and other international regulatory initiatives, could have a material impact on our businesses and our profitability. U.S. banking regulators will be required to enact new rules specific to the U.S. banking industry to implement the final Basel III accord. Consequently, it is not possible to determine with certainty at this time how our regulatory capital and our operations will align with the regulatory capital requirements of Basel III, or when we will be expected to be compliant with the Basel regulatory capital requirements. We believe that we will be able to comply with the relevant Basel II and Basel III regulatory capital requirements when and as applied to us. 73 Table of Contents Economic Capital We define economic capital as the capital required to protect holders of our senior debt, and obligations higher in priority, against unexpected economic losses over a one year period at a level consistent with the solvency of a firm with our target AA senior debt rating. Economic capital requirements are one of several important measures used by management and the Board of Directors to assess the adequacy of our capital levels in relation to State Streets risk profile. ALCCO is responsible for overseeing our economic capital process. The framework and methodologies used to quantify economic capital for each of the risk types described below have been developed by our Enterprise Risk Management, Global Treasury and Corporate Finance groups and are designed to be generally consistent with our risk management principles and Basel II. This economic capital framework has been approved by senior management. Due to the evolving nature of quantification techniques, we expect to periodically refine the methodologies, assumptions, and data used to estimate our economic capital requirements, which could result in a different amount of capital needed to support our business activities. We quantify capital requirements for the risks inherent in our business activities and group them into one of the following broadly defined categories: Market risk: the risk of adverse financial impact due to fluctuations in market prices, primarily as they relate to our trading activities; Interest rate risk: the risk of loss in non trading asset and liability management positions, primarily the impact of adverse movements in interest rates on the repricing mismatches that exist between our balance sheet assets and liabilities; Credit risk: the risk of loss that may result from the default or downgrade of a borrower or counterparty; Operational risk: the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events, which is consistent with the Basel II definition; and Business risk: the risk of negative earnings resulting from adverse changes in business factors, including changes in the competitive environment, changes in the operational economics of our business activities, and the effect of strategic and reputation risks. Economic capital for each of these five categories is estimated on a stand alone basis using statistical modeling techniques applied to internally generated and, in some cases, external data. These individual results are then aggregated at the State Street consolidated level. A capital reduction, or diversification benefit, is then applied to reflect the unlikely event of experiencing an extremely large loss in each risk type at the same time. Liquidity The objective of liquidity management is to ensure that we have the ability to meet our financial obligations in a timely and cost effective manner, and that we maintain sufficient flexibility to fund strategic corporate initiatives as they arise. Effective management of liquidity involves assessing the potential mismatch between the future cash needs of our clients and our available sources of cash under normal and adverse economic and business conditions. Significant uses of liquidity, described more fully below, consist primarily of funding deposit withdrawals and outstanding commitments to extend credit or commitments to purchase securities as they are drawn upon. Liquidity is provided by the maintenance of broad access to the global capital markets and by our consolidated balance sheet asset structure. Our Global Treasury group is responsible for the day to day management of our global liquidity position, which is conducted within risk guidelines established and monitored by ALCCO. Management maintains a liquidity measurement framework to assess the sources and uses of liquidity that is monitored by Global Treasury and our Enterprise Risk Management group. Embedded in this framework is a process that outlines several levels of potential risk to our liquidity and identifies triggers that we use as early warning signals of a possible difficulty. These triggers are a combination of internal and external measures of potential increases in cash needs or decreases in available sources of cash and possible impairment of our ability to access the global capital markets. Another important component of the framework is a contingency funding plan that is designed to identify and manage through a potential liquidity crisis. The plan defines roles, responsibilities and management 74 Table of Contents actions to be undertaken in the event of deterioration in our liquidity profile caused by either a State Street specific event or a broader disruption in the capital markets. Specific actions are linked to the levels of triggers. We generally manage our liquidity risk on a global basis at the State Street consolidated level. We also manage parent company liquidity, and in certain cases branch liquidity, separately. State Street Bank generally has broader access to funding products and markets limited to banks, specifically the federal funds market and the Federal Reserves discount window. The parent company is managed to a more conservative liquidity profile, reflecting narrower market access. We typically hold enough cash, primarily in the form of interest bearing deposits with subsidiary banks, to meet current debt maturities and cash needs, as well as those projected over the next one year period. Sources of liquidity come from two primary areas: access to the global capital markets and liquid assets carried on our consolidated balance sheet. Our ability to source incremental funding at reasonable rates of interest from wholesale investors in the capital markets is the first source of liquidity we would access to accommodate the uses of liquidity described below. On balance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our liquidity management strategy. These assets provide liquidity through maturities of the assets, but more importantly, they provide us with the ability to raise funds by pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales. Each of these sources of liquidity is used in our management of daily cash needs and is available in a crisis scenario should we need to accommodate potential large, unexpected demand for funds. Uses of liquidity generally result from the following: withdrawals of unsecured client deposits; draw downs on unfunded commitments to extend credit or to purchase securities, generally provided through lines of credit; and short duration advance facilities. Client deposits are generated largely from our investment servicing activities, and are invested in a combination of term investment securities and short term money market assets whose mix is determined by the characteristics of the deposits. Most of the client deposits are payable on demand or are short term in nature, which means that withdrawals can potentially occur quickly and in large amounts. Similarly, clients can request disbursement of funds under commitments to extend credit, or can overdraw their deposit accounts rapidly and in large volumes. In addition, a large volume of unanticipated funding requirements, such as large draw downs of existing lines of credit, could require additional liquidity. Material risks to sources of short term liquidity could include, among other things, adverse changes in the perception in the financial markets of our financial condition or liquidity needs, and downgrades by major independent credit rating agencies of our deposits and our debt securities, which would restrict our ability to access the capital markets and could lead to withdrawals of unsecured deposits by our clients. In managing our liquidity, we have issued term wholesale certificates of deposit, or CDs, and invested those funds in short term money market assets which are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet and would be available to meet cash needs. At December 31, 2010, this wholesale CD portfolio totaled $6.82 billion, compared to $5.74 billion at December 31, 2009. In connection with our management of liquidity where we seek to maintain access to sources of back up liquidity at reasonable costs, we have participated in the Federal Reserves secured lending program available to financial institutions, referred to as the term auction facility, or TAF. State Street Bank terminated its participation in the TAF in February 2010, and consequently had no TAF balance outstanding at December 31, 2010, compared to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2009. Since then, the Federal Reserve has terminated the TAF program. The highest TAF balance outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2010 for State Street Bank was $2.0 billion, compared to $10.0 billion during the year ended December 31, 2009. The average TAF balance outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2010 was approximately $214 million, compared to an average TAF balance of approximately $4.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009. In addition to these funding sources, at December 31, 2010, asset backed commercial paper issued to third parties by the conduits, which were consolidated into our financial statements in May 2009, totaled approximately $1.92 billion, compared to $12.07 billion at December 31, 2009. We continue to market the conduit commercial paper program to investors in order to fund the remaining former conduit assets. 75 Table of Contents While maintenance of our high investment grade credit rating is of primary importance to our liquidity management program, on balance sheet liquid assets represent significant liquidity that we can directly control, and provide a source of cash in the form of principal maturities and the ability to borrow from the capital markets using our securities as collateral. Our liquid assets consist primarily of cash balances at central banks in excess of regulatory requirements and other short term liquid assets, such as federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits with banks, the latter of which are multicurrency instruments invested with major multinational banks; and high quality, marketable investment securities not already pledged, which generally are more liquid than other types of assets and can be sold or borrowed against to generate cash quickly. At December 31, 2010, the value of our liquid assets, as defined, totaled $83.41 billion, compared to $75.98 billion at December 31, 2009. Due to the unusual size and volatile nature of our quarter end client deposits, we maintained approximately $16.61 billion at central banks as of December 31, 2010, compared to $22.45 as of December 31, 2009, both in excess of regulatory required minimums. Aggregate investment securities carried at $44.81 billion as of December 31, 2010, compared to $40.96 billion as of December 31, 2009, were designated as pledged for public and trust deposits, borrowed funds and for other purposes as provided by law, and are excluded from the liquid assets calculation, unless pledged internally between State Street affiliates. Liquid assets included securities pledged to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston to secure State Street Banks ability to borrow from their discount window should the need arise. This access to primary credit is an important source of back up liquidity for State Street Bank. As of December 31, 2010, State Street Bank had no outstanding primary credit borrowings from the discount window. Based on our level of liquid assets and our ability to access the capital markets for additional funding when necessary, including our ability to issue debt and equity securities under our current universal shelf registration, management considers overall liquidity at December 31, 2010 to be sufficient to meet State Streets current commitments and business needs, including supporting the liquidity of the commercial paper conduits and accommodating the transaction and cash management needs of our clients. As referenced above, our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the maintenance of high investment grade ratings on our debt, as measured by the major independent credit rating agencies. Factors essential to maintaining high credit ratings include diverse and stable core earnings; strong risk management; strong capital ratios; diverse liquidity sources, including the global capital markets and client deposits; and strong liquidity monitoring procedures. High ratings on debt minimize borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by increasing the potential market for our debt. A downgrade or reduction of these credit ratings could have an adverse effect to our ability to access funding at favorable interest rates. The following table presents information about State Streets and State Street Banks credit ratings as of February 25, 2011. Fitch does not have a current subordinated debt rating for State Street. The previous subordinated debt rating of A was retired in June 2010 when the corresponding State Street subordinated debt matured.

We have, as discussed previously, issued in the past, and we may issue in the future, securities pursuant to the shelf registration. The issuance of debt or equity securities will depend on future market conditions, funding needs and other factors. We currently maintain a corporate commercial paper program, unrelated to the former conduit asset backed commercial paper program, under which we can issue up to $3 billion with original maturities of up to 270 days from the date of issue. At December 31, 2010, we had $2.80 billion of commercial paper outstanding, compared to $2.78 billion at December 31, 2009. Corporate commercial paper issuances are recorded in other short term borrowings in our consolidated statement of condition. Additional information about our corporate commercial paper program is provided in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. State Street Bank currently has Board authority to issue bank notes up to an aggregate of $5 billion, and up to $1 billion of subordinated bank notes. As of December 31, 2010, State Street Banks outstanding unsecured senior notes issued under this Board authority totaled $2.45 billion. Additional information with respect to these outstanding bank notes is provided in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. State Street Bank currently maintains a line of credit with a financial institution of CAD $800 million, or approximately $802 million as of December 31, 2010, to support its Canadian securities processing operations. The line of credit has no stated termination date and is cancelable by either party with prior notice. At December 31, 2010, no balance was outstanding on this line of credit.

The obligations presented in the table above are recorded in our consolidated statement of condition at December 31, 2010, except for interest on long term debt. The table does not include obligations which will be settled in cash, primarily in less than one year, such as deposits, federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements and other short term borrowings. Additional information about deposits, federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements and other short term borrowings is provided in notes 7 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. The table does not include obligations related to derivative instruments, because the amounts included in our consolidated statement of condition at December 31, 2010 related to derivatives do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid under the contracts upon settlement. Additional information about derivative contracts is provided in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. We have obligations under pension and other post retirement benefit plans, more fully described in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, which are not included in the above table. Additional information about contractual cash obligations related to long term debt and operating and capital leases is provided in notes 10 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8.

Risk Management The global scope of our business activities requires that we balance what we perceive to be the primary risks in our businesses with a comprehensive and well integrated risk management function. The identification, measurement, monitoring and mitigation of risks are essential to the financial performance and successful management of our businesses. These risks, if not effectively managed, can result in current losses to State Street as well as erosion of our capital and damage to our reputation. Our systematic approach allows for a more precise assessment of risks within a framework for evaluating opportunities for the prudent use of capital that appropriately balance risk and return. We have a disciplined approach to risk management that involves all levels of management. The Board, through its Risk and Capital Committee, provides extensive review and oversight of our overall risk management programs, including the approval of key risk management policies and the periodic review of State Streets Risk Appetite Statement, which is an integral part of our overall Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, or ICAAP. The Risk Appetite Statement outlines the quantitative limits and qualitative goals that define and constrain our risk appetite and defines responsibilities for measuring and monitoring risk against limits, which are reported regularly to the Board. In addition, State Street utilizes a variety of key risk indicators to monitor risk on a more granular level. Risk Management, a corporate function, provides oversight, support and coordination across business units independent of the business units activities, and is responsible for the formulation and maintenance of enterprise wide risk management policies and guidelines. In addition, Risk Management establishes and reviews approved limits and, in collaboration with business line management, monitors key risks. Our Chief Risk Officer meets regularly with the Board and its Risk and Capital Committee, and has the authority to escalate issues as necessary. The execution of duties with respect to the management of people, products, business operations and processes is the responsibility of business unit managers. The function of risk management is designing and directing the implementation of risk management programs and processes consistent with corporate and regulatory standards, and providing oversight of the business owned risks. Accordingly, risk management is a shared responsibility between the Risk Management function and the business lines, and requires joint efforts in goal setting, program design and implementation, resource management, and performance evaluation between business and functional units. Responsibility for risk management is overseen by a series of management committees, as well as the Boards Risk and Capital Committee. The Management Risk and Capital Committee, or MRAC, co chaired by 78 Table of Contents our Chief Risk Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is the senior management decision making body for risk and capital issues, and is responsible for ensuring that State Streets strategy, budget, risk appetite and capital adequacy are properly aligned. ALCCO, chaired by our Treasurer, oversees the management of our consolidated balance sheet, the management of our global liquidity and interest rate risk positions, our regulatory and economic capital, the determination of the framework for capital allocation and strategies for capital structure, and debt and equity issuances. State Streets risk management program is supported by the activities of a number of corporate risk oversight committees, all of which are chaired by senior executives within Risk Management. Our Fiduciary Review Committee reviews the criteria for the acceptance of fiduciary duties, and assists our business lines with their fiduciary responsibilities executed on behalf of clients. Our Credit Committee acts as the credit and counterparty risk guidelines committee for State Street. Our Operational Risk Committee provides cross business oversight of operational risk to identify, measure, manage and control operational risk in an effective and consistent manner across State Street. Our Model Assessment Committee provides recommendations concerning technical modeling issues and independently validates financial models utilized by our business units. While we believe that our risk management program is effective in managing the risks in our businesses, external factors may create risks that cannot always be identified or anticipated. Market Risk Market risk is defined as the risk of adverse financial impact due to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and other market driven factors and prices. State Street is exposed to market risk in both its trading and non trading, or asset and liability management, activities. The market risk management processes related to these activities, discussed in further detail below, apply to both on and off balance sheet exposures. We engage in trading and investment activities primarily to serve our clients needs and to contribute to our overall corporate earnings and liquidity. In the conduct of these activities, we are subject to, and assume, market risk. The level of market risk that we assume is a function of our overall risk appetite, objectives and liquidity needs, our clients requirements and market volatility. Interest rate risk, a component of market risk, is more thoroughly discussed in the Asset and Liability Management portion of this Market Risk section. Trading Activities Market risk associated with foreign exchange and other trading activities is managed through corporate guidelines, including established limits on aggregate and net open positions, sensitivity to changes in interest rates, and concentrations, which are supplemented by stop loss thresholds. We use a variety of risk management tools and methodologies, including value at risk, or VaR, described later in this section, to measure, monitor and manage market risk. All limits and measurement techniques are reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a regular basis by business managers, the Market Risk Management group and the Trading and Market Risk Committee. We use a variety of derivative financial instruments to support our clients needs, conduct trading activities and manage our interest rate and currency risk. These activities are designed to generate trading revenue and to hedge potential earnings volatility. In addition, we provide services related to derivatives in our role as both a manager and a servicer of financial assets. Our clients use derivatives to manage the financial risks associated with their investment goals and business activities. With the growth of cross border investing, our clients have an increasing need for foreign exchange forward contracts to convert currency for international investments and to manage the currency risk in their international investment portfolios. As an active participant in the foreign exchange markets, we provide foreign exchange forward contracts and options in support of these client needs. As part of our trading activities, we assume positions in the foreign exchange and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and using derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange and interest rate options and interest rate swaps, and interest rate futures. As of December 31, 2010, the aggregate notional amount of these derivatives was $744.64 billion, of which $637.85 billion was composed of foreign exchange forward, swap and spot contracts. In the aggregate, positions are matched closely to 79 Table of Contents minimize currency and interest rate risk. All foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at current market rates. Additional information about trading derivatives is provided in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. As noted above, we use a variety of risk measurement tools and methodologies, including VaR, which is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical confidence interval. We use a risk measurement system to estimate VaR daily. We have adopted standards for estimating VaR, and we maintain capital for market risk in accordance with applicable regulatory guidelines. VaR is estimated for a 99% one tail confidence interval and an assumed one day holding period using a historical observation period of two years. A 99% one tail confidence interval implies that daily trading losses should not exceed the estimated VaR more than 1% of the time, or less than three business days out of a year. The methodology uses a simulation approach based on historically observed changes in foreign exchange rates, U.S. and non U.S. interest rates and foreign exchange implied volatilities, and incorporates the resulting diversification benefits provided from the mix of our trading positions. Like all quantitative risk measures, our VaR methodology is subject to inherent limitations and assumptions. Our methodology gives equal weight to all market rate observations regardless of how recently the market rates were observed. The estimate is calculated using static portfolios consisting of trading positions held at the end of each business day. Therefore, implicit in the VaR estimate is the assumption that no intra day actions are taken by management during adverse market movements. As a result, the methodology does not incorporate risk associated with intra day changes in positions or intra day price volatility. The following table presents VaR with respect to our trading activities, for trading positions held during the periods indicated, as measured by our VaR methodology. The generally lower total VaR amounts compared to component VaR amounts primarily relate to diversification benefits across risk types. VALUE AT RISK Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 (In millions) AnnualAverage Maximum Minimum AnnualAverage Maximum Minimum Foreign exchange rates $ 3.0 $ 9.4 $ 0.6 $ 3.1 $ 9.7 $ 0.5 Interest rates 3.3 8.3 1.6 1.8 4.1 0.6 Total VaR for trading assets $ 4.6 $ 10.2 $ 1.8 $ 3.7 $ 9.2 $ 1.2 We back test the estimated one day VaR on a daily basis. This information is reviewed and used to confirm that all relevant trading positions are properly modeled. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we did not experience any actual trading losses in excess of our end of day VaR estimate. Our VaR methodology also measures VaR associated with certain assets classified as trading account assets in our consolidated balance sheet. These assets are not held in connection with typical trading activities, and thus are not reflected in the foregoing VaR table. In the table below, the VaR associated with these assets is reported as VaR for non trading assets. Total regulatory VaR is calculated as the sum of the VaR for trading assets and the VaR for non trading assets, with no diversification benefits recognized. The average, maximum and minimum amounts are calculated for each line item separately.

Most of our NIR is earned from the investment of deposits generated by our Investment Servicing and Investment Management lines of business. We structure our balance sheet assets to generally conform to the characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities, but we manage our overall interest rate risk position in the context of current and anticipated market conditions and within internally approved risk guidelines. Our overall interest rate risk position is maintained within a series of policies approved by the Board and guidelines established and monitored by ALCCO. Our Global Treasury group has responsibility for managing State Streets day to day interest rate risk. To effectively manage the consolidated balance sheet and related NIR, Global Treasury has the authority to assume a limited amount of interest rate risk based on market conditions and its views about the direction of global interest rates over both short term and long term time horizons. Global Treasury manages our exposure to changes in interest rates on a consolidated basis organized into three regional treasury units, North America, Europe and Asia/Pacific, to reflect the growing, global nature of our exposures and to capture the impact of change in regional market environments on our total risk position. Our investment activities and our use of derivative financial instruments are the primary tools used in managing interest rate risk. We invest in financial instruments with currency, repricing, and maturity characteristics we consider appropriate to manage our overall interest rate risk position. In addition to on balance sheet assets, we use certain derivative instruments, primarily interest rate swaps, to alter the interest rate characteristics of specific balance sheet assets or liabilities. The use of derivatives is subject to ALCCO approved guidelines. Additional information about our use of derivatives is provided in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. As a result of growth in our non U.S. operations, including the Intesa and MIFA acquisitions, non U.S. dollar denominated client liabilities are a significant portion of our consolidated balance sheet. This growth results in exposure to changes in the shape and level of non U.S. dollar yield curves, which we include in our consolidated interest rate risk management process. Because no one individual measure can accurately assess all of our exposures to changes in interest rates, we use several quantitative measures in our assessment of current and potential future exposures to changes in interest rates and their impact on NIR and balance sheet values. Net interest revenue simulation is the primary tool used in our evaluation of the potential range of possible NIR results that could occur under a variety of interest rate environments. We also use market valuation and duration analysis to assess changes in the economic value of balance sheet assets and liabilities caused by assumed changes in interest rates. To measure, monitor, and report on our interest rate risk position, we use (1) NIR simulation, or NIR at risk, which measures the impact on NIR over the next twelve months to immediate, or rate shock, and gradual, or rate ramp, changes in market interest rates; and (2) economic value of equity, or EVE, which measures the impact on the present value of all NIR related principal and interest cash flows of an immediate change in interest rates. NIR at risk is designed to measure the potential impact of changes in market interest rates on NIR in the short term. EVE, on the other hand, is a long term view of interest rate risk, but with a view toward liquidation of State Street. Both of these measures are subject to ALCCO approved guidelines, and are monitored regularly, along with other relevant simulations, scenario analyses and stress tests, by both Global Treasury and ALCCO. In calculating our NIR at risk, we start with a base amount of NIR that is projected over the next twelve months, assuming our forecasted yield curve over the period. Our existing balance sheet assets and liabilities are adjusted by the amount and timing of transactions that are forecasted to occur over the next twelve months. That yield curve is then shocked, or moved immediately, &plusmn;100 basis points in a parallel fashion, or at all points along the yield curve. Two new twelve month NIR projections are then developed using the same balance sheet and forecasted transactions, but with the new yield curves, and compared to the base scenario. We also perform 81 Table of Contents the calculations using interest rate ramps, which are &plusmn;100 basis point changes in interest rates that are assumed to occur gradually over the next twelve months, rather than immediately as we do with interest rate shocks. EVE is based on the change in the present value of all NIR related principal and interest cash flows for changes in market rates of interest. The present value of existing cash flows with a then current yield curve serves as the base case. We then apply an immediate parallel shock to that yield curve of &plusmn;200 basis points and recalculate the cash flows and related present values. A large shock is used to better capture the embedded option risk in our mortgage backed securities that results from borrowers prepayment opportunities. Key assumptions used in the models described above include the timing of cash flows; the maturity and repricing of balance sheet assets and liabilities, especially option embedded financial instruments like mortgage backed securities; changes in market conditions; and interest rate sensitivities of our client liabilities with respect to the interest rates paid and the level of balances. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the models cannot precisely predict future NIR or predict the impact of changes in interest rates on NIR and economic value. Actual results could differ from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and market conditions, changes in spreads and management strategies, among other factors. Projections of potential future streams of NIR are assessed as part of our forecasting process. The following table presents the estimated exposure of NIR for the next twelve months, calculated as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, due to an immediate &plusmn;100 basis point shift in then current interest rates. Estimated incremental exposures presented below are dependent on managements assumptions about asset and liability sensitivities under various interest rate scenarios, such as those previously discussed, and do not reflect any additional actions management may undertake in order to mitigate some of the adverse effects of interest rate changes on State Streets financial performance. NIR AT RISK Estimated Exposure toNet Interest Revenue (In millions) December 31,2010 December 31,2009 Rate change: +100 bps shock $ 121 $ (165 ) 100 bps shock (231 ) (330 ) +100 bps ramp 42 (128 ) 100 bps ramp (117 ) (112 ) As of December 31, 2010, for an upward 100 basis point shock in market rates versus NIR sensitivity at December 31, 2009, NIR improved due to forecasted investment portfolio re investment, which would occur at higher rates, after the shock, coupled with the current assumptions for client deposit pricing sensitivities. For an upward 100 basis point ramp in market rates, the same factors affect this analysis; however, the benefit is depressed as rates increase more slowly. For a downward 100 basis point shock in market rates, forecasted portfolio re investment would compress asset yields with little relief on deposit expense due to the historically low level of interest rates; however, the increase in portfolio duration in 2010 provides some benefit to NIR sensitivity as of December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009. For a downward 100 basis point ramp in market rates, the same factors described above affect NIR at risk, but to a lesser extent as decreases in interest rates occur more slowly. Other important factors which affect the levels of NIR are balance sheet size and mix; interest rate spreads; the slope and interest rate level of U.S. dollar and non U.S. dollar yield curves and the relationship between them; the pace of change in market interest rates; and management actions taken in response to the preceding conditions. The following table presents estimated EVE exposures, calculated as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, assuming an immediate and prolonged shift in interest rates, the impact of which would be spread over a number of years. 82 Table of Contents ECONOMIC VALUE OF EQUITY Estimated Exposure toEconomic Value of Equity (In millions) December 31,2010 December 31,2009 Rate change: +200 bps shock $ (2,058 ) $ (1,205 ) 200 bps shock 949 (434 ) The increase in the exposure to EVE for an upward 200 basis point shock as of December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009 is attributable to the re investment of investment portfolio amortization and other run off into fixed rate U.S. government securities. These same factors account for the improvement in the exposure to EVE for a downward 200 basis point shock as of December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009. Credit Risk Credit and counterparty risk is defined as the risk of financial loss if a borrower or counterparty is either unable or unwilling to repay borrowings or settle a transaction in accordance with contractual terms. We assume credit and counterparty risk for both our on and off balance sheet exposures. The extension of credit and the acceptance of counterparty risk by State Street are governed by corporate guidelines based on each counterpartys risk profile, the markets served, counterparty and country concentrations, and regulatory compliance. Our focus on large institutional investors and their businesses requires that we assume concentrated credit risk for a variety of products and durations. We maintain comprehensive guidelines and procedures to monitor and manage all aspects of credit and counterparty risk that we undertake. An internal rating system is used to assess potential risk of loss. State Streets risk rating process incorporates the use of risk rating tools in conjunction with management judgment. Qualitative and quantitative inputs are captured in a transparent and replicable manner, and following a formal review and approval process, an internal credit rating based on State Streets credit scale is assigned. Counterparties are evaluated on an individual basis at least annually, while significant exposures to counterparties are reviewed daily. Processes for credit approval and monitoring are in place for all credit extensions. As part of the approval and renewal process, due diligence is conducted based on the size and term of the exposure, as well as the creditworthiness of the counterparty. At any point in time, having one or more counterparties to which our exposure exceeds 10% of our consolidated total shareholders equity, exclusive of unrealized gains or losses, is not unusual. Exposure to these counterparties is regularly evaluated by Risk Management. We provide, on a limited basis, traditional loan products and services to key clients in a manner that is intended to enhance client relationships, increase profitability and manage risk. We employ a relationship model in which credit decisions are based upon credit quality and the overall institutional relationship. An allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb probable credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio that can be estimated, and is reviewed regularly by management for adequacy. The provision for loan losses is a charge to current earnings to maintain the overall allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate relative to the level of estimated probable credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio. Information about provisions for loan losses is included in the Provision for Loan Losses section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. We purchase securities under agreements to resell, referred to as repurchase agreements. Most repurchase agreements are short term, with maturities of less than 90 days. Risk is managed through a variety of processes, including establishing the acceptability of counterparties; limiting purchases largely to low risk U.S. government securities; taking possession or control of pledged assets; monitoring levels of underlying collateral; and limiting the duration of the agreements. Securities are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is required from the borrower. We also provide clients with off balance sheet liquidity and credit enhancement facilities in the form of letters and lines of credit and standby bond purchase agreements. These exposures are subject to an initial credit 83 Table of Contents analysis, with detailed approval and review processes. These facilities are also actively monitored and reviewed annually. We maintain a separate reserve for probable credit losses related to certain of these off balance sheet activities, which is recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated statement of condition. Management reviews the adequacy of this reserve on a regular basis. On behalf of clients enrolled in our lending program, we lend securities to banks, broker/dealers and other institutions. In most circumstances, we indemnify our clients for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities. Though these transactions are collateralized, the substantial volume of these activities necessitates detailed credit based underwriting and monitoring processes. The aggregate amount of indemnified securities on loan totaled $334.24 billion at December 31, 2010, and $365.25 billion at December 31, 2009. We require the borrowers to provide collateral in an amount equal to or in excess of 100% of the fair market value of the securities borrowed. State Street holds the collateral received in connection with its securities lending services as agent, and these holdings are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. The securities on loan and the collateral are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary. We held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $343.41 billion and $375.92 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. The collateral held by us is invested on behalf of our clients. In certain cases, the collateral is invested in third party repurchase agreements, for which we indemnify the client against loss of the principal invested. We require the repurchase agreement counterparty to provide collateral in an amount equal to or in excess of 100% of the amount of the repurchase agreement. The indemnified repurchase agreements and the related collateral are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. Of the collateral of $343.41 billion at December 31, 2010 and $375.92 billion at December 31, 2009 referenced above, $89.07 billion at December 31, 2010 and $77.73 billion at December 31, 2009 was invested in indemnified repurchase agreements. We held, as agent, $93.29 billion and $82.62 billion as collateral for indemnified investments in repurchase agreements at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. Investments in debt and equity securities, including investments in affiliates, are monitored regularly by Corporate Finance and Risk Management. Procedures are in place for assessing impaired securities, as discussed in notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. Operational Risk We define operational risk as the potential for loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events. As a leading provider of services to institutional investors, we provide a broad array of services, including research, investment management, trading services and investment servicing, that give rise to operational risk. Consequently, active management of operational risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business. Our Operational Risk Policy Statement defines operational risk and details roles and responsibilities for its management. The Policy Statement is reinforced by the Operational Risk Guidelines, which document our practices and provide a mandate within which programs, processes, and regulatory elements are implemented to ensure that operational risk is identified, measured, managed and controlled in a consistent manner across State Street. Responsibility for the management of operational risk lies with every individual at State Street. We maintain a governance structure related to operational risk designed to ensure that responsibilities are clearly defined and to provide independent oversight of operational risk management. The Risk and Capital Committee of the Board sets operational risk policy and oversees implementation of the operational risk framework. Risk Management develops corporate programs to manage operational risk and oversees the overall operational risk program. Business units take responsibility for their own operational risk and periodically review the status of the business controls, which are designed to provide a sound operational environment. The business units also identify, manage, and report on operational risk. The Operational Risk Committee reviews operational risk related information and policies, provides oversight of the operational risk program, and escalates operational risk issues of note to the MRAC and Risk and Capital Committee of the Board. Corporate Audit performs independent reviews of the application of operational risk management practices and methodologies and reports to the Examining & Audit Committee of the Board. 84 Table of Contents Our discipline in managing operational risk, which is a result of this emphasis on policy, guidelines, oversight, and independent review, provides the structure to identify, evaluate, control, monitor, measure, mitigate and report operational risk. Business Risk We define business risk as the risk of adverse changes in our earnings related to business factors, including changes in the competitive environment, changes in the operational economics of business activities and the potential effect of strategic and reputation risks, not already captured as market, interest rate, credit or operational risks. We incorporate business risk into our assessment of our economic capital needs. Active management of business risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business, and responsibility for the management of business risk lies with every individual at State Street. Separating the effects of a potential material adverse event into operational and business risk is sometimes difficult. For instance, the direct financial impact of an unfavorable event in the form of fines or penalties would be classified as an operational risk loss, while the impact on our reputation and the potential loss of clients and corresponding decline in revenue would be classified as a business risk loss. An additional example of business risk is the integration of a major acquisition. Failure to successfully integrate the operations of an acquired business, and the resultant inability to retain clients, would be classified as a business risk loss. Business risk is managed with a long term focus. Techniques for its assessment and management include the development of business plans and appropriate management oversight. The potential impact of the various elements of business risk is difficult to quantify with any degree of precision. We use a combination of historical earnings volatility, scenario analysis, stress testing and management judgment to help assess the potential effect on State Street attributable to business risk. Management and control of business risks are generally the responsibility of the business units as part of their overall strategic planning and internal risk management processes. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS In the normal course of our business, we utilize three types of special purpose entities. One type is utilized in connection with our involvement as collateral manager with respect to managed investment vehicles. Since we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of these managed investment vehicles as defined by GAAP, we do not record them in our consolidated financial statements. A second type is utilized in connection with our asset backed commercial paper program, under which conduits administered by us sell commercial paper to our institutional clients, primarily mutual fund clients, as short term investments. We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of these conduits as defined by GAAP, and they are recorded in our consolidated financial statements. A third type is utilized in connection with our tax exempt investment program, under which trusts structure and sell certificated interests in pools of tax exempt investment grade assets, principally to our mutual fund clients. The activities associated with these vehicles are recorded in our consolidated financial statements, since we treat the underlying transactions as secured borrowings, not as sales, for accounting purposes. Additional information about the activities of the above described special purpose entities is provided in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. In the normal course of our business, we hold assets under custody and administration and assets under management in a custodial or fiduciary capacity for our clients, and, in accordance with GAAP, we do not record these assets in our consolidated statement of condition. Similarly, collateral funds associated with our securities finance activities are held by us as agent; therefore, we do not record these assets in our consolidated statement of condition. Additional information about these off balance sheet activities is provided in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. In the normal course of our business, we utilize derivative financial instruments to support our clients needs, to conduct our trading activities and to manage our interest rate and foreign currency risk. Additional 85 Table of Contents information about our use of derivative instruments is provided in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS Information with respect to recent accounting developments is provided in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The information set forth in the Market Risk section of Managements Discussion and Analysis, included under Item 7, is incorporated by reference herein.
