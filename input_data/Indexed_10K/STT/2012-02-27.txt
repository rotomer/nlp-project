ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS GENERAL State Street Corporation, the parent company, is a financial holding company headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this Managements Discussion and Analysis to State Street, we, us, our or similar terms mean State Street Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Our principal banking subsidiary is State Street Bank and Trust Company, or State Street Bank. At December 31, 2011, we had total assets of $216.83 billion, total deposits of $157.29 billion, total shareholders equity of $19.40 billion and 29,740 employees. With $21.81 trillion of assets under custody and administration and $1.86 trillion of assets under management at year end 2011, we are a leading specialist in meeting the needs of institutional investors worldwide. We have two lines of business: Investment Servicing provides services for U.S. mutual funds, collective investment funds and other investment pools, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, foundations and endowments worldwide. Products include custody, product and participant level accounting, daily pricing and administration; master trust and master custody; record keeping; foreign exchange, brokerage and other trading services; securities finance; deposit and short term investment facilities; loans and lease financing; investment manager and alternative investment manager operations outsourcing; and performance, risk and compliance analytics to support institutional investors. Investment Management, through State Street Global Advisors, or SSgA, provides a broad range of investment management strategies, specialized investment management advisory services and other financial services, such as securities finance, for corporations, public funds, and other sophisticated investors. Management strategies offered by SSgA include passive and active, such as enhanced indexing and hedge fund strategies, using quantitative and fundamental methods for both U.S. and non U.S. equity and fixed income securities. SSgA also offers exchange traded funds. For financial and other information about our lines of business, refer to Line of Business Information in this Managements Discussion and Analysis and note 24 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. This Managements Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. Certain previously reported amounts presented have been reclassified to conform to current period classifications. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., referred to as GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the application of certain accounting policies that materially affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Accounting policies that require management to make assumptions that are difficult, subjective or complex about matters that are uncertain and may change in subsequent periods are discussed in more depth under Significant Accounting Estimates in this Managements Discussion and Analysis. Certain financial information provided in this Managements Discussion and Analysis, or in other public statements, announcements or reports filed by us with the SEC, is prepared on both a GAAP, or reported, basis and a non GAAP, or operating, basis. Management measures and compares certain financial information on an operating basis, as it believes that this presentation supports meaningful comparisons from period to period and the analysis of comparable financial trends with respect to State Streets normal ongoing business operations. Management believes that operating basis financial information, which reports revenue from non taxable sources on a fully taxable equivalent basis and excludes the impact of revenue and expenses outside of the normal course of our business, facilitates an investors understanding and analysis of State Streets underlying financial performance and trends in addition to financial information prepared in conformity with GAAP. 40 Table of Contents This Managements Discussion and Analysis contains statements that are considered forward looking statements within the meaning of U.S. securities laws. Forward looking statements are based on our current expectations about revenue and market growth, acquisitions and divestitures, new technologies, services, opportunities, earnings and other matters that do not relate strictly to historical facts. These forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially. We undertake no obligation to revise the forward looking statements contained in this Managements Discussion and Analysis to reflect events after the time we file this Form 10 K with the SEC. Additional information about forward looking statements and related risks and uncertainties is provided in Risk Factors included under Item 1A.

Financial Highlights This section provides information related to significant actions we took in 2011, as well as highlights of our financial results for 2011 presented in the preceding table. Additional information is provided under Consolidated Results of Operations, which follows this section. Significant actions taken by us in 2011 included the following: We declared aggregate common stock dividends of $0.72 per share, or approximately $358 million, during the year. In 2010, we declared aggregate common stock dividends of $0.04 per share, or $20 million. The 2011 dividends represented the first increase in our common stock dividend since early 2009. Refer to Capital under Financial Condition in this Managements Discussion and Analysis. From May through November, we purchased approximately 16.3 million shares of our common stock under the publicly announced program approved by the Board of Directors in March 2011, at an aggregate cost of approximately $675 million. Shares remaining from these purchases were recorded as treasury stock in our consolidated statement of condition as of December 31, 2011. We had no remaining purchase authority under the program as of December 31, 2011. Refer to Capital under Financial Condition in this Managements Discussion and Analysis. We recorded aggregate restructuring charges of approximately $253 million, primarily in connection with two significant actions: the continuing implementation of our business operations and information technology transformation program ($133 million), and expense control measures designed to calibrate our expenses to our outlook for our capital markets facing businesses in 2012 ($120 million). The charges for the business operations and information technology transformation program consisted mainly of costs related to employee severance and information technology. In connection with our implementation of the program, we achieved approximately $86 million of pre tax, run rate expense savings in 2011 compared to 2010 run rate expenses, and we are seeking to achieve an additional $94 million of pre tax, run rate expense savings in 2012. These annual pre tax run rate savings relate only to the business operations and information technology transformation program. Our actual operating expenses may increase or decrease as a result of other factors. Refer to Expenses under Consolidated Results of Operations in this Managements Discussion and Analysis. We completed our acquisitions of Bank of Irelands asset management business, or BIAM, Complementa Investment Controlling AG, an investment performance measurement and analytics firm based in Switzerland, and Pulse Trading, Inc., a full service agency brokerage firm based in Boston, Massachusetts. Refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. We issued approximately $500 million of 4.956% junior subordinated debentures due 2018, in connection with a remarketing of the 6.001% junior subordinated debentures due 2042 originally issued to State Street 42 Table of Contents Capital Trust III in 2008. The 6.001% junior subordinated debentures were issued in connection with our concurrent offering of the trusts 8.25% fixed to floating rate normal automatic preferred enhanced capital securities, referred to as normal APEX. The original 6.001% junior subordinated debentures were canceled as a result of the remarketing transaction. Refer to Capital under Financial Condition in this Managements Discussion and Analysis and note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. We issued $500 million of our non cumulative perpetual preferred stock, series A, $100,000 liquidation preference per share, in connection with the above referenced remarketing transaction. The preferred stock was purchased by State Street Capital Trust III using the ultimate proceeds from the remarketing transaction, and now constitutes the principal asset of the trust. The preferred stock qualifies for inclusion in tier 1 regulatory capital under federal regulatory capital guidelines. We also issued an aggregate of $2 billion of senior notes, composed of $1 billion of 2.875% notes due 2016, $750 million of 4.375% notes due 2021 and $250 million of floating rate notes due 2014. Refer to Capital under Financial Condition in this Managements Discussion and Analysis and notes 9 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. Our financial results for 2011 included the following: Total revenue increased 7% compared to 2010. A 10% increase in total fee revenue from 2010 levels (primarily associated with increases in our core servicing and management fees) and higher net gains related to investment securities (mainly gains from sales of available for sale securities) were partly offset by a 14% decrease in net interest revenue. Net interest revenue was significantly affected by a 69% decline in discount accretion associated with former conduit securities, mainly the result of our December 2010 investment portfolio repositioning. Servicing and management fees were both up 11% from 2010. Servicing fee revenue increased mainly due to the impacts of new business and prior year acquisitions, and improvement in average equity market valuations compared to the prior year. Servicing fees generated outside the U.S. in 2011 were approximately 42% of total servicing fees, compared to approximately 41% in 2010. Management fee revenue increased primarily due to the improvement in equity markets, as well as the addition of revenue from the acquired BIAM business. Management fees generated outside the U.S. in 2011 were approximately 41% of total management fees, compared to 34% in 2010. Trading services revenue increased 10%, mainly from higher volumes of foreign exchange trading and higher electronic trading revenue in brokerage and other fees. Securities finance revenue increased 19% as a result of higher spreads, partly offset by lower lending volumes. Processing fees and other revenue declined 15%, mainly as a result of fair value adjustments related to positions in the fixed income trading initiative, as well as lower levels of net revenue from joint ventures. In 2011, we recorded net interest revenue of $2.33 billion, a 14% decline compared to $2.70 billion in 2010. These amounts included $220 million and $712 million, respectively, of discount accretion related to investment securities added to our consolidated statement of condition in connection with the 2009 conduit consolidation. Discount accretion is more fully discussed in Net Interest Revenue under Consolidated Results of Operations in this Managements Discussion and Analysis. On a fully taxable equivalent basis, 2011 net interest revenue declined 13%, from $2.83 billion in 2010 to $2.46 billion. These amounts reflect increases from tax equivalent adjustments of $128 million and $129 million, respectively. Both declines (reported basis and fully taxable equivalent) were primarily associated with the above described decline in discount accretion. The impact of these declines was partly offset by lower funding costs and the effect of higher levels of client deposits. Net interest margin, calculated on fully taxable equivalent net interest revenue, declined 57 basis points to 1.67% in 2011 from 2.24% in 2010. Total expenses of $7.06 billion increased 3% from $6.84 billion in 2010, and included acquisition and restructuring costs of $269 million. These costs were composed of $16 million associated with acquisitions (consisted of $71 million of acquisition related costs reduced by a $55 million indemnification benefit described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8) and $253 million associated with restructuring charges. Expenses from operations of $6.79 billion ($7.06 billion net of $269 million delineated 43 Table of Contents above) increased 10% compared to 2010 expenses from operations of $6.18 billion ($6.84 billion net of $666 million, composed of a $7 million tax on bonus payments to employees in the U.K., a $414 million securities lending charge and $245 million of acquisition and restructuring costs). The increase mainly resulted from increases in compensation and employee benefits expenses from merit adjustments and acquisitions, and higher levels of professional services expenses. In 2011, we secured mandates for approximately $1.41 trillion in assets to be serviced; of the total, $1.14 trillion was installed prior to December 31, 2011, with the remaining $270 billion expected to be installed in 2012. The new business not installed by December 31, 2011 was not included in assets under custody and administration at that date, and had no impact on servicing fee revenue for 2011, as the assets are not included until their installation is complete and we begin to service them. Once installed, the assets generate servicing fee revenue in subsequent periods. We will provide various services for these assets including accounting, fund administration, custody, foreign exchange, securities finance, transfer agency, performance analytics, compliance reporting and monitoring, hedge fund servicing, private equity administration, real estate administration, depository banking services, wealth management services and investment manager operations outsourcing. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This section discusses our consolidated results of operations for 2011 compared to 2010, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included under Item 8. A comparison of consolidated results of operations for 2010 with those for 2009 is provided under Comparison of 2010 and 2009 in this Managements Discussion and Analysis. TOTAL REVENUE Years ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 % Change2010 2011 (Dollars in millions) Fee revenue: Servicing fees $ 4,382 $ 3,938 $ 3,334 11 % Management fees 917 829 766 11 Trading services 1,220 1,106 1,094 10 Securities finance 378 318 570 19 Processing fees and other 297 349 171 (15 ) Total fee revenue 7,194 6,540 5,935 10 Net interest revenue: Interest revenue 2,946 3,462 3,286 (15 ) Interest expense 613 763 722 (20 ) Net interest revenue 2,333 2,699 2,564 (14 ) Gains (Losses) related to investment securities, net 67 (286 ) 141 Total revenue $ 9,594 $ 8,953 $ 8,640 7 Our broad range of services generates fee revenue and net interest revenue. Fee revenue generated by our investment servicing and investment management businesses is augmented by trading services, securities finance and processing fees and other revenue. We earn net interest revenue from client deposits and short term investment activities by providing deposit services and short term investment vehicles, such as repurchase agreements and commercial paper, to meet clients needs for high grade liquid investments, and investing these sources of funds and additional borrowings in assets yielding a higher rate. Fee Revenue Servicing and management fees collectively composed approximately 74% of our total fee revenue for 2011 and 73% for 2010. The level of these fees is influenced by several factors, including the mix and volume of assets under custody and administration and assets under management, securities positions held and the volume of portfolio transactions, and the types of products and services used by clients, and are generally affected by changes in worldwide equity and fixed income security valuations. 44 Table of Contents Generally, servicing fees are affected, in part, by changes in daily average valuations of assets under custody and administration, while management fees are affected by changes in month end valuations of assets under management. Additional factors, such as the level of transaction volumes, changes in service level, balance credits, client minimum balances, pricing concessions and other factors, may have a significant effect on our servicing fee revenue. Generally, management fee revenue is more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue. Management fees for enhanced index and actively managed products are generally earned at higher rates than those for passive products. Enhanced index and actively managed products may also involve performance fee arrangements. Performance fees are generated when the performance of certain managed funds exceeds benchmarks specified in the management agreements. Generally, we experience more volatility with performance fees than with more traditional management fees. In light of the above, we estimate, assuming all other factors remain constant, that a 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity values would result in a corresponding change in our total revenue of approximately 2%. If fixed income security values were to increase or decrease by 10%, we would anticipate a corresponding change of approximately 1% in our total revenue. The following table presents selected equity market indices as of and for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. Daily averages and the averages of month end indices demonstrate worldwide changes in equity market valuations that affect our servicing and management fee revenue, respectively. Year end indices affect the value of assets under custody and administration and assets under management at those dates. The index names listed in the table are service marks of their respective owners.

Products and services include custody; product and participant level accounting; daily pricing and administration; record keeping; investment manager and alternative investment manager operations outsourcing; master trust and master custody; and performance, risk and compliance analytics. We are the largest provider of mutual fund custody and accounting services in the U.S. We distinguish ourselves from other mutual fund service providers by offering clients a broad range of integrated products and services, including accounting, daily pricing and fund administration. At December 31, 2011, we calculated approximately 40.6% of the U.S. mutual fund prices provided to NASDAQ that appeared daily in The Wall 45 Table of Contents Street Journal and other publications with an accuracy rate of 99.87%. We serviced U.S. tax exempt assets for corporate and public pension funds, and we provided trust and valuation services for more than 5,500 daily priced portfolios at December 31, 2011. We are a service provider outside of the U.S. as well. In Germany, Italy and France, we provide depotbank services for retail and institutional fund assets, as well as custody and other services to pension plans and other institutional clients. In the U.K., we provide custody services for pension fund assets and administration services for mutual fund assets. At December 31, 2011, we serviced approximately $711 billion of offshore assets, primarily domiciled in Ireland, Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.04 trillion of assets under administration in the Asia/Pacific region, and in Japan, we held approximately 93% of the trust assets held by non domestic trust banks in that region. We are an alternative asset servicing provider worldwide, servicing hedge, private equity and real estate funds. At December 31, 2011, we had approximately $816 billion of alternative assets under administration. The 11% increase in servicing fees from 2010 primarily resulted from the impact on current period revenue of new business awarded to us and installed during 2011 and prior periods, the addition of a full year of revenue generated by the acquired Intesa securities services and Mourant International Finance Administration, or MIFA, businesses and increases in daily average equity market valuations. For 2011, servicing fees generated outside the U.S. were approximately 42% of total servicing fees compared to approximately 41% for 2010. At year end 2011, our total assets under custody and administration were $21.81 trillion, compared to $21.53 trillion a year earlier. The increase compared to 2010 was primarily the result of a higher level of new servicing business won and installed prior to December 31, 2011, partly offset by net client redemptions and distributions, as well as decreases in worldwide equity market valuations. These asset levels as of year end did not reflect new business awarded to us during 2011 that had not been installed prior to December 31, 2011. The value of assets under custody and administration is a broad measure of the relative size of various markets served. Changes in the values of assets under custody and administration do not necessarily result in proportional changes in our servicing fee revenue. Assets under custody and administration consisted of the following as of December 31: ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY AND ADMINISTRATION As of December 31, 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2010 2011AnnualGrowthRate 2007 2011CompoundAnnualGrowthRate (Dollars in billions) Mutual funds $ 5,265 $ 5,540 $ 4,734 $ 4,093 $ 5,200 (5 )% Collective funds 4,437 4,350 3,580 2,679 3,968 2 3 % Pension products 4,837 4,726 4,395 3,621 5,246 2 (2 ) Insurance and other products 7,268 6,911 6,086 5,514 5,799 5 6 Total $ 21,807 $ 21,527 $ 18,795 $ 15,907 $ 20,213 1 2 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT MIX OF ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY AND ADMINISTRATION As of December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (In billions) Equities $ 10,849 $ 11,000 $ 8,828 Fixed income 8,317 7,875 7,236 Short term and other investments 2,641 2,652 2,731 Total $ 21,807 $ 21,527 $ 18,795 46 Table of Contents GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY AND ADMINISTRATION(1) As of December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (In billions) United States $ 15,745 $ 15,889 $ 14,585 Other Americas 622 599 606 Europe/Middle East/Africa 4,400 4,067 2,773 Asia/Pacific 1,040 972 831 Total $ 21,807 $ 21,527 $ 18,795 (1) Geographic mix is based on the location at which the assets are custodied or serviced. Management Fees Through SSgA, we provide a broad range of investment management strategies, specialized investment management advisory services and other financial services for corporations, public funds, and other sophisticated investors. Based on assets under management at December 31, 2011, SSgA was the largest manager of institutional assets worldwide, the largest manager of assets for tax exempt organizations (primarily pension plans) in the U.S., and the third largest investment manager overall in the world. SSgA offers a broad array of investment management strategies, including passive and active, such as enhanced indexing and hedge fund strategies, using quantitative and fundamental methods for both U.S. and global equities and fixed income securities. SSgA also offers exchange traded funds, or ETFs, such as the SPDR&reg; ETF brand. The 11% increase in management fees from 2010 resulted primarily from the impact of increases in average month end equity market valuations, the addition of revenue from the acquired BIAM business and, to a lesser extent, the impact of new business won and installed during 2011 and prior periods. Average month end equity market valuations, individually presented in the foregoing INDEX table, increased an average of 12% compared to 2010. Management fees generated outside the U.S. were approximately 41% of total management fees for 2011, up from 34% for 2010. At year end 2011, assets under management were $1.86 trillion, compared to $2.01 trillion at year end 2010. Such amounts include assets of the SPDR&reg; Gold ETF, for which we act as distribution agent rather than investment manager, and certain assets managed for the U.S. government under programs adopted during the financial crisis. While certain management fees are directly determined by the value of assets under management and the investment strategy employed, management fees reflect other factors as well, including our relationship pricing for clients who use multiple services, and the benchmarks specified in the respective management agreements related to performance fees. The overall decrease in assets under management at December 31, 2011 compared to December 31, 2010, which can be seen in the tables that follow this discussion, generally reflected net lost business (including the planned reduction associated with the U.S. Treasurys winding down of its portfolio of agency guaranteed mortgage backed securities) and depreciation in the values of the assets managed. These decreases were partly offset by the addition of approximately $23 billion of managed assets from the BIAM acquisition. Passive fixed income assets under management declined 32% year over year, mainly reflective of the sale of U.S. government securities associated with the U.S. Treasurys winding down of its mortgage backed securities portfolio. Managed cash balances declined 11%, and reflected the effect of reductions of securities lending volumes associated with continued weak loan demand. These declines were partly offset by an increase in sales of passive exchange traded funds as well as other actively managed products. The net lost business of $140 billion for 2011 presented in the following analysis of activity in assets under management does not reflect $20 billion of new business awarded to us during 2011 that had not been installed prior to December 31, 2011.

We earn foreign exchange trading revenue by acting as a market maker. We offer a range of foreign exchange, or FX, products, services and execution models which focus on clients global requirements for our proprietary research and the execution of trades in any time zone. Most of our FX products and execution models can be grouped into three broad categories: direct FX, indirect FX, and electronic trading. Foreign exchange trading revenue is influenced by three principal factors: the volume and type of client foreign exchange transactions; currency volatility; and the management of currency market risks. We also offer a range of brokerage and other trading products tailored specifically to meet the needs of the global pension community, including transition management, commission recapture and self directed brokerage. These products are differentiated by our position as an agent of the institutional investor. Direct and indirect FX revenue is recorded in foreign exchange trading revenue; revenue from electronic trading is recorded in brokerage and other trading services revenue. Trading services revenue increased 10%, to $1.22 billion, for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $1.11 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. In the same comparison, foreign exchange trading revenue increased 14% to $683 million for 2011 from $597 million for 2010. The increase resulted from higher client volumes, which were up 10%, partly offset by a 4% decline in currency volatility. We enter into FX transactions with clients and investment managers that contact our trading desk directly. These trades are all executed at negotiated rates. We refer to this activity, and our market making activities, as direct FX. Alternatively, clients or their investment managers may elect to route FX transactions to our FX desk through our asset servicing operation; we refer to this activity as indirect FX. We execute indirect FX trades as a principal at rates based on a published formula. We calculate revenue for indirect FX using an attribution methodology based on estimated effective mark ups/downs and observed client volumes. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, our indirect FX revenue was approximately $331 million and $336 million, respectively, a decline of approximately 1% year over year. All other FX revenue not included in this indirect FX revenue, and unrelated to electronic trading, is considered by us to be direct FX revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, our direct FX revenue was $352 million and $261 million, respectively, an increase of approximately 35% year over year. For the year ended December 31, 2009, our indirect FX revenue was approximately $369 million, and our direct FX revenue was $308 million. Our clients may choose to execute FX transactions through one of our electronic trading platforms. This service generates revenue through a click fee. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, our revenue from electronic FX trading platforms, which is recorded in brokerage and other trading services revenue, was $282 million and $240 million, respectively, an increase of approximately 18% year over year. During 2011, particularly in the second half of the year, some of our clients who relied on our indirect model to execute their FX transactions transitioned to other methods to conduct their FX transactions. Through State Street, they can transition to either direct FX execution, including our Street FX service where trades are executed at agreed upon benchmarks, where State Street continues to act as a principal market maker, or to one of our electronic trading platforms. Brokerage and other trading services revenue increased 6% to $537 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $509 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was largely related to higher electronic trading volumes and higher trading profits, partly offset by lower levels of revenue from transition management. Our transition management revenue was adversely affected by compliance issues in our U.K. business, the reputational impact of which may adversely affect our revenue from transition management in 2012. Securities Finance Our securities finance business consists of two components: investment funds with a broad range of investment objectives which are managed by SSgA and engage in agency securities lending, which we refer to as the SSgA lending funds; and an agency lending program for third party investment managers and asset owners, which we refer to as the agency lending funds. 49 Table of Contents Our securities finance business provides liquidity to the financial markets, as well as an effective means for clients to earn incremental revenue on their securities portfolios. By acting as a lending agent and coordinating loans between lenders and borrowers, we lend securities and provide liquidity to clients worldwide. Borrowers provide collateral in the form of cash or securities to State Street in return for loaned securities. Borrowers are generally required to provide collateral equal to a contractually agreed percentage equal to or in excess of the fair value of the loaned securities. As the fair value of the loaned securities changes, additional collateral is provided by the borrower or collateral is returned to the borrower. Such movements are typically referred to as daily mark to market collateral adjustments. We also participate in securities lending transactions as a principal, rather than an agent. As principal, we borrow securities from the lending client and then lend such securities to the subsequent borrower, either a State Street client or a broker/dealer. Our involvement as principal is utilized when the lending client is unable to transact directly with the market and requires us to execute the transaction and furnish the securities. We provide our credit rating to the transaction as well as our ability to source securities through our assets under custody and administration. For cash collateral, our clients pay a usage fee to the provider of the cash collateral, and we invest the cash collateral in certain investment vehicles or managed accounts as directed by the owner of the loaned securities. In some cases, the investment vehicles or managed accounts may be managed by SSgA. The spread between the yield on the investment vehicle and the usage fee paid to the provider of the collateral is split between the lender of the securities and State Street as agent. For non cash collateral, the borrower pays a fee for the loaned securities, and the fee is split between the lender of the securities and State Street. Securities finance revenue, composed of our split of both the spreads related to cash collateral and the fees related to non cash collateral, is principally a function of the volume of securities on loan and the interest rate spreads and fees earned on the underlying collateral. For 2011, securities finance revenue increased 19% from 2010, substantially the result of higher spreads across all lending programs, partly offset by a 9% decrease in average lending volumes. Average spreads increased 28% for 2011 compared to 2010, and securities on loan averaged $361 billion for 2011 compared to $396 billion for 2010. As previously reported, in December 2010, we divided certain of the agency lending collateral pools into liquidity pools, from which clients can obtain cash redemptions, and duration pools, which are restricted and operate as liquidating accounts. These actions were taken to provide greater flexibility to participants with respect to their control of their level of participation in our agency lending program. As of December 31, 2011, the aggregate net assets of the liquidity pools and duration pools were $25.3 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively, compared to $26.2 billion and $11.8 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2010. The decline in the aggregate net assets of the duration pools from year end 2010 reflected both pay downs on securities held by some of the pools and in kind redemptions by clients into separately managed accounts. These declines were partly offset by improvement in the market value of securities held by the pools. The return obligations of participants in the agency lending program represented by interests in the duration pools exceeded the market value of the assets in the duration pools by approximately $198 million as of December 31, 2011, compared to $319 million as of December 31, 2010. This amount is expected to be eliminated as the assets in the duration pools mature or pay down. Market influences continued to affect our revenue from, and the profitability of, our securities lending activities during 2011, and may do so in future periods. As long as securities lending spreads remain below the levels generally experienced prior to late 2007, client demand is likely to remain at a reduced level and our revenues from our securities lending activities will be adversely affected relative to the revenues we earned in 2007, 2008 (which were extraordinarily high) and 2009. In addition, proposed or anticipated regulatory changes may affect the volume of our securities lending activity and related revenue in future periods. Processing Fees and Other Processing fees and other revenue includes diverse types of fees and revenue, including fees from our structured products business, fees from software licensing and maintenance, equity income from our joint venture 50 Table of Contents investments, gains and losses on sales of leased equipment and other assets, and amortization of our investments in tax advantaged financings. Processing fees and other revenue declined 15% to $297 million for 2011, from $349 million for 2010. This decrease primarily resulted from fair value adjustments related to positions in the fixed income trading initiative, as well as lower net revenue from joint ventures. NET INTEREST REVENUE Net interest revenue is defined as total interest revenue earned on interest earning assets less interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities. Interest earning assets, which principally consist of investment securities, interest bearing deposits with banks, repurchase agreements, loans and leases and other liquid assets, are financed primarily by client deposits, short term borrowings and long term debt. Net interest margin represents the relationship between annualized fully taxable equivalent net interest revenue and total average interest earning assets for the period. Revenue that is exempt from income taxes, mainly that earned from certain investment securities (state and political subdivisions), is adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent basis using a federal statutory income tax rate of 35%, adjusted for applicable state income taxes, net of the related federal tax benefit. The following tables present the components of average interest earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities, related interest revenue and interest expense, and rates earned and paid, for the periods indicated: 2011 2010 2009 Years ended December 31, AverageBalance InterestRevenue/Expense Rate AverageBalance InterestRevenue/Expense Rate AverageBalance InterestRevenue/Expense Rate (Dollars in millions; fully taxable equivalent basis) Interest bearing deposits with banks $ 20,241 $ 149 .74 % $ 13,550 $ 93 .69 % $ 24,162 $ 156 .64 % Securities purchased under resale agreements 4,686 28 .61 2,957 24 .83 3,701 24 .65 Federal funds sold 68 .29 Trading account assets 2,013 .01 376 1,914 20 1.02 Investment securities 103,075 2,615 2.54 96,123 3,140 3.27 81,190 2,943 3.63 Investment securities purchased under AMLF(1) 882 25 2.86 Loans and leases 12,180 280 2.30 12,094 331 2.73 9,703 242 2.49 Other interest earning assets 5,462 2 .03 1,156 3 .24 1,303 2 .15 Total interest earning assets $ 147,657 $ 3,074 2.08 $ 126,256 $ 3,591 2.84 $ 122,923 $ 3,412 2.78 Interest bearing deposits: U.S. $ 4,049 $ 11 .27 % $ 8,632 $ 37 .43 % $ 7,616 $ 61 .81 % Non U.S. 84,011 209 .25 68,326 176 .26 61,551 134 .22 Securities sold under repurchase agreements 9,040 10 .11 8,108 4 .05 11,065 3 .03 Federal funds purchased 845 .05 1,759 1 .05 956 .04 Short term borrowings under AMLF(1) 877 18 2.02 Other short term borrowings 5,134 86 1.67 13,590 252 1.86 16,847 197 1.17 Long term debt 8,966 289 3.22 8,681 286 3.30 7,917 304 3.84 Other interest bearing liabilities 3,535 8 .24 940 7 .69 1,131 5 .46 Total interest bearing liabilities $ 115,580 $ 613 .53 $ 110,036 $ 763 .69 $ 107,960 $ 722 .67 Interest rate spread 1.55 % 2.15 % 2.11 % Net interest revenue fully taxable equivalent basis $ 2,461 $ 2,828 $ 2,690 Net interest margin fully taxable equivalent basis 1.67 % 2.24 % 2.19 % Tax equivalent adjustment $ (128 ) $ (129 ) $ (126 ) Net interest revenue GAAP basis $ 2,333 $ 2,699 $ 2,564 (1) Amounts represent averages of asset backed commercial paper purchases from eligible unaffiliated money market mutual funds under the Federal Reserves Asset Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, or AMLF, and associated borrowings. The AMLF expired in February 2010. 51 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010, average interest earning assets were higher, mainly as a result of the impact of increases in interest bearing and noninterest bearing client deposits, as well as growth in the investment portfolio. The increases in average deposits resulted from the additional deposits placed with us by clients amid market and public concerns related to various economic events, as well as the full year to date impact of the acquired Intesa securities services business on 2011 aggregate deposits. The growth in the investment portfolio resulted from our continued re investment strategy. The incremental deposits were invested with the Federal Reserve and other central banks and used to reduce our U.S. interest bearing deposits and other short term borrowings. The investment of the incremental noninterest bearing deposits generated net interest revenue, but because the invested deposits increased our average interest earning assets, they negatively affected our net interest margin. Securities purchased under resale agreements increased as we reduced our U.S. Treasury holdings, given the extremely low yields offered for such investments. For the year ended December 31, 2011, fully taxable equivalent net interest revenue declined 13% compared to the same period in 2010. On a GAAP basis, net interest revenue declined 14% compared to the same period in 2010. The declines were mainly the result of lower discount accretion, more fully described below. The level of accretion recorded was affected by sales of securities, particularly the December 2010 investment portfolio repositioning, and pay downs. If the conduit related discount accretion were excluded, fully taxable equivalent net interest revenue for 2011 would have been $2.24 billion ($2.46 billion presented in the preceding table less accretion of $220 million) compared to $2.12 billion ($2.83 billion presented in the preceding table less accretion of $712 million) for 2010. This increase was primarily the result of lower funding costs, as market rates dropped throughout the year. In addition, higher levels of client deposits replaced interest bearing short term funding, with the excess deposits invested with the Federal Reserve and non U.S. central banks. Subsequent to the 2009 conduit consolidation, we have recorded aggregate discount accretion in interest revenue of $1.55 billion ($621 million in 2009, $712 million in 2010 and $220 million in 2011). The timing and ultimate recognition of discount accretion depends, in part, on factors that are outside of our control, including anticipated prepayment speeds and credit quality. The impact of these factors is uncertain and can be significantly influenced by general economic and financial market conditions. The timing and recognition of discount accretion can also be influenced by our ongoing management of the risks and other characteristics associated with our investment portfolio, including sales of securities which would otherwise generate accretion, such as the December 2010 investment portfolio repositioning. Depending on the factors discussed above, among others, we anticipate that, until the former conduit securities remaining in our portfolio mature or are sold, discount accretion will continue to contribute to our net interest revenue, and may increase the volatility of our net interest revenue and margin. The December 2010 portfolio repositioning resulted in a significant decrease in the discount accretion that we recognized in 2011, and that we expect to recognize in future periods. Assuming that we hold the remaining former conduit securities to maturity, all other things equal, we expect the remaining former conduit securities carried in our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2011 to generate aggregate discount accretion in future periods of approximately $1.10 billion over their remaining terms, with approximately half of this aggregate discount accretion to be recorded over the next four years. Changes in the components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are discussed in more detail below. Additional detail about the components of interest revenue and interest expense is provided in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. Interest bearing deposits with banks, including cash balances maintained at the Federal Reserve to satisfy reserve requirements, averaged $20.24 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011, a significant increase compared to $13.55 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. An average of $9.50 billion was held at the Federal Reserve Bank during 2011, compared to $4.98 billion held during 2010, with balances in both periods exceeding minimum reserve requirements. The significant increase in the annual comparison reflected growth in noninterest bearing client deposits. 52 Table of Contents Average securities purchased under resale agreements increased to $4.69 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $2.96 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. Average trading account assets increased to $2.01 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $376 million for 2010. Averages benefited largely from an increase in client demand associated with our trading activities. In connection with these activities, we traded in highly liquid fixed income securities as principal with our custody clients and other third parties that trade in these securities. Our average investment securities portfolio increased to $103.08 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $96.12 billion for 2010. The increase was generally the result of ongoing purchases of securities, partly offset by maturities and sales. In December 2010, we repositioned our portfolio by selling approximately $11 billion of mortgage and asset backed securities and re investing approximately $7 billion of the proceeds, primarily in agency mortgage backed securities. The repositioning was undertaken to enhance our regulatory capital ratios under evolving regulatory capital standards, increase our balance sheet flexibility in deploying our capital, and reduce our exposure to certain asset classes. During 2011, we purchased $54 billion of highly rated U.S. Treasury securities, federal agency mortgage backed securities and U.S. and non U.S. asset backed securities. As of December 31, 2011, securities rated AAA and AA comprised approximately 89% of our portfolio, compared to 90% rated AAA and AA as of December 31, 2010. Loans and leases averaged $12.18 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $12.09 billion for 2010. The increases primarily resulted from higher client demand for short duration liquidity, offset in part by a decrease in leases and the purchased receivables added in connection with the conduit consolidation, mainly from maturities and pay downs. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 29% and 27%, respectively, of our average loan and lease portfolio was composed of short duration advances that provided liquidity to clients in support of their investment activities related to securities settlement. The following table presents average U.S. and non U.S. short duration advances for the years indicated: Years Ended December 31, (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Average U.S. short duration advances $ 1,994 $ 1,924 $ 2,213 Average non U.S. short duration advances 1,585 1,366 761 Total average short duration advances $ 3,579 $ 3,290 $ 2,974 For the year ended December 31, 2011, the increase in average non U.S. short duration advances compared to the prior year period was mainly due to activity associated with clients added in connection with the acquired Intesa securities services business. Average other interest earning assets increased to $5.46 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $1.16 billion for 2010. The increase was primarily the result of higher levels of cash collateral provided in connection with our role as principal in certain securities borrowing activities. Average interest bearing deposits increased to $88.06 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $76.96 billion for 2010. The increase reflected client deposits added in connection with the May 2010 acquisition of the Intesa securities services business, and higher levels of non U.S. transaction accounts associated with new and existing business in assets under custody and administration. Average other short term borrowings declined to $5.13 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $13.59 billion for 2010, as the higher levels of client deposits provided additional liquidity. Average long term debt increased to $8.97 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $8.68 billion for the same period in 2010. The increase primarily reflected the issuance of an aggregate of $2 billion of senior notes by us in March 2011, partly offset by the maturities of $1 billion of senior notes in February 2011 and $1.45 billion of senior notes in September 2011, both previously issued by State Street Bank under the FDICs Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program. Additional information about our long term debt is provided in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. 53 Table of Contents Average other interest bearing liabilities increased to $3.54 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $940 million for 2010. The increase was primarily the result of higher levels of client cash collateral received in connection with our role as principal in certain securities lending activities. Several factors could affect future levels of our net interest revenue and margin, including the mix of client liabilities; actions of the various central banks; changes in U.S. and non U.S. interest rates; the various yield curves around the world; the amount of discount accretion generated by the former conduit securities that remain in our investment portfolio; and the relative impact of the yields earned on the securities purchased by us with the proceeds from the December 2010 portfolio repositioning and other maturities compared to the yields earned on the securities sold or matured. Based on market conditions and other factors, we have continued to re invest the proceeds from pay downs and maturities of securities in highly rated investment securities, such as U.S. Treasuries and federal agency mortgage backed securities and U.S. and non U.S. mortgage and asset backed securities. The pace at which we continue to re invest and the types of securities purchased will depend on the impact of market conditions and other factors over time. These factors and the level of interest rates worldwide are expected to dictate what effect our re investment program will have on future levels of our net interest revenue and net interest margin. Gains (Losses) Related to Investment Securities, Net From time to time, in connection with our ongoing management of the investment portfolio, we sell available for sale securities, to manage risk, to take advantage of favorable market conditions, or for other reasons. In 2011, we recorded net realized gains of $140 million from sales of approximately $16.27 billion of available for sale securities, compared to net realized losses of $55 million from sales of approximately $29.41 billion of investment securities in 2010. The $55 million of net losses realized during 2010 included the $344 million net realized loss that resulted from the December 2010 investment portfolio repositioning described earlier under Net Interest Revenue. The aggregate unrealized loss on securities for which other than temporary impairment was recorded in 2011 was $123 million. Of this total, $50 million related to factors other than credit, and was recognized, net of taxes, as a component of other comprehensive income in our consolidated statement of condition. We recorded losses from other than temporary impairment related to credit of the remaining $73 million in our 2011 consolidated statement of income, compared to $231 million in 2010, which resulted from our assessment of impairment. For 2011, the substantial majority of the impairment losses related to non agency mortgage backed securities which management concluded had experienced credit losses resulting from deterioration in financial performance of those securities during the year. The securities are reported as asset backed securities in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. Years ended December 31, 2011 2010 (In millions) Net realized gains (losses) from sales of investment securities(1) $ 140 $ (55 ) Gross losses from other than temporary impairment (123 ) (651 ) Losses not related to credit 50 420 Net impairment losses (73 ) (231 ) Gains (Losses) related to investment securities, net $ 67 $ (286 ) Impairment associated with expected credit losses $ (42 ) $ (203 ) Impairment associated with managements intent to sell the impaired securities prior to their recovery in value (8 ) (1 ) Impairment associated with adverse changes in timing of expected future cash flows (23 ) (27 ) Net impairment losses $ (73 ) $ (231 ) (1) Amount for 2010 included the net loss of $344 million associated with the repositioning of the investment portfolio. 54 Table of Contents We regularly review the investment securities portfolio to identify other than temporary impairment of individual securities. Impairment related to expected losses represents the difference between the discounted values of the expected future cash flows from the securities compared to their current amortized cost basis, with each discount rate commensurate with the effective yield on the underlying security. For debt securities held to maturity, other than temporary impairment remaining after credit related impairment (which credit related impairment is recorded in our consolidated statement of income) is recognized, net of taxes, as a component of other comprehensive income in the shareholders equity section of our consolidated statement of condition, and is accreted prospectively over the remaining terms of the securities based on the timing of their estimated future cash flows. For other than temporary impairment of debt securities that results from our decision to sell the security prior to its recovery in value, the entire difference between the securitys fair value and its amortized cost basis is recorded in our consolidated statement of income. Additional information about investment securities, the gross gains and losses that compose the net sale gains and our process to identify other than temporary impairment, is provided in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES We recorded no provisions for loan losses in 2011, compared to $25 million in 2010. The substantial majority of the provision recorded in 2010 resulted from changes in expectations with respect to future cash flows from certain commercial real estate, or CRE, loan portfolio acquired in 2008 pursuant to indemnified repurchase agreements with an affiliate of Lehman as a result of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. The CRE loans are reviewed on a quarterly basis, and any provisions for loan losses that are recorded reflect managements current expectations with respect to future cash flows from these loans, based on an assessment of economic conditions in the commercial real estate market and other factors. Future changes in expectations with respect to these loans could result in additional provisions for loan losses.

Independent of the restructuring charges presented in the table above, compensation and employee benefits expenses included non recurring costs associated with the business operations and information technology transformation program of approximately $47 million for 2011. Information systems and communications expenses for 2011 increased over the prior year, primarily as a result of higher levels of spending on telecommunications hardware and software related to improvements in our investor technology and global infrastructure, as well as the inclusion of the expenses of the acquired Intesa securities services business and MIFA for the full year versus part of 2010. Transaction processing services expenses for 2011 increased over the prior year primarily as a result of higher levels of spending on external contract services; higher broker and sub custodian fees; and the inclusion of the expenses of the acquired Intesa securities services business for the full year versus part of 2010. The increase in aggregate other expenses (professional services, amortization of other intangible assets, securities processing costs (recoveries), regulator fees and assessments and other costs) for 2011 compared to 2010 resulted primarily from the impact of litigation and higher levels of advertising costs on professional fees, as well as lower levels of insurance recoveries received in 2011 compared to 2010. In addition, amortization increased as a result of higher levels of other intangible assets, mainly those recorded in connection with the acquired Intesa securities services and MIFA businesses. The increase in the other costs component of aggregate other expenses was mainly the result of significant insurance recoveries received in 2010. These increases were offset slightly by a lower level of funding provided to our charitable foundation. The $115 million of insurance recoveries that reduced other expenses for 2010 was received with respect to settlement payments made by us to clients in prior periods in connection with certain active fixed income strategies managed by SSgA prior to August 2007. We account for insurance recoveries as gains when payments for the recoveries are received. Acquisition Costs In 2011, we incurred acquisition costs of $71 million, substantially related to integration costs incurred in connection with our acquisitions of BIAM, the Intesa securities services business and MIFA. These acquisition costs were offset by a $55 million indemnification benefit for an income tax claim related to the 2010 acquisition of the Intesa securities services business. Refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for additional information with respect to the indemnification benefit. Restructuring Charges In 2011, we recorded $253 million of aggregate restructuring charges in connection with two significant plans our continued implementation of our business operations and information technology transformation program ($133 million), and expense control measures designed to calibrate our expenses to our outlook for our capital markets facing businesses in 2012 ($120 million). Each of these plans is described below. Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program In November 2010, we announced a global multi year business operations and information technology transformation program. The program includes operational, information technology and targeted cost initiatives, including plans related to reductions in both staff and occupancy costs. 56 Table of Contents With respect to our business operations, we are standardizing certain core business processes, primarily through our execution of the State Street LEAN methodology, and driving automation of these business processes. We are currently creating a new technology platform, including transferring certain core software applications to a private cloud, and have expanded our use of service providers associated with components of our technology infrastructure and application maintenance and support. We expect the transfer of core software applications to a private cloud to occur primarily in 2013 and 2014. To implement this program, we expect to incur aggregate pre tax restructuring charges of approximately $400 million to $450 million over the four year period ending December 31, 2014. To date, we have recorded aggregate restructuring charges of $289 million in our consolidated statement of income, composed of $156 million in 2010 and $133 million in 2011. The following table presents the charges by type of cost: (In millions) Employee RelatedCosts Real EstateConsolidation InformationTechnology Costs Total 2010 $ 105 $ 51 $ 156 2011 85 7 $ 41 133 Total $ 190 $ 58 $ 41 $ 289 The employee related costs included costs related to severance, benefits and outplacement services. Real estate consolidation costs resulted from actions taken to reduce our occupancy costs through consolidation of leases and properties. Information technology costs included transition fees related to the above described expansion of our use of service providers. In 2010, in connection with the program, we initiated the involuntary termination of 1,400 employees, or approximately 5% of our global workforce, which was substantially complete at the end of 2011. In addition, in the third quarter of 2011, in connection with the expansion of our use of service providers associated with our information technology infrastructure and application maintenance and support, we identified 530 employees who will be provided with severance and outplacement services as their roles are eliminated. As of December 31, 2011, in connection with the planned aggregate staff reductions of 1,930 employees described above, 1,332 employees had been involuntarily terminated and left State Street, including 782 employees in 2011. In connection with our continued implementation of the business operations and information technology transformation program, we achieved approximately $86 million of annual pre tax, run rate expense savings in 2011 compared to 2010 run rate expenses. Excluding the expected aggregate restructuring charges of $400 million to $450 million described earlier, we expect the program to reduce our pre tax expenses from operations, on an annualized basis, by approximately $575 million to $625 million by the end of 2014 compared to 2010, with the full effect realized in 2015. Assuming all other things equal, we expect to achieve aggregate annual pre tax expense savings of approximately $540 million by the end of 2014, for a total annual pre tax expense savings of approximately $600 million to be realized in 2015. We expect the business operations transformation component of the program to result in annual pre tax expense savings of approximately $440 million in 2015, with the majority of these savings expected to be achieved by the end of 2013. In addition, we expect the information technology transformation component of the program to result in annual pre tax expense savings of approximately $160 million in 2015. These annual pre tax run rate savings relate only to the business operations and information technology transformation program. Our actual operating expenses may increase or decrease as a result of other factors. The majority of the annualized savings will affect compensation and employee benefits expenses; these savings will be modestly offset by increases in information systems and communications expenses as we implement the program. 2011 Expense Control Measures During the fourth quarter of 2011, in connection with expense control measures designed to calibrate our expenses to our outlook for our capital markets facing businesses in 2012, we took two actions. First, we 57 Table of Contents withdrew from our fixed income trading initiative, under which we traded in fixed income securities and derivatives as principal with our custody clients and other third parties that trade in these securities and derivatives. We undertook this withdrawal as a result of continuing market turmoil, as well as evolving regulatory changes that likely would have required us to increase our regulatory capital and expenses associated with this initiative. Second, we instituted targeted staff reductions. As a result of these actions, we recorded restructuring charges of $120 million in our 2011 consolidated statement of income. The following table presents the charges by type of cost: (In millions) Employee related costs $ 62 Fixed income trading portfolio 38 Asset and other write offs 20 Total $ 120 The employee related costs included costs related to severance, benefits and outplacement services related to both aspects of the expense control measures. In connection with these measures, we identified 442 employees who will be provided with severance and outplacement services as their roles are eliminated. As of December 31, 2011, 15 employees had been involuntarily terminated and left State Street, and an additional 184 employees were involuntarily terminated and left State Street in January 2012. The fixed income trading portfolio related costs resulted from fair value adjustments to the initiatives trading portfolio related to our decision to withdraw from the initiative. Costs for asset and other write offs related to other asset write downs and contract terminations. As a result of the withdrawal from the fixed income trading initiative, we intend to wind down that initiatives remaining derivatives portfolio. At December 31, 2011, this portfolio consisted primarily of derivative assets with an aggregate fair value of approximately $1.89 billion and derivative liabilities with an aggregate fair value of approximately $1.78 billion. In future periods during which the portfolio is wound down, the impact of economic and market conditions, including changes in credit profiles and currency and yield spreads, on the valuation of, or trade execution for, the portfolio could result in additional fair value adjustments. Aggregate Restructuring Related Accrual Activity The following table presents aggregate activity associated with accruals that resulted from the charges associated with the business operations and information technology transformation program and the 2011 expense control measures: (In millions) Employee RelatedCosts Real EstateConsolidation InformationTechnologyCosts Fixed IncomeTradingPortfolio Asset andOther Write offs Total Initial accrual for business operations and information technology transformation program $ 105 $ 51 $ 156 Payments (15 ) (4 ) (19 ) Balance at December 31, 2010 90 47 137 Additional accruals for business operations and information technology transformation program 85 7 $ 41 133 Accruals for expense control measures 62 $ 38 $ 20 120 Payments and adjustments (75 ) (15 ) (8 ) (5 ) (103 ) Balance at December 31, 2011 $ 162 $ 39 $ 33 $ 38 $ 15 $ 287 58 Table of Contents Income Taxes We recorded income tax expense of $616 million for 2011, compared to $530 million for 2010. Our effective tax rate for 2011 was 24.3% compared to 25.4% for 2010. Each of 2011 and 2010 reflected discrete tax benefits ($103 million in 2011 and $180 million in 2010) related to transactions in connection with which we incurred costs to terminate funding obligations that supported former conduit asset structures. In addition, income tax expense for 2011 included $55 million related to a settlement with Italian tax authorities associated with tax assessments issued to an Italian banking subsidiary acquired by us in connection with our acquisition of the Intesa securities services business. We recorded an offsetting indemnification benefit in acquisition costs, as described earlier under Expenses. Refer to notes 2 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for additional information about the tax settlement and income taxes. LINE OF BUSINESS INFORMATION We have two lines of business: Investment Servicing and Investment Management. Given our services and management organization, the results of operations for these lines of business are not necessarily comparable with those of other companies, including companies in the financial services industry. Information about our two lines of business, as well as the revenues, expenses and capital allocation methodologies with respect to these lines of business, is provided in note 24 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. The following is a summary of our line of business results. The Other column for 2011 represented integration costs associated with acquisitions and restructuring charges associated with our business operations and information technology transformation program ($133 million) and expense control measures ($120 million), both described in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. The Other column for 2010 represented the net loss from sales of investment securities associated with the December 2010 investment portfolio repositioning, restructuring charges associated with our business operations and information technology transformation program, and integration costs associated with acquisitions. The amounts presented in the Other column for 2009 represented net interest revenue earned in connection with our participation in the Federal Reserves AMLF and integration costs recorded in connection with our 2007 acquisition of Investors Financial. The amounts in the Other columns were not allocated to State Streets business lines. 59 Table of Contents In 2011, management revised its methodology with respect to funds transfer pricing, which is used in the measurement of business unit net interest revenue. Net interest revenue and average assets for 2010 have been restated for comparative purposes to reflect the revised methodology. Amounts for 2009 were not restated.

The increase in total fee revenue generally related to servicing fees, securities finance and trading services revenue, and was partly offset by a decline in processing fees and other revenue. The increase in servicing fees in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily resulted from the impact on current period revenue of new business awarded to us and installed during 2011 and prior periods, the full year impact of revenue generated by the acquired Intesa securities services and MIFA businesses and increases in daily average equity market valuations. Securities finance revenue increased 26% primarily as a result of the effect of higher spreads, partly offset by a decline in average lending volumes. Trading services revenue increased 10% compared to 2010, as a result of an increase in foreign exchange trading revenue related to higher client trading volumes, partly offset by a decline in currency volatility. Servicing fees, trading services revenue and gains (losses) related to investment securities, net, for our Investment Servicing business line are identical to the respective consolidated results. Refer to Servicing Fees, Trading Services and Gains (Losses) Related to Investment Securities, Net under Total Revenue in this Managements Discussion and Analysis for a more in depth discussion. A discussion of processing fees and other revenue is provided in Processing Fees and Other under Total Revenue. Net interest revenue declined 15% compared to 2010, primarily as a result of lower conduit related discount accretion. The level of accretion recorded in 2011 was significantly affected by our December 2010 investment portfolio repositioning. A portion of net interest revenue is allocated to the Investment Management business line based on the volume of client liabilities attributable to that line of business. 60 Table of Contents Total expenses from operations increased 8% from 2010, primarily because of higher compensation and employee benefits expenses, which resulted from year over year salary adjustments, the inclusion of the expenses of the acquired Intesa securities services business and MIFA for a full year, increased staff and external contract services, and higher payroll taxes. Investment Management Total revenue for 2011 increased 6% compared to 2010, generally the result of higher levels of management fees. The 11% increase in management fees, generated by SSgA, resulted primarily from the impact of increases in average month end equity market valuations, the addition of revenue from the acquired BIAM business and, to a lesser extent, the impact of new business won and installed during 2011 and prior periods. Securities finance revenue declined 15% because of reduced utilization of lendable assets in the SSgA lending funds and the transition of assets by clients from lending to non lending products. Management fees for the Investment Management business line are identical to the respective consolidated results. Refer to Management Fees under Total Revenue in this Managements Discussion and Analysis for a more in depth discussion. A discussion of securities finance revenue and processing fees and other revenue is provided in Securities Finance and Processing Fees and Other under Total Revenue. Total expenses from operations increased 20% from 2010. The increase was mainly reflective of higher compensation and employee benefits expenses related to year over year salary adjustments and increased staff, as well as significant insurance recoveries received in 2010. COMPARISON OF 2010 AND 2009 OVERVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Years ended December 31, 2010(1) 2009 % Change (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Total fee revenue $ 6,540 $ 5,935 10 % Net interest revenue 2,699 2,564 5 Gains (Losses) related to investment securities, net(2) (286 ) 141 Total revenue 8,953 8,640 4 Provision for loan losses 25 149 Total expenses 6,842 5,966 15 Income before income tax expense and extraordinary loss 2,086 2,525 (17 ) Income tax expense 530 722 (27 ) Net income 1,556 1,803 (14 ) Extraordinary loss, net of taxes (3,684 ) Net income (loss) $ 1,556 $ (1,881 ) Adjustment to net income (loss)(3) (16 ) (163 ) Net income before extraordinary loss available to common shareholders $ 1,540 $ 1,640 (6 ) Net income (loss) available to common shareholders $ 1,540 $ (2,044 ) Earnings per common share before extraordinary loss: Basic $ 3.11 $ 3.50 Diluted 3.09 3.46 Earnings per common share: Basic $ 3.11 $ (4.32 ) Diluted 3.09 (4.31 ) Average common shares outstanding (in thousands): Basic 495,394 470,602 Diluted 497,924 474,003 Return on common shareholders equity before extraordinary loss(4) 9.5 % 13.2 % (1) Financial results for 2010 included those of acquired businesses from their respective dates of acquisition.

(3) Amount for 2010 represented the allocation of earnings to participating securities using the two class method. Amount for 2009 represented dividends and discount related to preferred stock issued in connection with the U.S. Treasurys TARP program in 2008 and redeemed in 2009. (4) For 2009, return on common shareholders equity was determined using net income before extraordinary loss available to common shareholders. 61 Table of Contents TOTAL REVENUE Years ended December 31, 2010 2009 % Change (Dollars in millions) Fee revenue: Servicing fees $ 3,938 $ 3,334 18 % Management fees 829 766 8 Trading services 1,106 1,094 1 Securities finance 318 570 (44 ) Processing fees and other 349 171 104 Total fee revenue 6,540 5,935 10 Net interest revenue: Interest revenue 3,462 3,286 5 Interest expense 763 722 6 Net interest revenue 2,699 2,564 5 Gains (Losses) related to investment securities, net (286 ) 141 Total revenue $ 8,953 $ 8,640 4 The increase in total revenue compared to 2009 was driven primarily by fee revenue, partly offset by net losses related to investment securities in 2010, which included a net sale loss related to a repositioning of the investment portfolio. The 18% increase in servicing fees from 2009 primarily resulted from the impact of new business awarded to us and installed during 2010 and prior periods on current period revenue, the addition of revenue generated by the acquired Intesa and MIFA businesses from May 17 and April 1, respectively, through December 31, and increases in daily average equity market valuations. Approximately 41% of our servicing fees were generated outside the U.S. in 2010, compared with 37% in 2009. Assets under custody and administration were $21.53 trillion, compared to $18.79 trillion in 2009, with the increase from 2009 primarily the result of increases in equity market valuations and a higher level of new servicing business won and installed prior to December 31, 2010, as well as the effects of the Intesa and MIFA acquisitions. Management fees increased 8% from 2009 to 2010, primarily from the impact of increases in average month end equity market valuations and, to a lesser extent, the impact of new business won and installed in prior periods on current period revenue. Approximately 34% of our management fees were generated outside the U.S. in 2010, down from 36% in 2009. Assets under management increased to $2.01 trillion at December 31, 2010, up $59 billion from $1.95 trillion a year earlier. Trading services revenue increased 1% primarily as a result of higher electronic trading volumes, partly offset by a decrease in foreign exchange trading revenue as a result of lower spreads on foreign exchange trades and a decline in currency volatility, partly offset by higher client volumes. Securities finance revenue was down 44% as a result of lower spreads across all lending programs. Processing fees and other revenue increased 104% due to higher net revenue from structured products, including fees from our tax exempt investment program, and higher net revenue related to certain tax advantaged investments. Net interest revenue increased primarily as a result of the impact of a higher portfolio allocation to fixed rate investment securities, U.S. and non U.S. investment portfolio growth, and the impact of the deposits added in May 2010 in connection with the acquisition of the Intesa securities services business, partly offset by lower spreads on both floating rate investment securities and non U.S. transaction deposits. We recorded net realized losses of $55 million from sales of investment securities and, separately, losses from other than temporary impairment related to credit of $231 million for 2010, compared to net sale gains of $368 million and losses from other than temporary impairment related to credit of $227 million for 2009. In December 2010, we undertook a repositioning of our investment securities portfolio by selling approximately 62 Table of Contents $11 billion of securities. The repositioning was undertaken to enhance our capital ratios under evolving regulatory capital standards, increase our balance sheet flexibility in deploying our capital, and reduce our exposure to certain asset classes. The sale resulted in a pre tax loss of approximately $344 million, which was recorded in our consolidated statement of income and is reflected in the $55 million of net sale losses described above. As a result, net losses related to investment securities for 2010 totaled $286 million, compared to net gains of $141 million for 2009. For 2010, the substantial majority of the impairment losses related to non agency mortgage backed securities which management concluded had experienced credit losses resulting from deterioration in financial performance of those securities during the year. PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES We recorded provisions for loan losses of $25 million in 2010 and $149 million in 2009. The substantial majority of the provisions recorded in both years resulted from changes in expectations with respect to future cash flows from certain CRE loans acquired in 2008 in connection with the indemnified repurchase agreements with an affiliate of Lehman as a result of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. EXPENSES Years ended December 31, 2010 2009 % Change (Dollars in millions) Compensation and employee benefits $ 3,524 $ 3,037 16 % Information systems and communications 713 656 9 Transaction processing services 653 583 12 Occupancy 463 475 (3 ) Securities lending charge 414 Provision for fixed income litigation exposure 250 Acquisition costs 89 49 82 Restructuring charges 156 Professional services 277 264 5 Amortization of other intangible assets 179 136 32 Other 374 516 (28 ) Total expenses $ 6,842 $ 5,966 15 Number of employees at year end 28,670 27,310 The increase in compensation and employee benefits expenses for 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to the effect of our reinstatement of cash incentive compensation accruals, as we did not accrue such incentive compensation during the first half of 2009 as part of our plan to increase our tangible common equity; the addition of the employees and associated expenses of the acquired Intesa securities services business and MIFA subsequent to their acquisition dates; and higher benefits requirements for payroll taxes, medical insurance and pensions. The increase in information systems and communications expenses for 2010 compared to 2009 reflected higher levels of spending on telecommunications hardware and software for our global infrastructure, as well as the addition of expenses from the acquired Intesa securities services business and MIFA subsequent to their respective acquisition dates. Transaction processing services expenses increased due to higher levels of sub custody expenses and higher external contract services costs related to increases in transaction volumes. In June 2010, we recorded an aggregate pre tax charge of $414 million, which included $9 million of associated legal costs. The charge provided for a one time cash contribution of $330 million to the cash collateral pools and liquidity trusts underlying the SSgA lending funds, which reflected our cost to restore the net asset 63 Table of Contents value per unit of such collateral pools to $1.00 as of June 30, 2010. As a result of this contribution, SSgA removed the redemption restrictions from these SSgA lending funds in August 2010. We also established a $75 million reserve to address potential inconsistencies in connection with our implementation of redemption restrictions applicable to the collateral pools underlying our agency lending program. The provision for fixed income litigation exposure of $250 million in 2009 resulted from an increase in the reserve initially established in 2007 associated with certain active fixed income strategies managed by SSgA. We settled regulatory inquiries related to this exposure in February 2010. In 2010, we recorded acquisition and restructuring costs of $245 million. These costs included $89 million of integration costs, $57 million of which related to the acquired Intesa securities services business and MIFA. These integration costs consisted only of certain transaction related costs and direct incremental costs to integrate the acquired businesses into our operations, and did not include ongoing expenses of the combined organization. The remaining $156 million was composed of restructuring charges recorded in connection with our business operations and information technology transformation program announced in November 2010. The $156 million of charges consisted of employee related costs for severance and other termination benefits, as well as costs which resulted from actions taken to consolidate real estate. The decrease in aggregate other expenses (professional services, amortization of other intangible assets, securities processing, regulator fees and assessments, and other) for 2010 compared to 2009 resulted primarily from the impact of an adverse judgment of $60 million rendered by a Netherlands court in 2009, the impact of $115 million of insurance recoveries received in 2010 and lower levels of FDIC assessments. This overall decrease was offset slightly by a higher level of other intangible assets amortization associated with the acquisition of the Intesa securities services business and MIFA. Income Taxes We recorded income tax expense of $530 million for 2010, compared to income tax expense before extraordinary loss of $722 million for 2009. Our effective tax rate for 2010 was 25.4% compared to 28.6% for 2009. The decline in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to transactions in connection with which we incurred costs to terminate funding obligations that supported former conduit asset structures, the partial write off of a deferred tax asset associated with certain of the investment securities sold in connection with the portfolio repositioning completed in the fourth quarter of 2010, and the absence of the impact of the non deductible portion of the SSgA related legal reserve established in 2009. FINANCIAL CONDITION The structure of our consolidated statement of condition is primarily driven by the liabilities generated by our Investment Servicing and Investment Management businesses. Our clients needs and our operating objectives determine balance sheet volume, mix and currency denomination. As our clients execute their worldwide cash management and investment activities, they use short term investments and deposits that constitute the majority of our liabilities. These liabilities are generally in the form of non interest bearing demand deposits; interest bearing transaction account deposits, which are denominated in a variety of currencies; and repurchase agreements, which generally serve as short term investment alternatives for our clients. Deposits and other liabilities generated by client activities are invested in assets that generally match the liquidity and interest rate characteristics of the liabilities, although the weighted average maturities of our assets are significantly longer than the contractual maturities of our liabilities. Our assets consist primarily of securities held in our available for sale or held to maturity portfolios and short term money market instruments, such as interest bearing deposits and securities purchased under resale agreements. The actual mix of assets is determined by the characteristics of the client liabilities and our desire to maintain a well diversified portfolio of high quality assets. As our non U.S. business activities have continued to grow, we have expanded our capabilities and processes to enable us to manage the liabilities generated by our core businesses and the related assets in which 64 Table of Contents these liabilities are invested, in a manner that more closely aligns our businesses and related activities with the cash management, investment activities and other operations of our clients. As a result, the structure of our statement of condition continues to evolve to reflect these efforts. In connection with the growth in non U.S. business, our cross border outstandings have increased as we have invested in higher levels of non U.S. assets. For additional information with respect to our non U.S. exposures, refer to Investment Securities and Cross Border Outstandings that follow. The following table presents the components of our average total interest earning and noninterest earning assets, average total interest bearing and noninterest bearing liabilities, and average preferred and common shareholders equity for the years ended December 31. Additional information about our average statement of condition, primarily our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, is included under Consolidated Results of Operations Total Revenue Net Interest Revenue in this Managements Discussion and Analysis.

Additional detail about our investment securities is provided in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. We manage our investment securities portfolio to align with the interest rate and duration characteristics of our client liabilities and in the context of the overall structure of our consolidated statement of condition, and in consideration of the global interest rate environment. We consider a well diversified, high credit quality investment securities portfolio to be an important element in the management of our consolidated statement of condition. 66 Table of Contents The portfolio is concentrated in securities with high credit quality, with approximately 89% of the carrying value of the portfolio rated AAA or AA as of December 31, 2011. The following table presents the percentages of the carrying value of the portfolio, by external credit rating, as of December 31: 2011 2010 AAA(1) 75 % 79 % AA 14 11 A 7 6 BBB 2 2 Below BBB 2 2 100 % 100 % (1) Includes U.S. Treasury securities that are split rated, AAA by Moodys Investor Services and AA+ by Standard & Poors. As of December 31, 2011, the investment portfolio of approximately 10,610 securities was diversified with respect to asset class. Approximately 83% of the aggregate carrying value of the portfolio as of that date was composed of mortgage backed and asset backed securities. The predominantly floating rate asset backed portfolio consisted primarily of student loan backed and credit card backed securities. Mortgage backed securities were composed of securities issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, as well as U.S. and non U.S. large issuer collateralized mortgage obligations. Non U.S. Debt Securities Approximately 23% of the aggregate carrying value of the portfolio as of December 31, 2011 was composed of non U.S. debt securities. The following table presents our non U.S. debt securities available for sale and held to maturity, included in the preceding table of investment securities carrying values, by significant country of issuer or collateral, as of December 31: (In millions) 2011 2010 Available for sale: United Kingdom $ 8,851 $ 4,451 Australia 3,154 1,332 Netherlands 3,109 2,320 Canada 1,905 2,138 Germany 1,510 916 France 329 219 Spain 228 285 Italy 231 Other 357 356 Total $ 19,674 $ 12,017 Held to maturity: Australia $ 2,572 $ 3,121 United Kingdom 2,259 3,190 Italy 297 342 Spain 220 245 Other 236 288 Total $ 5,584 $ 7,186 Approximately 88% of the aggregate carrying value of these non U.S. debt securities was rated AAA or AA as of both December 31, 2011 and 2010. The majority of these securities comprise senior positions within the security structures, which are protected through subordination and other forms of credit protection. As of 67 Table of Contents December 31, 2011, the securities had an aggregate pre tax net unrealized loss of approximately $143 million and an average market to book ratio of 99.4%. The majority is floating rate securities, and accordingly the aggregate holdings are considered to have minimal interest rate risk. The underlying collateral primarily includes U.K. prime mortgages, Australian and Netherlands mortgages, Canadian government securities and German automobile loans. The other category of available for sale securities includes approximately $49 million and $69 million of securities as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, related to Portugal and Ireland, all of which are mortgage backed securities. The other category of held to maturity securities includes approximately $233 million and $262 million of securities as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, related to Portugal, Ireland and Greece, all of which are mortgage backed securities. Our aggregate exposure to the peripheral European countries of Spain, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Portugal as of December 31, 2011 included no direct sovereign debt exposure to these countries. Our indirect exposure to these countries was substantially composed of approximately $1.08 billion of mortgage and asset backed securities, with an aggregate pre tax gross unrealized loss of approximately $122 million as of December 31, 2011. We recorded no other than temporary impairment on these securities in 2011. The global economic downturn, coupled with the failure of the Eurozone countries to abide by the terms of the Eurozone stability pact, led to significant borrowing at advantageous rates, particularly by the above mentioned peripheral countries, while those countries failed to address their underlying uncompetitive economies. These events led to the sovereign debt crisis when these fundamental issues caused severe stresses within the Eurozone. This sovereign crisis in Europe has deteriorated with little sign of improvement in the peripheral countries economies. Peripheral country risks are identified, assessed and monitored by our Country and Counterparty Exposure Committee. Country limits are defined in our credit and counterparty risk guidelines, in accordance with our credit and counterparty risk policy. These limits are monitored on a daily basis by Enterprise Risk Management. All peripheral country exposures are subject to ongoing surveillance and subjected to stress test analysis, conducted by the investment portfolio management team. The stress tests performed reflect the structure and nature of the exposure, its past and likely future performance based on macroeconomic and environmental analysis, with key underlying assumptions varied under a range of scenarios, reflecting likely downward pressure on collateral performance from the sovereign crisis and related austerity measures. The results of the stress tests are presented to senior management and Enterprise Risk Management as part of the surveillance process. In addition, Enterprise Risk Management conducts stress test analyses and evaluates exposures for evaluation of other than temporary impairment. The assumptions used in the evaluation process are stressed to reflect likely downward pressure on collateral performance from the sovereign crisis and related austerity measures and their economic impact. Evaluations of exposure to Greece are based on that country remaining a member of the Eurozone under all scenarios. Stress scenarios are subject to regular review and updated to reflect changes in the economic environment, measures taken in response to the sovereign crisis and collateral performance, with particular attention to our peripheral country exposures. 68 Table of Contents Municipal Securities We carry approximately $7.15 billion of municipal securities, classified as state and political subdivisions in the preceding table of investment securities carrying values, in our investment portfolio. Substantially all of these securities are classified as securities available for sale, with the remainder classified as securities held to maturity. We also provide approximately $8.28 billion of credit and liquidity facilities to municipal issuers as a form of credit enhancement. The following table presents our combined credit exposure to state and municipal obligors which represents 5% or more of our aggregate municipal credit exposure of approximately $15.43 billion across our businesses as of December 31, 2011, grouped by state to display geographic dispersion: (Dollars in millions) Total MunicipalSecurities Credit andLiquidityFacilities Total % of TotalMunicipalExposure State of Issuer: Texas $ 1,002 $ 1,669 $ 2,671 17 % California 192 1,496 1,688 11 Massachusetts 841 478 1,319 9 New York 309 596 905 6 Wisconsin 491 407 898 6 Florida 165 686 851 6 Total $ 3,000 $ 5,332 $ 8,332 Our total municipal securities exposure presented above is concentrated primarily with highly rated counterparties, with approximately 86% of the obligors rated AAA or AA as of December 31, 2011. As of that date, approximately 67% and 31% of our aggregate exposure was associated with general obligation and revenue bonds, respectively. In addition, we had no exposures associated with healthcare, industrial development or land development bonds. The portfolios are also diversified geographically; the states that represent our largest exposure are widely dispersed across the U.S. Additional information with respect to our analysis of other than temporary impairment of municipal securities is provided in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. 69 Table of Contents The following table presents the carrying amounts, by contractual maturity, of debt securities available for sale and held to maturity, and the related weighted average contractual yields, as of December 31, 2011: Under 1 Year 1 to 5 Years 6 to 10 Years Over 10 Years (Dollars in millions) Amount Yield Amount Yield Amount Yield Amount Yield Available for sale(1): U.S. Treasury and federal agencies: Direct obligations $ 1,200 .14 % $ 38 3.67 % $ 822 3.15 % $ 776 2.19 % Mortgage backed securities 5 5.08 755 3.46 10,871 3.19 18,390 3.43 Asset backed securities: Student loans 155 .51 3,331 .71 8,490 .80 4,569 .87 Credit cards 1,893 .86 5,893 .66 2,701 .76 Sub prime 581 .62 82 1.41 17 1.88 724 .88 Other 119 1.71 1,602 .95 1,198 .73 546 .62 Total asset backed 2,748 10,908 12,406 5,839 Non U.S. debt securities: Mortgage backed securities 474 1.41 2,358 2.39 987 2.99 7,056 2.43 Asset backed securities 230 1.00 916 1.61 2,511 1.90 646 2.29 Government securities 1,671 1.09 Other 1,636 4.46 958 3.97 231 4.28 Total non U.S. debt securities 4,011 4,232 3,729 7,702 State and political subdivisions(2) 471 5.10 2,326 5.07 3,328 4.97 922 3.77 Collateralized mortgage obligations 81 4.94 1,163 4.17 1,209 3.02 1,527 2.91 Other U.S. debt securities 289 5.13 1,391 4.41 1,899 4.25 36 .98 Total $ 8,805 $ 20,813 $ 34,264 $ 35,192 Held to maturity(1): U.S. Treasury and federal agencies: Mortgage backed securities $ 19 4.80 % $ 102 4.97 % $ 144 5.38 % Asset backed securities 31 1.13 Non U.S. debt securities: Mortgage backed securities $ 1,304 .54 % 254 1.18 3,415 3.48 Asset backed securities 204 4.82 217 4.49 15 1.77 Government securities 3 .36 Other 155 2.35 17 4.55 Total non U.S. debt securities 1,307 613 217 3,447 State and political subdivisions(2) 56 3.82 49 5.95 2 6.52 Collateralized mortgage obligations 394 4.64 1,350 3.56 530 4.07 1,060 3.23 Total $ 1,757 $ 2,031 $ 851 $ 4,682 (1) The maturities of mortgage backed securities, asset backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are based on expected principal payments.

These unrealized losses related to reclassifications totaled $303 million, or $189 million after tax, and $523 million, or $317 million after tax, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, or OCI. Refer to note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. The decline in these remaining after tax unrealized losses related to reclassifications from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011 resulted primarily from amortization. We conduct periodic reviews of individual securities to assess whether other than temporary impairment exists. To the extent that other than temporary impairment is identified, the impairment is broken into a credit component and a non credit component. The credit component is recorded in our consolidated statement of income, and the non credit component is recorded in OCI to the extent that we do not intend to sell the security. Our assessment of other than temporary impairment involves an evaluation, more fully described in note 3, of economic and security specific factors. Such factors are based on estimates, derived by management, which contemplate current market conditions and security specific performance. To the extent that market conditions are worse than managements expectations, other than temporary impairment could increase, in particular, the credit component that would be recorded in our consolidated statement of income. Given the exposure of our investment securities portfolio, particularly mortgage and asset backed securities, to residential mortgage and other consumer credit risks, the performance of the U.S. housing market is a significant driver of the portfolios credit performance. As such, our assessment of other than temporary impairment relies to a significant extent on our estimates of trends in national housing prices. Generally, indices that measure trends in national housing prices are published in arrears. As of September 30, 2011, national housing prices, according to the Case Shiller National Home Price Index, had declined by approximately 31.3% peak to current. Overall, managements expectation, for purposes of its evaluation of other than temporary impairment as of December 31, 2011, was that housing prices would decline by approximately 35% peak to trough. The performance of certain mortgage products and vintages of securities continues to deteriorate. In addition, management continues to believe that housing prices will decline further as indicated above. The combination of these factors has led to an increase in managements overall loss expectations. Our investment portfolio continues to be sensitive to managements estimates of future cumulative losses. Ultimately, other than temporary impairment is based on specific CUSIP level detailed analysis of the unique characteristics of each security. In addition, we perform sensitivity analysis across each significant product type within the non agency U.S. residential mortgage backed portfolio. We estimate, for example, that other than temporary impairment of the investment portfolio could increase by approximately $10 million to $50 million, if national housing prices were to decline by 37% to 39% peak to trough, compared to managements expectation of 35% described above. This sensitivity estimate is based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of housing prices and the timing of defaults. To the extent that such factors differ substantially from managements current expectations, resulting loss estimates may differ materially from those stated. Excluding the securities for which other than temporary impairment was recorded in 2011, management considers the aggregate decline in fair value of the remaining 71 Table of Contents securities and the resulting net unrealized losses as of December 31, 2011 to be temporary and not the result of any material changes in the credit characteristics of the securities. Additional information about our assessment of impairment is provided in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. In late 2010, several major U.S. financial institutions participated in a mortgage foreclosure moratorium with respect to residential mortgages. While the moratorium has been lifted, the residential mortgage servicing environment remains challenging, and the timeline to liquidate distressed loans continues to extend. The rate at which distressed residential mortgages are liquidated may affect, among other things, our investment securities portfolio. Such effects could include the timing of cash flows or the credit quality associated with the mortgages collateralizing certain of our residential mortgage backed securities, which, accordingly, could result in the recognition of additional other than temporary impairment in future periods. Loans and Leases The following table presents U.S. and non U.S. loans and leases, by segment, and aggregate average loans and leases, as of and for the years ended December 31 (excluding the allowance for loan losses): (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 Institutional: U.S. $ 7,115 $ 7,001 $ 6,637 $ 6,004 $ 9,798 Non U.S. 2,478 4,192 3,571 2,327 6,004 Commercial real estate: U.S. 460 764 600 800 Total loans and leases $ 10,053 $ 11,957 $ 10,808 $ 9,131 $ 15,802 Average loans and leases $ 12,180 $ 12,094 $ 9,703 $ 11,884 $ 10,753 Additional detail about these loan and lease segments, including underlying classes, is provided in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. The institutional segment is composed of the following classes: investment funds, commercial and financial, purchased receivables and lease financing. Investment funds includes lending to mutual and other collective investment funds and short duration advances to fund clients to provide liquidity in support of their transaction flows associated with securities settlement activities. Commercial and financial includes lending to corporate borrowers, including broker/dealers. Purchased receivables represents undivided interests in securitized pools of underlying third party receivables added in connection with the 2009 conduit consolidation. Lease financing includes our investment in leveraged lease financing. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, unearned income deducted from our investment in leveraged lease financing was $146 million and $168 million, respectively, for U.S. leases and $381 million and $667 million, respectively, for non U.S. leases. Aggregate short duration advances to our clients included in the institutional segment were $2.17 billion and $2.63 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The commercial real estate, or CRE, loans were acquired in 2008 pursuant to indemnified repurchase agreements with an affiliate of Lehman as a result of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. These loans, which are primarily collateralized by direct and indirect interests in commercial real estate, were recorded at their then current fair value, based on managements expectations with respect to future cash flows from the loans using appropriate market discount rates as of the date of acquisition. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we held an aggregate of approximately $199 million and $307 million, respectively, of CRE loans which were modified in troubled debt restructurings. No impairment loss was recognized upon restructuring of the loans, as the discounted cash flows of the modified loans exceeded the carrying amount of the original loans as of the modification date. No loans were modified in troubled debt restructurings in 2011. 72 Table of Contents We define past due loans as loans on which contractual principal or interest payments are over 90 days delinquent, but for which interest continues to be accrued. No institutional loans were 90 days or more contractually past due as of December 31, 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008 or 2007. Although a portion of the CRE loans was 90 days or more contractually past due as of December 31, 2011, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we do not report them as past due loans, because in accordance with GAAP, the interest earned on these loans is based on an accretable yield resulting from managements expectations with respect to the future cash flows for each loan relative to both the timing and collection of principal and interest as of the reporting date, not the loans contractual payment terms. These cash flow estimates are updated quarterly to reflect changes in managements expectations, which consider market conditions. We generally place loans on non accrual status once principal or interest payments are 60 days past due, or earlier if management determines that full collection is not probable. Loans 60 days past due, but considered both well secured and in the process of collection, may be excluded from non accrual status. For loans placed on non accrual status, revenue recognition is suspended. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, approximately $5 million and $158 million, respectively, of the aforementioned CRE loans had been placed by management on non accrual status, as the yield associated with these loans, determined when the loans were acquired, was deemed to be non accretable. This determination was based on managements expectations of the future collection of principal and interest from the loans. The decline in loans on non accrual status at December 31, 2011 compared to December 31, 2010 resulted mainly from the transfer of certain CRE loans to other real estate owned in 2011 in connection with foreclosure or similar transactions. These transactions had no impact on our 2011 consolidated statement of income.

Cross Border Outstandings Cross border outstandings are amounts payable to State Street by non U.S. counterparties which are denominated in U.S. dollars or other non local currency, as well as non U.S. local currency claims not funded by local currency liabilities. Our cross border outstandings consist primarily of deposits with banks; loans and lease financing, including short duration advances; investment securities; amounts related to foreign exchange and interest rate contracts; and securities finance. In addition to credit risk, cross border outstandings have the risk that, as a result of political or economic conditions in a country, borrowers may be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations of principal and or interest when due because of the unavailability of, or restrictions on, foreign exchange needed by borrowers to repay their obligations. We place deposits with non U.S. counterparties that have strong internal State Street risk ratings. Counterparties are approved and monitored by our Country and Counterparty Exposure Committee. This process includes financial analysis of non U.S. counterparties and the use of an internal risk rating system. Each counterparty is reviewed at least annually and potentially more frequently based on deteriorating credit fundamentals or general market conditions. We also utilize risk mitigation and other facilities that may reduce our exposure through the use of cash collateral and or balance sheet netting. In addition, the Country and Counterparty Exposure Committee performs a country risk analysis and monitors limits on country exposure. 74 Table of Contents The following table presents cross border outstandings in countries in which we do business, the on balance sheet portion of which amounted to at least 1% of our consolidated total assets as of December 31. The aggregate on balance sheet cross border outstandings presented in the table represented 15%, 16% and 12% of our consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

There were no aggregate on balance sheet cross border outstandings to countries which totaled between 0.75% and 1% of our consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2010. Several European countries, particularly Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain, have experienced credit deterioration associated with weaknesses in their economic and fiscal situations. With respect to this ongoing uncertainty, we are closely monitoring our exposure to these countries. While we had no sovereign debt securities related to these countries in our investment portfolio, we had aggregate exposure of approximately $1.08 billion of mortgage and asset backed securities, composed of $424 million in Spain, $373 million in Italy, $114 million in Ireland, $99 million in Greece and $69 million in Portugal, as of December 31, 2011.

The aggregate exposures consisted primarily of interest bearing deposits, loans, including short duration advances, and foreign exchange contracts. We had not recorded any other than temporary impairment or provisions for loan losses with respect to any of our exposures in these countries as of December 31, 2011. 75 Table of Contents Capital The management of both regulatory and economic capital involves key metrics evaluated by management to assess whether our actual level of capital is commensurate with our risk profile, is in compliance with all regulatory requirements, and is sufficient to provide us with the financial flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives. Regulatory Capital Our objective with respect to regulatory capital management is to maintain a strong capital base in order to provide financial flexibility for our business needs, including funding corporate growth and supporting clients cash management needs, and to provide protection against loss to depositors and creditors. We strive to maintain an appropriate level of capital, commensurate with our risk profile, on which an attractive return to shareholders is expected to be realized over both the short and long term, while protecting our obligations to depositors and creditors and satisfying regulatory capital adequacy requirements. Our capital management process focuses on our risk exposures, our regulatory capital requirements, the evaluations of the major independent credit rating agencies that assign ratings to our public debt and our capital position relative to our peers. Our Asset, Liability and Capital Committee, referred to as ALCCO, oversees the management of our regulatory capital, and is responsible for ensuring capital adequacy with respect to regulatory requirements, internal targets and the expectations of the major independent credit rating agencies. The primary regulator of both State Street and State Street Bank for regulatory capital purposes is the Federal Reserve. Both State Street and State Street Bank are subject to the minimum capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve and defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991. State Street Bank must meet the regulatory capital thresholds for well capitalized in order for the parent company to maintain its status as a financial holding company. The following table presents regulatory capital ratios and related regulatory guidelines for State Street and State Street Bank as of December 31; refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for additional information: REGULATORYGUIDELINES STATESTREET STATESTREETBANK Minimum WellCapitalized 2011 2010 2011 2010 Regulatory capital ratios: Tier 1 risk based capital 4 % 6 % 18.8 % 20.5 % 17.6 % 18.1 % Total risk based capital 8 10 20.5 22.0 19.6 19.9 Tier 1 leverage ratio(1) 4 5 7.3 8.2 6.7 7.1 (1) Regulatory guideline for well capitalized applies only to State Street Bank. At December 31, 2011, State Streets and State Street Banks tier 1 and total risk based capital ratios declined compared to December 31, 2010. Higher capital associated with net income and the remarketing of subordinated debt (partly offset by the effect of purchases of our common stock and declarations of common stock dividends) was more than offset by increases in total risk weighted assets. Balance sheet growth mainly associated with higher levels of investment securities, the result of our re investment strategy, drove the increase in total risk weighted assets. Higher off balance sheet exposure associated with our securities finance agency lending business, the result of market conditions, also contributed to the increase in total risk weighted assets. The decline in the tier 1 leverage ratio for both entities generally resulted from a significant increase in adjusted quarterly average assets, mainly the result of the above mentioned re investment strategy and significantly higher average interest bearing deposits with banks that resulted from high levels of client deposits. These incremental client deposits were invested with central banks, including the Federal Reserve. As of December 31, 2011, regulatory capital ratios for State Street and State Street Bank exceeded the regulatory minimum and well capitalized thresholds. 76 Table of Contents In 2011, we issued approximately $500 million of 4.956% junior subordinated debentures due March 15, 2018, in a remarketing of the 6.001% junior subordinated debentures due 2042 originally issued to State Street Capital Trust III in 2008. The original debentures were issued to Capital Trust III in connection with our concurrent offering of the trusts 8.25% fixed to floating rate normal automatic preferred enhanced capital securities, referred to as normal APEX (refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8). The net proceeds from the sale of the remarketed 4.956% junior subordinated debentures were ultimately used by Capital Trust III to make a final distribution to the holders of the normal APEX with respect to the original 6.001% junior subordinated debentures and to satisfy the obligation of Capital Trust III to purchase $500 million of our non cumulative perpetual preferred stock, series A, $100,000 liquidation preference per share. The preferred stock constitutes the principal asset of the trust. As a result of the above described transactions, as of December 31, 2011 we had outstanding the above referenced $500 million of 4.956% junior subordinated debentures due March 15, 2018 and $500 million of non cumulative perpetual preferred stock. The 4.956% debentures qualify for inclusion in tier 2 regulatory capital and the perpetual preferred stock qualifies for inclusion in tier 1 regulatory capital, both under federal regulatory capital guidelines. The original 6.001% junior subordinated debentures, which qualified for inclusion in tier 1 regulatory capital as trust preferred securities, were canceled as a result of the remarketing transaction. Common Stock In 2011, our Board of Directors approved a new program authorizing the purchase by us of up to $675 million of our common stock in 2011. This new program superseded the Boards prior authorization under which 13.25 million common shares were available for purchase as of December 31, 2010. During the period from April 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011, we purchased approximately 16.3 million shares of our common stock, at an average cost per share of approximately $41.38 and an aggregate cost of approximately $675 million. As of December 31, 2011, no purchase authority remained under this program. Adjusting for shares of common stock issued in connection with employee compensation, at December 31, 2011, we had approximately 14.2 million less common shares outstanding compared to December 31, 2010 as a result of completion of the stock purchase program. During 2011, we declared aggregate common stock dividends of $0.72 per share, or approximately $358 million. These dividends compare to aggregate common stock dividends of $0.04 per share, or $20 million, for all of 2010, and represented the first increase in our quarterly common stock dividend since we announced a reduction of such dividends in the first quarter of 2009. Funds for cash distributions to our shareholders by the parent company are derived from a variety of sources. The level of dividends to shareholders on our common stock is reviewed regularly and determined by the Board considering our liquidity, capital adequacy and recent earnings history and prospects, as well as economic conditions and other factors deemed relevant. In addition, the prior approval of the Federal Reserve is required for us to pay future common stock dividends. The Federal Reserve is currently conducting a review of capital plans for 2012 submitted by us and other systemically important financial institutions, which capital plans include tests of our capital adequacy under various stress scenarios. The levels at which we will be able to declare dividends and purchase shares of our common stock during 2012 will depend on the Federal Reserves assessment of our capital plan and our projected performance under the stress scenarios. While we anticipate that we will obtain Federal Reserve approval for the continued return of capital to our shareholders through dividends and or common stock purchases in 2012, there can be no assurance with respect to the Federal Reserves assessment of our capital plan. Federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid by subsidiary banks to the parent holding company. In addition, banking regulators have the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends. Information concerning limitations on dividends from our subsidiary banks is provided in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. 77 Table of Contents Other The current minimum regulatory capital requirements enforced by the U.S. banking regulators are based on a 1988 international accord, commonly referred to as Basel I, which was developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. In 2004, the Basel Committee released the final version of its new capital adequacy framework, referred to as Basel II. Basel II governs the capital adequacy of large, internationally active banking organizations, such as State Street, that generally rely on sophisticated risk management and measurement systems, and requires these organizations to enhance their measurement and management of the risks underlying their business activities and to better align regulatory capital requirements with those risks. Basel II adopts a three pillar framework for addressing capital adequacy minimum capital requirements, which incorporates Pillar 1, the measurement of credit risk, market risk and operational risk; Pillar 2, supervisory review, which addresses the need for a banking organization to assess its capital adequacy position relative to its overall risk, rather than only with respect to its minimum capital requirement; and Pillar 3, market discipline, which imposes public disclosure requirements on a banking organization intended to allow the assessment of key information about the organizations risk profile and its associated level of regulatory capital. In December 2007, U.S. banking regulators jointly issued final rules to implement the Basel II framework in the U.S. The framework does not supersede or change the existing prompt corrective action and leverage capital requirements applicable to banking organizations in the U.S., and explicitly reserves the regulators authority to require organizations to hold additional capital where appropriate. Prior to full implementation of the Basel II framework, State Street is required to complete a defined qualification period, during which it must demonstrate that it complies with the related regulatory requirements to the satisfaction of the Federal Reserve. State Street is currently in the qualification period for Basel II. In addition, in response to the recent financial crisis and ongoing global financial market dynamics, the Basel Committee has proposed new guidelines, referred to as Basel III. Basel III would establish more stringent capital and liquidity requirements, including higher minimum regulatory capital ratios, new capital buffers, higher risk weighted asset calibrations, more restrictive definitions of qualifying capital, a liquidity coverage ratio and a net stable funding ratio. Basel III, the Dodd Frank Act and the resulting regulations are expected to result in an increase in the minimum regulatory capital that we will be required to maintain and changes in the manner in which our regulatory capital ratios are calculated. We are currently designated as a large bank holding company subject to enhanced supervision and prudential standards, commonly referred to as a systemically important financial institution, or SIFI, and we are one among an initial group of 29 institutions worldwide that have been identified by the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision as global systemically important banks, or G SIBs. Both of these designations will require us to hold incrementally higher regulatory capital compared to financial institutions without such designations. The Basel III requirements, as well as related provisions of the Dodd Frank Act and other international regulatory initiatives, could have a material impact on our businesses and our profitability. U.S. banking regulators will be required to enact new rules specific to the U.S. banking industry to implement the final Basel III accord. Consequently, determining with certainty at this time the alignment of our regulatory capital and our operations with the regulatory capital requirements of Basel III, or when we will be expected to be compliant with the Basel regulatory capital requirements, is not possible. We believe, however, that we will be able to comply with the relevant Basel II and Basel III regulatory capital requirements when and as applied to us. Economic Capital We define economic capital as the capital required to protect holders of our senior debt, and obligations higher in priority, against unexpected economic losses over a one year period at a level consistent with the solvency of a firm with our target Aa3/AA senior bank debt rating. Economic capital requirements are one of 78 Table of Contents several important measures used by management and the Board of Directors to assess the adequacy of our capital levels in relation to State Streets risk profile. Due to the evolving nature of quantification techniques, we expect to periodically refine the methodologies, assumptions, and data used to estimate our economic capital requirements, which could result in a different amount of capital needed to support our business activities. In addition, we have begun to measure returns on economic capital and economic profit (defined by us as net income available to common shareholders after deduction of State Streets cost of equity capital) by line of business. This economic profit will be used by management and the Board to gauge risk adjusted performance over time. This in turn has become an element of our internal process for allocating resources, e.g., capital, information technology spending, etc., by line of business. In addition, this augments our current use of return on capital in our evaluation of the viability of a new business or product initiative and for merger and acquisition analysis. We quantify capital requirements for the risks inherent in our business activities and group them into one of the following broadly defined categories: Market risk: the risk of adverse financial impact due to fluctuations in market prices, primarily as they relate to our trading activities; Interest rate risk: the risk of loss in non trading asset and liability management positions, primarily the impact of adverse movements in interest rates on the repricing mismatches that exist between the assets and liabilities carried in our consolidated statement of condition; Credit risk: the risk of loss that may result from the default or downgrade of a borrower or counterparty; Operational risk: the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events, which is consistent with the Basel II definition; and Business risk: the risk of negative earnings resulting from adverse changes in business factors, including changes in the competitive environment, changes in the operational economics of our business activities, and the effect of strategic and reputation risks. Economic capital for each of these five categories is estimated on a stand alone basis using scenario analysis and statistical modeling techniques applied to internally generated and, in some cases, external data. These individual results are then aggregated at the State Street consolidated level. Liquidity The objective of liquidity management is to ensure that we have the ability to meet our financial obligations in a timely and cost effective manner, and that we maintain sufficient flexibility to fund strategic corporate initiatives as they arise. Effective management of liquidity involves assessing the potential mismatch between the future cash needs of our clients and our available sources of cash under normal and adverse economic and business conditions. Significant uses of liquidity, described more fully below, consist primarily of funding deposit withdrawals and outstanding commitments to extend credit or commitments to purchase securities as they are drawn upon. Liquidity is provided by the maintenance of broad access to the global capital markets and by the asset structure in our consolidated statement of condition. Our Global Treasury group is responsible for the day to day management of our global liquidity position, which is conducted within risk guidelines established and monitored by ALCCO. Management maintains a liquidity framework which assesses the sources and uses of liquidity. Monitoring of our liquidity position is conducted by Global Treasury and our Enterprise Risk Management group. Embedded in this framework is a process that outlines several areas of potential risk based on our activities, size, and other appropriate risk related factors. We use liquidity metrics, early warning indicators and stress testing to identify potential liquidity needs. 79 Table of Contents These measures are a combination of internal and external events which assist us in identifying potential increases in cash needs or decreases in available sources of cash, as well as the potential impairment of our ability to access the global capital markets. Another important component of the liquidity framework is a contingency funding plan, or CFP, that is designed to identify and manage State Street through a potential liquidity crisis. The CFP defines roles, responsibilities and management actions to be undertaken in the event of deterioration in our liquidity profile caused by either a State Street specific event or a broader disruption in the capital markets. Specific actions are linked to the level of stress indicated by these measures or by management judgment of market conditions. We generally manage our liquidity on a global basis at the State Street consolidated level. We also manage parent company liquidity, and in certain cases branch liquidity, separately. State Street Bank generally has broader access to funding products and markets limited to banks, specifically the federal funds market and the Federal Reserves discount window. The parent company is managed to a more conservative liquidity profile, reflecting narrower market access. The parent company typically holds enough cash, primarily in the form of interest bearing deposits with its banking subsidiaries, to meet current debt maturities and cash needs, as well as those projected over the next one year period. Our sources of liquidity come from two primary areas: access to the global capital markets and liquid assets carried in our consolidated statement of condition. Our ability to source incremental funding at reasonable rates of interest from wholesale investors in the capital markets is the first source of liquidity we would access to accommodate the uses of liquidity described below. On balance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our liquidity management strategy. These assets provide liquidity through maturities of the assets, but more importantly, they provide us with the ability to raise funds by pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales. State Street is also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston. This membership allows for advances of liquidity in varying terms against high quality collateral, which helps facilitate asset and liability management of depository institutions. There were no balances outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2011 or 2010. Each of these sources of liquidity is used in our management of daily cash needs and is available in a crisis scenario should we need to accommodate potential large, unexpected demand for funds. Our uses of liquidity generally result from the following: withdrawals of unsecured client deposits; draw downs of unfunded commitments to extend credit or to purchase securities, generally provided through lines of credit; and short duration advance facilities. Client deposits are generated largely from our investment servicing activities, and are invested in a combination of investment securities and short term money market instruments whose mix is determined by the characteristics of the deposits. Most of the client deposits are payable on demand or are short term in nature, which means that withdrawals can potentially occur quickly and in large amounts. Similarly, clients can request disbursement of funds under commitments to extend credit, or can overdraw their deposit accounts rapidly and in large volumes. In addition, a large volume of unanticipated funding requirements, such as large draw downs of existing lines of credit, could require additional liquidity. Material risks to sources of short term liquidity could include, among other things, adverse changes in the perception in the financial markets of our financial condition or liquidity needs, and downgrades by major independent credit rating agencies of our deposits and our debt securities, which would restrict our ability to access the capital markets and could lead to withdrawals of unsecured deposits by our clients. In managing our liquidity, we have issued term wholesale certificates of deposit, or CDs, and invested those funds in short term money market instruments which are carried in our consolidated statement of condition and which would be available to meet our cash needs. At December 31, 2011, this wholesale CD portfolio totaled $6.34 billion, compared to $6.82 billion at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011, we had no conduit issued asset backed commercial paper outstanding to third parties, compared to $1.92 billion at December 31, 2010. While maintenance of our high investment grade credit rating is of primary importance to our liquidity management program, on balance sheet liquid assets represent significant liquidity that we can directly control, and provide a source of cash in the form of principal maturities and the ability to borrow from the capital markets 80 Table of Contents using our securities as collateral. Our net liquid assets consist primarily of cash balances at central banks in excess of regulatory requirements and other short term liquid assets, such as interest bearing deposits with banks, which are multi currency instruments invested with major multi national banks; and high quality, marketable investment securities not already pledged, which generally are more liquid than other types of assets and can be sold or borrowed against to generate cash quickly. As of December 31, 2011, the value of our consolidated net liquid assets, as defined, totaled $144.15 billion, compared to $83.41 billion as of December 31, 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2011, consolidated average net liquid assets were $97.33 billion, compared to $73.72 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. Due to the unusual size and volatile nature of client deposits as of quarter end, we maintained excess balances of approximately $50.09 billion at central banks as of December 31, 2011, compared to $16.61 billion as of December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2011, the value of the parent companys net liquid assets totaled $4.91 billion, compared with $5.06 billion as of December 31, 2010. The parent companys liquid assets consisted primarily of overnight placements with its banking subsidiaries. Aggregate investment securities carried at $44.66 billion as of December 31, 2011, compared to $44.81 billion as of December 31, 2010, were designated as pledged for public and trust deposits, borrowed funds and for other purposes as provided by law, and are excluded from the liquid assets calculation, unless pledged internally between State Street affiliates. Liquid assets included securities pledged to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston to secure State Street Banks ability to borrow from their discount window should the need arise. This access to primary credit is an important source of back up liquidity for State Street Bank. As of December 31, 2011, State Street Bank had no outstanding primary credit borrowings from the discount window. Based on our level of consolidated liquid assets and our ability to access the capital markets for additional funding when necessary, including our ability to issue debt and equity securities under our current universal shelf registration, management considers State Streets overall liquidity as of December 31, 2011 to be sufficient to meet its current commitments and business needs, including accommodating the transaction and cash management needs of its clients. As referenced above, our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the maintenance of high investment grade ratings on our debt, as measured by the major independent credit rating agencies. Factors essential to maintaining high credit ratings include diverse and stable core earnings; strong risk management; strong capital ratios; diverse liquidity sources, including the global capital markets and client deposits; and strong liquidity monitoring procedures. High ratings on debt minimize borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by increasing the potential market for our debt. A downgrade or reduction of these credit ratings could have an adverse effect on our ability to access funding at favorable interest rates. The following table presents information about State Streets and State Street Banks credit ratings as of February 24, 2012: Standard &Poors MoodysInvestorsService Fitch State Street: Short term commercial paper A 1 P 1 F1+ Senior debt A+ A1 A+ Subordinated debt A A2 Capital securities BBB+ A3 A State Street Bank: Short term deposits A 1+ P 1 F1+ Long term deposits AA Aa2 AA Senior debt AA Aa2 A+ Subordinated debt A+ Aa3 A Outlook Negative Negative Stable 81 Table of Contents We maintain an effective universal shelf registration that allows for the public offering and sale of debt securities, capital securities, common stock, depositary shares and preferred stock, and warrants to purchase such securities, including any shares into which the preferred stock and depositary shares may be convertible, or any combination thereof. We have, as discussed previously, issued in the past, and we may issue in the future, securities pursuant to the shelf registration. The issuance of debt or equity securities will depend on future market conditions, funding needs and other factors. Additional information about debt and equity securities issued pursuant to this shelf registration is provided in notes 9 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. We currently maintain a corporate commercial paper program, under which we can issue up to $3 billion with original maturities of up to 270 days from the date of issue. At December 31, 2011, we had $2.38 billion of commercial paper outstanding, compared to $2.80 billion at December 31, 2010. Additional information about our corporate commercial paper program is provided in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. State Street Bank had initial Board authority to issue bank notes up to an aggregate of $5 billion, including up to $1 billion of subordinated bank notes. Approximately $2.05 billion was available under this Board authority as of December 31, 2011. In 2011, $2.45 billion of senior notes, which were outstanding at December 31, 2010, matured. State Street Bank currently maintains a line of credit with a financial institution of CAD $800 million, or approximately $787 million as of December 31, 2011, to support its Canadian securities processing operations. The line of credit has no stated termination date and is cancelable by either party with prior notice. As of December 31, 2011, no balance was outstanding on this line of credit.

Interest payments were calculated at the stated rate with the exception of floating rate debt, for which payments were calculated using the indexed rate in effect as of December 31, 2011. The obligations presented in the table above are recorded in our consolidated statement of condition at December 31, 2011, except for interest on long term debt and capital lease obligations. The table does not include obligations which will be settled in cash, primarily in less than one year, such as deposits, federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements and other short term borrowings. Additional information about deposits, federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements and other short term borrowings is provided in notes 7 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. The table does not include obligations related to derivative instruments, because the amounts included in our consolidated statement of condition at December 31, 2011 related to derivatives do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid under the contracts upon settlement. Additional information about derivative contracts is provided in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. We have obligations under pension and other post retirement benefit plans, more fully described in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, which are not included in the above table. Additional information about contractual cash obligations related to long term debt and operating and capital leases is provided in notes 9 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. The consolidated statement of cash flows, also included under Item 8, provides additional liquidity information. 82 Table of Contents OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS DURATION OF COMMITMENT As of December 31, 2011 (In millions) Totalamountscommitted(1) Less than1 year 1 3years 4 5years Indemnified securities financing $ 302,342 $ 302,342 Unfunded commitments to extend credit 17,297 13,404 $ 1,691 $ 2,202 Asset purchase agreements 4,854 853 3,849 152 Standby letters of credit 3,838 1,446 1,994 398 Purchase obligations(2) 115 30 45 40 Total commercial commitments $ 328,446 $ 318,075 $ 7,579 $ 2,792 (1) Total amounts committed reflect participations to independent third parties.

Risk Management The global scope of our business activities requires that we balance what we perceive to be the primary risks in our businesses with a comprehensive and well integrated risk management function. The identification, measurement, monitoring and mitigation of risks are essential to the financial performance and successful management of our businesses. These risks, if not effectively managed, can result in current losses to State Street as well as erosion of our capital and damage to our reputation. Our systematic approach allows for an assessment of risks within a framework for evaluating opportunities for the prudent use of capital that appropriately balances risk and return. We have a disciplined approach to risk that involves all levels of management. The Board, through its Risk and Capital Committee, provides extensive review and oversight of our overall risk management programs, including the approval of key risk management policies and the periodic review of State Streets Risk Appetite Statement, which is an integral part of our overall Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, or ICAAP. The Risk Appetite Statement outlines the quantitative limits and qualitative goals that define and constrain our risk appetite and defines responsibilities for measuring and monitoring risk against limits, which are reported regularly to the Board. In addition, State Street utilizes a variety of key risk indicators to monitor risk on a more granular level. Enterprise Risk Management, or ERM, a corporate function, provides oversight, support and coordination across business units independent of the business units activities, and is responsible for the formulation and maintenance of enterprise wide risk management policies and guidelines. In addition, ERM establishes and reviews approved limits and, in collaboration with business unit management, monitors key risks. Our Chief Risk Officer meets regularly with the Board and its Risk and Capital Committee, and has the authority to escalate issues as necessary. The execution of duties with respect to the management of people, products, business operations and processes is the responsibility of business unit managers. The function of risk management is designing and directing the implementation of risk management programs and processes consistent with corporate and regulatory standards, and providing oversight of the business owned risks. Accordingly, risk management is a shared responsibility between ERM and the business units, and requires joint efforts in goal setting, program design and implementation, resource management, and performance evaluation between business and functional units. 83 Table of Contents Responsibility for risk management is overseen by a series of management committees, as well as the Boards Risk and Capital Committee. The Management Risk and Capital Committee, or MRAC, co chaired by our Chief Risk Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is the senior management decision making body for risk and capital issues, and is responsible for ensuring that State Streets strategy, budget, risk appetite and capital adequacy are properly aligned. ALCCO, chaired by our Treasurer, oversees the management of our consolidated statement of condition, the management of our global liquidity and interest rate risk positions, our regulatory and economic capital, the determination of the framework for capital allocation and strategies for capital structure, and debt and equity issuances. State Streets risk management program is supported by the activities of a number of corporate risk oversight committees, chaired by senior executives within ERM. Our Fiduciary Review Committee reviews and assesses the risk management programs of those units in which State Street serves in a fiduciary capacity. Our Credit Committee acts as the credit and counterparty risk guidelines committee for State Street. Our Country and Counterparty Exposure Committee ensures that country risks are identified, assessed, monitored, reported and mitigated where necessary. Our Operational Risk Committee provides cross business oversight of operational risk to identify, measure, manage and control operational risk in an effective and consistent manner across State Street. Our Model Assessment Committee provides recommendations concerning technical modeling issues and independently validates financial models utilized by our business units. While we believe that our risk management program is effective in managing the risks in our businesses, external factors may create risks that cannot always be identified or anticipated. Market Risk Market risk is defined as the risk of adverse financial impact due to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and other market driven factors and prices. State Street is exposed to market risk in both its trading and non trading, or asset and liability management, activities. The market risk management processes related to these activities, discussed in further detail below, apply to both on and off balance sheet exposures. We engage in trading and investment activities primarily to support our clients needs and to contribute to our overall corporate earnings and liquidity. In the conduct of these activities, we are subject to, and assume, market risk. The level of market risk that we assume is a function of our overall risk appetite, objectives and liquidity needs, our clients requirements and market volatility. Interest rate risk, a component of market risk, is more thoroughly discussed in the Asset and Liability Management portion of this Market Risk section. Trading Activities Market risk associated with our foreign exchange and other trading activities is managed through corporate guidelines, including established limits on aggregate and net open positions, sensitivity to changes in interest rates, and concentrations, which are supplemented by stop loss thresholds. We use a variety of risk management tools and methodologies, including value at risk, or VaR, described later in this section, to measure, monitor and manage market risk. All limits and measurement techniques are reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a regular basis by business managers, the Market Risk Management group and the Trading and Market Risk Committee. We enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments to support our clients needs and to manage our interest rate and currency risk. These activities are generally intended to generate trading revenue and to manage potential earnings volatility. In addition, we provide services related to derivatives in our role as both a manager and a servicer of financial assets. Our clients use derivatives to manage the financial risks associated with their investment goals and business activities. With the growth of cross border investing, our clients have an increasing need for foreign exchange forward contracts to convert currency for international investments and to manage the currency risk in their international investment portfolios. As an active participant in the foreign exchange markets, we provide foreign exchange forward contracts and options in support of these client needs. 84 Table of Contents As part of our trading activities, we assume positions in the foreign exchange and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and using derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange and interest rate options and interest rate swaps, interest rate forward contracts, and interest rate futures. As of December 31, 2011, the aggregate notional amount of these derivatives was $1.36 trillion, of which $1.03 trillion was composed of foreign exchange forward, swap and spot contracts. In the aggregate, positions are matched closely to minimize currency and interest rate risk. All foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at current market rates. Additional information about our trading derivatives is provided in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8. As noted above, we use a variety of risk measurement tools and methodologies, including VaR, which is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical confidence interval. We use a risk measurement methodology to estimate VaR daily. We have adopted standards for estimating VaR, and we maintain regulatory capital for market risk in accordance with applicable bank regulatory market risk guidelines. VaR is estimated for a 99% one tail confidence interval and an assumed one day holding period using a historical observation period of two years. A 99% one tail confidence interval implies that daily trading losses should not exceed the estimated VaR more than 1% of the time, or less than three business days out of a year. The methodology uses a simulation approach based on historically observed changes in foreign exchange rates, U.S. and non U.S. interest rates and implied volatilities, and incorporates the resulting diversification benefits provided from the mix of our trading positions. Like all quantitative risk measures, our historical simulation VaR methodology is subject to inherent limitations and assumptions. Our methodology gives equal weight to all market rate observations regardless of how recently the market rates were observed. The estimate is calculated using static portfolios consisting of trading positions held at the end of each business day. Therefore, implicit in the VaR estimate is the assumption that no intra day actions are taken by management during adverse market movements. As a result, the methodology does not incorporate risk associated with intra day changes in positions or intra day price volatility. In addition to daily VaR measurement, we regularly perform stress tests. These stress tests consider historical events, such as the Asian financial crisis or the most recent crisis in the financial markets, as well as hypothetical scenarios defined by us, such as parallel and non parallel changes in yield curves. Our VaR model incorporates exposures to more than 8,000 factors, composed of foreign exchange spot rates, interest rate base and spread curves and implied volatility levels and skews. The following table presents VaR associated with our trading activities, for trading positions held during the periods indicated, as measured by our VaR methodology. The generally lower total VaR amounts compared to component VaR amounts primarily relate to diversification benefits across risk types. VALUE AT RISK Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 (In millions) AnnualAverage Maximum Minimum AnnualAverage Maximum Minimum Foreign exchange rates $ 2.3 $ 6.0 $ 0.4 $ 3.0 $ 9.4 $ 0.6 Interest rates 4.8 11.1 1.6 3.3 8.3 1.6 Total VaR for trading assets $ 5.4 $ 11.1 $ 1.8 $ 4.6 $ 10.2 $ 1.8 Our historical simulation VaR methodology recognizes diversification benefits by fully revaluing our portfolio using historical market information. As a result, this historical simulation better captures risk by incorporating, by construction, any diversification benefits or concentration risks in our portfolio related to market factors which have historically moved in correlated or independent directions and amounts. Consistent with current bank regulatory market risk guidelines, our VaR measurement includes certain positions held outside of our regular sales and trading activities, but carried in trading account assets in our consolidated statement of condition and covered by those guidelines. We do not have a historical simulation VaR model that covers positions outside of our regular sales and trading activities. Consequently, we compute the 85 Table of Contents VaR associated with those assets using a separate model, which we then add to the VaR associated with our sales and trading activities to derive State Streets total regulatory VaR. Although this simple addition does not give full recognition to the benefits of diversification of our business, we believe that this approach is both conservative and consistent with the way in which we manage those businesses. We perform ongoing integrity testing of our VaR models to validate that the model forecasts are reasonable when compared to actual results. Our actual daily trading profit and loss, or P&L, is generally greater than hypothetical daily trading P&L due to our ability to manage our positions through intra day trading and other pricing considerations. As such, while we have not seen any back testing exceptions to the VaR model in comparison to actual daily trading P&L, we do from time to time see back testing exceptions on a hypothetical basis, assuming that all positions are held constant. These exceptions are generally infrequent, as one would expect from the nature and definition of a VaR computation. We evaluate our VaR methodology on an ongoing basis. Any revisions to our VaR methodology are implemented only after thorough review and approval internally and by the Federal Reserve, our primary U.S. banking regulator. We implemented one such revision in August 2011, in order to better capture the risks associated with our exposures to certain interest rate spreads. The following table presents the VaR associated with our trading activities, presented in the preceding table, and the VaR associated with positions outside of these trading activities, the latter of which is described as VaR for non trading assets. Total regulatory VaR is calculated as the sum of the VaR associated with trading assets and the VaR for non trading assets, with no additional diversification benefits recognized. The average, maximum and minimum amounts are calculated for each line item separately. Total Regulatory VALUE AT RISK Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 (In millions) AnnualAverage Maximum Minimum AnnualAverage Maximum Minimum VaR for trading assets $ 5.4 $ 11.1 $ 1.8 $ 4.6 $ 10.2 $ 1.8 VaR for non trading assets 1.7 1.9 1.4 2.6 6.7 1.1 Total regulatory VaR $ 7.1 $ 12.9 $ 3.5 $ 7.2 $ 13.1 $ 4.5 Asset and Liability Management Activities The primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable and growing net interest revenue, or NIR, under varying economic environments, while protecting the economic values of the assets and liabilities carried in our consolidated statement of condition from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates. Most of our NIR is earned from the investment of client deposits generated by our Investment Servicing and Investment Management businesses. We structure our balance sheet assets to generally conform to the characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities, but we manage our overall interest rate risk position in the context of current and anticipated market conditions and within internally approved risk guidelines. Non U.S. dollar denominated client liabilities are a significant portion of our consolidated statement of condition. This exposure and the resulting changes in the shape and level of non U.S. dollar yield curves are considered in our consolidated interest rate risk management process. Our overall interest rate risk position is maintained within a series of policies approved by the Board and guidelines established and monitored by ALCCO. Our Global Treasury group has responsibility for managing State Streets day to day interest rate risk. To effectively manage the consolidated balance sheet and related NIR, Global Treasury has the authority to assume a limited amount of interest rate risk based on market conditions and its views about the direction of global interest rates over both short term and long term time horizons. Global Treasury manages our exposure to changes in interest rates on a consolidated basis organized into three regional treasury units, North America, Europe and Asia/Pacific, to reflect the growing, global nature of our exposures and to capture the impact of change in regional market environments on our total risk position. 86 Table of Contents Our investment activities and our use of derivative financial instruments are the primary tools used in managing interest rate risk. We invest in financial instruments with currency, repricing, and maturity characteristics we consider appropriate to manage our overall interest rate risk position. In addition to on balance sheet assets, we use certain derivative instruments, primarily interest rate swaps, to alter the interest rate characteristics of specific balance sheet assets or liabilities. Our use of derivatives is subject to ALCCO approved guidelines. Additional information about our use of derivatives is provided in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. Because no one individual measure can accurately assess all of our exposures to changes in interest rates, we use several quantitative measures in our assessment of current and potential future exposures to changes in interest rates and their impact on NIR and balance sheet values. Net interest revenue simulation is the primary tool used in our evaluation of the potential range of possible NIR results that could occur under a variety of interest rate environments. We also use market valuation and duration analysis to assess changes in the economic value of balance sheet assets and liabilities caused by assumed changes in interest rates. To measure, monitor, and report on our interest rate risk position, we use NIR simulation, or NIR at risk, which measures the impact on NIR over the next twelve months to immediate, or rate shock, and gradual, or rate ramp, changes in market interest rates and economic value of equity, or EVE, which measures the impact on the present value of all NIR related principal and interest cash flows of an immediate change in interest rates. NIR at risk is designed to measure the potential impact of changes in market interest rates on NIR in the short term. EVE, on the other hand, is a long term view of interest rate risk, but with a view toward liquidation of State Street. Both of these measures are subject to ALCCO approved guidelines, and are monitored regularly, along with other relevant simulations, scenario analyses and stress tests, by both Global Treasury and ALCCO. In calculating our NIR at risk, we start with a base amount of NIR that is projected over the next twelve months, assuming our forecasted yield curve over the period. Our existing balance sheet assets and liabilities are adjusted by the amount and timing of transactions that are forecasted to occur over the next twelve months. That yield curve is then shocked, or moved immediately, &plusmn;100 basis points in a parallel fashion, or at all points along the yield curve. Two new twelve month NIR projections are then developed using the same balance sheet and forecasted transactions, but with the new yield curves, and compared to the base scenario. We also perform the calculations using interest rate ramps, which are &plusmn;100 basis point changes in interest rates that are assumed to occur gradually over the next twelve months, rather than immediately as we do with interest rate shocks. EVE is based on the change in the present value of all NIR related principal and interest cash flows for changes in market rates of interest. The present value of existing cash flows with a then current yield curve serves as the base case. We then apply an immediate parallel shock to that yield curve of &plusmn;200 basis points and recalculate the cash flows and related present values. A large shock is used to better capture the embedded option risk in our mortgage backed securities that results from borrowers prepayment opportunities. Key assumptions used in the models described above include the timing of cash flows; the maturity and repricing of balance sheet assets and liabilities, especially option embedded financial instruments like mortgage backed securities; changes in market conditions; and interest rate sensitivities of our client liabilities with respect to the interest rates paid and the level of balances. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the models cannot precisely predict future NIR or predict the impact of changes in interest rates on NIR and economic value. Actual results could differ from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and market conditions, changes in spreads and management strategies, among other factors. Projections of potential future streams of NIR are assessed as part of our forecasting process. 87 Table of Contents The following table presents the estimated exposure of NIR for the next twelve months, calculated as of the dates indicated, due to an immediate &plusmn;100 basis point shift in then current interest rates. Estimated incremental exposures presented below are dependent on managements assumptions about asset and liability sensitivities under various interest rate scenarios, such as those previously discussed, and do not reflect any additional actions management may undertake in order to mitigate some of the adverse effects of interest rate changes on State Streets financial performance. NET INTEREST REVENUE AT RISK Estimated Exposure toNet Interest Revenue (In millions) December 31,2011 December 31,2010 Rate change: +100 bps shock $ 235 $ 121 100 bps shock (334 ) (231 ) +100 bps ramp 79 42 100 bps ramp (158 ) (117 ) As of December 31, 2011, NIR sensitivity to an upward 100 basis point shock in market rates increased compared to December 31, 2010. A larger projected balance sheet funded mainly with client deposit inflows is expected to increase the benefit of rising rates to NIR. The benefit to NIR is less significant for an upward 100 basis point ramp, since market rates are assumed to increase gradually. NIR is expected to be more sensitive to a downward 100 basis point shock in market rates as of December 31, 2011 compared to December 31, 2010. Due to the exceptionally low interest rate environment, deposit rates quickly reach their implicit floors and provide little funding relief on the liability side, while assets reset into the lower rate environment, placing downward pressure on NIR. Other important factors which affect the levels of NIR are balance sheet size and mix; interest rate spreads; the slope and interest rate level of U.S. dollar and non U.S. dollar yield curves and the relationship between them; the pace of change in market interest rates; and management actions taken in response to the preceding conditions. The following table presents estimated EVE exposures, calculated as of the dates indicated, assuming an immediate and prolonged shift in interest rates, the impact of which would be spread over a number of years. ECONOMIC VALUE OF EQUITY Estimated Exposure toEconomic Value of Equity (In millions) December 31,2011 December 31,2010 Rate change: +200 bps shock $ (1,936 ) $ (2,058 ) 200 bps shock 490 949 Exposure to EVE for an upward 200 basis point shock as of December 31, 2011 declined slightly compared to December 31, 2010. The impact of lower rates shortening the duration of the investment portfolio was offset by purchases of fixed rate investment securities in 2011. Credit Risk Credit and counterparty risk is defined as the risk of financial loss if a borrower or counterparty is either unable or unwilling to repay borrowings or settle a transaction in accordance with underlying contractual terms. We assume credit and counterparty risk for both our on and off balance sheet exposures. The extension of credit and the acceptance of counterparty risk by State Street are governed by corporate guidelines based on each 88 Table of Contents counterpartys risk profile, the markets served, counterparty and country concentrations, and regulatory compliance. Our focus on large institutional investors and their businesses requires that we assume concentrated credit risk for a variety of products and durations. We maintain comprehensive guidelines and procedures to monitor and manage all aspects of credit and counterparty risk that we undertake. An internal rating system is used to assess potential risk of loss. State Streets risk rating process incorporates the use of risk rating tools in conjunction with management judgment. Qualitative and quantitative inputs are captured in a transparent and replicable manner, and following a formal review and approval process, an internal credit rating based on State Streets credit scale is assigned. We evaluate the credit of our counterparties on an ongoing basis, but at a minimum annually. Significant exposures are reviewed daily by ERM. Processes for credit approval and monitoring are in place for all extensions of credit. As part of the approval and renewal process, due diligence is conducted based on the size and term of the exposure, as well as the creditworthiness of the counterparty. At any point in time, having one or more counterparties to which our exposure exceeds 10% of our consolidated total shareholders equity, exclusive of unrealized gains or losses, is not unusual. We provide, on a selective basis, traditional loan products and services to key clients in a manner that is intended to enhance client relationships, increase profitability and manage risk. We employ a relationship model in which credit decisions are based on credit quality and the overall institutional relationship. An allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb estimated probable credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date; this allowance is reviewed on a regular basis by management. The provision for loan losses is a charge to current earnings to maintain the overall allowance for loan losses at a level considered appropriate relative to the level of estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. Information about provisions for loan losses is included under Provision for Loan Losses in this Managements Discussion and Analysis. We also assume other types of credit exposure with our clients and counterparties. We purchase securities under reverse repurchase agreements, which are agreements to resell. Most repurchase agreements are short term, with maturities of less than 90 days. Risk is managed through a variety of processes, including establishing the acceptability of counterparties; limiting purchases primarily to low risk U.S. government securities; taking possession or control of pledged assets; monitoring levels of underlying collateral; and limiting the duration of the agreements. Securities are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is required from the borrower. We also provide clients with off balance sheet liquidity and credit enhancement facilities in the form of letters and lines of credit and standby bond purchase agreements. These exposures are subject to an initial credit analysis, with detailed approval and review processes. These facilities are also actively monitored and reviewed annually. We maintain a separate reserve for probable credit losses related to certain of these off balance sheet activities, which is recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated statement of condition. Management reviews the appropriate level of this reserve on a regular basis. On behalf of clients enrolled in our securities lending program, we lend securities to banks, broker/dealers and other institutions. In most circumstances, we indemnify our clients for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities. Though these transactions are collateralized, the substantial volume of these activities necessitates detailed credit based underwriting and monitoring processes. The aggregate amount of indemnified securities on loan totaled $302.34 billion as of December 31, 2011, compared to $334.24 billion as of December 31, 2010. We require the borrowers to provide collateral in an amount equal to or in excess of 100% of the fair market value of the securities borrowed. State Street holds the collateral received in connection with its securities lending services as agent, and these holdings are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. The securities on loan and the collateral are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary. We held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $312.60 billion and $343.41 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The collateral held by us is invested on behalf of our clients. In certain cases, the collateral is invested in third party repurchase agreements, for which we indemnify the client against loss of the principal invested. We 89 Table of Contents require the counterparty to the repurchase agreement to provide collateral in an amount equal to or in excess of 100% of the amount of the repurchase agreement. The indemnified repurchase agreements and the related collateral are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. Of the collateral of $312.60 billion as of December 31, 2011 and $343.41 billion as of December 31, 2010 referenced above, $88.66 billion as of December 31, 2011 and $89.07 billion as of December 31, 2010 was invested in indemnified repurchase agreements. We or our agents held $93.04 billion and $93.29 billion as collateral for indemnified investments in repurchase agreements as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Investments in debt and equity securities, including investments in affiliates, are monitored regularly by Corporate Finance and Risk Management. Procedures are in place for assessing impaired securities, as described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. Operational Risk We define operational risk as the potential for loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events. As a leading provider of services to institutional investors, we provide a broad array of services, including research, investment management, trading services and investment servicing, that give rise to operational risk. Consequently, active management of operational risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business. Our Operational Risk Policy Statement defines operational risk and details roles and responsibilities for its management. The Policy Statement is reinforced by the Operational Risk Guidelines, which document our practices and provide a mandate within which programs, processes, and regulatory elements are implemented to ensure that operational risk is identified, measured, managed and controlled in a consistent manner across State Street. Responsibility for the management of operational risk lies with every individual at State Street. We maintain a governance structure related to operational risk designed to ensure that responsibilities are clearly defined and to provide independent oversight of operational risk management. The Risk and Capital Committee of the Board sets operational risk policy and oversees implementation of the operational risk framework. ERM develops corporate programs to manage operational risk and oversees the overall operational risk program. Business units take responsibility for their own operational risk and periodically review the status of the business controls, which are designed to provide a sound operational environment. The business units also identify, manage, and report on operational risk. The Operational Risk Committee reviews operational risk related information and policies, provides oversight of the operational risk program, and escalates operational risk issues of note to the MRAC and Risk and Capital Committee of the Board. Corporate Audit performs independent reviews of the application of operational risk management practices and methodologies and reports to the Examining & Audit Committee of the Board. Our discipline in managing operational risk, which is a result of this emphasis on policy, guidelines, oversight, and independent review, provides the structure to identify, evaluate, control, monitor, measure, mitigate and report operational risk. Business Risk We define business risk as the risk of adverse changes in our earnings related to business factors, including changes in the competitive environment, changes in the operational economics of business activities and the potential effect of strategic and reputation risks, not already captured as market, interest rate, credit or operational risks. We incorporate business risk into our assessment of our economic capital needs. Active management of business risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business, and responsibility for the management of business risk lies with every individual at State Street. Separating the effects of a potential material adverse event into operational and business risk is sometimes difficult. For instance, the direct financial impact of an unfavorable event in the form of fines or penalties would be classified as an operational risk loss, while the impact on our reputation and consequently the potential loss of clients and corresponding decline in revenue would be classified as a business risk loss. An additional example of 90 Table of Contents business risk is the integration of a major acquisition. Failure to successfully integrate the operations of an acquired business, and the resultant inability to retain clients and the associated revenue, would be classified as a business risk loss. Business risk is managed with a long term focus. Techniques for its assessment and management include the development of business plans and appropriate management oversight. The potential impact of the various elements of business risk is difficult to quantify with any degree of precision. We use a combination of historical earnings volatility, scenario analysis, stress testing and management judgment to help assess the potential effect on State Street attributable to business risk. Management and control of business risks are generally the responsibility of the business units as part of their overall strategic planning and internal risk management processes. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS In the normal course of our business, we use special purpose entities. Additional information about these special purpose entities is provided in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. One type of special purpose entity is used in connection with our involvement as collateral manager with respect to managed investment vehicles. Since we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of these managed investment vehicles as defined by GAAP, we do not record them in our consolidated financial statements. In the normal course of our business, we hold assets under custody and administration and assets under management in a custodial or fiduciary capacity for our clients, and, in conformity with GAAP, we do not record these assets in our consolidated statement of condition. Similarly, collateral funds associated with our securities finance activities are held by us as agent; therefore, we do not record these assets in our consolidated statement of condition. Additional information about our securities finance activities is provided in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. In the normal course of our business, we use derivative financial instruments to support our clients needs and to manage our interest rate and foreign currency risk. Additional information about our use of derivative instruments is provided in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, and we apply accounting policies that affect the determination of amounts reported in these financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. The majority of the accounting policies described in note 1 do not involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates in their application, or the variability of the estimates is not material to our consolidated financial statements. However, certain of these accounting policies, by their nature, require management to make judgments, involving significant estimates and assumptions, about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements, and changes in this information over time could materially affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses reported in subsequent financial statements. Based on the sensitivity of reported financial statement amounts to the underlying estimates and assumptions, the relatively more significant accounting policies applied by State Street have been identified by management as those associated with fair value measurements; interest revenue recognition and other than temporary impairment; and goodwill and other intangible assets. These accounting policies require the most subjective or complex judgments, and underlying estimates and assumptions could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. An understanding of the judgments, estimates and assumptions underlying these accounting policies is essential in order to understand our reported consolidated results of operations and financial condition. 91 Table of Contents The following is a brief discussion of the above mentioned significant accounting estimates. Management of State Street has discussed these significant accounting estimates with the Examining & Audit Committee of the Board. Fair Value Measurements We carry certain of our financial assets and liabilities at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, including trading account assets, investment securities available for sale and derivative instruments. As discussed in further detail below, changes in the fair value of these financial assets and liabilities are recorded either as components of our consolidated statement of income, or as components of other comprehensive income within shareholders equity in our consolidated statement of condition. In addition to those financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, we estimate the fair values of other financial assets and liabilities that we carry at amortized cost in our consolidated statement of condition, and we disclose these fair value estimates in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. We estimate the fair values of these financial assets and liabilities using the definition of fair value described below. At December 31, 2011, approximately $107.02 billion of our financial assets and approximately $6.82 billion of our financial liabilities were carried at fair value on a recurring basis, compared to $87.78 billion and $6.58 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2010. The amounts at December 31, 2011 represented approximately 49% of our consolidated total assets and approximately 3% of our consolidated total liabilities, compared to 55% and 5%, respectively, at December 31, 2010. The decrease in the relative percentage of consolidated total assets at December 31, 2011 compared to 2010 mainly reflected the impact of a significant increase in interest bearing deposits with banks, in which we invested excess client deposits, partly offset by purchases of asset backed and other debt securities available for sale as part of our re investment strategy. The significant increase in client deposits and our re investment strategy are more fully discussed under Net Interest Revenue in Consolidated Results of Operations in this Managements Discussion and Analysis. Additional information with respect to the assets and liabilities carried by us at fair value on a recurring basis is provided in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. GAAP defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. When we measure fair value for our financial assets and liabilities, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. When possible, we look to active and observable markets to measure the fair value of identical, or similar, financial assets or liabilities. When identical financial assets and liabilities are not traded in active markets, we look to market observable data for similar assets and liabilities. In some instances, certain assets and liabilities are not actively traded in observable markets, and as a result we use alternate valuation techniques to measure their fair value. We categorize the financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value in our consolidated statement of condition on a recurring basis based on a prescribed three level valuation hierarchy. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1) and the lowest priority to valuation methods using significant unobservable inputs (level 3). At December 31, 2011, including the effect of master netting agreements, we categorized approximately 90% of our financial assets carried at fair value in level 2, with the remaining 10% categorized in levels 1 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy. At December 31, 2011, on the same basis, we categorized approximately 95% of our financial liabilities carried at fair value in level 2, with the remaining 5% categorized in levels 1 and 3. The assets categorized in level 1 were composed of trading account assets and U.S. Treasury securities available for sale, specifically Treasury bills, which have a maturity of one year or less. Fair value for these securities was measured by management using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical securities. 92 Table of Contents The assets categorized in level 2 were composed of investment securities available for sale and derivative instruments. Fair value for the investment securities was measured by management primarily using information obtained from independent third parties. Information obtained from third parties is subject to review by management as part of a validation process. Management utilizes a process to verify the information provided, including an understanding of underlying assumptions and the level of market participant information used to support those assumptions. In addition, management compares significant assumptions used by third parties to available market information. Such information may include known trades or, to the extent that trading activity is limited, comparisons to market research information pertaining to credit expectations, execution prices and the timing of cash flows, and where information is available, back testing. The derivative instruments categorized in level 2 predominantly represented foreign exchange and interest rate contracts used in our trading activities, for which fair value was measured by management using discounted cash flow techniques, with inputs consisting of observable spot and forward points, as well as observable interest rate curves. The substantial majority of our financial assets categorized in level 3 were composed of asset backed and mortgage backed securities available for sale. Level 3 assets also included derivative instruments, mainly foreign exchange contracts. The aggregate fair value of our financial assets and liabilities categorized in level 3 as of December 31, 2011 compared to 2010 increased approximately 47%, primarily composed of purchases of U.S. and non U.S. asset backed securities in connection with our above described re investment strategy. With respect to derivative instruments, we evaluated the impact on valuation of the credit risk of our counterparties and our own credit. We considered factors such as the market based probability of default by us and our counterparties, our current and expected potential future net exposures by remaining maturities in determining the appropriate measurements of fair value. Valuation adjustments associated with derivative instruments were not significant for 2011, 2010 or 2009. Interest Revenue Recognition and Other Than Temporary Impairment Our portfolio of fixed income investment securities constitutes a significant portion of the assets carried in our consolidated statement of condition. As discussed below, the estimation of future cash flows from these securities is a significant factor in the recognition of both interest revenue and other than temporary impairment with respect to these securities. Expectations of defaults and prepayments are the most significant assumptions underlying our estimates of future cash flows. In determining these estimates, management relies on relevant and reliable information, including but not limited to deal structure, including optional and mandatory calls, market interest rate curves, industry standard asset class specific prepayment models, recent prepayment history, independent credit ratings, and recent actual and projected credit losses. Management considers this information based on its relevance and uses its best judgment in order to determine its assumptions for underlying cash flow expectations and resulting estimates. Management reviews its underlying assumptions and develops expected future cash flow estimates at least quarterly. Additional detail with respect to the sensitivity of these default and prepayment assumptions is provided under Financial Condition Investment Securities in this Managements Discussion and Analysis. Interest Revenue Recognition Our investment portfolio, excluding the former conduit assets remaining from the 2009 consolidation, consists of securities which were not typically acquired at significant discounts or premiums to their face amounts. In connection with the conduit consolidation, we recorded certain of the conduits investment securities at a significant discount to their face amount. To the extent that future cash flows from these securities exceed their recorded carrying amounts (as expected), the portion of the discount not related to credit will be accreted into interest revenue in our consolidated statement of income over the securities remaining terms. As a result of the magnitude of the discount, the estimates associated with the timing and amount of the accretion of these security discounts into interest revenue are significant to our consolidated financial statements. 93 Table of Contents A portion of the former conduit securities, primarily asset backed securities, had expected credit losses on the date of consolidation, or were considered to be certain beneficial interests in a securitization that were not of high credit quality, and therefore, we account for these securities, including the recognition of related interest revenue, differently from the remainder of our portfolio. The accounting for these securities requires an initial estimation of the timing and amount of each of the securities expected future principal, interest and other contractual cash flows, and the calculation of a yield based on these estimates, which yield is maintained and used to recognize interest revenue. Generally, the timing and amount of these securities future cash flows are inherently uncertain, due to the unknown timing and amount of principal payments (including potential credit losses) and the variability of future interest rates. Since the conduit consolidation, we have recorded aggregate discount accretion in interest revenue in our consolidated statement of income of $1.55 billion, composed of $220 million in 2011, $712 million in 2010 and $621 million in 2009. We recorded significantly less accretion in 2011 as a result of the December 2010 investment portfolio repositioning, and we similarly expect to record significantly less accretion in future years. Additional information about this discount accretion is provided under Consolidated Results of Operations Total Revenue Net Interest Revenue in this Managements Discussion and Analysis. Other Than Temporary Impairment GAAP also requires the use of cash flow estimates to evaluate other than temporary impairment of our investment securities. The amount and timing of expected future cash flows are significant estimates in the determination of other than temporary impairment. Additional information with respect to managements assessment of other than temporary impairment is provided in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill is created when the purchase price exceeds the assigned fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses, and represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements being acquired. Other acquired identifiable intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair value. Goodwill is not amortized. Other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, and both goodwill and other intangible assets are subject to an impairment adjustment if events or circumstances indicate the potential inability to realize the carrying amount. In conformity with GAAP, we evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances dictate. Substantially all of the goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in our consolidated statement of condition have resulted from business acquisitions of our Investment Servicing line of business, with the remainder associated with our Investment Management line of business. Goodwill is ultimately supported by revenue from our investment servicing and investment management businesses. A decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth, or our inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods, could lead to a perceived impairment of goodwill, which would be evaluated and, if necessary, be recorded as a write down of the reported amount of goodwill through a charge to earnings in our consolidated statement of income. On an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances dictate, management reviews goodwill and evaluates events or other developments that may indicate impairment of the carrying amount. We perform this evaluation at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our two major lines of business. The evaluation methodology for potential impairment is inherently complex and involves significant management judgment in the use of estimates and assumptions. We evaluate goodwill for impairment using a two step process. First, we compare the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, no impairment exists. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, then we compare the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, then goodwill impairment is recognized by writing the goodwill down to the implied fair value. The implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the 94 Table of Contents reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, as if the unit had been acquired in a business combination and the overall fair value of the unit was the purchase price. To determine the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit being evaluated for goodwill impairment, we use one of two principal methodologies: a market approach, based on a comparison of the reporting unit to publicly traded companies in similar lines of business; or an income approach, based on the value of the cash flows that the business can be expected to generate in the future. Events that may indicate impairment include significant or adverse changes in the business, economic or political climate; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; unanticipated competition; and a more likely than not expectation that we will sell or otherwise dispose of a business to which the goodwill or other intangible assets relate. Additional information about goodwill and other intangible assets, including information by line of business, is provided in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. Our evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment in 2011 indicated that there was no significant impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets in 2011. There was no significant impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets in 2010, and no impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets was recorded in 2009. Goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in our consolidated statement of condition at December 31, 2011 totaled approximately $5.65 billion and $2.46 billion, respectively, compared to $5.60 billion and $2.59 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2010.
