ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following is a discussion of the financial condition and results of operations for the period from July 1, 2000 through November 22, 2000, the period from November 23, 2000 through June 29, 2001, the fiscal year ended June 28, 2002 and the fiscal year ended June 27, 2003 for us and our predecessor. Financial information for the period from July 1, 2000 through November 22, 2000 is the historical financial information of our predecessor, and when combined with the period from November 23, 2000 through June 29, 2001 is considered herein to be pro forma fiscal year 2001.

Those divisions are our predecessor, and our operations prior to the sale of XIOtech were substantially identical to the operations of our predecessor before the November 2000 transactions. Although we were incorporated on August 10, 2000, prior to November 23, 2000, our operations were not material. Pro forma financial information related to revenue and cost of revenue for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2001 is based on our historical consolidated financial statements for the period from November 23, 2000 through June 29, 2001 and the historical combined financial statements of our predecessor for the period from July 1, 2000 through November 22, 2000, adjusted to give pro forma effect to the November 2000 transactions and to eliminate the related compensation charges, as if the November 2000 transactions had occurred on July 1, 2000.
