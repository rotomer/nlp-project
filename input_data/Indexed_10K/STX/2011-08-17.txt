BUSINESS We are the worlds leading provider of hard disk drives based on revenue. We design, manufacture, market and sell hard disk drives. Hard disk drives, commonly referred to as disk drives, hard drives or HDDs, are devices that store digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating disks with magnetic surfaces. The performance attributes of disk drives, including their cost effectiveness, high quality, high storage capacities and energy efficiencies have resulted in disk drives being used as the primary medium for mass storage of electronic data. We produce a broad range of disk drive products addressing enterprise applications, where our products are designed for enterprise servers, mainframes and workstations; client compute applications, where our products are designed for desktop and notebook computers; and client non compute applications, where our products are designed for a wide variety of end user devices such as digital video recorders (DVRs), personal data backup systems, portable external storage systems and digital media systems. In addition to manufacturing and selling disk drives, we provide data storage services for small to medium sized businesses, including online backup, data protection and recovery solutions. Industry Overview Electronic Data Storage Industry The electronic data storage industry is comprised of companies that manufacture components or subcomponents designed for electronic data storage devices and companies that provide storage solutions through a variety of technologies such as disk drives, tape storage and semiconductor based storage technologies such as flash memory. Participants in the electronic data storage industry include: Major subcomponent manufacturers. Companies that manufacture components or subcomponents used in electronic data storage devices or solutions include companies such as Fuji Electric Device Technology Co., Ltd., Showa Denko K.K. and TDK Corporation, which supply heads and media to disk drive manufacturers; LSI Corporation and Marvell Technology Group Limited, which supply application specific integrated circuits (ASICs); and Hoya Corporation, which supplies glass substrates. Hardware storage solutions manufacturers. Companies that transform components into storage products include disk drive manufacturers such as Seagate, Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Toshiba Corporation and Western Digital Corporation; magnetic tape storage manufacturers such as Quantum Corporation; and semiconductor storage manufacturers such as Intel Corporation, Micron Technology, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., SanDisk Corporation and STEC, Inc., whose operations include integrating flash memory into storage products such as solid state drives (SSDs). System integrators. Companies that bundle and package storage components such as storage hardware and software into client compute, client non compute or enterprise applications. Client compute original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) include Acer Inc., Apple Inc., Dell Inc., Hewlett Packard Company and Lenovo Group Limited; client non compute OEMs include Apple Inc., DIRECTV Group, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, Motorola, Inc., Scientific Atlanta Inc., Sony Corporation and TiVo Inc.; and enterprise storage system OEMs include EMC Corporation, Hewlett Packard Company and NetApp, Inc. Distributors who integrate storage hardware and software into end user applications are also included in this category. Storage services. Another area within the electronic data storage industry is services and solutions related to the backup, archiving, recovery and discovery of electronic data. 4 Table of Contents Demand for Electronic Data Storage The electronic data storage industry has traditionally been focused on client compute applications. We believe that technological advances in storage technology and a proliferation of client non compute applications such as digital video recorders, gaming devices, digital music players and digital cameras are driving the broad, global proliferation and growth of digital content through the: creation and sharing of all types of digital content, such as high resolution photos, high definition video and movies and music by consumers and electronic data by enterprises; aggregation and distribution of digital content through services and other offerings such as YouTube, Facebook, Pandora, iTunes, Hulu and LinkedIn; network and video infrastructure, including broadband, internet protocol television (IPTV), cable and satellite that has enabled the access, hosting and distribution of such digital content; enjoyment and consumption of digital content through DVRs, handheld devices, tablets and gaming consoles, as well as in automobiles; and protection of digital content through storage on backup devices and storage services. As a result of these factors, the nature and amount of content being created requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store, manage, distribute, utilize and backup such content. This in turn has resulted in the rapid growth in demand for electronic data storage applications and solutions which we believe will continue to grow with the increased demand for electronic data storage, in developed countries as well as in emerging economies. We believe that demand for electronic data storage in the enterprise and traditional compute markets continues to grow as the proliferation of digital content in the consumer space has resulted in additional demand for storage by enterprises, including those that host, aggregate, distribute or share such content. Other factors driving demand for additional storage include: continued growth in cloud computing and backup services for enterprises seeking efficient and cost effective methods of processing and storing mass data increases demand for storage as data centers expand and proliferate; increasing legal and regulatory requirements, which necessitate larger archives; and changes in the nature and amount of data being stored, such as the growing use of digital records in the healthcare industry Demand Trends for Disk Drives We believe that continued growth in digital content requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store, aggregate, host, distribute, manage, backup and use such content, which we believe will continue to result in increased demand for disk drive products. In addition, we believe the continued increase in demand for disk drives, in developed countries as well as in emerging economies, reflects the demand for real time access to rich data and content driven by the impact of a highly mobile and increasingly connected user base. We believe these trends will continue as computing architectures evolve to serve the growing commercial and consumer user base throughout the world. Historically, the electronic data storage industry has introduced alternative technologies that directly compete with hard disk drives. SSDs, using NAND flash memory, are a potential alternative to disk drives in certain applications such as consumer handheld devices, tablets and portable external storage. NAND flash memory is a type of non volatile storage technology. However, we believe that in the foreseeable future the traditional enterprise and client compute markets that require high capacity storage solutions, as well as the data intensive client non compute markets, will continue to be best served by hard disk drives based on the industrys ability to deliver reliable, energy efficient and cost effective mass storage devices. 5 Table of Contents Disk Drives for Enterprise Storage. We define enterprise storage as disk drives designed for mission critical applications and nearline applications. Mission critical applications are defined as applications that are vital to the operation of enterprises, requiring high performance, and high reliability disk drives. We expect the market for mission critical enterprise storage solutions to continue to be driven by enterprises moving network traffic to dedicated storage area networks in an effort to reduce network complexity and increase energy savings. We believe that this transition will lead to an increased demand for more energy efficient, smaller form factor disk drives. These solutions are comprised principally of high performance enterprise class disk drives with sophisticated firmware and communications technologies. Nearline applications are defined as applications that are capacity intensive and require high capacity and energy efficient disk drives featuring low costs per gigabyte. We expect such applications, which include storage for cloud computing and backup services, will continue to grow and drive demand for disk drives designed with these attributes. SSD storage applications have been introduced as a potential alternative to redundant system startup or boot disk drives. In addition, enterprises are gradually adopting SSDs in applications where rapid processing and or energy efficiency is required. The timing of significant adoption of SSDs is dependent on enterprises weighing the cost effectiveness and other benefits of mission critical enterprise disk drives against the perceived performance benefits of SSDs. Disk Drives for Client Compute. We define client compute applications as disk drives designed for the traditional desktop and mobile compute applications. We believe that the increase in demand resulting from growing economies of certain countries and the continued proliferation of digital content will drive the demand for the client compute market. Disk Drives for Client Non Compute. We define client non compute applications as disk drives designed for consumer electronic devices and disk drives used for external storage and network attached storage (NAS). Disk drives designed for consumer electronic devices are primarily used in applications such as DVRs that require a higher capacity, low cost per gigabyte storage solution. Disk drives for external and NAS devices are designed for purposes such as personal data backup and portable external storage, and to augment storage capacity in the consumers current desktop, notebook, tablet or DVR disk drive capacities. Client non compute applications also include devices designed to display digital media in the home theater. We believe the proliferation of high definition and media rich digital content will continue to create increasing consumer demand for higher storage solutions. As the proliferation of client non compute applications that require minimal storage such as tablets continues, SSDs could become more competitive within the client compute market in the future. Industry Supply Balance From time to time the industry has experienced periods of imbalance between supply and demand. To the extent that the disk drive industry builds capacity based on expectations of demand that do not materialize, price erosion may become more pronounced. Conversely, during periods where demand exceeds supply, price erosion is generally muted. For the first half of fiscal year 2011, our industry experienced a period of relative balance between supply and demand. We also believe there was unmet demand in the last quarter of fiscal year 2011 due to a reaction to possible supply chain disruptions stemming from the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. However, the industry returned to a relatively balanced supply environment at the end of the fiscal year. 6 Table of Contents Disk Drive Technology Overview The design and manufacturing of disk drives depends on highly advanced technology and manufacturing techniques and therefore requires high levels of research and development spending and capital equipment investments. Manufacturing our disk drives is a complex process that begins with the production of individual components and ends with a fully assembled unit. We design, fabricate and assemble a number of the most important components found in our disk drives, including read/write heads and recording media. Our design and manufacturing operations are based on technology platforms that are used to produce various disk drive products that serve multiple data storage applications and markets. Our core technology platforms are focused around the areal density of media and read/write head technologies. Using an integrated platform design and manufacturing leverage approach allows us to deliver a portfolio of disk drive products to service a wide range of electronic data storage applications and a wide range of industries. Disk Drive Performance Disk drive performance is commonly differentiated by six key characteristics: storage capacity, commonly expressed in gigabytes (GB) or terabytes (TB), which is the amount of data that can be stored on the disk; spindle rotation speed, commonly expressed in revolutions per minute (RPM), which has an effect on speed of access to data; interface transfer rate, commonly expressed in megabytes per second, which is the rate at which data moves between the disk drive and the computer controller; average seek time, commonly expressed in milliseconds, which is the time needed to position the heads over a selected track on the disk surface; data transfer rate, commonly expressed in megabytes per second, which is the rate at which data is transferred to and from the disk; and product quality and reliability, commonly expressed in annualized return rates. Areal Density Areal density is a measure of storage capacity per square inch on the recording surface of a disk. The capacity of a disk drive is determined by the number of disks it contains as well as the areal density capability of these disks. We have been pursuing, and will continue to pursue, a number of technologies to increase areal densities across the entire range of our products for expanding disk drive capacities and reducing the number of disks and heads per drive to further reduce product costs. Manufacturing Disk drive manufacturers are distinguished by their level of vertical integration, which is the degree to which they control the design and manufacture of the technology used in their products and by whether they are captive, producing disk drives for their own computer systems, or independent, producing disk drives as a stand alone product. Vertically integrated hard drive manufacturers design and produce their own read/write heads and recording media, which are critical technologies for disk drives. This integrated approach enables manufacturers to lower costs and to improve the functionality of components so that they work together efficiently. In contrast, manufacturers that are not integrated purchase most of their components from third party suppliers, upon whom they depend for key elements of their technological innovation and 7 Table of Contents differentiation. This can limit their ability to coordinate technology roadmaps and optimize the component design process for manufacturing efficiency and product reliability while making them reliant on the technology investment decisions of their suppliers. Independent manufacturers can enjoy a competitive advantage over captive manufacturers in working with OEMs because they do not compete with OEMs for computer system sales. We believe the competitive dynamics of the disk drive industry favor vertically integrated, independent manufacturers with the scale to make substantial technology investments and apply them across a broad product portfolio and set of customers. We pursue a vertically integrated business strategy based on the ownership of critical component technologies, allowing us to maintain control over our product roadmap and component cost, quality and availability. We believe that because of our vertical design and manufacturing strategy, we are well suited to meet the challenges posed by the close interdependence of components for disk drives. Our manufacturing efficiency and flexibility are critical elements of our integrated business strategy. We continuously seek to improve our manufacturing efficiency and cost by: employing manufacturing automation to enhance our efficiency; improving product quality and reliability and reducing costs; integrating our supply chain with suppliers and customers to enhance our demand visibility and reduce our working capital requirements; coordinating between our manufacturing group and our research and development organization to rapidly achieve volume manufacturing; and rationalizing the facilities we operate and reducing the number of personnel we employ. A vertically integrated model, however, tends to have less flexibility when demand moderates as it exposes us to higher unit costs as capacity utilization is not optimized. Due to the significant challenges posed by the need to continually innovate and improve manufacturing efficiency and the continued demands on capital and research and development investments required to do so, the disk drive industry has undergone significant consolidation as disk drive manufacturers and component manufacturers merged with other companies or exited the industry. The increasing technological challenges, associated levels of investment and competitive necessity of large scale operations may also drive future industry consolidation. Additionally, we may in the future face indirect competition from customers who from time to time evaluate whether to offer electronic data storage products that may compete with our products. Components and Raw Materials All of our disk drive products incorporate certain components, including a head disk assembly and a printed circuit board mounted to the head disk assembly, which are sealed inside a rigid base and top cover containing the recording components in a contamination controlled environment. We maintain a highly integrated approach to our business by designing and manufacturing a significant portion of the components we view as critical to our products, such as recording heads and media. Read/Write Heads. The function of the read/write head is to scan across the disk as it spins, magnetically recording or reading information. The tolerances of recording heads are extremely demanding and require state of the art equipment and processes. Our read/write heads are manufactured with thin film and photolithographic processes similar to those used to produce semiconductor integrated circuits, though challenges in magnetic film properties and topographical structures are unique to the disk drive industry. We perform all primary stages of design and manufacture of read/write heads at our facilities. We use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced read/write heads, the mix of which varies based on product mix, technology and our internal capacity levels. 8 Table of Contents Media. Information is written to the media, or disk, as it rotates at very high speeds past the read/write head. The media is made from non magnetic material, usually aluminum alloy or glass, and is coated with a thin layer of magnetic material. We use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced finished media and aluminum substrates, the mix of which varies based on product mix, technology and our internal capacity levels. We purchase all of our glass substrates from third parties, which we use in the disk drives we make for mobile products. Printed Circuit Board Assemblies. The printed circuit board assemblies (PCBAs) are comprised of standard and custom ASICs and ancillary electronic control chips. The ASICs control the movement of data to and from the read/write heads and through the internal controller and interface, which communicates with the host computer. The ASICs and control chips form electronic circuitry that delivers instructions to a head positioning mechanism called an actuator to guide the heads to the selected track of a disk where the data is recorded or retrieved. Disk drive manufacturers use one or more industry standard interfaces such as serial advanced technology architecture (SATA); small computer system interface (SCSI); serial attached SCSI (SAS); or Fibre Channel (FC) to communicate to the host systems. We outsource to third parties the manufacture and assembly of the PCBAs used in our disk drives. We do not manufacture any ASICs, but we participate in their proprietary design. Head Disk Assembly. The head disk assembly consists of one or more disks attached to a spindle assembly powered by a spindle motor that rotates the disks at a high constant speed around a hub. Read/write heads, mounted on an arm assembly, similar in concept to that of a record player, fly extremely close to each disk surface and record data on and retrieve it from concentric tracks in the magnetic layers of the rotating disks. The read/write heads are mounted vertically on an E shaped assembly (E block) that is actuated by a voice coil motor to allow the heads to move from track to track. The E block and the recording media are mounted inside the head disk assembly. We purchase spindle motors from outside vendors and from time to time participate in the design of the motors that go into our products. Disk Drive Assembly. Following the completion of the head disk assembly, it is mated to the PCBA, and the completed unit goes through extensive defect mapping and testing prior to packaging and shipment. Disk drive assembly and test operations occur primarily at facilities located in China and Thailand. We perform subassembly and component manufacturing operations at our facilities in China, Malaysia, Northern Ireland, Singapore, Thailand and in the United States in Minnesota. In addition, third parties manufacture and assemble components for us in various Asian countries, including China, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam, in Europe and in the United States. Suppliers of Components and Industry Constraints. Due to industry consolidation, there are a limited number of independent suppliers of components, such as recording heads and media, available to disk drive manufacturers. Vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers, who manufacture their own components, are less dependent on external component suppliers than less vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers. Commodity and Other Manufacturing Costs. The production of disk drives requires rare earth elements, precious metals, scarce alloys and industrial commodities, which are subject to fluctuations in prices and the supply of which has at times been constrained. During the latter part of fiscal year 2011, the industry experienced significant increases in the costs of rare earth elements, which are used in magnets as well as in the process for polishing glass substrates. In addition to increased costs of components and commodities, volatility in fuel costs may also increase our costs related to commodities, manufacturing and freight. As a result, we may increase our use of ocean shipments to help offset any increase in freight costs. Products We offer a broad range of disk drive products for the enterprise, client compute and client non compute market applications. We offer more than one product within each product family and 9 Table of Contents differentiate products on the basis of price, performance, form factor, capacity, interface, power consumption efficiency, security features like full disk encryption and other customer integration requirements.

Customers We sell our disk drives to major OEMs, distributors and retailers under our globally recognized brand names. We have longstanding relationships with many of our OEM customers, such as Hewlett Packard Company, Dell Inc. and EMC Corporation. The following table summarizes our disk drive revenue by channel and by geography: Fiscal Years Ended July 1, 2011 July 2, 2010 July 3, 2009 Revenues by Channel (%) OEM 69 % 71 % 64 % Distributors 22 % 21 % 27 % Retail 9 % 8 % 9 % Revenues by Geography (%) Americas 29 % 26 % 28 % EMEA 20 % 22 % 27 % Asia Pacific 51 % 52 % 45 % OEM customers typically enter into master purchase agreements with us. These agreements provide for pricing, volume discounts, order lead times, product support obligations and other terms and conditions. The term of these agreements is usually 6 to 24 months; however they are generally cancelable for convenience by either party upon written notice. Our product support obligations generally extend substantially beyond the term of these agreements. These master agreements typically do not commit the customer to buy any minimum quantity of products or create exclusive relationships. Deliveries are scheduled only after receipt of purchase orders. In addition, with limited lead time, customers may cancel or defer most purchase orders without significant penalty. Anticipated orders from many of our customers have in the past failed to materialize or OEM delivery schedules have been deferred or altered as a result of changes in their business needs. Our distributors generally enter into non exclusive agreements for the resale of our products. They typically furnish us with a non binding indication of their near term requirements and product deliveries are generally scheduled accordingly. The agreements and related sales programs typically provide the distributors with limited right of return and price protection rights. In addition, we offer sales programs to distributors on a quarterly and periodic basis to promote the sale of selected products in the sales channel. Our retail channel consists of our branded storage products sold to retailers either by us directly or by our distributors. Retail sales made by us or our distributors typically require greater marketing support, sales incentives and price protection periods. In fiscal year 2011, Hewlett Packard Company accounted for approximately 15% of consolidated revenue, while Dell Inc. accounted for approximately 13% of consolidated revenue. In each of fiscal years 2010 and 2009, Hewlett Packard Company accounted for approximately 16% of consolidated revenue, while Dell Inc. accounted for approximately 11% of consolidated revenue. We have master purchase agreements in place with Hewlett Packard Company and Dell Inc. that are cancelable for convenience by either party upon written notice, and do not require either customer to purchase any minimum or other specified quantity of our products. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business Dependence on Key Customers We may be adversely affected by the loss of, or reduced, delayed or cancelled purchases by, one or more of our larger customers." 11  Table of Contents Competition The markets that we compete in are intensely competitive. Disk drive manufacturers not only compete for a limited number of major disk drive customers but also compete with other companies in the electronic data storage industry that provide alternative storage solutions, such as flash memory, tape, optical and SSDs. Some of the principal factors used by customers to differentiate among electronic data storage solutions manufacturers are storage capacity, price per unit and price per gigabyte, storage/retrieval access times, data transfer rates, product quality and reliability, supply continuity, form factor, warranty and brand. We believe that our disk drive products are competitive with respect to each of these factors in the markets that we currently address. We summarize below our principal disk drive competitors, other competitors, the effect of competition on price erosion for our products, product life cycles and technology. Principal Disk Drive Competitors. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition from a number of domestic and foreign companies, some of which have greater financial and other resources than we have. These competitors include independent disk drive manufacturers such as Western Digital Corporation, as well as large captive manufacturers such as Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and Toshiba Corporation. Because these captive manufacturers produce complete computer systems and other non compute consumer electronics and mobile devices, they can derive a greater portion of their operating margins from other components, which may reduce their need to realize a profit on the disk drives included in their computer systems and may allow them to sell disk drives to third parties at very low margins. Many captive manufacturers are also formidable competitors because they have more resources and greater access to their internal customers than we do. In addition, competitors such as Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and Toshiba Corporation are increasingly integrating other storage technologies such as flash memory, hybrid disk drives and SSDs into their product offerings. Not only may they be willing to sell their disk drives at a lower margin to advance their overall business strategy, their portfolio may allow them to be indifferent to which technology prevails over the other as they can offer a broad range of storage media and solutions and focus on those with lowest costs and greatest sales. In addition to competing with our disk drive competitors, we also compete with companies such as Iomega Corporation (an EMC company) and LaCie S.A. that purchase disk drives from us and our competitors for use in their branded storage products. Other Competitors. We also are experiencing competition from companies that provide alternative storage technologies such as flash memory and SSDs. In the flash memory market, primarily used in lower capacity handheld devices, our principal competitors include Micron Technology, Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., SanDisk Corporation and Toshiba Corporation. In enterprise applications, where SSDs are used for rapid processing and high volume transactions, our principal SSD competitors include Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, Intel Corporation and STEC Inc., with others expected to enter in the near future. Price Erosion. Our industry has been characterized by price declines for disk drive products with comparable capacity, performance and feature sets ("like for like products"). Price declines for like for like products ("price erosion") are more pronounced during periods of: economic contraction or industry consolidation in which competitors may use discounted pricing to attempt to maintain or gain market share; few new product introductions when multiple competitors have comparable or alternative product offerings; temporary imbalances between industry supply and demand; and seasonally weaker demand, which may cause excess supply. 12 Table of Contents Disk drive manufacturers typically attempt to offset price erosion with an improved mix of disk drive products characterized by higher capacity, better performance and additional feature sets and or product cost reductions. We expect price erosion in our industry to continue. To remain competitive, we believe it is necessary for industry participants to continue to introduce new product offerings that utilize advanced technologies ahead of the competition in order to take advantage of potentially higher initial profit margins and reduced cost structures on these new products. Product Life Cycles and Changing Technology. Our industry has been characterized by significant advances in technology, which have contributed to rapid product life cycles. As a result, success in our industry has been dependent to a large extent on the ability to be the first to market with new products, allowing those disk drive manufacturers who introduce new products first to benefit from improved product mix, favorable profit margins and less pricing pressure until comparable products are introduced. Also, because our industry is characterized by continuous price erosion, the existence of rapid product life cycles has necessitated quick achievement of product cost effectiveness. Changing technology also necessitates on going investments in research and development, which may be difficult to recover due to rapid product life cycles and economic declines. Further, there is a continued need to successfully execute product transitions and new product introductions, as factors such as quality, reliability and manufacturing yields become of increasing competitive importance. Seasonality The disk drive industry traditionally experiences seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the second half of the calendar year. This seasonality is driven by consumer spending in the back to school season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter. In addition, corporate demand is typically higher during the second half of the calendar year. However, with volatility in fuel costs, the industry may be experiencing higher levels of demand earlier in the calendar year as customers attempt to take advantage of less expensive modes of transportation, which generally require longer lead times. Research and Development We are committed to developing new component technologies, products and alternative storage technologies, including solid state technology. Our research and development focus is designed to bring new products to market in high volume, with quality attributes that our customers expect, before our competitors. Part of our product development strategy is to leverage a design platform and or subsystem within product families to serve different market needs. This platform strategy allows for more efficient resource utilization, leverages best design practices, reduces exposure to changes in demand, and allows for achievement of lower costs through purchasing economies. Our advanced technology integration effort focuses disk drive and component research on recording subsystems, including read/write heads and recording media, market specific product technology and technology focused towards new business opportunities. The primary purpose of our advanced technology integration effort is to ensure timely availability of mature component technologies to our product development teams as well as allowing us to leverage and coordinate those technologies in the design centers across our products in order to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace. During fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, we had product development expenses of approximately $875 million, $877 million and $953 million, respectively, which represented 8%, 8% and 10% of our consolidated revenue, respectively. Patents and Licenses As of July 1, 2011, we had 4,370 U.S. patents and 553 patents issued in various foreign jurisdictions as well as 1,093 U.S. and 444 foreign patent applications pending. The number of patents and patent 13 Table of Contents applications will vary at any given time as part of our ongoing patent portfolio management activity. Due to the rapid technological change that characterizes the electronic data storage industry, we believe that, in addition to patent protection, the improvement of existing products, reliance upon trade secrets, protection of unpatented proprietary know how and development of new products are also important to our business in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage. Accordingly, we intend to continue our efforts to broadly protect our intellectual property, including obtaining patents, where available, in connection with our research and development program. The electronic data storage industry is characterized by significant litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property rights. Because of rapid technological development in the electronic data storage industry, some of our products have been, and in the future could be, alleged to infringe existing patents of third parties. From time to time, we receive claims that our products infringe patents of third parties. Although we have been able to resolve some of those claims or potential claims by obtaining licenses or rights under the patents in question without a material adverse affect on us, other claims have resulted in adverse decisions or settlements. In addition, other claims are pending, which if resolved unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. For more information on these claims, see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 13, Legal, Environmental, and Other Contingencies." The costs of engaging in intellectual property litigation in the past have been, and in the future may be, substantial, irrespective of the merits of the claim or the outcome. We have patent licenses with a number of companies. Additionally, as part of our normal intellectual property practices, we may be engaged in negotiations with other major electronic data storage companies and component manufacturers with respect to patent licenses. Backlog In view of our customers rights to cancel or defer orders with little or no penalty, we believe backlog in the disk drive industry is of limited indicative value in estimating future performance and results. Environmental Matters Our operations are subject to U.S. and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by issuing authorities. We have established environmental management systems and continually update our environmental policies and standard operating procedures for our operations worldwide. We believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws, regulations and permits. We budget for operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws. If additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future, we could incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures. Some environmental laws, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (as amended, the "Superfund" law) and its state equivalents, can impose liability for the cost of cleanup of contaminated sites upon any of the current or former site owners or operators or upon parties who sent waste to these sites, regardless of whether the owner or operator owned the site at the time of the release of hazardous substances or the lawfulness of the original disposal activity. We have been identified as a potentially responsible party at several sites. At each of these sites, we have an assigned portion of the financial liability based on the type and amount of hazardous substances disposed of by each party at the site and the number of financially viable parties. We have fulfilled our responsibilities at some of these sites and remain involved in only a few sites at this time. 14 Table of Contents While our ultimate costs in connection with these sites is difficult to predict with complete accuracy, based on our current estimates of cleanup costs and our expected allocation of these costs, we do not expect costs in connection with these sites to be material. We may be subject to various state, federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment, including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products. For example, the European Union ("EU") enacted the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment, which prohibits the use of certain substances, including lead, in certain products, including disk drives, put on the market after July 1, 2006. Similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions, including in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Taiwan, China, Japan and others. The European Union REACH Directive (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and restriction of Chemicals, EC 1907/2006) also restricts substances of very high concern (SVHCs) in products. If we or our suppliers fail to comply with the substance restrictions, recycle requirements or other environmental requirements as they are enacted worldwide, it could have a materially adverse effect on our business. Employees At July 1, 2011, we employed approximately 52,700 employees, temporary employees and contractors worldwide, of which approximately 45,500 employees were located in our Asian operations. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees at all levels. We believe that our employee relations are good.
