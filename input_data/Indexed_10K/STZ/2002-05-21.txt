RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FISCAL 2002 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2001 NET SALES The following table sets forth the net sales (in thousands of dollars) by operating segment of the Company for Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001. Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001 Net Sales %Increase 2002 2001 (Decrease) Popular and Premium Wine: Branded: External customers $ 781,662 $ 603,948 29.4 % Intersegment 9,669 6,451 49.9 % Total Branded 791,331 610,399 29.6 % Other: External customers 57,718 64,799 (10.9)% Intersegment 13,751 16,562 (17.0)% Total Other 71,469 81,361 (12.2)% Popular and Premium Wine net sales $ 862,800 $ 691,760 24.7 % Imported Beer and Spirits: Beer $ 758,800 $ 659,371 15.1 % Spirits 288,568 285,743 1.0 % Imported Beer and Spirits net sales $ 1,047,368 $ 945,114 10.8 % U.K. Brands and Wholesale: Branded: External customers $ 296,770 $ 285,717 3.9 % Intersegment 574 1,193 (51.9)% Total Branded 297,344 286,910 3.6 % Wholesale 495,549 404,209 22.6 % U.K. Brands and Wholesale net sales $ 792,893 $ 691,119 14.7 % 22 Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001 Net Sales %Increase 2002 2001 (Decrease) Fine Wine: External customers $ 141,436 $ 92,898 52.2 % Intersegment 753 217 247.0 % Fine Wine net sales $ 142,189 $ 93,115 52.7 % Corporate Operations and Other $ $ N/A Intersegment eliminations $ (24,747) $ (24,423) 1.3 % Consolidated Net Sales $ 2,820,503 $ 2,396,685 17.7 % Net sales for Fiscal 2002 increased to $2,820.5 million from $2,396.7 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of $423.8 million, or 17.7%. POPULAR AND PREMIUM WINE Net sales for the Popular and Premium Wine segment for Fiscal 2002 increased to $862.8 million from $691.8 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of $171.0 million, or 24.7%. This increase resulted primarily from $188.1 million of sales of the newly acquired brands from the Turner Road Vintners Assets and Corus Assets acquisitions (the "March Acquisitions"), both completed in March 2001. This increase was partially offset by declines in the Popular and Premium Wine segments grape juice concentrate business and certain other wine brands. IMPORTED BEER AND SPIRITS Net sales for the Imported Beer and Spirits segment for Fiscal 2002 increased to $1,047.4 million from $945.1 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of $102.3 million, or 10.8%. This increase resulted primarily from a 15.1% increase in imported beer sales, led by volume growth in the Mexican beer portfolio. Spirits sales increased slightly primarily from an increase in bulk whiskey sales, partially offset by slightly lower branded spirits sales as a result of lower net selling prices from the implementation of a net pricing strategy in the third quarter of Fiscal 2001, which also resulted in lower promotion costs. U.K. BRANDS AND WHOLESALE Net sales for the U.K. Brands and Wholesale segment for Fiscal 2002 increased to $792.9 million from $691.1 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of $101.8 million, or 14.7%. Excluding an adverse foreign currency impact of $28.9 million, net sales increased $130.7 million, or 18.9%. This local currency basis increase resulted primarily from a 27.1% increase in wholesale sales, with the majority of this growth coming from organic sales. Additionally, branded sales increased 7.4% with an increase in wine sales being partially offset by a decrease in cider sales. FINE WINE Net sales for the Fine Wine segment for Fiscal 2002 increased to $142.2 million from $93.1 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of $49.1 million, or 52.7%. This increase resulted primarily from $32.9 million of sales of the newly acquired brands from the Ravenswood acquisition and organic sales growth primarily due to volume increases in the Estancia, Veramonte, and Franciscan brands. 23 GROSS PROFIT The Companys gross profit increased to $919.0 million for Fiscal 2002 from $757.5 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of $161.6 million, or 21.3%. The dollar increase in gross profit resulted primarily from sales of the newly acquired brands from the March Acquisitions and the Ravenswood acquisition, volume growth in the Imported Beer and Spirits segments Mexican beer portfolio, volume growth in the Fine Wine segments portfolio, and volume growth in the U.K. Brands and Wholesale segments wholesale business and branded business. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the Imported Beer and Spirits segments spirits sales and an adverse foreign currency impact. As a percent of net sales, gross profit increased to 32.6% for Fiscal 2002 from 31.6% for Fiscal 2001, resulting primarily from sales of higher margin wine brands acquired in the March Acquisitions and the Ravenswood acquisition. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $576.6 million for Fiscal 2002 from $486.6 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of $90.0 million, or 18.5%. The dollar increase in selling, general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from an increase in advertising, promotion, selling, and general and administrative expenses associated with the brands acquired in the March Acquisitions and the Ravenswood acquisition. In addition, there were increases in promotion and advertising expenses associated with the Imported Beer and Spirits segments Mexican beer portfolio volume growth, the U.K. Brands and Wholesale segments branded business volume growth, and the Fine Wine segments portfolio volume growth. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales remained virtually unchanged at 20.4% for Fiscal 2002 as compared to 20.3% for Fiscal 2001. OPERATING INCOME The following table sets forth the operating income (loss) (in thousands of dollars) by operating segment of the Company for Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001. Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001 Operating Income (Loss) % Increase 2002 2001 (Decrease) Popular and Premium Wine $ 104,781 $ 50,390 107.9 % Imported Beer and Spirits 178,805 167,680 6.6 % U.K. Brands and Wholesale 47,270 48,961 (3.5)% Fine Wine 39,169 24,495 59.9 % Corporate Operations and Other (27,544) (20,658) 33.3 % Consolidated Operating Income $ 342,481 $ 270,868 26.4 % As a result of the above factors, operating income increased to $342.5 million for Fiscal 2002 from $270.9 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of $71.6 million, or 26.4%. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET Net interest expense increased to $114.2 million for Fiscal 2002 from $108.6 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of $5.6 million, or 5.1%. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in the average borrowings primarily due to the financing of the March Acquisitions and the Ravenswood acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in the average interest rate. 24 NET INCOME As a result of the above factors, net income increased to $136.4 million for Fiscal 2002 from $97.3 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of $39.1 million, or 40.1%. For financial analysis purposes only, the Companys earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") for Fiscal 2002 were $429.6 million, an increase of $88.3 million over EBITDA of $341.3 million for Fiscal 2001. EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income or net cash flow from operating activities and should not be construed as an indication of operating performance or as a measure of liquidity. FISCAL 2001 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2000 NET SALES The following table sets forth the net sales (in thousands of dollars) by operating segment of the Company for Fiscal 2001 and Fiscal 2000. Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000 Net Sales %Increase 2001 2000 (Decrease) Popular and Premium Wine: Branded: External customers $ 603,948 $ 623,796 (3.2)% Intersegment 6,451 5,524 16.8 % Total Branded 610,399 629,320 (3.0)% Other: External customers 64,799 86,814 (25.4)% Intersegment 16,562 1,146 1345.2 % Total Other 81,361 87,960 (7.5)% Popular and Premium Wine net sales $ 691,760 $ 717,280 (3.6)% Imported Beer and Spirits: Beer $ 659,371 $ 570,380 15.6 % Spirits 285,743 267,762 6.7 % Imported Beer and Spirits net sales $ 945,114 $ 838,142 12.8 % U.K. Brands and Wholesale: Branded: External customers $ 285,717 $ 313,027 (8.7)% Intersegment 1,193 75 1490.7 % Total Branded 286,910 313,102 (8.4)% Wholesale 404,209 416,644 (3.0)% U.K. Brands and Wholesale net sales $ 691,119 $ 729,746 (5.3)% Fine Wine: External customers $ 92,898 $ 62,046 49.7 % Intersegment 217 73 197.3 % Fine Wine net sales $ 93,115 $ 62,119 49.9 % Corporate Operations and Other $ $ N/A Intersegment eliminations $ (24,423) $ (6,818) 258.2 % Consolidated Net Sales $ 2,396,685 $ 2,340,469 2.4 % Net sales for Fiscal 2001 increased to $2,396.7 million from $2,340.5 million for Fiscal 2000, an increase of $56.2 million, or 2.4%. 25 POPULAR AND PREMIUM WINE Net sales for the Popular and Premium Wine segment for Fiscal 2001 decreased to $691.8 million from $717.3 million for Fiscal 2000, a decrease of $25.5 million, or (3.6)%. The decline resulted primarily from a decrease in table wine sales, a decrease in sparkling wine sales as third quarter 2000 included the impact of sales associated with Millennium activities, and a decrease in grape juice concentrate sales. These decreases were partially offset by increases in sales of Paul Masson Grande Amber and Arbor Mist. IMPORTED BEER AND SPIRITS Net sales for the Imported Beer and Spirits segment for Fiscal 2001 increased to $945.1 million from $838.1 million for Fiscal 2000, an increase of $107.0 million, or 12.8%. This increase resulted primarily from volume growth and selling price increases in the Mexican beer portfolio, selling price increases on tequila products and the inclusion of $11.3 million of incremental net sales during the first quarter of Fiscal 2001 from the Canadian whisky brands acquired as part of the Black Velvet Assets acquisition, which was completed in April 1999. U.K. BRANDS AND WHOLESALE Net sales for the U.K. Brands and Wholesale segment for Fiscal 2001 decreased to $691.1 million from $729.7 million for Fiscal 2000, a decrease of $38.6 million, or (5.3)%. This decrease resulted primarily from an adverse foreign currency impact of $58.8 million. On a local currency basis, net sales increased 2.8% primarily due to an increase in wholesale sales, including sales from the recent Forth Wines acquisition, an increase in branded table wine sales, and an increase in packaged cider sales. These increases were partially offset by decreases in private label cider and draft cider sales. FINE WINE Net sales for the Fine Wine segment for Fiscal 2001 increased to $93.1 million from $62.1 million for Fiscal 2000, an increase of $31.0 million, or 49.9%. As the acquisition of Franciscan was completed in June 1999, this increase resulted primarily from the inclusion of $21.9 million of net sales from the first quarter of Fiscal 2001 and from selling price increases instituted during the second quarter of Fiscal 2001. GROSS PROFIT The Companys gross profit increased to $757.5 million for Fiscal 2001 from $722.5 million for Fiscal 2000, an increase of $35.0 million, or 4.8%. The dollar increase in gross profit was primarily related to volume growth and selling price increases in the Companys Mexican beer portfolio, sales attributable to the acquisitions of Franciscan (completed in June 1999) and the Black Velvet Assets (completed in April 1999), and increases in the Fine Wine segments selling prices. These increases were partially offset by an adverse foreign currency impact. As a percent of net sales, gross profit increased to 31.6% for Fiscal 2001 from 30.9% for Fiscal 2000, resulting primarily from sales of higher margin distilled spirits and super premium and ultra premium wine acquired in the acquisitions of the Black Velvet Assets and Franciscan, respectively, and from improved margins resulting from selling price increases in the Companys imported beer business and the Fine Wine segment portfolio, as well as cost improvements in the U.K. Brands and Wholesale segments cider and wholesale businesses. 26 SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $486.6 million for Fiscal 2001 from $481.9 million for Fiscal 2000, an increase of $4.7 million, or 1.0%. The dollar increase in selling, general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from an increase in selling expenses in all operating segments, the inclusion of the Franciscan business and expenses related to the brands acquired in the Black Velvet Assets acquisition for a full year in Fiscal 2001, and an increase in expenses in Corporate Operations. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in advertising and promotion expenses, primarily in the Popular and Premium Wine segment, and a favorable foreign currency impact. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales decreased to 20.3% for Fiscal 2001 as compared to 20.6% for Fiscal 2000 as the percent increase in net sales for Fiscal 2001 was greater than the percent increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for Fiscal 2001. NONRECURRING CHARGES The Company incurred nonrecurring charges of $5.5 million in Fiscal 2000 related to the closure of a cider production facility within the U.K. Brands and Wholesale operating segment in the United Kingdom ($2.9 million) and to a management reorganization within the Popular and Premium Wine operating segment ($2.6 million). No such charges were incurred in Fiscal 2001. OPERATING INCOME The following table sets forth the operating income (loss) (in thousands of dollars) by operating segment of the Company for Fiscal 2001 and Fiscal 2000. Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000 Operating Income (Loss) 2001 2000 % Increase Popular and Premium Wine $ 50,390 $ 47,305 6.5 % Imported Beer and Spirits 167,680 142,931 17.3 % U.K. Brands and Wholesale 48,961 48,473 1.0 % Fine Wine 24,495 12,708 92.8 % Corporate Operations and Other (20,658) (16,376) 26.1 % Consolidated Operating Income $ 270,868 $ 235,041 15.2 % As a result of the above factors, operating income increased to $270.9 million for Fiscal 2001 from $235.0 million for Fiscal 2000, an increase of $35.8 million, or 15.2%. Exclusive of the aforementioned $2.6 million in nonrecurring charges, operating income for the Popular and Premium Wine operating segment increased 1.0% in Fiscal 2001 from $49.9 million in Fiscal 2000. Operating income for the U.K. Brands and Wholesale operating segment, excluding the aforementioned nonrecurring charges of $2.9 million, decreased 4.8% in Fiscal 2001 from $51.4 million in Fiscal 2000. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET Net interest expense increased to $108.6 million for Fiscal 2001 from $106.1 million for Fiscal 2000, an increase of $2.5 million, or 2.4%. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in the average interest rate which was partially offset by a decrease in average borrowings. NET INCOME As a result of the above factors, net income increased to $97.3 million for Fiscal 2001 from $77.4 million for Fiscal 2000, an increase of $20.0 million, or 25.8%. 27 For financial analysis purposes only, the Companys earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") for Fiscal 2001 were $341.3 million, an increase of $41.5 million over EBITDA of $299.8 million for Fiscal 2000. EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income or net cash flow from operating activities and should not be construed as an indication of operating performance or as a measure of liquidity. FINANCIAL LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES GENERAL The Companys principal use of cash in its operating activities is for purchasing and carrying inventories. The Companys primary source of liquidity has historically been cash flow from operations, except during the annual fall grape harvests when the Company has relied on short term borrowings. The annual grape crush normally begins in August and runs through October. The Company generally begins purchasing grapes in August with payments for such grapes beginning to come due in September. The Companys short term borrowings to support such purchases generally reach their highest levels in November or December. Historically, the Company has used cash flow from operating activities to repay its short term borrowings. The Company will continue to use its short term borrowings to support its working capital requirements. The Company believes that cash provided by operating activities and its financing activities, primarily short term borrowings, will provide adequate resources to satisfy its working capital, liquidity and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for both its short term and long term capital needs. FISCAL 2002 CASH FLOWS OPERATING ACTIVITIES Net cash provided by operating activities for Fiscal 2002 was $213.3 million, which resulted from $226.3 million in net income adjusted for noncash items, less $13.0 million representing the net change in the Companys operating assets and liabilities. The net change in operating assets and liabilities resulted primarily from increases in accounts receivable and inventories partially offset by increases in accounts payable, deferred revenue, accrued salaries and commissions, and accrued advertising and promotions. INVESTING ACTIVITIES AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES Net cash used in investing activities for Fiscal 2002 was $585.4 million, which resulted from net cash paid of $472.8 million for the March Acquisitions and the Ravenswood acquisition, $77.3 million of equity contributions to PWP and $71.1 million of capital expenditures (including $10.1 million for vineyards), partially offset by $35.8 million of proceeds from the sale of assets. Net cash provided by financing activities for Fiscal 2002 was $236.9 million, which resulted primarily from proceeds of $252.5 million from the issuance of long term debt, including $250.0 million of 8 1/8% Senior Subordinated Notes used to repay $130.0 million of 8 3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes and $65.0 million of 8 3/4% Series C Senior Subordinated Notes and a portion of the Companys borrowings under its senior credit facility, net proceeds of $151.5 million from equity offerings, proceeds of $51.4 million from net revolving loan borrowings under the senior credit facility, and proceeds of $45.0 million from exercise of employee stock options. These amounts were partially offset by principal payments of long term debt of $261.0 million, which included the repayments as discussed above and $54.7 million of scheduled or required principal payments under the Companys senior credit facility. 28 During June 1998, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of its Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. The repurchase of shares of common stock will be accomplished, from time to time, in managements discretion and depending upon market conditions, through open market or privately negotiated transactions. The Company may finance such repurchases through cash generated from operations or through the senior credit facility. The repurchased shares will become treasury shares. As of May 15, 2002, the Company had purchased 4,075,344 shares of Class A Common Stock at an aggregate cost of $44.9 million, or at an average cost of $11.01 per share. No shares were repurchased during Fiscal 2002, Fiscal 2001 and Fiscal 2000. DEBT Total debt outstanding as of February 28, 2002, amounted to $1,429.6 million, an increase of $63.8 million from February 28, 2001. The ratio of total debt to total capitalization decreased to 59.9% as of February 28, 2002, from 68.9% as of February 28, 2001. SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY As of February 28, 2002, under the 2000 Credit Agreement (as defined below), the Company had outstanding term loans of $281.3 million bearing a weighted average interest rate of 3.9%, $50.0 million of outstanding revolving loans bearing a weighted average interest rate of 3.1%, undrawn letters of credit of $13.2 million, and $236.8 million in revolving loans available to be drawn. During June 1999, the Company financed the purchase price for the Franciscan Acquisition primarily through additional term loan borrowings under its previous senior credit facility. The Company financed the purchase price for the Simi Acquisition with revolving loan borrowings under the same senior credit facility. During August 1999, as discussed below, a portion of the Companys borrowings under that senior credit facility were repaid with the net proceeds of its Senior Notes (as defined below) offering. On October 6, 1999, the Company, certain of its principal operating subsidiaries, and a syndicate of banks (the "Syndicate Banks"), for which The Chase Manhattan Bank acts as administrative agent, entered into a senior credit facility (as subsequently amended, the "2000 Credit Agreement"). The 2000 Credit Agreement includes both U.S. dollar and British pound sterling commitments of the Syndicate Banks of up to, in the aggregate, the equivalent of $1.0 billion (subject to increase as therein provided to $1.2 billion). Proceeds of the 2000 Credit Agreement were used to repay all outstanding principal and accrued interest on all loans under the Companys prior senior credit facility, and are available to fund permitted acquisitions and ongoing working capital needs of the Company and its subsidiaries. The 2000 Credit Agreement provides for a $380.0 million Tranche I Term Loan facility due in December 2004, a $320.0 million Tranche II Term Loan facility available for borrowing in British pound sterling due in December 2004, and a $300.0 million Revolving Credit facility (including letters of credit up to a maximum of $20.0 million) which expires in December 2004. The Tranche I Term Loan facility ($380.0 million) and the Tranche II Term Loan facility ((pound) 193.4 million, or $320.0 million) were fully drawn at closing. During Fiscal 2001, the Company used proceeds from operating activities to prepay a portion of the $380.0 million Tranche I Term Loan facility. During Fiscal 2002, the Company used proceeds from the sale of 645,000 shares of the Companys Class A Common Stock (see Note 11) to pay an additional portion of the $380.0 million Tranche I Term Loan facility. After these repayments, the required quarterly repayments of the Tranche I Term Loan facility were revised to $17.4 million for each quarter in 2002, $19.6 million for each quarter in 2003, and $20.0 million for each quarter in 2004. On November 17, 1999, proceeds from the Sterling Senior Notes (as defined below) were used to repay a portion of the $320.0 million Tranche II Term Loan facility ((pound) 73.0 million, or $118.3 million). On May 15, 2000, proceeds from the Sterling Series C Senior Notes (as defined below) were used to repay an 29 additional portion of the $320.0 million Tranche II Term Loan facility ((pound) 78.8 million, or $118.2 million). After these repayments, the required quarterly repayments of the Tranche II Term Loan facility were revised to (pound) 0.4 million ($0.6 million) for each quarter in 2001 and 2002, (pound) 0.5 million ($0.7 million) for each quarter in 2003, and (pound) 8.5 million ($12.0 million) for each quarter in 2004 (the foregoing U.S. dollar equivalents are as of February 28, 2002). There are certain mandatory term loan prepayments, including those based on sale of assets and issuance of debt and equity, in each case subject to customary baskets, exceptions and thresholds. The rate of interest payable, at the Companys option, is a function of the London interbank offering rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin, federal funds rate plus a margin, or the prime rate plus a margin. The margin is adjustable based upon the Companys Debt Ratio (as defined in the 2000 Credit Agreement) and, with respect to LIBOR borrowings, ranges between 0.75% and 1.25% for Revolving Credit loans and 1.00% and 1.75% for Term Loans. As of February 28, 2002, the margin was 1.125% for Revolving Credit loans and 1.625% for Term Loans. In addition to interest, the Company pays a facility fee on the Revolving Credit commitments at 0.50% per annum as of February 28, 2002. This fee is based upon the Companys quarterly Debt Ratio and can range from 0.25% to 0.50%. Certain of the Companys principal operating subsidiaries have guaranteed the Companys obligations under the 2000 Credit Agreement. The 2000 Credit Agreement is secured by (i) first priority pledges of 100% of the capital stock of Canandaigua Limited and all of the Companys domestic operating subsidiaries and (ii) first priority pledges of 65% of the capital stock of Matthew Clark and certain other foreign subsidiaries. The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to customary lending covenants including those restricting additional liens, incurring additional indebtedness, the sale of assets, the payment of dividends, transactions with affiliates and the making of certain investments, in each case subject to customary baskets, exceptions and thresholds. The primary financial covenants require the maintenance of a debt coverage ratio, a senior debt coverage ratio, a fixed charges ratio and an interest coverage ratio. Among the most restrictive covenants contained in the 2000 Credit Agreement is the debt coverage ratio. On February 13, 2001, the 2000 Credit Agreement was amended to, among other things, permit the Company to finance the acquisition of the Turner Road Vintners Assets with revolving loan borrowings, permit the refinancing of the Original Notes (as defined below) and Series C Notes (as defined below) with senior notes, and adjust the senior debt coverage ratio covenant. SENIOR NOTES On August 4, 1999, the Company issued $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8 5/8% Senior Notes due August 2006 (the "August 1999 Senior Notes").

In February 2002, the Company redeemed the Original Notes and the Series C Notes with the proceeds from the January 2002 Senior Subordinated Notes (as defined below). In connection with this redemption, the Company incurred an extraordinary loss of $2.6 million ($1.6 million, net of income taxes) related to the write off of the remaining deferred financing costs and unamortized discount. 31 On March 4, 1999, the Company issued $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8 1/2% Senior Subordinated Notes due March 2009 ("Senior Subordinated Notes").

The January 2002 Senior Subordinated Notes are guaranteed, on a senior subordinated basis, by certain of the Companys significant operating subsidiaries. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The table below sets forth information about the Companys long term contractual obligations and other commercial commitments outstanding at February 28, 2002. It brings together data for easy reference from the consolidated balance sheet and from individual notes to the Companys consolidated financial statements. PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD Less than After Total 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years 5 years (in thousands) Contractual obligations Notes payable $ 54,775 $ 54,775 $ $ $ Long term debt (excluding unamortized discount) 1,357,015 77,929 209,390 200,000 869,696 Capital lease obligations 18,269 3,680 7,165 4,566 2,858 Operating leases 185,079 20,463 34,154 30,425 100,037 Unconditional purchase obligations 829,461 230,277 308,814 157,793 132,577 Total contractual cash obligations $ 2,444,599 $ 387,124 $ 559,523 $ 392,784 $ 1,105,168 32 AMOUNT OF COMMITMENT EXPIRATION PER PERIOD Less than After Total 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years 5 years (in thousands) Other contractual commitments Lines of credit $ 236,838 $ $ 236,838 $ $ Standby letters of credit 13,162 13,162 Total commercial commitments $ 250,000 $ $ 250,000 $ $ EQUITY OFFERINGS During March 2001, the Company completed a public offering of 8,740,000 shares of its Class A Common Stock, which was held as treasury stock. This resulted in net proceeds to the Company, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses, of $139.4 million. The net proceeds were used to repay revolving loan borrowings under the senior credit facility of which a portion was incurred to partially finance the acquisition of the Turner Road Vintners Assets. During October 2001, the Company sold 645,000 shares of its Class A Common Stock, which was held as treasury stock, in connection with a public offering of Class A Common Stock by stockholders of the Company. The net proceeds to the Company, after deducting underwriting discounts, of $12.1 million were used to repay borrowings under the senior credit facility. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES During Fiscal 2002, the Company incurred $71.1 million for capital expenditures, including $10.1 million related to vineyards. The Company plans to spend $69.0 million for capital expenditures, exclusive of vineyards, in fiscal 2003. In addition, the Company continues to consider the purchase, lease and development of vineyards and may incur additional expenditures for vineyards if opportunities become available. See "Business Sources and Availability of Raw Materials" under Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Management reviews the capital expenditure program periodically and modifies it as required to meet current business needs. RELATED PARTIES Agustin Francisco Huneeus, the executive in charge of the Fine Wine segment, along with other members of his immediate family, through various family owned entities (the "Huneeus Interests") engaged in certain transactions with the Fine Wine segment during each of the three years in the period ended February 28, 2002. The Huneeus Interests engage the Fine Wine segment as the exclusive distributor of its Quintessa wines under a long term contract; sell grapes to the Fine Wine segment pursuant to existing long term contracts; participate as partners with the Fine Wine segment in the ownership and operation of a winery and vineyards in Chile; and render brand management and other consulting and advisory services in the United States and internationally to the Fine Wine segment and the Company. Total payments to the Huneeus Interests pursuant to these transactions and arrangements totaled $4.8 million, $5.0 million, and $3.2 million for the years ended February 28, 2002, February 28, 2001, and February 29, 2000, respectively. In addition, the Fine Wine segment performs certain wine processing services for the Huneeus Interests. Total fees received from the Huneeus Interests to the Fine Wine segment for these services totaled $0.4 million, $0.6 million, and $0.6 million for the years ended February 28, 2002, February 28, 2001, and February 29, 2000, respectively. As of February 28, 2002 and 2001, the net amounts due to/from the Huneeus Interests under these agreements are insignificant. 33 EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES The Companys results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by inflation and changing prices, including rising energy and tequila costs. The Company has been able, subject to normal competitive conditions, to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices. There can be no assurances, however, that the Company will continue to be able to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Companys significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Companys consolidated financial statements located in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. However, certain of the Companys accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of the Companys financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by the Companys management; as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. In applying those policies, the Companys management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. Those estimates are based on the Companys historical experience, terms of existing contracts, the Companys observance of trends in the industry, information provided by the Companys customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. The Companys critical accounting policies include: Inventory valuation. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, cost being determined on the first in, first out method. Reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories are provided based on historical experience and current product demand. The Company evaluates the adequacy of these reserves quarterly. Accounting for acquisitions. Acquisition activities are an important element of the Companys business strategy. The Companys acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that may be incurred. The determination of the fair value of such intangible assets and other assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires the Companys management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the Companys consolidated financial statements. Impairment of long lived assets. The Companys long lived assets include goodwill, trademarks and other intangible assets. In assessing the recoverability of the Companys goodwill and other intangibles, the Company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets. On March 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142 (as defined below) and will be required to analyze its goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment issues during the first six months of fiscal 2003 and then on a periodic basis thereafter. The Company currently expects to complete the initial impairment review during the first quarter of fiscal 2003. The Company does not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial review. However, there can be no assurance that at the time the review is completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded. Any resulting impairment charge could have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. 34 ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS During 2000 and 2001, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") addressed various issues related to the income statement classification of certain promotional payments, including EITF Issue No. 00 14 ("EITF No. 00 14"), "Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives," EITF Issue No. 00 22 ("EITF No. 00 22"), "Accounting for Points and Certain Other Time Based or Volume Based Sales Incentive Offers, and Offers for Free Products or Services to Be Delivered in the Future," and EITF Issue No. 00 25 ("EITF No. 00 25"), "Vendor Income Statement Characterization of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendors Products." In November 2001, the EITF codified EITF No. 00 14, EITF No. 00 22, and EITF No. 00 25 as part of EITF Issue No. 01 09 ("EITF No. 01 09"), "Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendors Products)." EITF No. 01 09 addresses the recognition, measurement and income statement classification of consideration given by a vendor to a customer (including both a reseller of the vendors products and an entity that purchases the vendors products from a reseller). EITF No. 01 09, among other things, requires that certain consideration given by a vendor to a customer be characterized as a reduction of revenue when recognized in the vendors income statement. The Company currently reports such costs referred to in EITF No. 00 14 and EITF No. 00 25 as selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company is required to adopt EITF No. 01 09 in its financial statements beginning March 1, 2002. Upon adoption of EITF No. 01 09, financial statements for prior periods presented for comparative purposes will be reclassified to comply with the requirements of EITF No. 01 09. For the fiscal years ended February 28, 2002, February 28, 2001, and February 29, 2000, net sales will be reduced by $222.4 million, $176.2 million, and $182.5 million, respectively, cost of product sold will increase by $10.1 million, $7.8 million, and $8.8 million, respectively, and selling, general and administrative expenses will decrease by $232.5 million, $184.0 million, and $191.3 million, respectively. This reclassification will not effect operating income or net income. In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 ("SFAS No. 141"), "Business Combinations." SFAS No. 141 addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations requiring all business combinations to be accounted for using one method, the purchase method. In addition, SFAS No. 141 supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16, "Business Combinations." SFAS No. 141 is effective immediately for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001, as well as for all business combinations accounted for by the purchase method for which the date of acquisition is July 1, 2001, or later. The Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 141 for all business combinations for which the acquisition date was before July 1, 2001, for fiscal years beginning March 1, 2002. The adoption of the applicable provisions of SFAS No. 141 has not had a material impact on the Companys financial statements. The Company believes that the adoption of the remaining provisions of SFAS No. 141 will not have a material impact on its financial statements. On March 1, 2002, the Company reclassified $59.9 million of previously identified separable intangible assets into goodwill in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 141. In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board also issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 ("SFAS No. 142"), "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 142 addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 17, "Intangible Assets." Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed at least annually for impairment. Separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. The Company is required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 142 for all goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to July 1, 2001, for fiscal years beginning March 1, 2002. For goodwill and intangible assets acquired after June 30, 2001, these assets are subject immediately to the nonamortization and amortization provisions of SFAS No. 142. The Companys 35 assessment of the financial impact of SFAS No. 142 on its financial statements is that $27.3 million of amortization expense of existing goodwill and other intangible assets for the fiscal year ending February 28, 2002, will not be incurred in subsequent fiscal years. The required transition impairment evaluations are not expected to result in impairment charges. In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143 ("SFAS No. 143"), "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated retirement costs. The Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 143 for fiscal years beginning March 1, 2003. The Company is currently assessing the financial impact of SFAS No. 143 on its financial statements. In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 ("SFAS No. 144"), "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." SFAS No. 144 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets. SFAS No. 144 supersedes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," and the accounting and reporting provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, "Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions," for the disposal of a segment of a business (as previously defined in that Opinion). The Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 144 for fiscal years beginning March 1, 2002. The Company believes the financial impact of SFAS No. 144 will not be material on its financial statements. In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 145 ("SFAS No. 145"), "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections." SFAS No. 145 rescinds Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 4 ("SFAS No. 4"), "Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt," Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 44, "Accounting for Intangible Assets of Motor Carriers," and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 64, "Extinguishments of Debt Made to Satisfy Sinking Fund Requirements." In addition, SFAS No. 145 amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, "Accounting for Leases," to eliminate an inconsistency between required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions. Lastly, SFAS No. 145 also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections, clarify meanings, or describe their applicability under changed conditions. The Company is required to adopt the provisions related to the rescission of SFAS No. 4 for fiscal years beginning March 1, 2003. All other provisions of SFAS No. 145 are effective for fiscal years beginning March 1, 2002. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 145 to have a material impact on its financial statements. However, it will result in a reclassification of the previously reported extraordinary item, net of income taxes, to increase nonoperating expense ($2.6 million) and to decrease the provision for income taxes ($1.0 million). EURO CONVERSION ISSUES Effective January 1, 1999, eleven of the fifteen member countries of the European Union (the "Participating Countries") established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro. Effective January 1, 2002, the euro became the sole currency of the Participating Countries. The Company does not believe that the effects of the conversion will have a material adverse effect on the Companys business and operations. 36 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company is exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. To manage the volatility relating to these risks, the Company periodically enters into derivative transactions including foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements. The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and does not use them for trading purposes. The Company uses derivative instruments solely to reduce the financial impact of these risks. The fair value of long term debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair value of long term debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The estimated fair value of the Companys total long term debt, including current maturities, was $1,407.4 million at February 28, 2002. A hypothetical 1% increase from prevailing interest rates at February 28, 2002, would result in a decrease in fair value of fixed interest rate long term debt by $57.6 million. Also, a hypothetical 1% increase from prevailing interest rates at February 28, 2002, would result in an approximate increase in cash required for interest on variable interest rate debt during the next five fiscal years as follows: 2003 $2.5 million 2004 $1.7 million 2005 $0.7 million 2006 $ 2007 $ The Company has on occasion entered into interest rate swap agreements to reduce its exposure to interest rate changes relative to its long term debt. At February 28, 2002, the Company had no interest rate swap agreements outstanding. The Company has exposure to foreign currency risk as a result of having international subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Canada. For the Companys operations in the United Kingdom, the Company uses local currency borrowings to hedge its earnings and cash flow exposure to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At February 28, 2002, management believes that a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would not result in a material adverse impact on either earnings or cash flow. The Company also has exposure to foreign currency risk as a result of contracts to purchase inventory items that are denominated in various foreign currencies. In order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting from these contracts, the Company periodically enters into foreign exchange hedging agreements. At February 28, 2002, the potential loss on outstanding foreign exchange hedging agreements from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would not be material. 37
