ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION The Company is a leading international producer and marketer of beverage alcohol in North America, Europe and Australia with a broad portfolio of brands across the wine, imported beer and distilled spirits categories. The Company is the largest wine company in the world and the largest multi category supplier of beverage alcohol brands in the United States. In the United Kingdom, the Company is the largest marketer of wine, the second largest producer and marketer of cider and a leading independent drinks wholesaler. The Company is the leading producer of wine in Australia and the second largest producer of wine in New Zealand. Through February 28, 2003, the Company reported its operating results in five segments: Popular and Premium Wine (branded popular and premium wine and brandy, and other, primarily grape juice concentrate and bulk wine); Imported Beer and Spirits (primarily imported beer and distilled spirits); U.K. Brands and Wholesale (branded wine, cider, and bottled water, and wholesale wine, distilled spirits, cider, beer, RTDs and soft drinks); Fine Wine (primarily branded super premium and ultra premium wine); and Corporate Operations and Other (primarily corporate related items). As a result of the Hardy Acquisition (as defined below), the Company has changed the structure of its internal organization to consist of two business divisions, Constellation Wines and Constellation Beers and Spirits. Separate division chief executives report directly to the Companys chief operating officer. As a result of such changes, beginning with the first quarter of Fiscal 2004, the Company will report its operating results in three segments: Constellation Wines (branded wine, and U.K. wholesale and other), Constellation Beers and Spirits (imported beer and distilled spirits) and Corporate Operations and Other. The new business segments reflect how the Companys operations are now being managed, how operating performance within the Company is now being evaluated by senior management and the availability and structure of internal financial reporting. The following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting (i) consolidated results of operations of the Company for the year ended February 28, 2003 ("Fiscal 2003"), compared to the year ended February 28, 2002 ("Fiscal 2002"), and Fiscal 2002 compared to the year ended February 28, 2001 ("Fiscal 2001"), and (ii) financial liquidity and capital resources for Fiscal 2003. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included herein. 16 As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142 on March 1, 2002. Upon the adoption of SFAS No. 142, the Company ceased amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. Retroactive application of SFAS No. 142 is not permitted. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company adopted EITF No. 01 09 on March 1, 2002. EITF No. 01 09 requires that certain consideration given by a vendor to a customer be characterized as a reduction of revenue. The Company previously reported such costs as selling, general and administrative expenses. As a result of adopting EITF No. 01 09, the Company has restated net sales, cost of product sold, and selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended February 28, 2002, and February 28, 2001. This reclassification did not affect operating income or net income. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS ACQUISITION OF HARDY On March 27, 2003, the Company acquired control of BRL Hardy Limited, now known as Hardy Wine Company Limited ("Hardy"), and on April 9, 2003, the Company completed its acquisition of all of Hardys outstanding capital stock (the "Hardy Acquisition"). Hardy is Australias largest wine producer with interests in wineries and vineyards in most of Australias major wine regions as well as New Zealand, France and the United States. In addition, Hardy has significant marketing and sales operations in the United Kingdom. This acquisition supports the Companys strategy of driving long term growth and positions the Company to capitalize on the growth opportunities in "new world" wine markets. Hardy has a comprehensive portfolio of wine products across all price points with a strong focus on premium wine production. Hardys wines are distributed worldwide through a network of marketing and sales operations, with the majority of sales generated in Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States. Total consideration paid in cash and Class A Common Stock to the Hardy shareholders was $1,137.4 million. Additionally, the Company expects to incur direct acquisition costs of $20.0 million. The acquisition date for accounting purposes is March 27, 2003. The Company expects to record an approximate $2 million reduction in the purchase price to reflect imputed interest between the accounting acquisition date and the final payment of consideration. The cash portion of the purchase price ($1,060.2 million) was financed with $660.2 million of borrowings under the Companys 2003 Credit Agreement (as defined below) and $400.0 million of borrowings under the Companys Bridge Agreement (as defined below). Additionally, the Company issued 3,288,913 shares of the Companys Class A Common Stock, which were valued at $77.2 million based on the simple average of the closing market price of the Companys Class A Common Stock beginning two days before and ending two days after April 4, 2003, the day the Hardy shareholders elected the form of consideration they wished to receive. As a result of the Hardy Acquisition, the Company also acquired the remaining 50% ownership of PWP (as defined below), the joint venture the Company established with Hardy in July 2001. The results of operations of the Hardy business will be reported in the Companys new Constellation Wines segment as of March 27, 2003. The Hardy Acquisition is significant and the Company expects it to have a material impact on the Companys future results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 17 ACQUISITIONS IN FISCAL 2003, FISCAL 2002 AND FISCAL 2001 AND JOINT VENTURE ACQUISITION OF RAVENSWOOD WINERY On July 2, 2001, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Ravenswood Winery, Inc. (the "Ravenswood Acquisition"), a leading premium wine producer based in Sonoma, California. On June 30, 2002, Ravenswood Winery, Inc. was merged into Franciscan Vineyards, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company). The Ravenswood business produces, markets and sells super premium and ultra premium California wine, primarily under the Ravenswood brand name. The vast majority of the wine the Ravenswood business produces and sells is red wine, including the number one super premium Zinfandel in the United States. The results of operations of the Ravenswood business are reported in the Fine Wine segment for Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002 and have been included in the consolidated results of operations of the Company since the date of acquisition. Beginning in Fiscal 2004, the results of operations of the Ravenswood business will be reported in the Companys new Constellation Wines segment. ACQUISITION OF THE CORUS ASSETS On March 26, 2001, in an asset acquisition, the Company acquired certain wine brands, wineries, working capital (primarily inventories), and other related assets from Corus Brands, Inc. (the "Corus Assets"). In this acquisition, the Company acquired several well known premium wine brands primarily sold in the northwestern United States, including Covey Run, Columbia, Ste. Chapelle and Alice White. In connection with the transaction, the Company also entered into long term grape supply agreements with affiliates of Corus Brands, Inc. covering more than 1,000 acres of Washington and Idaho vineyards. The results of operations of the Corus Assets are reported in the Popular and Premium Wine segment for Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002 and have been included in the consolidated results of operations of the Company since the date of acquisition. Beginning in Fiscal 2004, the results of operations of the Corus Assets will be reported in the Companys new Constellation Wines segment. ACQUISITION OF THE TURNER ROAD VINTNERS ASSETS On March 5, 2001, in an asset acquisition, the Company acquired several well known premium wine brands, including Vendange, Nathanson Creek, Heritage, and Talus, working capital (primarily inventories), two wineries in California, and other related assets from Sebastiani Vineyards, Inc. and Tuolomne River Vintners Group (the "Turner Road Vintners Assets"). The results of operations of the Turner Road Vintners Assets are reported in the Popular and Premium Wine segment for Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002 and have been included in the consolidated results of operations of the Company since the date of acquisition. Beginning in Fiscal 2004, the results of operations of the Turner Road Vintners Assets will be reported in the Companys new Constellation Wines segment. ACQUISITION OF FORTH WINES On October 27, 2000, the Company acquired all of the issued Ordinary Shares and Preference Shares of Forth Wines Limited ("Forth Wines"). The results of operations of Forth Wines are reported in the U.K. Brands and Wholesale segment for Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002 and have been included in the consolidated results of operations of the Company since the date of acquisition. Beginning in Fiscal 2004, the results of operations of Forth Wines will be reported in the Companys new Constellation Wines segment. 18 PACIFIC WINE PARTNERS Pacific Wine Partners LLC ("PWP") produces, markets and sells a global portfolio of premium wine in the United States, including a range of Australian imports. As a result of the Hardy Acquisition, PWP became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Accordingly, its results of operations will be consolidated and reported in the Companys new Constellation Wines segment. On July 31, 2001, the Company and Hardy completed the formation of PWP, a joint venture owned equally by the Company and Hardy. In connection with the initial formation of the joint venture, PWP was given the exclusive distribution rights in the United States and the Caribbean to seven brands Banrock Station, Hardys, Leasingham, Barossa Valley Estate and Chateau Reynella from Australia; Nobilo from New Zealand; and La Baume from France. The joint venture also owns Farallon, a premium California coastal wine. In addition, PWP owns a winery and controls 1,400 acres of vineyards, all located in Monterey County, California. On October 16, 2001, the Company announced that PWP completed the purchase of certain assets of Blackstone Winery, including the Blackstone brand and the Codera wine business in Sonoma County. The investment in PWP is accounted for using the equity method; accordingly, the results of operations of PWP since July 31, 2001, have been included in the equity in earnings of joint venture line in the Consolidated Statements of Income of the Company. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FISCAL 2003 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2002 NET SALES The following table sets forth the net sales (in thousands of dollars) by operating segment of the Company for Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002 Net Sales %Increase 2003 2002 (Decrease) Popular and Premium Wine: Branded: External customers $ 684,094 $ 696,901 (1.8)% Intersegment 8,570 9,669 (11.4)% Total Branded 692,664 706,570 (2.0)% Other: External customers 45,223 57,718 (21.6)% Intersegment 11,537 13,751 (16.1)% Total Other 56,760 71,469 (20.6)% Popular and Premium Wine net sales $ 749,424 $ 778,039 (3.7)% Imported Beer and Spirits: Beer $ 776,006 $ 726,953 6.7 % Spirits 282,307 274,702 2.8 % Imported Beer and Spirits net sales $ 1,058,313 $ 1,001,655 5.7 % 19 Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002 Net Sales %Increase 2003 2002 (Decrease) U.K. Brands and Wholesale: Branded: External customers $ 229,283 $ 223,791 2.5 % Intersegment 189 574 (67.1)% Total Branded 229,472 224,365 2.3 % Wholesale 560,346 495,532 13.1 % U.K. Brands and Wholesale net sales $ 789,818 $ 719,897 9.7 % Fine Wine: External customers $ 154,353 $ 131,161 17.7 % Intersegment 1,405 753 86.6 % Fine Wine net sales $ 155,758 $ 131,914 18.1 % Corporate Operations and Other $ $ N/A Intersegment eliminations $ (21,701) $ (24,747) (12.3)% Consolidated Net Sales $ 2,731,612 $ 2,606,758 4.8 % Net sales for Fiscal 2003 increased to $2,731.6 million from $2,606.8 million for Fiscal 2002, an increase of $124.9 million, or 4.8%. This increase resulted primarily from increased sales of imported beer and impact of foreign currency changes of $50.7 million in the U.K. Brands and Wholesale segment. Also contributing to the sales growth were increased sales in U.K. wholesale (on a local currency basis), fine wine and spirits, offset by lower bulk wine, grape juice concentrate, Popular and Premium branded wine and U.K. branded sales (on a local currency basis). POPULAR AND PREMIUM WINE Net sales for the Popular and Premium Wine segment for Fiscal 2003 decreased to $749.4 million from $778.0 million for Fiscal 2002, a decrease of $28.6 million, or (3.7)%. Other sales declined $14.7 million, or (20.6)%, on lower bulk wine and grape juice concentrate sales. Branded sales declined $13.9 million, or (2.0)%, on lower volume offset slightly by higher average selling prices. Volumes were negatively impacted as a result of increased promotional spending in the industry, which the Company did not participate in heavily. In this competitive pricing environment, the Company continues to be selective in its promotional activities, focusing instead on growth areas, long term brand building initiatives and increased profitability. IMPORTED BEER AND SPIRITS Net sales for the Imported Beer and Spirits segment for Fiscal 2003 increased to $1,058.3 million from $1,001.7 million for Fiscal 2002, an increase of $56.7 million, or 5.7%. This increase resulted primarily from a $49.1 million increase in imported beer sales. The growth in imported beer sales was due to a price increase on the Companys Mexican beer portfolio, which took effect in the first quarter of Fiscal 2003. Spirits sales increased $7.6 million due primarily to increased bulk whiskey sales, along with a slight increase in branded sales. U.K. BRANDS AND WHOLESALE Net sales for the U.K. Brands and Wholesale segment for Fiscal 2003 increased to $789.8 million from $719.9 million for Fiscal 2002, an increase of $69.9 million, or 9.7%. This increase resulted from the impact of foreign currency changes of $50.7 million and a $28.6 million local currency increase in 20 wholesale sales due to the addition of new accounts and increased average delivery sizes, partially offset by a $9.4 million local currency decline in branded sales as a decrease in cider sales was partially offset by increases in wine sales. FINE WINE Net sales for the Fine Wine segment for Fiscal 2003 increased to $155.8 million from $131.9 million for Fiscal 2002, an increase of $23.8 million, or 18.1%. This increase resulted from an additional four months of sales of the brands acquired in the Ravenswood Acquisition, completed in July 2001, of $14.1 million, as well as growth in the Ravenswood, Simi, Estancia and Franciscan brands. The growth was due to higher sales volumes led by Ravenswood and Simi, partially offset by higher promotional costs and a shift towards lower priced brands. GROSS PROFIT The Companys gross profit increased to $760.7 million for Fiscal 2003 from $695.2 million for Fiscal 2002, an increase of $65.6 million, or 9.4%. The dollar increase in gross profit resulted from higher imported beer sales, the additional four months of sales of the brands acquired in the Ravenswood Acquisition (completed in July 2001), a favorable mix of sales towards higher margin products, particularly popular and premium wine and tequila, lower average wine and spirits costs, and a favorable foreign currency impact. These increases were partially offset by higher average imported beer costs and lower concentrate and bulk wine sales. As a result of the foregoing, gross profit as a percent of net sales increased to 27.8% for Fiscal 2003 from 26.7% for Fiscal 2002. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $351.0 million for Fiscal 2003 from $352.7 million for Fiscal 2002, a decrease of $1.7 million, or (0.5)%. The Company adopted SFAS No. 142 on March 1, 2002, and, accordingly, stopped amortizing goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets. Therefore, the decrease of $1.7 million consists of a decrease of $27.3 million of amortization expense from Fiscal 2002 offset by an increase of $25.6 million. The increase resulted primarily from increased personnel costs to support the Companys growth, higher selling costs to support the growth in the U.K. wholesale business, and increased advertising costs on certain popular and premium wine brands and imported beer brands. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales decreased to 12.8% for Fiscal 2003 as compared to 13.5% for Fiscal 2002. This decrease was due to the reduced amortization expense noted above partially offset by (i) the percent increase in general and administrative expenses growing at a faster rate than the percent change in the Corporate Operations and Other, Popular and Premium Wine and U.K. Brands and Wholesale segments net sales, and (ii) the percent increase in the U.K. Brands and Wholesale segments selling costs being greater than the percent increase in U.K. Brands and Wholesale segments net sales. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES The Companys Popular and Premium Wine segment recorded a property, plant and equipment impairment of $4.8 million in Fiscal 2003 in connection with the planned closure of two of its production facilities in Fiscal 2004. The Company has begun the realignment of its business operations within the Popular and Premium Wine segment to further improve productivity. This realignment is not expected to have an impact on brand sales. As part of this realignment, the Company expects to incur an additional $6.7 million in charges, primarily in cash, during Fiscal 2004 within the Constellation Wine segment. No such charges were incurred in Fiscal 2002. 21 In connection with the Hardy Acquisition, the Company expects to record a restructuring charge related to the integration of Hardy in the amount of $3.2 million in Fiscal 2004. In addition, the Company expects to record a one time charge in the amount of $8.2 million in Fiscal 2004 for the write off of bank fees related to the repayment of the Companys senior credit facility. OPERATING INCOME The following table sets forth the operating income (loss) (in thousands of dollars) by operating segment of the Company for Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002 Operating Income (Loss) 2003 2002 %Increase Popular and Premium Wine $ 107,715 $ 104,781 2.8% Imported Beer and Spirits 217,963 178,805 21.9% U.K. Brands and Wholesale 56,577 47,270 19.7% Fine Wine 55,515 39,169 41.7% Corporate Operations and Other (32,812) (27,544) 19.1% Consolidated Operating Income $ 404,958 $ 342,481 18.2% As a result of the above factors, operating income increased to $405.0 million for Fiscal 2003 from $342.5 million for Fiscal 2002, an increase of $62.5 million, or 18.2%. Fiscal 2002 operating income for Popular and Premium Wine, Imported Beer and Spirits, U.K. Brands and Wholesale and Fine Wine included amortization expense of $8.9 million, $8.2 million, $5.9 million, and $4.3 million, respectively. GAIN ON CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS In February 2003, the Company entered into a foreign currency collar contract in connection with the Hardy Acquisition to lock in a range for the cost of the acquisition in U.S. dollars. As of February 28, 2003, this derivative instrument had a fair value of $23.1 million. Under SFAS No. 133, a transaction that involves a business combination is not eligible for hedge accounting treatment. As such, the derivative was recorded on the balance sheet at its fair value with the change in the fair value recognized separately on the Companys Consolidated Statement of Income. In the first quarter of Fiscal 2004, the Company will record an additional gain of $4.1 million related to the settlement of the foreign currency derivative instruments entered into in conjunction with the Hardy Acquisition. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET Net interest expense decreased to $105.4 million for Fiscal 2003 from $114.2 million for Fiscal 2002, a decrease of $8.8 million, or (7.7)%. The decrease resulted from both a decrease in the average borrowings for the year and a decrease in the average interest rate. PROVISIONS FOR INCOME TAXES The Companys effective tax rate for Fiscal 2003 was 39.3% as compared to 40.0% for Fiscal 2002 as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 142 on March 1, 2002. 22 NET INCOME As a result of the above factors, net income increased to $203.3 million for Fiscal 2003 from $136.4 million for Fiscal 2002, an increase of $66.9 million, or 49.0%. FISCAL 2002 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2001 NET SALES The following table sets forth the net sales (in thousands of dollars) by operating segment of the Company for Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001. Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001 Net Sales %Increase 2002 2001 (Decrease) Popular and Premium Wine: Branded: External customers $ 696,901 $ 546,211 27.6 % Intersegment 9,669 6,451 49.9 % Total Branded 706,570 552,662 27.8 % Other: External customers 57,718 64,799 (10.9)% Intersegment 13,751 16,562 (17.0)% Total Other 71,469 81,361 (12.2)% Popular and Premium Wine net sales $ 778,039 $ 634,023 22.7 % Imported Beer and Spirits: Beer $ 726,953 $ 633,833 14.7 % Spirits 274,702 262,933 4.5 % Imported Beer and Spirits net sales $ 1,001,655 $ 896,766 11.7 % U.K. Brands and Wholesale: Branded: External customers $ 223,791 $ 225,550 (0.8)% Intersegment 574 1,193 (51.9)% Total Branded 224,365 226,743 (1.0)% Wholesale 495,532 404,208 22.6 % U.K. Brands and Wholesale net sales $ 719,897 $ 630,951 14.1 % Fine Wine: External customers $ 131,161 $ 88,486 48.2 % Intersegment 753 217 247.0 % Fine Wine net sales $ 131,914 $ 88,703 48.7 % Corporate Operations and Other $ $ N/A Intersegment eliminations $ (24,747) $ (24,423) 1.3 % Consolidated Net Sales $ 2,606,758 $ 2,226,020 17.1 % Net sales for Fiscal 2002 increased to $2,606.8 million from $2,226.0 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of $380.7 million, or 17.1%. POPULAR AND PREMIUM WINE Net sales for the Popular and Premium Wine segment for Fiscal 2002 increased to $778.0 million from $634.0 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of $144.0 million, or 22.7%. This increase resulted primarily from $158.5 million of sales of the newly acquired brands from the Turner Road Vintners 23 Assets and Corus Assets acquisitions (the "March Acquisitions"), both completed in March 2001. This increase was partially offset by declines in the Popular and Premium Wine segments grape juice concentrate business and certain other wine brands. IMPORTED BEER AND SPIRITS Net sales for the Imported Beer and Spirits segment for Fiscal 2002 increased to $1,001.7 million from $896.8 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of $104.9 million, or 11.7%. This increase resulted primarily from a 14.7% increase in imported beer sales, led by volume growth in the Mexican beer portfolio. Spirits sales increased slightly primarily from an increase in bulk whiskey sales, partially offset by slightly lower branded spirits sales as a result of lower net selling prices from the implementation of a net pricing strategy in the third quarter of Fiscal 2001, which also resulted in lower promotion costs. U.K. BRANDS AND WHOLESALE Net sales for the U.K. Brands and Wholesale segment for Fiscal 2002 increased to $719.9 million from $631.0 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of $88.9 million, or 14.1%. This increase resulted from a 27.1% local currency basis increase in wholesale sales, with the majority of this growth coming from organic sales, and a 7.4% local currency basis increase in branded sales, with an increase in wine sales being partially offset by a decrease in cider sales, partially offset by a 22.9% adverse foreign currency impact. FINE WINE Net sales for the Fine Wine segment for Fiscal 2002 increased to $131.9 million from $88.7 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of $43.2 million, or 48.7%. This increase resulted primarily from $30.4 million of net sales of the newly acquired brands from the Ravenswood Acquisition and organic sales growth primarily due to volume increases in the Estancia, Veramonte, and Franciscan brands. GROSS PROFIT The Companys gross profit increased to $695.2 million for Fiscal 2002 from $578.9 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of $116.2 million, or 20.1%. The dollar increase in gross profit resulted primarily from sales of the newly acquired brands from the March Acquisitions and the Ravenswood Acquisition, volume growth in the Imported Beer and Spirits segments Mexican beer portfolio, volume growth in the Fine Wine segments portfolio, and volume growth in the U.K. Brands and Wholesale segments wholesale business and branded business. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the Imported Beer and Spirits segments spirits sales and an adverse foreign currency impact. As a percent of net sales, gross profit increased to 26.7% for Fiscal 2002 from 26.0% for Fiscal 2001, resulting primarily from sales of higher margin wine brands acquired in the March Acquisitions and the Ravenswood Acquisition. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $352.7 million for Fiscal 2002 from $308.1 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of $44.6 million, or 14.5%. The dollar increase in selling, general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from an increase in advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses associated with the brands acquired in the March Acquisitions and the Ravenswood Acquisition. In addition, there were increases in selling, general and administrative expenses associated with the Imported Beer and Spirits segments Mexican beer portfolio volume growth, 24 and the U.K. Brands and Wholesale segments wholesale volume growth, and increased personnel costs to support the Companys growth within the Corporate Operations and Other segment. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales decreased slightly to 13.5% for Fiscal 2002 as compared to 13.8% for Fiscal 2001 due to higher sales growth from the March Acquisitions and the Ravenswood Acquisition than the related selling, general and administrative expense growth. OPERATING INCOME The following table sets forth the operating income (loss) (in thousands of dollars) by operating segment of the Company for Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001. Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001 Operating Income (Loss) %Increase 2002 2001 (Decrease) Popular and Premium Wine $ 104,781 $ 50,390 107.9 % Imported Beer and Spirits 178,805 167,680 6.6 % U.K. Brands and Wholesale 47,270 48,961 (3.5)% Fine Wine 39,169 24,495 59.9 % Corporate Operations and Other (27,544) (20,658) 33.3 % Consolidated Operating Income $ 342,481 $ 270,868 26.4 % As a result of the above factors, operating income increased to $342.5 million for Fiscal 2002 from $270.9 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of $71.6 million, or 26.4%. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET Net interest expense increased to $114.2 million for Fiscal 2002 from $108.6 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of $5.6 million, or 5.1%. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in the average borrowings primarily due to the financing of the March Acquisitions and the Ravenswood Acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in the average interest rate. NET INCOME As a result of the above factors, net income increased to $136.4 million for Fiscal 2002 from $97.3 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of $39.1 million, or 40.1%. FINANCIAL LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES GENERAL The Companys principal use of cash in its operating activities is for purchasing and carrying inventories. The Companys primary source of liquidity has historically been cash flow from operations, except during the annual fall grape harvests when the Company has relied on short term borrowings. In the United States, the annual grape crush normally begins in August and runs through October. In Australia, the annual grape crush normally begins in March and runs through May. The Company generally begins purchasing grapes at the beginning of the crush season with payments for such grapes beginning to come due one month later. The Companys short term borrowings to support such purchases generally reach their highest levels one to two months after the crush season has ended. Historically, the Company has used cash flow from operating activities to repay its short term 25 borrowings. The Company will continue to use its short term borrowings to support its working capital requirements. The Company believes that cash provided by operating activities and its financing activities, primarily short term borrowings, will provide adequate resources to satisfy its working capital, liquidity and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for both its short term and long term capital needs. FISCAL 2003 CASH FLOWS OPERATING ACTIVITIES Net cash provided by operating activities for Fiscal 2003 was $236.1 million, which resulted from $256.5 million in net income adjusted for noncash items, less $20.4 million representing the net change in the Companys operating assets and liabilities. The net change in operating assets and liabilities resulted primarily from an increase in inventories and a reduction in accrued excise taxes and adverse grape contracts partially offset by increases in accrued income taxes payable and accrued advertising and promotion expenses. INVESTING ACTIVITIES Net cash used in investing activities for Fiscal 2003 was $72.0 million, which resulted primarily from $71.6 million of capital expenditures (including $7.0 million for vineyards). FINANCING ACTIVITIES Net cash used in financing activities for Fiscal 2003 was $161.5 million resulting primarily from $151.1 million of principal payments of long term debt and $51.9 million of net repayments of notes payable. These debt payments were partially funded by $28.7 million of proceeds from employee stock option exercises and $10.0 million of proceeds from long term debt which was used for the repayment of debt at one of the Companys Chilean subsidiaries. FISCAL 2002 CASH FLOWS OPERATING ACTIVITIES Net cash provided by operating activities for Fiscal 2002 was $213.3 million, which resulted from $226.3 million in net income adjusted for noncash items, less $13.0 million representing the net change in the Companys operating assets and liabilities. The net change in operating assets and liabilities resulted primarily from increases in accounts receivable and inventories partially offset by increases in accounts payable, deferred revenue, accrued salaries and commissions, and accrued advertising and promotions. INVESTING ACTIVITIES Net cash used in investing activities for Fiscal 2002 was $585.4 million, which resulted from net cash paid of $472.8 million for the March Acquisitions and the Ravenswood Acquisition, $77.3 million of equity contributions to PWP and $71.1 million of capital expenditures (including $10.1 million for vineyards), partially offset by $35.8 million of proceeds from the sale of assets. 26 FINANCING ACTIVITIES Net cash provided by financing activities for Fiscal 2002 was $236.9 million, which resulted primarily from proceeds of $252.5 million from the issuance of long term debt, including $250 million of 8 1/8% Senior Subordinated Notes used to repay $130.0 million of 8 3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes and $65.0 million of 8 3/4% Series C Senior Subordinated Notes and a portion of the Companys borrowings under its senior credit facility, net proceeds of $151.5 million from equity offerings, proceeds of $51.4 million from net revolving loan borrowings under the senior credit facility, and proceeds of $45.0 million from exercise of employee stock options. These amounts were partially offset by principal payments of long term debt of $261.0 million, which included the repayments as discussed above and $54.7 million of scheduled or required principal payments under the Companys senior credit facility. During June 1998, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of its Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. The repurchase of shares of common stock will be accomplished, from time to time, in managements discretion and depending upon market conditions, through open market or privately negotiated transactions. The Company may finance such repurchases through cash generated from operations or through the senior credit facility. The repurchased shares will become treasury shares. As of May 12, 2003, the Company had purchased 4,075,344 shares of Class A Common Stock at an aggregate cost of $44.9 million, or at an average cost of $11.01 per share. No shares were repurchased during Fiscal 2003, Fiscal 2002 or Fiscal 2001. DEBT Total debt outstanding as of February 28, 2003, amounted to $1,265.5 million, a decrease of $164.0 million from February 28, 2002. The ratio of total debt to total capitalization decreased to 51.9% as of February 28, 2003, from 59.9% as of February 28, 2002. SENIOR CREDIT FACILITIES 2000 Credit Agreement As of February 28, 2003, under the 2000 Credit Agreement (as defined below), the Company had outstanding term loans of $145.4 million bearing a weighted average interest rate of 3.1%, $2.0 million of outstanding revolving loans bearing a weighted average interest rate of 3.1%, undrawn letters of credit of $15.1 million, and $282.9 million available to be drawn under the Revolving Credit facility. The 2000 Credit Agreement was a senior credit facility originally entered into between the Company, certain of its principal operating subsidiaries and a syndicate of banks, for which The Chase Manhattan Bank acted as administrative agent, on October 6, 1999, and subsequently amended (the "2000 Credit Agreement"). 2003 Credit Agreement In connection with the Hardy Acquisition, on January 16, 2003, the Company, the U.S. subsidiaries of the Company (excluding certain inactive subsidiaries) and Canandaigua Limited ("Guarantors"), JPMorgan Chase Bank, as a lender and administrative agent (the "Administrative Agent"), and certain other lenders (such other lenders, together with the Administrative Agent, are collectively referred to herein as the "Lenders") entered into a new credit agreement, which was subsequently amended and restated on March 19, 2003 (the "2003 Credit Agreement"). The 2003 Credit Agreement provides for aggregate credit facilities of $1.6 billion consisting of a $400.0 million Tranche A Term Loan facility due in February 2008, an $800.0 million Tranche B Term Loan facility due in November 2008 and a $400.0 million Revolving Credit facility (including an Australian Dollar revolving 27 sub facility of up to A$10.0 million and a sub facility for letters of credit of up to $40.0 million) which expires on the fifth anniversary of the first date on which the Lenders obligation to make loans under the 2003 Credit Agreement commences. The required annual repayments of the Tranche A Term Loan facility is $40.0 million in Fiscal 2004 and increases by $20.0 million each year through fiscal 2008. The required annual repayments of the Tranche B Term Loan, which is backend loaded, is $10.0 million in Fiscal 2004 and increases to $400.0 million in fiscal 2009. The rate of interest payable, at the Companys option, is a function of LIBOR plus a margin, the federal funds rate plus a margin, or the prime rate plus a margin. The margin is adjustable based upon the Companys Debt Ratio (as defined in the 2003 Credit Agreement) and, with respect to LIBOR borrowings, ranges between 1.75% and 2.75%. The initial LIBOR margin for the Revolving Credit facility and the Tranche A Term Loan facility is 2.25%, while the initial LIBOR margin on the Tranche B Term Loan facility is 2.75%. The Companys obligations are guaranteed by the Guarantors and the Company has pledged collateral of (i) 100% of the capital stock of all of the Companys U.S. subsidiaries and (ii) 65% of the voting capital stock of Canandaigua Limited, Matthew Clark plc, Hardy, Constellation Australia Pty Limited and certain other foreign subsidiaries of the Company. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Company and the Guarantors are required to pledge certain of their assets consisting of, among other things, inventory, accounts receivable and trademarks to secure the obligations under the 2003 Credit Agreement. The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to customary lending covenants including those restricting additional liens, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the sale of assets, the payment of dividends, transactions with affiliates and the making of certain investments, in each case subject to baskets, exceptions and thresholds. The primary financial covenants require the maintenance of a debt coverage ratio, a senior debt coverage ratio, a fixed charges ratio and an interest coverage ratio. The Company used the proceeds of the Tranche A Term Loan facility, the Tranche B Term Loan facility and a portion of the Revolving Credit facility under the 2003 Credit Agreement to payoff its obligations under the 2000 Credit Agreement, to fund a portion of the cash required to pay the Hardy shareholders and to pay indebtedness outstanding under certain of Hardys credit facilities. The Company intends to use the remaining availability under the 2003 Credit Agreement to fund its working capital needs on an ongoing basis. Bridge Agreement On January 16, 2003, the Company, the Guarantors, JPMorgan Chase Bank, as a lender and Administrative Agent, and certain other lenders (such other lenders, together with the Administrative Agent, are collectively referred to herein as the "Bridge Lenders") entered into a bridge loan agreement which was amended and restated as of March 26, 2003, containing commitments of the Bridge Lenders to make bridge loans (the "Bridge Loans") of up to, in the aggregate, $450.0 million (the "Bridge Agreement"). On April 9, 2003, the Company used $400.0 million of the Bridge Loans to fund a portion of the cash required to pay the former Hardy shareholders. The Bridge Loans are due on the first anniversary of the date of the funding of the Bridge Loans ("Bridge Loan Maturity Date"). The rate of interest payable on the Bridge Loans is equal to LIBOR plus a margin. The initial margin on the Bridge Loans is 3.75%. 28 If the Bridge Loans are not repaid on the Bridge Loan Maturity Date, the Bridge Lenders have committed to make certain term loans in an amount corresponding to the then outstanding amount of the Bridge Loans ("Term Loans"). The Term Loans are due on the seventh anniversary of the date on which the Bridge Loans are funded ("Term Loan Maturity Date"). The rate of interest payable on the Term Loans is equal to LIBOR plus a margin. If the Term Loans are not repaid on the date that is three months after the Bridge Loan Maturity Date, then the margin will increase on a quarterly basis thereafter until the Term Loans are refinanced, exchanged or otherwise repaid in full. The rate of interest payable on any of the Bridge Loans or the Term Loans is capped at 11.50% ("Rate Cap"). The Lenders have the right to exchange on or after the Bridge Loan Maturity Date all or a portion of their respective Bridge Loans or Term Loans for notes ("Exchange Notes") that will be issued pursuant to an indenture to be entered into among the Company, as issuer, certain subsidiaries of the Company, as guarantors, and an indenture trustee on behalf of the holders of the Exchange Notes. The Exchange Notes indenture will be in a form to be agreed between the Company and the Administrative Agent and will contain terms and a final maturity date that are substantially consistent with the terms and the maturity date of the Term Loans. The Exchange Notes will bear interest at a fixed rate as determined by the exchanging holder that will not exceed the Rate Cap. The Guarantors have guaranteed the Companys obligations under the Bridge Agreement. The Company and the Guarantors have made certain representations and warranties in the Bridge Agreement which are substantially the same as the representations and warranties in the 2003 Credit Agreement. The Bridge Agreement also contains covenants and events of default that are similar to the covenants and events of default in the indentures pursuant to which the Company issued its senior notes and senior subordinated notes. SENIOR NOTES On August 4, 1999, the Company issued $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8 5/8% Senior Notes due August 2006 (the "August 1999 Senior Notes").

The net proceeds of the offering ((pound) 78.8 million, or $118.2 million) were used to repay a portion of the Companys British pound sterling borrowings under its then existing senior credit facility. Interest on the Sterling Series C Senior Notes is payable semiannually on May 15 and November 15. The Sterling Series C Senior Notes are redeemable at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at any time.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The following table sets forth information about the Companys long term contractual obligations outstanding at February 28, 2003. It brings together data for easy reference from the consolidated balance sheet and from individual notes to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 9 and Note 14 to the Companys consolidated financial statements located in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for detailed discussion of items noted in the table below. PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD Less than After Total 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years 5 years (in thousands) Contractual obligations Notes payable to banks $ 2,623 $ 2,623 $ $ $ Long term debt (excluding unamortized discount) 1,248,799 67,682 81,081 404,400 695,636 Capital lease obligations 14,590 3,582 5,870 3,465 1,673 Operating leases 192,898 24,612 39,992 28,229 100,065 Unconditional purchase obligations 605,748 176,412 242,104 119,827 67,405 Total contractual cash obligations $ 2,064,658 $ 274,911 $ 369,047 $ 555,921 $ 864,779 The above table includes the payments due by period as of February 28, 2003, and includes the required payments under the then existing 2000 Credit Agreement. Subsequent to February 28, 2003, the Company drew down $8.0 million in revolving debt and $1,200.0 million in term loan debt under the 2003 Credit Agreement and $400.0 million under the Bridge Agreement. The Company used these proceeds to payoff the Companys obligations under the 2000 Credit Agreement, to fund the cash required to pay the Hardy shareholders and to pay indebtedness outstanding under certain of Hardys credit facilities. Consequently, the following table gives the payments due by period taking into account these changes: PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD Less than After Total 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years 5 years (in thousands) Contractual obligations Notes payable to banks $ 8,623 $ 8,623 $ $ $ Long term debt (excluding unamortized discount) 2,303,436 50,600 677,800 879,400 695,636 Capital lease obligations 14,590 3,582 5,870 3,465 1,673 Operating leases 192,898 24,612 39,992 28,229 100,065 Unconditional purchase obligations 605,748 176,412 242,104 119,827 67,405 Total contractual cash obligations $ 3,125,295 $ 263,829 $ 965,766 $ 1,030,921 $ 864,779 31 In addition, in connection with the formation of the Companys joint venture, PWP, in July 2001, the Company transferred certain of its vineyard lease and vineyard management agreements to PWP. The agreements have terms that expire between 2012 and 2026. The Company guaranteed PWPs payment and performance under these agreements. The estimated maximum amount of the Companys exposure is $42.6 million in undiscounted future payments. The Company has not recorded a liability for these guarantees and does not have any collateral from PWP. EQUITY OFFERINGS During March 2001, the Company completed a public offering of 8,740,000 shares of its Class A Common Stock, which was held as treasury stock. This resulted in net proceeds to the Company, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses, of $139.4 million. The net proceeds were used to repay revolving loan borrowings under the senior credit facility of which a portion was incurred to partially finance the acquisition of the Turner Road Vintners Assets. During October 2001, the Company sold 645,000 shares of its Class A Common Stock, which was held as treasury stock, in connection with a public offering of Class A Common Stock by stockholders of the Company. The net proceeds to the Company, after deducting underwriting discounts, of $12.1 million were used to repay borrowings under the senior credit facility. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES During Fiscal 2003, the Company incurred $71.6 million for capital expenditures, including $7.0 million related to vineyards. The Company plans to spend approximately $120 million for capital expenditures, exclusive of vineyards, in Fiscal 2004. In addition, the Company continues to consider the purchase, lease and development of vineyards and may incur additional expenditures for vineyards if opportunities become available. See "Business Sources and Availability of Raw Materials" under Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Management reviews the capital expenditure program periodically and modifies it as required to meet current business needs. RELATED PARTIES Agustin Francisco Huneeus, the executive in charge of the Fiscal 2003 Fine Wine segment, along with other members of his immediate family, through various family owned entities (the "Huneeus Interests") engaged in certain transactions with the Fine Wine segment during each of the three years in the period ended February 28, 2003. The Huneeus Interests engage the Fine Wine segment as the exclusive distributor of its Quintessa wines under a long term contract; sell grapes to the Fine Wine segment pursuant to existing long term contracts; lease a vineyard consisting of 67 acres to the Fine Wine segment pursuant to a 5 year lease contract; participate as partners with the Fine Wine segment in the ownership and operation of a winery and vineyards in Chile; and render brand management and other consulting and advisory services in the United States and internationally to the Fine Wine segment and the Company. Total amounts to the Huneeus Interests pursuant to these transactions and arrangements totaled $6.5 million, $4.8 million, and $5.0 million for the years ended February 28, 2003, February 28, 2002, and February 28, 2001, respectively. In addition, the Fine Wine segment performs certain wine processing services for the Huneeus Interests. Total fees earned from the Huneeus Interests to the Fine Wine segment for these services totaled $0.2 million, $0.4 million, and $0.6 million for the years ended February 28, 2003, February 28, 2002, and February 28, 2001, respectively. As of February 28, 2003, and February 28, 2002, the net amounts due to/from the Huneeus Interests under these agreements are insignificant. 32 EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES The Companys results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by inflation and changing prices. The Company has been able, subject to normal competitive conditions, to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices. There can be no assurances, however, that the Company will continue to be able to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Companys significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Companys consolidated financial statements located in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. However, certain of the Companys accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of the Companys financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by the Companys management; as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. In applying those policies, the Companys management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. Those estimates are based on the Companys historical experience, the Companys observance of trends in the industry, information provided by the Companys customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. On an ongoing basis, the Company reviews its estimates to ensure that they appropriately reflect changes in the Companys business. The Companys critical accounting policies include: Accounting for promotional activities. Gross sales reflect reductions attributable to consideration given to customers in various customer incentive programs, including pricing discounts on single transactions, volume discounts, promotional and advertising allowances, coupons, and rebates. Certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the cost of those programs. The accrued liability for these programs is determined through analysis of programs offered, historical trends, expectations regarding customer and consumer participation, sales and payment trends, and experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs that had been previously offered. If assumptions included in the Companys estimates were to change or market conditions were to change, then material incremental reductions to revenue could be required, which would have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial statements. Promotional costs were $231.6 million, $223.9 million and $178.5 million for Fiscal 2003, Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001, respectively. Inventory valuation. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, cost being determined on the first in, first out method. The Company assesses the valuation of its inventories and reduces the carrying value of those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of the Companys forecasted usage to their estimated net realizable value. The Company estimates the net realizable value of such inventories based on analyses and assumptions including, but not limited to, historical usage, future demand and market requirements. Reductions to the carrying value of inventories are recorded in cost of goods sold. If the future demand for the Companys products is less favorable than the Companys forecasts, then the value of the inventories may be required to be reduced, which could result in material additional expense to the Company and have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial statements. Accounting for business combinations. The acquisition of businesses is an important element of the Companys strategy. Under the purchase method, the Company is required to record 33 the net assets acquired at the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. The determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the Companys financial statements. For example, the Companys acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets; the value and estimated life of those assets may affect the amount of future period amortization expense for intangible assets with finite lives as well as possible impairment charges that may be incurred. Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Intangible assets with indefinite lives consist primarily of trademarks as well as distributor and agency relationships. The Company is required to analyze its goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis as well as when events and circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. Certain factors that may occur and indicate that an impairment exists include, but are not limited to, operating results that are lower than expected and adverse industry or market economic trends. The impairment testing requires management to estimate the fair value of the assets or reporting unit and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. The estimate of fair value of the assets is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows. The estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows supplemented by the market approach. In estimating the fair value, management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as future cash flows, future revenues, future earnings and other factors. The assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with the past performance of each reporting unit and other intangible assets and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans. Such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets. The recording of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial statements. ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS NOT YET ADOPTED In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143 ("SFAS No. 143"), "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated retirement costs. As required, the Company adopted SFAS No. 143 on March 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements. In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 145 ("SFAS No. 145"), "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections." SFAS No. 145 rescinds Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 4 ("SFAS No. 4"), "Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt," Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 44, "Accounting for Intangible Assets of Motor Carriers," and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 64, "Extinguishments of Debt Made to Satisfy Sinking Fund Requirements." In addition, SFAS No. 145 amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, "Accounting for Leases," to eliminate an inconsistency between required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions. Lastly, SFAS No. 145 also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical 34 corrections, clarify meanings, or describe their applicability under changed conditions. The Company is required to adopt the provisions related to the rescission of SFAS No. 4 for fiscal years beginning March 1, 2003. All other provisions of SFAS No. 145 were effective for fiscal years beginning March 1, 2002. The adoption of the applicable provisions of SFAS No. 145 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements. The adoption of the provisions rescinding SFAS No. 4 will result in a reclassification of the extraordinary loss related to the extinguishment of debt recorded in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2002 ($1.6 million, net of income taxes), by increasing selling, general and administrative expenses ($2.6 million) and decreasing the provision for income taxes ($1.0 million). In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 00 21 ("EITF No. 00 21"), "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables." EITF No. 00 21 addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities. EITF No. 00 21 also addresses how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement. The Company is required to adopt EITF No. 00 21 for all revenue arrangements entered into beginning August 1, 2003. The Company is currently assessing the financial impact of EITF No. 00 21 on its financial statements. In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148 ("SFAS No. 148"), "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure." SFAS No. 148 amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 ("SFAS No. 123"), "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. SFAS No. 148 also amends the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entitys accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation. Lastly, SFAS No. 148 amends Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 28 ("APB Opinion No. 28"), "Interim Financial Reporting," to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information. The Company has adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148 for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2003. The Company is required to adopt the amendment to APB Opinion No. 28 for financial reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning March 1, 2003. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN No. 46"), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities an interpretation of ARB No. 51." FIN No. 46 requires all variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that holds the majority of the beneficial interests in the variable interest entity. In addition, the interpretation expands disclosure requirements for both variable interest entities that are consolidated as well as variable interest entities from which the entity is the holder of a significant amount of the beneficial interests, but not the majority. Since the Company has no transactions with variable interest entities, the Company does not expect the adoption of FIN No. 46 in its entirety to have a significant impact on the Companys financial statements. In April 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 149 ("SFAS No. 149"), "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS No. 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, and hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003, except for those provisions of SFAS No. 149 which relate to SFAS No. 133 Implementation Issues that have been effective for fiscal quarters that began prior to June 15, 2003. For these issues, the provisions that are currently in effect should continue to be applied in accordance with their respective effective dates. In addition, certain 35 provisions of SFAS No. 149, which relate to forward purchases or sales of when issued securities or other securities that do not yet exist, should be applied to both existing contracts and new contracts entered into after June 30, 2003. The Company is currently assessing the financial impact of SFAS No. 149 on its financial statements. CAUTIONARY INFORMATION REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This Annual Report on Form 10 K contains "forward looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Companys control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in, or implied by, such forward looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, including the statements under Item 1 "Business" and Item 7 "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" regarding the Companys business strategy, future financial position, prospects, plans and objectives of management, as well as information concerning expected actions of third parties are forward looking statements. When used in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, the words "anticipate," "intend," "expect," and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements, although not all forward looking statements contain such identifying words. All forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. In addition to the risks and uncertainties of ordinary business operations, important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in, or implied, by the Companys forward looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K are as follows: THE COMPANYS INDEBTEDNESS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL HEALTH. The Company has incurred substantial indebtedness to finance its acquisitions and may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to finance further acquisitions or for other purposes. The Companys ability to satisfy its financial obligations under the Companys indebtedness outstanding from time to time will depend upon the Companys future operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions, levels of interest rates and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond the Companys control. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the Companys cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet all of its debt service requirements and to fund its capital expenditure requirements. The Companys current and future debt service obligations and covenants could have important consequences. Such consequences include, or may include, the following: the Companys ability to obtain financing for future working capital needs or acquisitions or other purposes may be limited; a significant portion of the Companys cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available for operations, expansion or distributions; the Company is subject to restrictive covenants that could limit its ability to conduct its business; and 36 the Company may be more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions than less leveraged competitors and, thus, may be limited in its ability to withstand competitive pressures. The restrictive covenants included in the Companys senior credit facility, its bridge loan agreement and its indentures include, among others, restrictions in relation to additional borrowings, the sale of assets, changes of control, the payment of dividends, transactions with affiliates, the making of investments and certain other fundamental changes. The senior credit facility and the bridge loan agreement also contain restrictions on acquisitions and certain financial ratio tests including a debt coverage ratio, a senior debt coverage ratio, a fixed charges ratio and an interest coverage ratio. These restrictions could limit the Companys ability to conduct business. A failure to comply with the obligations contained in the senior credit facility, the bridge loan agreement, its indentures or in follow on financings could result in an event of default under such agreements, which could require the Company to immediately repay the related debt and also debt under other agreements that may contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions. THE COMPANYS ACQUISITION OR JOINT VENTURE STRATEGIES MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL. The Company has made a number of mergers and acquisitions, including the recent acquisitions of Hardy, Ravenswood, the Turner Road Vintners Assets, and the Corus Assets, and anticipates that it may, from time to time, acquire additional businesses, assets or securities of companies that the Company believes would provide a strategic fit with its business. In addition, the Company has entered joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures. Acquired businesses will need to be integrated with the Companys existing operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into its business or product offerings. Acquisitions are accompanied by risks such as potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business. Acquisitions are subject to risks associated with the difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies, the potential disruption to the Companys business and the diversion of management time and attention. The Company shares control of its existing joint ventures and may not have majority interest or control of future joint ventures, and, therefore, there is the risk that the Companys joint venture partners may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with those of the joint venture or the Company. There is also risk that the Companys joint venture partners may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and that the Company may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. The Companys failure or the failure of an entity in which the Company has a joint venture interest to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. COMPETITION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS. The Company is in a highly competitive industry and the dollar amount and unit volume of its sales could be negatively affected by its inability to maintain or increase prices, changes in geographic or product mix, a general decline in beverage alcohol consumption or the decision of the Companys wholesale customers, retailers or consumers to purchase competitive products instead of the Companys products. Wholesaler, retailer and consumer purchasing decisions are influenced by, among other things, the perceived absolute or relative overall value of the Companys products, including their quality or pricing, compared to competitive products. Unit volume and dollar sales could also be affected by pricing, purchasing, financing, operational, advertising or promotional decisions made by wholesalers and retailers which could affect their supply of, or consumer demand for, the Companys products. The Company could also experience higher than expected selling, general and administrative expenses if the 37 Company finds it necessary to increase the number of its personnel or advertising or promotional expenditures to maintain its competitive position or for other reasons. INCREASE IN EXCISE TAXES AND GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS. In the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and other countries in which the Company operates, the Company is subject to imposition of excise taxes and other taxes on beverage alcohol products in varying amounts which have been subject to change. In addition, the beverage alcohol products industry is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies. For example, in the United States, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the various state liquor authorities regulate such matters as licensing, trade and pricing practices, permitted and required labeling, advertising and relations with wholesalers and retailers. Certain federal and state regulations also require warning labels and signage. Increases in excise taxes on beverage alcohol products in the United States, the United Kingdom or Australia, if enacted, could materially and adversely affect the Companys financial condition or results of operations. New or revised regulations or increased licensing fees, requirements or taxes could also have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. THE COMPANY RELIES ON THE PERFORMANCE OF WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTORS, MAJOR RETAILERS AND CHAINS FOR THE SUCCESS OF ITS BUSINESS. In the United States, the Company sells its products principally to wholesalers for resale to retail outlets including grocery stores, package liquor stores, club and discount stores and restaurants. In the United Kingdom and Australia, the Company sells its products principally to wholesalers and directly to major retailers and chains. The replacement or poor performance of the Companys major wholesalers, retailers and chains, or the Companys inability to collect accounts receivable from the Companys major wholesalers, retailers and chains could materially and adversely affect the Companys results of operations and financial condition. Distribution channels for beverage alcohol products have been consolidating in recent years. In addition, wholesalers and retailers of the Companys products offer products which compete directly with the Companys products for retail shelf space and consumer purchases. Accordingly, there is a risk that wholesalers or retailers may give higher priority to products of the Companys competitors. In the future, the Companys wholesalers and retailers may not continue to purchase the Companys products or provide the Companys products with adequate levels of promotional support. THE COMPANYS BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DECLINES IN THE CONSUMPTION OF PRODUCTS THE COMPANY SELLS. Although since 1995 there have been modest increases in consumption of beverage alcohol in most of the Companys product categories, there have been periods in the past few decades in which there were substantial declines in the overall per capita consumption of beverage alcohol products in the United States and other markets in which the Company participates. A limited or general decline in consumption in one or more of the Companys product categories could occur in the future due to a variety of factors, including: a general decline or lack of improvement in economic conditions; increased concern about the health consequences of consuming beverage alcohol products and about drinking and driving; 38 a trend toward a healthier diet including lighter, lower calorie beverages such as diet soft drinks, juices and water products; increased activity of anti alcohol consumer groups; and increased federal, state or foreign excise taxes. THE COMPANY GENERALLY PURCHASES RAW MATERIALS UNDER SHORT TERM SUPPLY CONTRACTS AND THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL PRICE FLUCTUATIONS FOR GRAPES AND GRAPE RELATED MATERIALS; THE COMPANY HAS A LIMITED GROUP OF SUPPLIERS OF GLASS BOTTLES. The Companys business is heavily dependent upon raw materials, such as grapes, grape juice concentrate, grains, alcohol and packaging materials from third party suppliers. The Company could experience raw material supply, production or shipment difficulties that could adversely affect the Companys ability to supply goods to its customers. The Company is also directly affected by increases in the costs of such raw materials. In the past, the Company has experienced dramatic increases in the cost of grapes. Although the Company believes it has adequate sources of grape supplies, in the event demand for certain wine products exceeds expectations, the Company could experience shortages. In addition, one of the Companys largest components of cost of goods sold is that of glass bottles, which, in the United States and Australia, have only a small number of producers. Currently, substantially all of the Companys glass container requirements for its United States operations are supplied by one producer and substantially all of the Companys glass container requirements for its Australian operations are supplied by another producer. The inability of any of the Companys glass bottle suppliers to satisfy its requirements could adversely affect the Companys business. THE COMPANYS GLOBAL OPERATIONS SUBJECT IT TO RISKS RELATED TO CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS AND GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTY. The Company has operations in different countries and, therefore, is subject to the risks associated with currency fluctuations. Subsequent to the Hardy Acquisition, the Companys exposure to foreign currency risk has increased significantly as a result of having additional international subsidiaries in Australia, New Zealand and France. The Company could experience changes in its ability to obtain or hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates. The Company could also be affected by nationalizations or unstable governments or legal systems or intergovernmental disputes. These currency, economic and political uncertainties may affect the Companys results, especially to the extent these matters, or the decisions, policies or economic strength of the Companys suppliers, affect the Companys global operations or imported beer products. THE COMPANY HAS A MATERIAL AMOUNT OF GOODWILL, AND IF THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO WRITE DOWN GOODWILL DUE TO IMPAIRMENT, IT WOULD REDUCE THE COMPANYS NET INCOME, WHICH IN TURN COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. As of February 28, 2003, goodwill represented approximately $722.2 million, or 22.6% of the Companys total assets. It is expected that this balance will increase once the allocation of the purchase price for the Hardy Acquisition is completed. Goodwill is the amount by which the costs of an acquisition accounted for using the purchase method exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired. The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142 ("SFAS No. 142"), "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," in its entirety, on March 1, 2002. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill is no longer amortized, but instead is subject to a periodic impairment evaluation based on the fair value of the reporting unit. Reductions in the Companys net income caused by a write down of goodwill could materially and adversely affect the Companys results of operations. 39 THE TERMINATION OR NON RENEWAL OF IMPORTED BEER DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS. All of the Companys imported beer products are marketed and sold pursuant to exclusive distribution agreements with the suppliers of these products and are subject to renewal from time to time. The Companys agreements to distribute Corona Extra and its other Mexican beer brands in 25 primarily western U.S. states expires in December 2006 and, subject to compliance with certain performance criteria, continued retention of certain personnel and other terms of the agreement, will be automatically renewed for additional terms of five years. Changes in control of the Company or its subsidiaries involved in importing the Mexican beer brands, or changes in the chief executive officer of such subsidiaries, may be a basis for the supplier, unless it consents to such changes, to terminate the agreement. The suppliers consent to such changes may not be unreasonably withheld. Prior to their expiration, all of the Companys imported beer distribution agreements may be terminated if the Company fails to meet certain performance criteria. The Company believes that it is currently in compliance with all of its material imported beer distribution agreements. From time to time the Company has failed, and may in the future fail, to satisfy certain performance criteria in the Companys distribution agreements. It is possible that the Companys beer distribution agreements may not be renewed or may be terminated prior to expiration. THE COMPANYS PRIOR YEARS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WERE AUDITED BY ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP. The Companys consolidated financial statements for the years ended February 28, 2002, and February 28, 2001, were audited by Arthur Andersen LLP, independent public accountants. On August 31, 2002, Arthur Andersen LLP ceased to practice before the SEC. Therefore, Arthur Andersen did not participate in the preparation of this Form 10 K, did not reissue its audit report with respect to the financial statements included in this Form 10 K, and did not consent to the inclusion of a copy of its previously issued audit report in this Form 10 K. As a result, holders of the Companys securities may have no effective remedy against Arthur Andersen LLP in connection with a material misstatement or omission in the financial statements to which its audit report relates. In addition, even if such holders were able to assert such a claim, because it has ceased operations, Arthur Andersen LLP may fail or otherwise have insufficient assets to satisfy claims made by holders of the Companys securities that might arise under federal securities laws or otherwise with respect to the audit report of Arthur Andersen LLP. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company is exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. To manage the volatility relating to these risks, the Company periodically enters into derivative transactions including foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements. The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and does not use them for trading purposes. The Company uses derivative instruments solely to reduce the financial impact of these risks. The fair value of long term debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair value of long term debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The estimated fair value of the Companys total long term debt, including current maturities, was $1,400.8 million and $1,407.4 million at February 28, 2003, and February 28, 2002, respectively. A hypothetical 1% increase from 40 prevailing interest rates at February 28, 2003, and February 28, 2002, would have resulted in a decrease in fair value of fixed interest rate long term debt by $151.3 million and $57.6 million, respectively. Also, a hypothetical 1% increase from prevailing interest rates at February 28, 2003, and February 28, 2002, would result in an approximate increase in cash required for interest on variable interest rate debt during the next five fiscal years as follows: February 28, February 28, 2003 2002 2003 N/A $2.5 million 2004 $1.1 million $1.7 million 2005 $0.3 million $0.7 million 2006 $ $ 2007 $ $ 2008 $ N/A The Company has on occasion entered into interest rate swap agreements to reduce its exposure to interest rate changes relative to its long term debt. At February 28, 2003, and February 28, 2002, the Company had no interest rate swap agreements outstanding. At February 28, 2003, the Company has exposure to foreign currency risk as a result of having international subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Canada. For the Companys operations in the United Kingdom, the Company uses local currency borrowings to hedge its earnings and cash flow exposure to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At February 28, 2003, management believes that a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would not result in a material adverse impact on either earnings or cash flow. The Company also has exposure to foreign currency risk as a result of contracts to purchase inventory items that are denominated in various foreign currencies. In order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting from these contracts, the Company periodically enters into foreign exchange hedging agreements. At February 28, 2003, and February 28, 2002, the potential loss on outstanding foreign exchange hedging agreements from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would not be material. Subsequent to the Hardy Acquisition, the Companys exposure to foreign currency risk has increased significantly as a result of having additional international subsidiaries in Australia, New Zealand and France. The Company also has exposure to foreign currency risk as a result of Hardys significant international sales that are denominated in various foreign currencies. In order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting from these sales, the Companys involvement with derivative financial instruments will increase proportionately. 41
