ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW The Company generates revenue through the production, marketing and sale of beverage alcohol products, primarily in North America, Europe and Australia. The Company has a broad portfolio of brands across the wine, imported beer and distilled spirits categories, and with the acquisition of Hardy in Fiscal 2004 solidified its position as the worlds largest wine company. The Companys business strategy is to remain focused across the beverage alcohol industry by offering a broad range of products in each of the Companys three major categories: wine, beer and spirits. The Company intends to keep its portfolio positioned for superior top line growth while maximizing the profitability of its brands. In addition, the Company seeks to increase its relative importance to key customers in major markets by increasing its share of their overall purchasing, which is increasingly important in a consolidating industry. The Companys strategy of breadth across categories and geographies, and strengthening scale in core markets, is designed to deliver long term profitable growth. This strategy allows the Company more investment choices, provides flexibility to address changing market conditions and creates stronger routes to market. The Companys businesses fall within one of two areas: growth or scale. The growth businesses represent approximately 60% of the Companys Fiscal 2004 net sales and include approximately half of the Companys branded wine business (specifically premium wines in the U.S. and wines in the U.K.), imported beer in the U.S. and the U.K. wholesale business. The scale businesses represent approximately 40% of Fiscal 2004 net sales and include spirits, the remaining half of the Companys branded wine business, cider, and non branded sales. The scale businesses are operated to maximize profitability and cash flow and to maintain strong routes to market. With a solid foundation of growth and scale businesses, the Company expects to continue to be able to leverage sales growth into even higher growth in earnings and cash flow. The U.S. beer industry has experienced a healthy pricing environment over the last several years; however, this could change due to market dynamics. Beginning January 2004, the Company raised prices to its wholesalers on the Companys imported Mexican beer brands. The timing of this price increase resulted in a shift in sales volume from Fiscal 2005 to Fiscal 2004 due to wholesaler buy in ahead of the price increase. As a result of the wholesaler buy in and as retailers and consumers adapt to the higher price, the Company expects a negative impact on volume trends for Fiscal 2005. The Company remains committed to its long term financial model of growing sales (both organically and through acquisitions), expanding margins and increasing cash flow to achieve superior earnings per share growth and improve return on invested capital. INTRODUCTION The Company is a leading international producer and marketer of beverage alcohol brands with a broad portfolio across the wine, spirits and imported beer categories. The Company has the largest wine business in the world and is the largest multi category supplier of beverage alcohol in the United States; a leading producer and exporter of wine from Australia and New Zealand; and both a major producer and independent drinks wholesaler in the United Kingdom. Through February 28, 2003, the Company reported its operating results in five segments: Popular and Premium Wine (branded popular and premium wine and brandy, and other, primarily grape juice concentrate and bulk wine); Imported Beer and Spirits (primarily imported beer and distilled spirits); U.K. Brands and Wholesale (branded wine, cider, and bottled water, and wholesale wine, distilled spirits, cider, beer, RTDs and soft drinks); Fine Wine (primarily branded super premium and ultra premium wine); and Corporate Operations and Other (primarily corporate related items). As a result of the Hardy Acquisition (as defined below), the Company has changed the structure of its internal organization to consist of two business divisions, Constellation Wines and Constellation Beers and Spirits. Separate division chief executives report directly to the Companys chief operating officer. Consequently, the Company reports its operating results in three segments: Constellation Wines (branded wine, and U.K. wholesale and other), Constellation Beers and Spirits (imported beer and distilled spirits) and Corporate Operations and Other (primarily corporate related items and other). Amounts included in the Corporate Operations and Other segment consist of general corporate administration and finance expenses. These amounts include costs of executive management, investor relations, internal audit, treasury, tax, corporate development, legal, financial reporting, professional fees and public relations. Any costs incurred at the corporate office that are applicable to the segments are allocated to the appropriate segment. The amounts included in the Corporate Operations and Other segment are general costs that are applicable to the consolidated group and are therefore not allocated to the other reportable segments. All costs reported within the Corporate Operations and Other segment are not included in the chief operating decision makers evaluation of the operating income performance of the other operating segments. The new business segments reflect how the Companys operations are being managed, how operating performance within the Company is being evaluated by senior management and the structure of its internal financial reporting. In addition, the Company changed its definition of operating income for segment purposes to exclude restructuring and related charges and unusual costs that affect comparability. Accordingly, the financial information for Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002 (as defined below) have been restated to conform to the new segment presentation. The following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting (i) consolidated results of operations of the Company for the year ended February 29, 2004 ("Fiscal 2004"), compared to the year ended February 28, 2003 ("Fiscal 2003"), and Fiscal 2003 compared to the year ended February 28, 2002 ("Fiscal 2002"), and (ii) financial liquidity and capital resources for Fiscal 2004. This discussion and analysis also identifies certain restructuring and related charges expected to affect consolidated results of operations of the Company for the year ended February 28, 2005 ("Fiscal 2005"). This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included herein. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142 on March 1, 2002. Upon the adoption of SFAS No. 142, the Company ceased amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. Retroactive application of SFAS No. 142 is not permitted. ACQUISITIONS IN FISCAL 2004, FISCAL 2003 AND FISCAL 2002 AND JOINT VENTURE ACQUISITION OF HARDY On March 27, 2003, the Company acquired control of BRL Hardy Limited, now known as Hardy Wine Company Limited ("Hardy"), and on April 9, 2003, the Company completed its acquisition of all of Hardys outstanding capital stock. As a result of the acquisition of Hardy, the Company also acquired the remaining 50% ownership of Pacific Wine Partners LLC ("PWP"), the joint venture the Company established with Hardy in July 2001. The acquisition of Hardy along with the remaining interest in PWP is referred to together as the "Hardy Acquisition." Through this acquisition, the Company acquired Australias largest wine producer with interests in wineries and vineyards in most of Australias major wine regions as well as New Zealand and the United States. Hardy has a comprehensive portfolio of wine products across all price points with a strong focus on premium wine production. Hardys wines are distributed worldwide through a network of marketing and sales operations, with the majority of sales generated in Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States. Total consideration paid in cash and Class A Common Stock to the Hardy shareholders was $1,137.4 million. Additionally, the Company recorded direct acquisition costs of $17.7 million. The acquisition date for accounting purposes is March 27, 2003. The Company has recorded a $1.6 million reduction in the purchase price to reflect imputed interest between the accounting acquisition date and the final payment of consideration. This charge is included as interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended February 29, 2004. The cash portion of the purchase price paid to the Hardy shareholders and optionholders ($1,060.2 million) was financed with $660.2 million of borrowings under the Companys March 2003 Credit Agreement (as defined below) and $400.0 million of borrowings under the Companys Bridge Agreement (as defined below). Additionally, the Company issued 3,288,913 shares of the Companys Class A Common Stock, which were valued at $77.2 million based on the simple average of the closing market price of the Companys Class A Common Stock beginning two days before and ending two days after April 4, 2003, the day the Hardy shareholders elected the form of consideration they wished to receive. The purchase price was based primarily on a discounted cash flow analysis that contemplated, among other things, the value of a broader geographic distribution in strategic international markets and a presence in the important Australian winemaking regions. The Company and Hardy have complementary businesses that share a common growth orientation and operating philosophy. The Hardy Acquisition supports the Companys strategy of growth and breadth across categories and geographies, and strengthens its competitive position in its core markets. The purchase price and resulting goodwill were primarily based on the growth opportunities of the brand portfolio of Hardy. In particular, the Company believes there are growth opportunities for Australian wines in the United Kingdom, United States and other wine markets. This acquisition supports the Companys strategy of driving long term growth and positions the Company to capitalize on the growth opportunities in "new world" wine markets. The results of operations of Hardy and PWP have been reported in the Companys Constellation Wines segment as of March 27, 2003. ACQUISITION OF RAVENSWOOD WINERY On July 2, 2001, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Ravenswood Winery, Inc. (the "Ravenswood Acquisition"), a leading premium wine producer based in Sonoma, California. On June 30, 2002, Ravenswood Winery, Inc. was merged into Franciscan Vineyards, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company). The Ravenswood business produces, markets and sells super premium and ultra premium California wine, primarily under the Ravenswood brand name. The vast majority of the wine the Ravenswood business produces and sells is red wine, including the number one super premium Zinfandel in the United States. The results of operations of the Ravenswood business are reported in the Constellation Wines segment and have been included in the consolidated results of operations of the Company since the date of acquisition. ACQUISITION OF THE CORUS ASSETS On March 26, 2001, in an asset acquisition, the Company acquired certain wine brands, wineries, working capital (primarily inventories), and other related assets from Corus Brands, Inc. (the "Corus Assets"). In this acquisition, the Company acquired several well known premium wine brands primarily sold in the northwestern United States, including Covey Run, Columbia, Ste. Chapelle and Alice White. In connection with the transaction, the Company also entered into long term grape supply agreements with affiliates of Corus Brands, Inc. covering more than 1,000 acres of Washington and Idaho vineyards. The results of operations of the Corus Assets are reported in the Constellation Wines segment and have been included in the consolidated results of operations of the Company since the date of acquisition. ACQUISITION OF THE TURNER ROAD VINTNERS ASSETS On March 5, 2001, in an asset acquisition, the Company acquired several well known premium wine brands, including Vendange, Nathanson Creek, Heritage, and Talus, working capital (primarily inventories), two wineries in California, and other related assets from Sebastiani Vineyards, Inc. and Tuolomne River Vintners Group (the "Turner Road Vintners Assets"). The results of operations of the Turner Road Vintners Assets are reported in the Constellation Wines segment and have been included in the consolidated results of operations of the Company since the date of acquisition. PACIFIC WINE PARTNERS On July 31, 2001, the Company and Hardy completed the formation of PWP, a joint venture owned equally by the Company and Hardy through March 26, 2003. Pacific Wine Partners LLC ("PWP") produces, markets and sells a portfolio of premium wine in the United States, including a range of Australian imports. PWP also exports certain of its U.S. produced wines to other countries. In connection with the initial formation of the joint venture, PWP was given the exclusive distribution rights in the United States and the Caribbean to several brands, including Banrock Station, Hardys, Leasingham, Barossa Valley Estate and Chateau Reynella from Australia; and Nobilo from New Zealand. PWP also owns Farallon, a premium California coastal wine. In addition, PWP owns a winery and controls 1,400 acres of vineyards in Monterey County, California. On October 16, 2001, the Company announced that PWP completed the purchase of certain assets of Blackstone Winery, including the Blackstone brand and the Codera wine business in Sonoma County. As a result of the Hardy Acquisition, PWP became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Accordingly, as noted above, its results of operations have been consolidated and reported in the Constellation Wines segment since March 27, 2003. Prior to March 27, 2003, the investment in PWP was accounted for using the equity method; accordingly, the results of operations of PWP from July 31, 2001, through March 26, 2003, were included in the equity in earnings of joint ventures line in the Consolidated Statements of Income of the Company. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003 NET SALES The following table sets forth the net sales (in thousands of dollars) by operating segment of the Company for Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003 Net Sales 2004 2003 %Increase Constellation Wines: Branded wines $ 1,549,750 $ 983,505 57.6% Wholesale and other 846,306 689,794 22.7% Constellation Wines net sales $ 2,396,056 $ 1,673,299 43.2% Constellation Beers and Spirits: Imported beers $ 862,637 $ 776,006 11.2% Spirits 284,551 282,307 0.8% Constellation Beers and Spirits net sales $ 1,147,188 $ 1,058,313 8.4% Corporate Operations and Other $ $ N/A Unusual gain $ 9,185 $ N/A Consolidated Net Sales $ 3,552,429 $ 2,731,612 30.0% Net sales for Fiscal 2004 increased to $3,552.4 million from $2,731.6 million for Fiscal 2003, an increase of $820.8 million, or 30.0%. This increase resulted primarily from the inclusion of $571.4 million of net sales of products acquired in the Hardy Acquisition as well as increases in imported beer sales of $86.6 million and U.K. wholesale sales of $61.1 million (on a local currency basis). In addition, net sales benefited from a favorable foreign currency impact of $74.6 million. Constellation Wines Net sales for the Constellation Wines segment for Fiscal 2004 increased to $2,396.1 million from $1,673.3 million for Fiscal 2003, an increase of $722.8 million, or 43.2%. Branded wine net sales increased $566.2 million, primarily due to the addition of $548.4 million of net sales of branded wine acquired in the Hardy Acquisition. Wholesale and other net sales increased $156.5 million primarily due to a favorable foreign currency impact of $63.1 million, growth in the U.K. wholesale business of $61.1 million (on a local currency basis), and the addition of $23.0 million of net sales of bulk wine acquired in the Hardy Acquisition. The net sales increase in the U.K. Wholesale business on a local currency basis is primarily due to the addition of new accounts and increased average delivery sizes as the Companys national accounts business continues to grow. The Company continues to face competitive discounting within select markets and geographies driven in part by excess grape supplies. The Company believes that the grape supply/demand cycle should come into balance over the next couple of years. The Company has taken a strategy of preserving the long term brand equity of its portfolio and investing its marketing dollars in the higher growth sectors of the wine business. Constellation Beers and Spirits Net sales for the Constellation Beers and Spirits segment for Fiscal 2004 increased to $1,147.2 million from $1,058.3 million for Fiscal 2003, an increase of $88.9 million, or 8.4%. This increase resulted primarily from volume gains on the Companys imported beer portfolio, which increased $86.6 million. Spirits net sales remained relatively flat as increased branded spirits sales were offset by lower bulk whisky and contract production sales. GROSS PROFIT The Companys gross profit increased to $975.8 million for Fiscal 2004 from $760.7 million for Fiscal 2003, an increase of $215.1 million, or 28.3%. The Constellation Wines segments gross profit increased $200.4 million primarily due to gross profit on the sales of branded wine acquired in the Hardy Acquisition. The Constellation Beers and Spirits segments gross profit increased $42.5 million primarily due to the volume growth in the segments imported beer portfolio. These increases were partially offset by $27.8 million of net unusual costs which consist of certain items that are excluded by management in their evaluation of the results of each operating segment. These net costs represent the flow through of inventory step up associated with the Hardy Acquisition of $22.5 million and the write down of concentrate inventory recorded in connection with the Companys decision to exit the commodity concentrate product line of $16.8 million (see additional discussion under "Restructuring and Related Charges" below), partially offset by the relief from certain excise tax, duty and other costs incurred in prior years of $11.5 million, which was recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Gross profit as a percent of net sales decreased slightly to 27.5% for Fiscal 2004 from 27.8% for Fiscal 2003 as an increase in gross profit margin from sales of higher margin wine brands acquired in the Hardy Acquisition was more than offset by the net unusual costs discussed above and a decrease in gross profit margin on the Constellation Wines U.K. wholesale business. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $457.3 million for Fiscal 2004 from $351.0 million for Fiscal 2003, an increase of $106.3 million, or 30.3%. The Constellation Wines segments selling, general and administrative expenses increased $76.8 million primarily due to $67.7 million of selling, general and administrative expenses from the addition of the Hardy and PWP businesses. The Constellation Beers and Spirits segments selling, general and administrative expenses increased $7.9 million due to increased imported beer and spirits advertising and selling expenses to support the growth across this segments businesses, partially offset by foreign currency gains. The Corporate Operations and Other segments general and administrative expenses increased $8.9 million primarily due to additional deferred financing costs associated with the Companys new bank credit facility and increased general and administrative expenses to support the Companys growth. In addition, there was a $12.7 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses related to unusual costs which consist of certain items that are excluded by management in their evaluation of the results of each operating segment. These costs consist primarily of the additional amortized deferred financing costs associated with the bridge financing in connection with the Hardy Acquisition of $11.6 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales increased slightly to 12.9% for Fiscal 2004 as compared to 12.8% for Fiscal 2003 due primarily to the unusual costs and the increased general and administrative expenses within the Corporate Operations and Other segment as discussed above. RESTRUCTURING AND RELATED CHARGES The Company recorded $31.2 million of restructuring and related charges for Fiscal 2004 associated with the restructuring plan of the Constellation Wines segment. Restructuring and related charges resulted from (i) $10.0 million related to the realignment of business operations and (ii) $21.2 million related to exiting the commodity concentrate product line in the U.S. and selling its winery located in Escalon, California. In total, the Company recorded $38.0 million of costs associated with exiting the commodity concentrate product line and selling its Escalon facility allocated between cost of product sold ($16.8 million) and restructuring and related charges ($21.2 million). The Company recorded $4.8 million of restructuring and related charges for Fiscal 2003 associated with an asset impairment charge in connection with two of Constellation Wines segments production facilities. In Fiscal 2005, the Company expects to incur additional restructuring and related charges of $11.6 million associated with the restructuring plan of the Constellation Wines segment. These charges are expected to consist of $7.2 million related to the further realignment of business operations in the Constellation Wines segment and $4.4 million related to renegotiating existing grape contracts as a result of exiting the commodity concentrate product line and selling the Escalon facility. Approximately half of the total charges in connection with exiting the commodity concentrate product line and selling the Escalon facility are non cash charges. OPERATING INCOME The following table sets forth the operating income (loss) (in thousands of dollars) by operating segment of the Company for Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003 Operating Income (Loss) 2004 2003 %Increase Constellation Wines $ 348,132 $ 224,556 55.0% Constellation Beers and Spirits 252,533 217,963 15.9% Corporate Operations and Other (41,717) (32,797) 27.2% Total Reportable Segments 558,948 409,722 36.4% Restructuring and Related Charges and Unusual Costs (71,591) (4,764) 1402.7% Consolidated Operating Income $ 487,357 $ 404,958 20.3% Restructuring and related charges and unusual costs of $71.6 million and $4.8 million for Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003, respectively, consist of certain costs that are excluded by management in their evaluation of the results of each operating segment. Fiscal 2004 costs represent the flow through of inventory step up and the amortization of deferred financing costs associated with the Hardy Acquisition of $22.5 million and $11.6 million, respectively, and costs associated with exiting the commodity concentrate product line and the Companys realignment of its business operations in the wine segment, including the write down of concentrate inventory of $16.8 million and restructuring and related charges of $31.2 million, partially offset by the relief from certain excise taxes, duty and other costs incurred in prior years of $10.4 million. Fiscal 2003 costs represent restructuring and related charges associated with the Companys realignment of its business operations in the wine segment. As a result of these costs and the above factors, consolidated operating income increased to $487.4 million for Fiscal 2004 from $405.0 million for Fiscal 2003, an increase of $82.4 million, or 20.3%. GAIN ON CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS The Company entered into a foreign currency collar contract in February 2003 in connection with the Hardy Acquisition to lock in a range for the cost of the acquisition in U.S. dollars. As of February 28, 2003, this derivative instrument had a fair value of $23.1 million. Under SFAS No. 133, a transaction that involves a business combination is not eligible for hedge accounting treatment. As such, the derivative was recorded on the balance sheet at its fair value with the change in the fair value recognized separately on the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income. During the first quarter of fiscal 2004, the gain on change in fair value of the derivative instrument of $1.2 million was recognized separately on the Companys Consolidated Statement of Income. EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF JOINT VENTURES The Companys equity in earnings of joint ventures decreased to $0.5 million in Fiscal 2004 from $12.2 million in Fiscal 2003 due to the acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership of PWP in March 2003 resulting in consolidation of PWPs results of operations since the date of acquisition. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET Interest expense, net of interest income of $3.6 million and $0.8 million for Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003, respectively, increased to $144.7 million for Fiscal 2004 from $105.4 million for Fiscal 2003, an increase of $39.3 million, or 37.3%. The increase resulted from higher average borrowings due to the financing of the Hardy Acquisition, partially offset by a lower average borrowing rate, and $1.7 million of imputed interest expense related to the Hardy Acquisition. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES The Companys effective tax rate for Fiscal 2004 declined to 36.0% from 39.3% for Fiscal 2003 as a result of the Hardy Acquisition, which significantly increased the allocation of income to jurisdictions with lower income tax rates. NET INCOME As a result of the above factors, net income increased to $220.4 million for Fiscal 2004 from $203.3 million for Fiscal 2003, an increase of $17.1 million, or 8.4%. FISCAL 2003 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2002 NET SALES The following table sets forth the net sales (in thousands of dollars) by operating segment of the Company for Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002 Net Sales 2003 2002 %Increase Constellation Wines: Branded wines $ 983,505 $ 963,514 2.1% Wholesale and other 689,794 641,589 7.5% Constellation Wines net sales $ 1,673,299 $ 1,605,103 4.2% Constellation Beers and Spirits: Imported beers $ 776,006 $ 726,953 6.7% Spirits 282,307 274,702 2.8% Constellation Beers and Spirits net sales $ 1,058,313 $ 1,001,655 5.7% Corporate Operations and Other $ $ N/A Consolidated Net Sales $ 2,731,612 $ 2,606,758 4.8% Net sales for Fiscal 2003 increased to $2,731.6 million from $2,606.8 million for Fiscal 2002, an increase of $124.9 million, or 4.8%. This increase resulted primarily from increased sales of imported beer of $49.1 million and the impact of foreign currency changes of $50.7 million in the Constellation Wines segment. Also contributing to the sales growth were increased sales in U.K. wholesale of $28.6 million (on a local currency basis), fine wine sales of $23.8 million and spirits sales of $7.6 million, offset by lower bulk wine, grape juice concentrate sales of $14.7 million, popular and premium branded wine sales of $13.9 million and U.K. branded sales of $9.4 million (on a local currency basis). Constellation Wines Net sales for the Constellation Wines segment for Fiscal 2003 increased to $1,673.3 million from $1,605.1 million for Fiscal 2002, an increase of $68.2 million, or 4.2%. Branded wines sales increased $20.0 million due to increased fine wine sales of $23.8 million and a favorable foreign currency impact of $9.3 million partially offset by lower popular and premium wine sales of $13.9 million. The increase in fine wine sales resulted from an additional four months of sales of the brands acquired in the acquisition of Ravenswood Winery, Inc. ("Ravenswood"), completed in July 2001, of $14.1 million, as well as an increase of $9.7 million due to volume growth in the fine wine business partially offset by higher promotional costs and a shift towards lower priced fine wine brands. Popular and premium wine sales declined $13.9 million on lower volume offset slightly by higher average selling prices. Volumes were negatively impacted as a result of increased promotional spending in the industry, which the Company did not participate in heavily. In this competitive pricing environment, the Company continues to be selective in its promotional activities, focusing instead on growth areas, long term brand building initiatives and increased profitability. Wholesale and other sales increased $48.2 million primarily due to a favorable foreign currency impact of $41.4 million and a $28.6 million local currency increase in U.K. wholesale sales due to the addition of new accounts and increased average delivery sizes, partially offset by lower bulk wine, grape juice concentrate and cider sales of $24.7 million. Constellation Beers and Spirits Net sales for the Constellation Beers and Spirits segment for Fiscal 2003 increased to $1,058.3 million from $1,001.7 million for Fiscal 2002, an increase of $56.7 million, or 5.7%. This increase resulted primarily from a $49.1 million increase in imported beer sales. The growth in imported beer sales was due to a price increase on the Companys Mexican beer portfolio, which took effect in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Spirits sales increased $7.6 million due primarily to increased bulk whiskey sales of $6.4 million, along with a slight increase in branded sales of $1.2 million. GROSS PROFIT The Companys gross profit increased to $760.7 million for Fiscal 2003 from $695.2 million for Fiscal 2002, an increase of $65.6 million, or 9.4%. The Constellation Wines segments gross profit increased $30.8 million due to lower wine costs, the additional four months of sales of the brands acquired in the Ravenswood Acquisition (completed in July 2001), a favorable mix of sales towards higher margin popular and premium wine, and a favorable foreign currency impact. These increases were partially offset by lower gross profit on the segments reduced bulk wine and grape juice concentrate sales. The Constellation Beers and Spirits segments gross profit increased $34.8 million due to increased gross profit on imported beer sales and increased gross profit on spirits sales. The increased gross profit on imported beer sales is primarily due to increased average selling prices in the Companys Mexican beer portfolio and the increased gross profit on the segments spirits business is due to a favorable mix of sales towards higher margin products and lower average spirits costs. As a result of the foregoing, gross profit as a percent of net sales increased to 27.8% for Fiscal 2003 from 26.7% for Fiscal 2002. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $351.0 million for Fiscal 2003 from $355.3 million for Fiscal 2002, a decrease of $4.3 million, or (1.2%). The Company adopted SFAS No. 142 on March 1, 2002, and, accordingly, stopped amortizing goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets. Therefore, the decrease of $4.3 million consists of a decrease of $27.3 million of amortization expense from Fiscal 2002 offset by an increase of $23.0 million. The Constellation Wines segments selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $2.6 million due to lower amortization expense of $19.1 million partially offset by (i) higher selling costs to support the growth in the U.K. wholesale business, (ii) increased selling and advertising costs on certain popular and premium wine brands, and (iii) higher selling, general and administrative expenses to support the growth in the fine wine business. The Constellation Beers and Spirits segments selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $4.4 million due to lower amortization expense of $8.2 million partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses to support the growth in the imported beer portfolio. The Corporate Operations and Other segments selling, general and administrative expenses increased $2.7 million primarily due to increased personnel costs to support the Companys growth. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales decreased to 12.8% for Fiscal 2003 as compared to 13.6% for Fiscal 2002. This decrease was due to the reduced amortization expense noted above partially offset by (i) the percent increase in general and administrative expenses growing at a faster rate than the percent increase in net sales across all segments, and (ii) the percent increase in the Constellation Wines segments U.K. wholesale and U.K. branded wine selling costs being greater than the percent increase in the U.K. wholesale and U.K. branded wine net sales. RESTRUCTURING AND RELATED CHARGES The Company recorded a property, plant and equipment impairment charge of $4.8 million in Fiscal 2003 in connection with the planned closure of two of its production facilities within its Constellation Wines segment in Fiscal 2004. During Fiscal 2004, the Company began the realignment of its business operations within this segment to further improve productivity. This realignment is not expected to have an impact on brand sales. No such charges were incurred in Fiscal 2002. OPERATING INCOME The following table sets forth the operating income (loss) (in thousands of dollars) by operating segment of the Company for Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002 Operating Income (Loss) 2003 2002 %Increase Constellation Wines $ 224,556 $ 191,227 17.4% Constellation Beers and Spirits 217,963 178,805 21.9% Corporate Operations and Other (32,797) (30,141) 8.8% Total Reportable Segments 409,722 339,891 20.5% Restructuring and Related Charges and Unusual Costs (4,764) N/A Consolidated Operating Income . . $ 404,958 $ 339,891 19.1% Restructuring and related charges and unusual costs of $4.8 million for Fiscal 2003 consist of certain costs that are excluded by management in their evaluation of the results of each operating segment. These costs represent restructuring and related charges associated with the Companys realignment of its business operations in the wine segment. As a result of the above factors, operating income increased to $405.0 million for Fiscal 2003 from $339.9 million for Fiscal 2002, an increase of $65.1 million, or 19.1%. Fiscal 2002 operating income for Constellation Wines and Constellation Beers and Spirits included amortization expense of $19.1 million and $8.2 million, respectively. GAIN ON CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS In February 2003, the Company entered into a foreign currency collar contract in connection with the Hardy Acquisition to lock in a range for the cost of the acquisition in U.S. dollars. As of February 28, 2003, this derivative instrument had a fair value of $23.1 million. Under SFAS No. 133, a transaction that involves a business combination is not eligible for hedge accounting treatment. As such, the derivative was recorded on the balance sheet at its fair value with the change in the fair value recognized separately on the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income. EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF JOINT VENTURES The Companys equity in earnings of joint venture increased to $12.2 million in Fiscal 2003 from $1.7 million in Fiscal 2002. Due to the formation of the joint venture in July 2001, there were seven months of earnings in Fiscal 2002 versus twelve months of earnings in Fiscal 2003. In addition, Fiscal 2003 benefited from an additional seven months of earnings due to the joint ventures purchase of certain assets of the Blackstone Winery, including the Blackstone brand and the Codera wine business in Sonoma County, which was completed in October 2001. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET Interest expense, net of interest income of $0.8 million and $1.6 million for Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002, respectively, decreased to $105.4 million for Fiscal 2003 from $114.2 million for Fiscal 2002, a decrease of $8.8 million, or (7.7)%. The decrease resulted from decreases in both the average borrowings for the year and the average interest rate for the year. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES The Companys effective tax rate for Fiscal 2003 declined to 39.3% from 40.0% for Fiscal 2002 as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 142 on March 1, 2002. NET INCOME As a result of the above factors, net income increased to $203.3 million for Fiscal 2003 from $136.4 million for Fiscal 2002, an increase of $66.9 million, or 49.0%. FINANCIAL LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES GENERAL The Companys principal use of cash in its operating activities is for purchasing and carrying inventories and carrying seasonal accounts receivable. The Companys primary source of liquidity has historically been cash flow from operations, except during annual grape harvests when the Company has relied on short term borrowings. In the United States, the annual grape crush normally begins in August and runs through October. In Australia, the annual grape crush normally begins in February and runs through May. The Company generally begins taking delivery of grapes at the beginning of the crush season with payments for such grapes beginning to come due one month later. The Companys short term borrowings to support such purchases generally reach their highest levels one to two months after the crush season has ended. Historically, the Company has used cash flow from operating activities to repay its short term borrowings and fund capital expenditures. The Company will continue to use its short term borrowings to support its working capital requirements. The Company believes that cash provided by operating activities and its financing activities, primarily short term borrowings, will provide adequate resources to satisfy its working capital, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, preferred dividend payment requirements, and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for both its short term and long term capital needs. FISCAL 2004 CASH FLOWS OPERATING ACTIVITIES Net cash provided by operating activities for Fiscal 2004 was $340.3 million, which resulted from $220.4 million of net income, plus $137.9 million of net noncash items charged to the Consolidated Statement of Income, less $18.0 million representing the net change in the Companys operating assets and liabilities. The net non cash items consisted primarily of depreciation of property, plant and equipment, deferred tax provision and amortization of intangible and other assets. The net change in operating assets and liabilities resulted primarily from an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in accounts payable, partially offset by a decrease in inventories and an increase in accrued advertising and promotion. INVESTING ACTIVITIES Net cash used in investing activities for Fiscal 2004 was $1,158.5 million, which resulted primarily from net cash paid of $1,069.5 million for the purchases of businesses and $105.1 million of capital expenditures. FINANCING ACTIVITIES Net cash provided by financing activities for Fiscal 2004 was $745.2 million resulting primarily from proceeds of $1,600.0 million from issuance of long term debt, including $1,060.2 million of long term debt incurred to acquire Hardy, plus net proceeds from the 2003 Equity Offerings (as defined below) of $426.1 million. This amount was partially offset by principal payments of long term debt of $1,282.3 million. FISCAL 2003 CASH FLOWS OPERATING ACTIVITIES Net cash provided by operating activities for Fiscal 2003 was $236.1 million, which resulted from $203.3 million of net income, plus $53.2 million of net noncash items charged to the Consolidated Statement of Income, less $20.4 million representing the net change in the Companys operating assets and liabilities. The net noncash items consisted primarily of depreciation of property, plant and equipment and provision for deferred taxes, partially offset by a gain on changes in fair value of derivative instrument. The net change in operating assets and liabilities resulted primarily from an increase in inventories and a reduction in accrued excise taxes and adverse grape contracts partially offset by increases in accrued income taxes payable and accrued advertising and promotion expenses. INVESTING ACTIVITIES Net cash used in investing activities for Fiscal 2003 was $72.0 million, which resulted primarily from $71.6 million of capital expenditures. FINANCING ACTIVITIES Net cash used in financing activities for Fiscal 2003 was $161.5 million resulting primarily from $151.1 million of principal payments of long term debt and $51.9 million of net repayments of notes payable. These debt payments were partially funded by $28.7 million of proceeds from employee stock option exercises and $10.0 million of proceeds from long term debt which was used for the repayment of debt at one of the Companys Chilean subsidiaries. During June 1998, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of its Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. The repurchase of shares of common stock will be accomplished, from time to time, in managements discretion and depending upon market conditions, through open market or privately negotiated transactions. The Company may finance such repurchases through cash generated from operations or through the senior credit facility. The repurchased shares will become treasury shares. As of May 14, 2004, the Company had purchased a total of 4,075,344 shares of Class A Common Stock at an aggregate cost of $44.9 million, or at an average cost of $11.01 per share. Of this total amount, no shares were repurchased during Fiscal 2004, Fiscal 2003 or Fiscal 2002. DEBT Total debt outstanding as of February 29, 2004, amounted to $2,047.9 million, an increase of $782.4 million from February 28, 2003. The ratio of total debt to total capitalization decreased to 46.3% as of February 29, 2004, from 51.9% as of February 28, 2003. SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY Credit Agreement In connection with the Hardy Acquisition, on January 16, 2003, the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company, JPMorgan Chase Bank, as a lender and administrative agent (the "Administrative Agent"), and certain other lenders entered into a new credit agreement (as subsequently amended and restated as of March 19, 2003, the "March 2003 Credit Agreement"). In October 2003, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the " October Credit Agreement") that (i) refinanced the then outstanding principal balance under the Tranche B Term Loan facility on essentially the same terms as the Tranche B Term Loan facility under the March 2003 Credit Agreement, but at a lower Applicable Rate (as such term is defined in the October Credit Agreement) and (ii) otherwise restated the terms of the March 2003 Credit Agreement, as amended. The October Credit Agreement was further amended during February 2004 (the "Credit Agreement"). The March 2003 Credit Agreement provided for aggregate credit facilities of $1.6 billion consisting of a $400.0 million Tranche A Term Loan facility due in February 2008, an $800.0 million Tranche B Term Loan facility due in November 2008 and a $400.0 million Revolving Credit facility (including an Australian Dollar revolving sub facility of up to A$10.0 million and a sub facility for letters of credit of up to $40.0 million) which expires on February 29, 2008. Proceeds of the March 2003 Credit Agreement were used to pay off the Companys obligations under its prior senior credit facility, to fund a portion of the cash required to pay the former Hardy shareholders and to pay indebtedness outstanding under certain of Hardys credit facilities. The Company uses the remaining availability under the Credit Agreement to fund its working capital needs on an on going basis. The Tranche A Term Loan facility and the Tranche B Term Loan facility were fully drawn on March 27, 2003. As of February 29, 2004, the Company has made $40.0 million of scheduled and required payments on the Tranche A Term Loan facility. In August 2003, the Company paid $100.0 million of the Tranche B Term Loan facility. In October 2003, the Company paid an additional $200.0 million of the Tranche B Term Loan facility. As of February 29, 2004, the required annual repayments of the Tranche A Term Loan and the Tranche B Term Loan are as follows: Tranche A Tranche B Term Loan Term Loan Total (in thousands) 2005 $ 60,000 $ $ 60,000 2006 80,000 54,420 134,420 2007 100,000 54,420 154,420 2008 120,000 119,048 239,048 2009 272,112 272,112 $ 360,000 $ 500,000 $ 860,000 The rate of interest payable, at the Companys option, is a function of LIBOR plus a margin, the federal funds rate plus a margin, or the prime rate plus a margin. The margin is adjustable based upon the Companys Debt Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and, with respect to LIBOR borrowings, ranges between 1.50% and 2.50%. As of February 29, 2004, the LIBOR margin for the Revolving Credit facility and the Tranche A Term Loan facility is 1.75%, while the LIBOR margin on the Tranche B Term Loan facility is 2.00%. The Companys obligations are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the Company ("Guarantors") and the Company is obligated to pledge collateral of (i) 100% of the capital stock of all of the Companys U.S. subsidiaries and (ii) 65% of the voting capital stock of certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company. The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to customary lending covenants including those restricting additional liens, the incurrence of additional indebtedness (including guarantees of indebtedness), the sale of assets, the payment of dividends, transactions with affiliates and the making of certain investments, in each case subject to baskets, exceptions and or thresholds. As a result of the prepayment of the Bridge Loans (as defined below) with the proceeds from the 2003 Equity Offerings (see Note 16), the requirement under certain circumstances for the Company and the Guarantors to pledge certain assets consisting of, among other things, inventory, accounts receivable and trademarks to secure the obligations under the Credit Agreement, ceased to apply. The primary financial covenants require the maintenance of a debt coverage ratio, a senior debt coverage ratio, a fixed charge ratio and an interest coverage ratio. As of February 29, 2004, the Company is in compliance with all of its covenants under its Credit Agreement. As of February 29, 2004, under the Credit Agreement, the Company had outstanding Tranche A Term Loans of $360.0 million bearing a weighted average interest rate of 2.9%, Tranche B Term Loans of $500.0 million bearing a weighted average interest rate of 3.2%, undrawn revolving letters of credit of $18.6 million, and $381.4 million in revolving loans available to be drawn. There were no outstanding revolving loans under the Credit Agreement as of February 29, 2004. Bridge Agreement On January 16, 2003, the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company, JPMorgan Chase Bank, as a lender and Administrative Agent, and certain other lenders (such other lenders, together with the Administrative Agent, are collectively referred to herein as the "Bridge Lenders") entered into a bridge loan agreement which was amended and restated as of March 26, 2003, containing commitments of the Bridge Lenders to make bridge loans (the "Bridge Loans") of up to, in the aggregate, $450.0 million (the "Bridge Agreement"). On April 9, 2003, the Company used $400.0 million of the Bridge Loans to fund a portion of the cash required to pay the former Hardy shareholders. On July 30, 2003, the Company used proceeds from the 2003 Equity Offerings to prepay the $400.0 million Bridge Loans in their entirety. SUBSIDIARY FACILITIES The Company has additional line of credit arrangements available totaling $91.5 million and $44.5 million as of February 29, 2004, and February 28, 2003, respectively. These lines support the borrowing needs of certain of the Companys foreign subsidiary operations. Interest rates and other terms of these borrowings vary from country to country, depending on local market conditions. As of February 29, 2004, and February 28, 2003, amounts outstanding under the subsidiary revolving credit facilities were $1.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively.

EQUITY OFFERINGS During July 2003, the Company completed a public offering of 9,800,000 shares of its Class A Common Stock resulting in net proceeds to the Company, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses, of $261.2 million. In addition, the Company also completed a public offering of 170,500 shares of its 5.75% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock ("Preferred Stock") resulting in net proceeds to the Company, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses, of $164.9 million. The Class A Common Stock offering and the Preferred Stock offering are referred to together as the "2003 Equity Offerings." The majority of the net proceeds from the 2003 Equity Offerings were used to repay the Bridge Loans that were incurred to partially finance the Hardy Acquisition. The remaining proceeds were used to repay term loan borrowings under the March 2003 Credit Agreement. During March 2001, the Company completed a public offering of 8,740,000 shares of its Class A Common Stock, which was held as treasury stock. This resulted in net proceeds to the Company, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses, of $139.4 million. The net proceeds were used to repay revolving loan borrowings under the senior credit facility of which a portion was incurred to partially finance the acquisition of the Turner Road Vintners Assets. During October 2001, the Company sold 645,000 shares of its Class A Common Stock, which was held as treasury stock, in connection with a public offering of Class A Common Stock by stockholders of the Company. The net proceeds to the Company, after deducting underwriting discounts, of $12.1 million were used to repay borrowings under the senior credit facility. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES During Fiscal 2004, the Company incurred $105.1 million for capital expenditures. The Company plans to spend approximately $125.0 million for capital expenditures in Fiscal 2005. In addition, the Company continues to consider the purchase, lease and development of vineyards and may incur additional expenditures for vineyards if opportunities become available. See "Business Sources and Availability of Raw Materials" under Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Management reviews the capital expenditure program periodically and modifies it as required to meet current business needs. EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES The Companys results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by inflation and changing prices. The Company has been able, subject to normal competitive conditions, to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices. There can be no assurances, however, that the Company will continue to be able to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Companys significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Companys consolidated financial statements located in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. However, certain of the Companys accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of the Companys financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by the Companys management; as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. In applying those policies, the Companys management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. Those estimates are based on the Companys historical experience, the Companys observance of trends in the industry, information provided by the Companys customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. On an ongoing basis, the Company reviews its estimates to ensure that they appropriately reflect changes in the Companys business. The Companys critical accounting policies include: Accounting for promotional activities. Sales reflect reductions attributable to consideration given to customers in various customer incentive programs, including pricing discounts on single transactions, volume discounts, promotional and advertising allowances, coupons, and rebates. Certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the cost of those programs. The accrued liability for these programs is determined through analysis of programs offered, historical trends, expectations regarding customer and consumer participation, sales and payment trends, and experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs that had been previously offered. If assumptions included in the Companys estimates were to change or market conditions were to change, then material incremental reductions to revenue could be required, which would have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial statements. Promotional costs were $336.4 million, $231.6 million and $223.9 million for Fiscal 2004, Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002, respectively. Inventory valuation. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, cost being determined on the first in, first out method. The Company assesses the valuation of its inventories and reduces the carrying value of those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of the Companys forecasted usage to their estimated net realizable value. The Company estimates the net realizable value of such inventories based on analyses and assumptions including, but not limited to, historical usage, future demand and market requirements. Reductions to the carrying value of inventories are recorded in cost of goods sold. If the future demand for the Companys products is less favorable than the Companys forecasts, then the value of the inventories may be required to be reduced, which could result in material additional expense to the Company and have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial statements. Accounting for business combinations. The acquisition of businesses is an important element of the Companys strategy. Under the purchase method, the Company is required to record the net assets acquired at the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. The determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the Companys financial statements. For example, the Companys acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets; the value and estimated life of those assets may affect the amount of future period amortization expense for intangible assets with finite lives as well as possible impairment charges that may be incurred. Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Intangible assets with indefinite lives consist primarily of trademarks as well as agency relationships. The Company is required to analyze its goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis as well as when events and circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. Certain factors that may occur and indicate that an impairment exists include, but are not limited to, operating results that are lower than expected and adverse industry or market economic trends. The impairment testing requires management to estimate the fair value of the assets or reporting unit and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. The estimate of fair value of the assets is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows. The estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows supplemented by the market approach. In estimating the fair value, management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as future cash flows, future revenues, future earnings and other factors. The assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with the past performance of each reporting unit and other intangible assets and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans. Such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets. The recording of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial statements. ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS NOT YET ADOPTED In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003) ("FIN No. 46(R)"), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities an interpretation of ARB No. 51", which will replace FASB Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN No. 46"), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," upon its effective date. FIN No. 46(R) retains many of the basic concepts introduced in FIN No. 46; however, it also introduces a new scope exception for certain types of entities that qualify as a business as defined in FIN No. 46(R) and revises the method of calculating expected losses and residual returns for determination of primary beneficiaries, including new guidance for assessing variable interests. The application of the transition requirements of FIN No. 46(R) with regard to special purpose entities and existing variable interest entities did not result in any entities requiring consolidation or any additional disclosures. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of FIN No. 46(R) for its adoption as of May 31, 2004. However, it is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 132 (revised 2003) ("SFAS No. 132(R)"), "Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, and 106." SFAS No. 132(R) supersedes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 132 ("SFAS No. 132"), by revising employers disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. SFAS No. 132(R) requires additional disclosures to those in SFAS No. 132 regarding the assets, obligations, cash flows, and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans. SFAS No. 132(R) also amends Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 28 ("APB Opinion No. 28"), "Interim Financial Reporting," to require additional disclosures for interim periods. The Company has adopted certain of the annual disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 132(R), primarily those related to its U.S. postretirement plan, for the fiscal year ending February 29, 2004. The Company is required to adopt the remaining annual disclosure provisions, primarily those related to its foreign plans, for the fiscal year ending February 28, 2005. The Company is required to adopt the amendment to APB Opinion No. 28 for financial reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning March 1, 2004. In March 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a proposed statement, "Share Based Payment, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 123 and 95." The objective of the proposed statement is to require recognition in an entitys financial statements of the cost of employee services received in exchange for equity instruments issued, and liabilities incurred, to employees in share based payment (or compensation) transactions based on the fair value of the instruments at the grant date. The proposed statement would eliminate the alternative of continuing to account for share based payment arrangements with employees under APB No. 25 and require that the compensation cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in an entitys financial statements. If adopted in its current form, the proposed statement would be effective for awards that are granted, modified, or settled in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2004. Also, if adopted in its current form, the proposed statement could result in a significant charge to the Companys Consolidated Statement of Income for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2006. CAUTIONARY INFORMATION REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This Annual Report on Form 10 K contains "forward looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Companys control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in, or implied by, such forward looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, including the statements under Item 1 "Business" and Item 7 "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" regarding the Companys business strategy, future financial position, prospects, plans and objectives of management, as well as information concerning expected actions of third parties are forward looking statements. When used in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, the words "anticipate," "intend," "expect," and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements, although not all forward looking statements contain such identifying words. All forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. In addition to the risks and uncertainties of ordinary business operations, important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in, or implied, by the Companys forward looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K are as follows: THE COMPANYS INDEBTEDNESS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL HEALTH. The Company has incurred substantial indebtedness to finance its acquisitions and may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to finance further acquisitions or for other purposes. The Companys ability to satisfy its debt obligations outstanding from time to time will depend upon the Companys future operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions, levels of interest rates and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond the Companys control. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the Companys cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet all of its debt service requirements and to fund its capital expenditure requirements. The Companys current and future debt service obligations and covenants could have important consequences. These consequences include, or may include, the following: the Companys ability to obtain financing for future working capital needs or acquisitions or other purposes may be limited; a significant portion of the Companys cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness and dividends on its Series A mandatory convertible preferred stock, thereby reducing funds available for operations, expansion or distributions; the Companys ability to conduct its business could be limited by restrictive covenants; and the Company may be more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions than less leveraged competitors and, thus, may be limited in its ability to withstand competitive pressures. The restrictive covenants and provisions in the Companys senior credit facility and its indentures under which its debt securities are issued include, among others, those restricting additional liens, additional borrowing, the sale of assets, changes of control, the payment of dividends, transactions with affiliates, the making of investments and certain other fundamental changes. The senior credit facility also contains restrictions on acquisitions and certain financial ratio tests including a debt coverage ratio, a senior debt coverage ratio, a fixed charges ratio and an interest coverage ratio. These restrictions could limit the Companys ability to conduct business. A failure to comply with the obligations contained in the senior credit facility, its existing indentures or other loan agreements or indentures entered into in the future could result in an event of default under such agreements, which could require the Company to immediately repay the related debt and also debt under other agreements that may contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions. THE COMPANYS ACQUISITION OR JOINT VENTURE STRATEGIES MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL. The Company has made a number of acquisitions, including the recent acquisitions of Hardy, Ravenswood, the Turner Road Vintners Assets, and the Corus Assets, and anticipates that it may, from time to time, acquire additional businesses, assets or securities of companies that the Company believes would provide a strategic fit with its business. In addition, the Company has entered joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures. Acquired businesses will need to be integrated with the Companys existing operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into its business or product offerings. Acquisitions are also accompanied by risks such as potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business. Acquisitions are subject to risks associated with the difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies, the potential disruption to the Companys business and the diversion of management time and attention. The Company shares control of its existing joint ventures and may not have majority interest or control of future joint ventures, and, therefore, there is the risk that the Companys joint venture partners may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with those of the joint venture or the Company. There is also risk that the Companys joint venture partners may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and that the Company may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. The Companys failure or the failure of an entity in which the Company has a joint venture interest to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. COMPETITION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS. The Company is in a highly competitive industry and the dollar amount and unit volume of its sales could be negatively affected by its inability to maintain or increase prices, changes in geographic or product mix, a general decline in beverage alcohol consumption or the decision of the Companys wholesale customers, retailers or consumers to purchase competitive products instead of the Companys products. Wholesaler, retailer and consumer purchasing decisions are influenced by, among other things, the perceived absolute or relative overall value of the Companys products, including their quality or pricing, compared to competitive products. Unit volume and dollar sales could also be affected by pricing, purchasing, financing, operational, advertising or promotional decisions made by wholesalers, state and provincial agencies, and retailers which could affect their supply of, or consumer demand for, the Companys products. The Company could also experience higher than expected selling, general and administrative expenses if the Company finds it necessary to increase the number of its personnel or advertising or promotional expenditures to maintain its competitive position or for other reasons. AN INCREASE IN EXCISE TAXES OR GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS. In the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and other countries in which the Company operates, the Company is subject to imposition of excise and other taxes on beverage alcohol products in varying amounts which have been subject to change. Significant increases in excise or other taxes on beverage alcohol products could materially and adversely affect the Companys financial condition or results of operations. Recently, many states have considered proposals to increase, and some of these states have increased, state alcohol excise taxes. In addition, the beverage alcohol products industry is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies concerning such matters as licensing, trade and pricing practices, permitted and required labeling, advertising and relations with wholesalers and retailers. Certain federal and state regulations also require warning labels and signage. New or revised regulations or increased licensing fees, requirements or taxes could also have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. THE COMPANY RELIES ON THE PERFORMANCE OF WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTORS, MAJOR RETAILERS AND CHAINS FOR THE SUCCESS OF ITS BUSINESS. In the United States, the Company sells its products principally to wholesalers for resale to retail outlets including grocery stores, package liquor stores, club and discount stores and restaurants. In the United Kingdom and Australia, the Company sells its products principally to wholesalers and directly to major retailers and chains. The replacement or poor performance of the Companys major wholesalers, retailers or chains, or the Companys inability to collect accounts receivable from the Companys major wholesalers, retailers or chains could materially and adversely affect the Companys results of operations and financial condition. Distribution channels for beverage alcohol products have been consolidating in recent years. In addition, wholesalers and retailers of the Companys products offer products which compete directly with the Companys products for retail shelf space and consumer purchases. Accordingly, there is a risk that wholesalers or retailers may give higher priority to products of the Companys competitors. In the future, the Companys wholesalers and retailers may not continue to purchase the Companys products or provide the Companys products with adequate levels of promotional support. THE COMPANYS BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A DECLINE IN THE CONSUMPTION OF PRODUCTS THE COMPANY SELLS. Although since 1995 there have been modest increases in consumption of beverage alcohol in most of the Companys product categories, there have been periods in the past in which there were substantial declines in the overall per capita consumption of beverage alcohol products in the United States and other markets in which the Company participates. A limited or general decline in consumption in one or more of the Companys product categories could occur in the future due to a variety of factors, including: a general decline in economic conditions; increased concern about the health consequences of consuming beverage alcohol products and about drinking and driving; a trend toward a healthier diet including lighter, lower calorie beverages such as diet soft drinks, juices and water products; increased activity of anti alcohol consumer groups; and increased federal, state or foreign excise or other taxes on beverage alcohol products. THE COMPANY GENERALLY PURCHASES RAW MATERIALS UNDER SHORT TERM SUPPLY CONTRACTS AND THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL PRICE FLUCTUATIONS FOR GRAPES AND GRAPE RELATED MATERIALS; AND THE COMPANY HAS A LIMITED GROUP OF SUPPLIERS OF GLASS BOTTLES. The Companys business is heavily dependent upon raw materials, such as grapes, grape juice concentrate, grains, alcohol and packaging materials from third party suppliers. The Company could experience raw material supply, production or shipment difficulties that could adversely affect the Companys ability to supply goods to its customers. The Company is also directly affected by increases in the costs of raw materials. In the past, the Company has experienced dramatic increases in the cost of grapes. Although the Company believes it has adequate sources of grape supplies, in the event demand for certain wine products exceeds expectations, the Company could experience shortages. One of the Companys largest components of cost of goods sold is that of glass bottles, which, in the United States and Australia, have only a small number of producers. Currently, substantially all of the Companys glass container requirements for its United States operations are supplied by one producer and most of the Companys glass container requirements for its Australian operations are supplied by another producer. The inability of any of the Companys glass bottle suppliers to satisfy its requirements could adversely affect the Companys business. THE COMPANYS GLOBAL OPERATIONS SUBJECT IT TO RISKS RELATED TO CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS AND GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTY WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS. The Company has operations in different countries throughout the world and, therefore, is subject to the risks associated with currency fluctuations. Subsequent to the Hardy Acquisition, the Companys exposure to foreign currency risk has increased significantly as a result of having additional international operations in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The Company could experience changes in its ability to obtain or hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates. The Company could also be affected by nationalizations or unstable governments or legal systems or intergovernmental disputes. These currency, economic and political uncertainties may have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, especially to the extent these matters, or the decisions, policies or economic strength of the Companys suppliers, affect the Companys global operations. THE COMPANY HAS A MATERIAL AMOUNT OF GOODWILL, AND IF THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO WRITE DOWN GOODWILL, IT WOULD REDUCE THE COMPANYS NET INCOME, WHICH IN TURN COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. As of February 29, 2004, goodwill represented approximately $1,540.6 million, or 27.7% of the Companys total assets. Goodwill is the amount by which the costs of an acquisition accounted for using the purchase method exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired. The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142 ("SFAS No. 142"), "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," in its entirety, on March 1, 2002. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill is no longer amortized, but instead is subject to a periodic impairment evaluation based on the fair value of the reporting unit. Reductions in the Companys net income caused by a write down of goodwill could materially and adversely affect the Companys results of operations. THE TERMINATION OR NON RENEWAL OF IMPORTED BEER DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS. All of the Companys imported beer products are marketed and sold pursuant to exclusive distribution agreements with the suppliers of these products and are subject to renewal from time to time. The Companys agreement to distribute Corona Extra and its other Mexican beer brands in 25 primarily western U.S. states expires in December 2006 and, subject to compliance with certain performance criteria, continued retention of certain personnel and other terms of the agreement, will be automatically renewed for additional terms of five years. Changes in control of the Company or its subsidiaries involved in importing the Mexican beer brands, or changes in the chief executive officer of such subsidiaries, may be a basis for the supplier, unless it consents to such changes, to terminate the agreement. The suppliers consent to such changes may not be unreasonably withheld. Prior to their expiration, all of the Companys imported beer distribution agreements may be terminated if the Company fails to meet certain performance criteria. The Company believes that it is currently in compliance with all of its material imported beer distribution agreements. From time to time the Company has failed, and may in the future fail, to satisfy certain performance criteria in the Companys distribution agreements. It is possible that the Companys beer distribution agreements may not be renewed or may be terminated prior to expiration. THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE THREE FISCAL YEARS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2002, WERE AUDITED BY ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP. The Companys consolidated financial statements for the three fiscal years ended February 28, 2002, were audited by Arthur Andersen LLP, independent public accountants. On August 31, 2002, Arthur Andersen LLP ceased to practice before the SEC. Therefore, Arthur Andersen LLP did not participate in the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, did not reissue its audit report with respect to the financial statements included in this Form 10 K, and did not consent to the inclusion of a copy of its previously issued audit report in this Form 10 K. As a result, holders of the Companys securities may have no effective remedy against Arthur Andersen LLP in connection with a material misstatement or omission in the financial statements to which its audit report relates. In addition, even if such holders were able to assert such a claim, because it has ceased operations, Arthur Andersen LLP may fail or otherwise have insufficient assets to satisfy claims made by holders of the Companys securities that might arise under federal securities laws or otherwise with respect to the audit report of Arthur Andersen LLP. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company, as a result of its global operating and financing activities, is exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. To manage the volatility relating to these risks, the Company periodically enters into derivative transactions including foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements. The Company uses derivative instruments solely to reduce the financial impact of these risks and does not use derivative instruments for trading purposes. Foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options are used to hedge existing foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, forecasted foreign currency denominated sales both to third parties as well as intercompany sales, and intercompany principal and interest payments. As of February 29, 2004, the Company had exposures to foreign currency risk primarily related to the Australian Dollar, Euro, New Zealand Dollar, British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar and Mexican Peso. As of February 29, 2004, and February 28, 2003, the Company had outstanding derivative contracts with a notional value of $735.8 million and $11.6 million, respectively. Using a sensitivity analysis based on estimated fair value of open contracts using forward rates, if the U.S. dollar had been 10% weaker as of February 29, 2004, and February 28, 2003, the fair value of open foreign exchange contracts would have been increased by $6.8 million and $2.4 million, respectively. Losses or gains from the revaluation or settlement of the related underlying positions would substantially offset such gains or losses. The fair value of fixed rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The estimated fair value of the Companys total fixed rate debt, including current maturities, was $1,274.8 million and $1,138.3 million as of February 29, 2004, and February 28, 2003, respectively. A hypothetical 1% increase from prevailing interest rates as of February 29, 2004, and February 28, 2003, would have resulted in a decrease in fair value of fixed interest rate long term debt by $52.9 million and $53.1 million, respectively. In addition to the $1.3 billion fair value of fixed rate debt outstanding, the Company also had variable rate debt outstanding (primarily LIBOR based) as of February 29, 2004, and February 28, 2003, of $860.0 million and $147.4 million, respectively. A hypothetical 1% increase from prevailing interest rates as of February 29, 2004, and February 28, 2003, would result in an increase in cash required for interest payments on variable interest rate debt during the next five fiscal years as follows: February 29, February 28, 2004 2003 2004 $7.4 million $1.1 million 2005 $8.3 million $0.3 million 2006 $7.3 million $ 2007 $5.9 million $ 2008 $3.9 million $ 2009 $1.4 million $ The Company has on occasion entered into interest rate swap agreements to reduce its exposure to interest rate changes relative to its variable rate debt. As of February 29, 2004, and February 28, 2003, the Company had no interest rate swap agreements outstanding.
