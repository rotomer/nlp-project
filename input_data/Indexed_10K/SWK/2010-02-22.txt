BUSINESS OVERVIEW Business Segments The Company is a diversified worldwide supplier of tools and engineered solutions for professional, industrial, construction, and do it yourself (DIY) use, as well as engineered and security solutions for industrial and commercial applications. Its operations are classified into three business segments: Security, Industrial and Construction DIY (CDIY). The Security segment is a provider of access and security solutions primarily for retailers, educational, financial and healthcare institutions, as well as commercial, governmental and industrial customers. The Company provides an extensive suite of mechanical and electronic security products and systems, and a variety of security services. These include security integration systems, software, related installation, maintenance, monitoring services, automatic doors, door closers, exit devices, healthcare storage and supply chain solutions, patient protection products, hardware (including hinges, gate hardware, cabinet pulls, hooks, braces and shelf brackets) and locking mechanisms. Security products are sold primarily on a direct sales basis and in certain instances, through third party distributors. The Industrial segment manufactures and markets: professional industrial and automotive mechanics tools and storage systems; assembly tools and systems; plumbing, heating and air conditioning tools; hydraulic tools and accessories; and specialty tools. These products are sold to industrial customers and distributed primarily through third party distributors as well as direct sales forces. The CDIY segment manufactures and markets hand tools, consumer mechanics tools, storage systems, pneumatic tools and fastener products which are principally utilized in construction and do it yourself projects. These products are sold primarily to professional end users, distributors, as well as consumers, and are distributed mainly through retailers (including home centers, mass merchants, hardware stores, and retail lumber yards). Pending Black Decker Merger On November 2, 2009, the Company and Black Decker announced that their Boards of Directors unanimously approved a definitive merger agreement under which Stanley and Black Decker will combine, under the name Stanley Black Decker, in an all stock transaction. Under the terms of the agreement each outstanding share of Black Decker will be converted into a fixed ratio of 1.275 shares of the Companys common stock. Based on the closing price of the Companys common stock on January 27, 2010, the consideration to be received by Black Decker shareholders in the merger has a value of approximately $66.90 per Black Decker share, or $4.2 billion in the aggregate. The final consideration to be received by Black Decker shareholders will be measured at the closing date of the merger using the market price of the Companys common stock at that time. Upon closing, it is expected that the Companys shareholders will own approximately 50.5% of the equity of the combined company and Black Decker shareholders will own approximately 49.5%. The terms of the proposed combination and other information about both companies are included in the Form S 4 registration statement and proxy declared effective February 3, 2010. 17 Table of Contents While the U.S. anti trust review is complete, the closing of the transaction is subject to other customary closing conditions, including foreign regulatory approvals and the approval of Stanley and Black Decker shareholders who will vote on the merger proposal in special meetings to be held on March 12, 2010. Closing of the transaction is expected to occur on March 12, 2010. Management believes the pending Black Decker merger is a transformative opportunity to bring together two highly complementary companies, with iconic brands and rich histories, yet with virtually no overlap. The merger would enable a comprehensive global offering in both hand and power tools, among other product offerings. Management believes the value unlocked by the anticipated $350 million of annual cost synergies, expected to be achieved within three years, will help fuel future growth and cement global cost leadership. Strategic Objectives For several years, the Company has pursued a diversification strategy to enable profitable growth. The strategy involves industry, geographic and customer diversification, as exemplified by the expansion of security solution product offerings, the growing proportion of sales outside the U.S., and the reduction of the Companys dependence on sales to U.S. home centers and mass merchants. In addition, the Company has indicated a desire to be a consolidator of the Tool Industry. Sales outside the U.S. represented 42% of the total in 2009, up from 29% in 2002. Sales to U.S. home centers and mass merchants have declined from a high point of approximately 40% in 2002 to approximately 15% in 2009. Execution of this strategy has entailed approximately $2.8 billion of acquisitions since the beginning of 2002, several divestitures, and increased brand investments. Over the past several years, the Company has generated strong free cash flow and received substantial proceeds from divestitures that enabled a transformation of the business portfolio. The Companys long term capital allocation objectives pertaining to the deployment of free cash flow after meeting its debt service obligations are: Target strong investment grade credit rating Invest approximately 2/3 in acquisitions and growth Return approximately 1/3 to shareowners, split approximately equally between the long standing quarterly common stock dividend and share buybacks. The Company remains committed to continued prudent dividend growth. The Company strives to operate in markets where the brand is meaningful, the value proposition is definable, and sustainable through innovation, and global cost leadership is achievable. The long term capital allocation strategy with respect to growth is focused on three strong existing platforms: convergent security, mechanical security, and industrial and automotive tools. The Company plans to expand these existing platforms through both organic growth and international acquisitions. Management intends to be a consolidator in the tool industry and to increase its relative weighting in emerging markets, objectives which are both well met by the pending Black Decker merger. The merger will also round out the mechanical security product offerings, and brings with it another strong growth platform in engineered fastening. Additionally, the Company has begun to develop two emerging growth platforms, healthcare and infrastructure. Significant areas of tactical emphasis related to execution of the Companys diversification strategy, as well as events impacting the Companys financial performance in 2009 and 2008, are discussed below. Continued Growth in the Security Business During 2009, the Company further advanced its strategy of becoming a global market leader in the commercial security industry. Annual revenues of the Security segment have grown to $1.560 billion, or 42% of 2009 sales, up from $216 million, or 10% of 2001 sales (the year the security expansion strategy was launched). Key recent events pertaining to the growth of this segment include the following: Management completed $24 million of small bolt on acquisitions during 2009, as capital was allocated more toward debt reduction in 2009 than in recent years. The security bolt ons acquired have further expanded the Companys U.S. security footprint. On July 18, 2008, the Company completed the acquisitions of Sonitrol Corporation (Sonitrol), for $282 million in cash, and Xmark Corporation (Xmark), for $47 million in cash. Sonitrol, with annual revenue totaling approximately $110 million, provides security monitoring services, access control and fire detection systems to commercial customers in North America. Sonitrol complements the product offering of the pre existing security integration and monitoring businesses, including HSM acquired in early 2007. Xmark, headquartered in Canada, markets and sells radio frequency identification (RFID) based systems used to identify, locate and protect people and assets. Xmark, with annual revenues exceeding $30 million, enhances the Companys personal security business. 18 Table of Contents On October 1, 2008, the Company completed the acquisition of Gnrale de Protection (GdP) for $169 million in cash. GdP, headquartered in Vitrolles, France, is a leading provider of audio and video security monitoring services, primarily for small and mid sized businesses located in France and Belgium. GdP, with approximately $90 million in annual revenues, represents Stanleys first significant expansion of its electronic security platform in continental Europe. Several other smaller acquisitions were completed in 2008 for a total purchase price of $68 million including Scan Modul, a European engineered healthcare storage business, access technologies distributors, a mechanical lock business, and security monitoring businesses. The acquisitions complement the existing Security segment product offerings, increase its scale and strengthen the value proposition offered to customers as industry dynamics favor multi solution providers that offer one stop shopping. The Sonitrol integration into HSM is essentially complete with the business sharing the same information technology platform; duplicative field offices and a monitoring center have been closed. The reverse integration of the Companys pre existing systems integration business into HSM is also complete, which contributed to the continuing improvement in the segment profit rate to 19.7% in 2009, up from 17.9% in 2008. Drive Further Profitable Growth in Branded Tools and Storage While diversifying the business portfolio through expansion in the security platforms is important, management recognizes that the branded tool and storage product offerings in the CDIY and Industrial segment businesses are important foundations of the Company that provide strong cash flow generation and growth prospects. Management is committed to growing these businesses through innovative product development, brand support, an increased weighting in emerging markets, and relentless focus on global cost competitiveness to foster vitality over the long term. Acquisition related growth will also be pursued where appropriate. The previously discussed pending Black Decker merger clearly is an indicator of the Companys commitment to the strategic objective. Continue to Invest in the Stanley Brand Stanley has a strong portfolio of brands associated with high quality products including Stanley, Facom, Mac, Proto , Vidmar , Bostitch and Fatmax . The Stanley brand is recognized as one of the worlds great brands and is one of the Companys most valuable assets. Brand support spending has averaged approximately $21 million annually since 2005, up sharply from the preceding years. This sustained brand support has yielded a steady improvement across the spectrum of brand awareness measures, notably a climb in unaided Stanley hand tool brand awareness from 27% in 2005 to 48% in 2009. Stanley had prominent signage at 11 major league baseball stadiums throughout 2009 and is continuing its program in the coming season. The Company is also maintaining long standing NASCAR racing sponsorships which will entail brand exposure over 38 race weekends in 2010. Stanley recently entered a ten year alliance agreement with the Walt Disney World Resort whereby Stanley logos are displayed on construction walls throughout the theme parks and Stanley, Mac, Proto , and Vidmar brand logos and or products are featured in various attractions where they will be seen by millions of visitors each year. Additionally, Stanley is The Official Tool Provider of the Walt Disney World Resort. In 2009 the Company also began advertising in the English Premier League which is the number one soccer league in the world, watched weekly by 650 million people around the world. The Company will continue to allocate its brand and advertising spend wisely, primarily to the outdoor marketing campaigns described above that foster television exposure, along with various print advertisements, generating more than 25 billion brand impressions annually. Continuous Improvement from the Stanley Fulfillment System The Company continued to practice the operating disciplines encompassed by the Stanley Fulfillment System (SFS). SFS employs continuous improvement techniques to streamline operations and drive efficiency throughout the supply chain. SFS has four primary elements that work in concert: sales and operations planning (SOP), common system platforms, Transformational Lean, and complexity reduction. SOP focuses on keeping supply in sync with demand for products, to minimize inventory while maximizing customer fill rates. Common systems entail standardization of processes and IT platforms to provide scalability that facilitates efficiency and rapid acquisition integrations. Transformational Lean combines traditional supply chain and manufacturing lean with back office functions to enable transformation of business models to drive competitive advantage. Complexity reduction focuses on standardizing processes and eradicating complexity in all 19 Table of Contents operational aspects, except where customers gain value and are willing to pay for customized offerings. Other benefits of SFS include reductions in lead times, rapid realization of synergies during acquisition integrations, and focus on employee safety. SFS disciplines helped to mitigate the substantial impact of material and energy price inflation that was experienced in recent years. It was instrumental in the reduction of working capital during 2009 as evidenced by the 34% improvement in working capital turns from 5.9 at year end 2008 to 7.9 at year end 2009. In 2010 and beyond, the Company plans to further leverage SFS to generate ongoing improvements in working capital turns, cycle times, complexity reduction and customer service levels. Certain Items Impacting Earnings Aside from the strategic commentary above, other matters having a significant impact on the Companys results in 2009 and / or 2008 were inflation, currency exchange rate fluctuations, costs associated with the Black Decker merger, and debt extinguishment gains. In addition, the weak economic conditions necessitated cost reduction actions in 2009 and 2008. While the Company experienced deflation in 2009, inflation (primarily commodity and freight) amounted to approximately $140 million in 2008 and $67 million in 2007. During this period more than two thirds of the cost increase was recovered through customer pricing actions. Inflationary trends have resumed somewhat, but the effect of inflation net of customer pricing actions is projected to have almost no impact in 2010 if commodity prices do not increase significantly from year end 2009 levels. The fluctuation of foreign currencies impacts the translation of foreign currency denominated operating results into U.S. dollars. Foreign currency translation contributed an estimated unfavorable impact of $0.04 of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2009, and a favorable impact of $0.09 and $0.18 in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar may have a significant impact, either positive or negative, on future earnings. Refer to the Market Risk section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis (MDA) for further discussion. In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company incurred $0.22 per diluted share in charges primarily related to the transaction and integration planning costs associated with the pending Black Decker merger. In 2009 the Company realized a $0.34 per diluted share gain on debt extinguishment as compared with an $0.08 per diluted share gain in 2008. The Company took decisive action to right size its cost structure in response to slowing demand (unit volume decreased 20% in 2009) due to the recessionary environment. Restructuring, asset impairment and related pre tax charges totaled $45 million and $92 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Employee headcount was reduced by approximately 3,000 as a result of restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2008 and through year end 2009. The total 2009 cost savings from the various actions taken were approximately $265 million, pre tax, of which approximately $150 million pertained to selling, general and administrative functions. Management believes the cost reduction and other strategic actions taken were judicious and position Stanley well to deliver favorable operating leverage as demand recovers. Outlook for 2010 This outlook discussion is intended to provide broad insight into the Companys near term earnings prospects, and not to discuss the various factors affecting such projections. Accordingly, the purpose is to clarify that 2010 diluted earnings per share are projected to be higher than 2009, and that 2010 free cash flow (as defined in the Financial Condition section of this MDA) is projected to be lower than 2009 (working capital improvement in 2010 expected to be modest). On a stand alone basis (i.e. excluding all impacts from the Black Decker merger), management expects 2010 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.00 $3.25, and 2010 free cash flow in the range of $300 to $350 million. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Below is a summary of the Companys operating results at the consolidated level, followed by an overview of business segment performance. The terms organic and core are utilized to describe results aside from the impact of acquisitions during their initial 12 months of ownership. This ensures appropriate comparability to operating results of prior periods. 20 Table of Contents Net Sales: Net sales from continuing operations were $3.737 billion in 2009, as compared to $4.426 billion in 2008, a 16% decrease. Price increases provided a 2% sales benefit in 2009, which was offset by 2% from unfavorable foreign currency translation in all regions, with the largest impact in Europe. Acquisitions within the Security segment, primarily the carryover effect from the 2008 Sonitrol, GdP and Scan Modul acquisitions, contributed a 4% increase in net sales. Organic unit volume declined 20% reflecting weak global economic conditions. Geographically, the 2009 volume decrease was most severe in Europe at 24%, as compared with 18% in the Americas and 11% in the less significant Asian region. The Industrial and CDIY segments, with their high European content, experienced 31% and 21% unit volume declines, respectively, while the Security segment had the best performance with only an 8% drop in organic volume. Aside from reduced end user demand, the Industrial segment was adversely affected by inventory de stocking throughout the supply chain which abated by the end of the fourth quarter. The consolidated organic sales unit volume decline was 19% in the first quarter of 2009, deteriorated to 24% in the second quarter, and improved sequentially to 20% in the third quarter and again to 16% in the fourth quarter. The sequential percentage improvements in the 2009 fiscal quarters partly relate to easier comparisons to 2008, which had a challenging second half when the recession deepened, but also reflect some encouraging macro economic trends. The CDIY segment is most affected by the residential construction market, which appears to have stabilized, as well as consumer confidence which has improved in the U.S. and Europe in the second half of 2009. Industrial production worldwide is up and management expects that will ultimately have a positive impact on our Industrial segment. There is a continued slowdown in commercial construction, particularly in the U.S., which is affecting the Security segment. Management is focusing on education, healthcare and other verticals in its efforts to mitigate the commercial construction impact on the Security segment. Management remains cautious moving forward into 2010 and expects modestly positive sales growth from 2009 levels, aside from acquisitions. The Company will continue to focus on innovative new product development and marketing as key sales drivers in its efforts to gain market share in this difficult economic environment. Net sales from continuing operations were $4.426 billion in 2008, as compared to $4.360 billion in 2007, a 2% increase. As a result of significant commodity inflation, the Company increased pricing on its products and services which provided a 3% sales benefit in 2008. Sales growth related to acquisitions, principally from Sonitrol, GdP and other small Security segment acquisitions, contributed nearly 4% in higher sales. Organic unit volume decreased 6%, while favorable foreign currency translation in all regions increased sales 1% versus the prior year. The organic unit volume decline reflects deteriorating economic conditions which spread from the U.S. to other regions in the second half of 2008. Sequentially, organic unit volume was down 4% for the first half of 2008, associated with the contraction in the U.S. residential construction market, and declined 7% and 10% in the third and fourth quarters, respectively. The CDIY segment unit volume was most affected by the economic downturn. In the Industrial segment, the U.S. based, automotive related businesses suffered sharp declines, which were partially offset by strength in industrial storage. Aside from the hardware business, which had lower sales pertaining to the loss of a major customer in 2007, the Security segment had positive organic sales volume for the year reflecting solid demand in its diversified end markets. Gross Profit: The Company reported gross profit from continuing operations of $1.508 billion, or 40% of net sales, in 2009, compared to $1.671 billion, or 38% of net sales, in 2008. Acquisitions within the Security segment contributed $100 million of gross profit in 2009. Core gross profit for 2009 was $1.408 billion, down $186 million from the prior year due to the previously discussed sales volume pressures pertaining to broad economic weakness, and to a much smaller extent unfavorable foreign currency translation. The 40% core gross margin rate represents a record rate for the Company, up nearly 200 basis points versus the prior year. Several factors enabled this strong performance with respect to the gross margin rate, including the carryover effect of customer pricing increases implemented to help recover the significant inflation experienced in 2008. Inflation abated in 2009 such that lower commodity costs offset the gross margin rate impact of cost under absorption associated with lower volume. Tight operational management, reflecting the disciplines of the previously discussed Stanley Fulfillment System, enabled substantial benefits from productivity projects and the execution of cost reduction actions taken in response to slower demand. The gross margin rate was further bolstered by improved sales mix associated with the Security segment. The Company reported gross profit from continuing operations of $1.671 billion, or 38% of net sales, in 2008, compared to $1.653 billion, or 38% of net sales, in 2007. The acquired businesses increased gross profit by $77 million and were modestly accretive to the gross margin rate. Core gross profit for 2008 was $1.594 billion, or 37% of net sales, down $59 million, or 60 basis points, from the prior year. The Security segment achieved gross profit expansion associated with the higher monitoring services sales mix emanating from the reverse integration of the legacy security integration business into HSM. However, this was more than offset by gross profit declines in the CDIY and Industrial segments reflecting sales volume pressures. Aggregate pricing and productivity actions in 2008 largely offset $140 million of material, energy and wage cost inflation. 21 Table of Contents SGA Expense: Selling, general and administrative expenses, inclusive of the provision for doubtful accounts (SGA), were $1.028 billion, or 27.5% of net sales, in 2009 as compared with $1.108 billion, or 25.0% of net sales in 2008. Aside from acquisitions, SGA was $142 million lower than 2008. The decrease in SGA pertains to headcount reductions and various cost containment actions such as temporarily suspending certain U.S. retirement benefits in 2009 and sharply curtailing travel and other discretionary spending. There was also a reduction in variable selling and other costs, as well as favorable foreign currency translation. Partially offsetting these decreases was $22 million of increased spending to expand the convergent security business sales force and various brand awareness advertising campaigns, and $5 million for Black Decker integration planning. Corporate overhead, which is not allocated to the business segments, amounted to $71 million in 2009, $60 million in 2008 and $62 million in 2007. The increase in 2009 expense mainly pertains to mark to market accounting on unfunded benefit plans where the liability due to participants increased from the higher Stanley common stock price and broader market recovery relative to year end 2008. SGA was $1.108 billion, or 25% of net sales, in 2008 as compared with $1.038 billion, or 24% of net sales in 2007. Acquired companies contributed $46 million of the increase. The remaining $24 million increase is largely attributable to foreign exchange impact, higher bad debt expense, and strategic investments including those to foster growth in emerging markets, partially offset by benefits from the cost reduction initiatives previously mentioned. Distribution center costs (i.e. warehousing and fulfillment facility and associated labor costs) are classified within SGA. This classification may differ from other companies who may report such expenses within cost of sales. Due to diversity in practice, to the extent the classification of these distribution costs differs from other companies, the Companys gross margins may not be comparable. Such distribution costs classified in SGA amounted to $102 million, $122 million and $129 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Interest and Other net: Net interest expense from continuing operations in 2009 was $61 million, compared to $83 million in 2008 and $88 million in 2007. The decline in 2009 relates to reduced short term borrowing levels along with sharply lower applicable interest rates. Additionally, the favorable effects of fixed to floating interest rate swaps, coupled with the reduction in interest expense from the early retirement of $137 million of junior subordinated debt securities, more than offset the increased interest expense from the September 2008 $250 million debt issuance. The decrease in 2008 versus 2007 net interest expense is primarily due to lower applicable interest rates on commercial paper borrowings in 2008. The remainder of the decrease predominantly relates to repayment of $150 million of debt that matured in November 2007, partially offset by interest expense on the $250 million of term debt issued in September 2008. Other net from continuing operations totaled $139 million of expense in 2009 compared to $112 million of expense in 2008. The increase is related to higher intangible asset amortization expense, mainly associated with the 2008 Sonitrol and GdP acquisitions. Additionally, the Company incurred $20 million in acquisition deal costs, primarily for Black Decker, which are required to be expensed rather than capitalized in goodwill under new accounting rules that became effective in January 2009. Other net from continuing operations amounted to $112 million of expense in 2008 compared to $85 million of expense in 2007. The increase pertained primarily to higher intangible asset amortization expense due to acquisitions, primarily Sonitrol and GdP, as well as currency losses. Gain on Debt Extinguishment: In May 2009, the Company repurchased $103 million of its junior subordinated debt securities for $59 million in cash and recognized a $44 million pre tax gain on extinguishment. In October 2008, $34 million of these securities were repurchased for $25 million in cash resulting in a $9 million pre tax gain thereon. The remaining principal obligation on these debt securities at January 2, 2010 is $313 million. Income Taxes: The Companys effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 19% in 2009, compared to 25% in both 2008 and 2007. The lower effective tax rate in 2009 primarily relates to benefits realized upon resolution of tax audits which are not expected to re occur to the same extent in future periods. The effective income tax rate may vary in future periods based on the distribution of domestic and foreign earnings or changes in tax law in the jurisdictions where the Company operates, among other factors. Discontinued Operations: The $3 million net loss from discontinued operations in 2009 is associated with the wind down of one small divestiture and purchase price adjustments for CST/berger and the other small businesses divested in 2008. The $88 million of net earnings from discontinued operations in 2008 is attributable to the $84 million net gain from the sale of the CST/berger business along with three other small businesses divested in 2008, and also reflects the operating results of these businesses through the dates of disposition. The $11 million of net earnings from discontinued operations reported in 2007 reflects the operating results of CST/berger and the aforementioned other minor businesses. 22 Table of Contents Business Segment Results The Companys reportable segments are aggregations of businesses that have similar products, services and end markets, among other factors. The Company utilizes segment profit (which is defined as net sales minus cost of sales, and SGA aside from corporate overhead expense), and segment profit as a percentage of net sales to assess the profitability of each segment. Segment profit excludes the corporate overhead expense element of SGA, other net (inclusive of intangible asset amortization expense), restructuring and asset impairments, interest income, interest expense, and income tax expense. Corporate overhead is comprised of world headquarters facility expense, cost for the executive management team and the expense pertaining to certain centralized functions that benefit the entire Company but are not directly attributable to the businesses, such as legal and corporate finance functions. Refer to Note O, Restructuring and Asset Impairments, and Note F, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the amount of restructuring charges and asset impairments, and intangibles amortization expense, respectively, attributable to each segment. As discussed previously, the Companys operations are classified into three business segments: Security, Industrial, and Construction and Do It Yourself (CDIY). Security: (Millions of Dollars) 2009 2008 2007 Net sales from continuing operations $ 1,560 $ 1,497 $ 1,400 Segment profit from continuing operations $ 307 $ 269 $ 240 % of Net sales 19.7 % 17.9 % 17.1 % Security segment sales increased 4% in 2009 reflecting a 12% contribution from acquisitions, mainly Sonitrol (acquired in July 2008) and GdP (acquired in October 2008). Price provided a 2% sales benefit which was offset by nearly 2% of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Organic sales volume decreased 8% as the segment was affected by the contraction in U.S. commercial construction and other capital spending delays associated with weak economic conditions. Mechanical access had somewhat steeper volume declines than convergent security, but was aided by stabilization in the residential hardware markets and a hardware products roll out at a major North American retailer in the second half of the year. Additionally, cross selling of mechanical products to convergent customers, retention of national account customers and select new product introductions helped alleviate mechanical access sales volume pressures. Lower organic volume in convergent (electronic) security pertained primarily to weakness in system installations, although there were some signs of improvement with national accounts late in the year. As a result there was a favorable mix shift in convergent security and the overall segment to higher margin recurring monthly service revenue (including security monitoring and maintenance) which grew organically in a high single digit percentage range. This improved sales mix shift in the segment is partially attributable to the recent expansion of the core commercial account sales force as well as a strategic emphasis on recurring service revenue and away from certain installation only jobs. The increase in the segment profit amount was attributable to acquisitions, while the sustainment of organic profit at the prior year level is notable considering the headwinds from lower sales. The robust 180 basis point segment profit rate expansion was enabled by the ongoing successful integration of accretive acquisitions, the previously mentioned mix shift to higher margin recurring monthly service revenues, the benefits of customer pricing and proactive cost reductions. Security segment sales increased 7% in 2008 primarily driven by acquisitions, notably Sonitrol and GdP, which contributed 9%. Customer price increases amounted to 3%, while foreign currency and organic volume declined 1% and 4%, respectively. The hardware business posted significant volume declines associated with the loss of a major customer in late 2007. Aside from hardware, the Security segment had an increase in organic volume reflecting solid demand from its well diversified customer base and associated recurring monthly revenues from service contracts for security monitoring and system maintenance. The access technologies and mechanical lock businesses delivered organic sales growth pertaining to modest volume increases and disciplined recovery of inflation through customer pricing actions. The reverse integration of the U.S. based legacy security integration business as well as the integration of the July 2008 Sonitrol acquisition into HSM provided cost synergies and fostered an 80 basis point expansion of the segment profit rate. The segment profit improvement was also attributable to strong execution of productivity projects, partially offset by the impact of the previously discussed hardware business sales volume decline. Industrial: (Millions of Dollars) 2009 2008 2007 Net sales from continuing operations $ 882 $ 1,274 $ 1,246 Segment profit from continuing operations $ 89 $ 164 $ 183 % of Net sales 10.1 % 12.9 % 14.7 % 23 Table of Contents Industrial segment net sales decreased 31% in 2009 compared with 2008. Price provided a 2% benefit which was offset by 2% of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Unit volume fell 31%, about evenly in the Americas and Europe which was partially offset by growth in the Companys relatively less significant Asian region. Industrial channels were down more severely than automotive repair channels. The unit volume declines reflected ongoing severe economic weakness in the U.S. and Europe. In addition to broad based, reduced end market demand, the segment was adversely impacted by pervasive inventory corrections throughout the supply chain which abated in the fourth quarter. There are signs of stabilization in the channels this business segment serves. Management is focusing on complexity reduction (including appropriate sku rationalization) and new product introductions in the Facom, Proto and Mac industrial and automotive repair businesses, and believes there are opportunities to gain share in this environment. Segment profit fell $75 million from the prior year due to the precipitous sales volume decline which was also reflected in the segment profit rate contraction. However price realization partially mitigated the sales volume and related negative manufacturing productivity effects, along with a solid improvement in Mac Tools profit reflecting disciplined cost and other actions. The Company initiated extensive cost actions throughout the segment in late 2008, but they took longer to implement in Europe due to the country specific works council process. Those actions are largely complete and were supplemented by other ongoing restructuring initiatives in 2009, as reflected in the quarterly segment profit rate that hit a trough of 9.2% in the third quarter and recovered to 11.3% in the fourth quarter. Industrial segment net sales increased 2% in 2008 versus 2007, attributable to acquisitions. Foreign currency translation provided a 3% benefit, and favorable pricing 2%, which were offset by a 5% unit volume decline. The North American automotive repair business was adversely affected by distributor attrition and the deteriorating U.S. economy. European sales volumes, which had been positive in the first half of the year, declined in the second half as Facom and other businesses reflected the contraction of the European economy. These volume declines were partially offset by strong sales growth in U.S. based engineered storage and to a lesser extent the hydraulic tools business. The sales growth in engineered storage was driven by government spending, particularly by army and navy bases, and also strength with commercial customers. The sales volume declines created substantial headwinds from unfavorable manufacturing plant absorption causing a decrease in the segment profit. Strong focus on customer pricing and productivity initiatives more than offset the effects of inflation. Additionally, the benefits of cost reduction actions partially mitigated the unfavorable impact of sales volume declines on segment profit. CDIY: (Millions of Dollars) 2009 2008 2007 Net sales from continuing operations $ 1,295 $ 1,656 $ 1,715 Segment profit from continuing operations $ 154 $ 191 $ 254 % of Net sales 11.9 % 11.5 % 14.8 % CDIY net sales from continuing operations decreased 22% in 2009 from 2008. Customer pricing contributed 2% to sales which was more than offset by 3% of unfavorable foreign currency translation in all regions. Segment unit volumes declined 21% overall, comprised of 22% in both the Americas and Europe and 16% in Asia. The sales volume declines were more pronounced in fastening systems (Bostitch), which has higher commercial construction and industrial channel content, than in consumer tools and storage. However the majority of this segment is driven by consumer and residential construction channels which have largely stabilized. Key customer point of sale data remains steady. Segment profit declined $37 million attributable to the sales volume pressure. The ongoing integration of the Bostitch business into consumer tools and storage has generated efficiencies that significantly aided the segment profit rate recovery from a trough of 6.4% in the fourth quarter of 2008. The aforementioned Bostitch integration, along with other cost actions and productivity initiatives, as well as the carryover effect of price increases and lower commodity costs, enabled the 40 basis point improvement in the segment profit rate despite sharply lower sales. CDIY net sales from continuing operations decreased 3% in 2008 from 2007. Customer pricing increases, in response to rising commodity costs in the first three quarters of 2008, contributed 3% to sales. Foreign currency translation increased sales by 2%, while organic volume declined 8%. Volume was negatively impacted by the contraction in residential construction in both the Americas and Europe, reductions in consumer spending, as well as a decline in industrial markets served by fastening systems, reflecting increasingly weak macro economic conditions. Fastening systems continued its planned shift toward more profitable business which resulted in additional volume pressure. The sales volume decline also partially pertained to the shut down of the unprofitable consumer metal storage business. Europe had essentially flat unit volume in the first half of 2008 but declined significantly in the second half. Despite declines in unit volume, CDIY retained focus on inventory levels and contributed a substantial part of the Companys total working capital improvement. Progress was made on executing customer pricing actions but these benefits were significantly outpaced by cost inflation contributing to the profit rate erosion. The profit rate was also affected by lower sales volumes. Productivity projects and cost reduction actions partially mitigated these unfavorable impacts. 24 Table of Contents RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES At January 2, 2010, the Companys restructuring reserve balance was $46.4 million, the vast majority of which is expected to be utilized in 2010. A summary of the restructuring reserve activity from January 3, 2009 to January 2, 2010 is as follows (in millions): Net Acquisition Additions/ 1/3/09 Accrual (Reversals) Usage Currency 1/2/10 Acquisitions Severance and related costs $ 10.8 $ (1.7 ) $ $ (4.1 ) $ (0.3 ) $ 4.7 Facility closure 1.8 1.7 (1.6 ) 1.9 Subtotal acquisitions 12.6 (5.7 ) (0.3 ) 6.6 2009 Actions Severance and related costs 42.4 (18.1 ) 0.3 24.6 Asset impairments 4.0 (4.0 ) Facility closure 1.8 (1.8 ) Other 0.4 (0.2 ) 0.2 Subtotal 2009 actions 48.6 (24.1 ) 0.3 24.8 Pre 2009 Actions Severance and related costs 54.1 (7.6 ) (31.2 ) (0.3 ) 15.0 Asset impairments (0.5 ) 0.5 Other 1.2 0.2 (1.4 ) Subtotal Pre 2009 actions 55.3 (7.9 ) (32.1 ) (0.3 ) 15.0 Total $ 67.9 $ $ 40.7 $ (61.9 ) $ (0.3 ) $ 46.4 Restructuring, asset impairment and related pre tax charges totaled $45 million in 2009, of which $41 million was classified in Restructuring charges and asset impairments and $4 million in Cost of sales and SG&A. 2009 Actions: In response to further sales volume declines associated with the economic recession, the Company initiated various cost reduction programs in 2009. Severance charges of $42.4 million were recorded relating to the reduction of approximately 1,500 employees. In addition, $4.0 million in charges were recognized for asset impairments related to closing several small distribution centers, consolidating production facilities, and exiting certain businesses. Facility closure costs totaled $1.8 million. Also, $0.4 million in other charges stemmed mainly from the termination of service contracts. Of the $48.6 million recognized for these actions, $24.1 million has been utilized to date, with $24.8 million of reserves remaining as of January 2, 2010. Of the charges recognized in 2009, $9.7 million pertains to the Security segment; $21.4 million to the Industrial segment; $15.5 million to the CDIY segment; and $2.0 million to non operating entities. Pre 2009 Actions: During 2008, the Company initiated cost reduction actions in order to maintain its cost competitiveness. A large portion of these actions were initiated in the fourth quarter as the Company responded to deteriorating macro economic conditions and slowing global demand, primarily in its CDIY and Industrial segments. Severance charges of $70.0 million were recorded relating to the reduction of approximately 2,700 employees. In addition, $13.6 million in charges were recognized related to asset impairments for production assets and real estate, and $0.7 million for facility closure costs. Also, $1.2 million in other charges stemmed from the termination of service contracts. Of the $85.5 million in full year 2008 restructuring and asset impairment charges, $13.8 million, $29.7 million, $35.6 million, and $6.4 million pertained to the Security, Industrial, and CDIY segments, and non operating entities, respectively. During 2007, the Company also initiated $11.8 million of cost reduction actions in various businesses entailing severance for 525 employees and the exit of a leased facility. As of January 3, 2009, the reserve balance related to these prior actions totaled $55.3 million of which $32.1 million was utilized in 2009. In addition, $7.6 million of severance related costs accrued prior to 2009 were reversed in 2009 due in part to a reduction in the number of employee terminations pertaining to recent changes in regional European labor statutes. The remaining reserve balance of $15.0 million predominantly relates to actions in Europe and is expected to be utilized in 2010. Acquisition Related: During 2009, $2.7 million of reserves were established for acquisitions consummated in the latter half of 2008 primarily related to the consolidation of security monitoring call centers. Of this amount, $1.0 million was for the severance of approximately 90 employees and $1.7 million related to the closure of a branch facility, primarily from remaining lease obligations. In 2009, $2.7 million of severance reserves previously established in purchase accounting that are no longer needed were reversed to goodwill. The Company utilized $5.7 million of the restructuring reserves during 2009 established for previous acquisitions. As of January 2, 2010, $6.6 million in acquisition related accruals remain. Those accruals are expected to be utilized predominantly in 2010. 25 Table of Contents FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity, Sources and Uses of Capital: The Companys primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and available lines of credit under various credit facilities. Operating and Investing Activities: The Company has consistently generated strong operating cash flows over many years. In 2009, cash flow from operations totaled $539 million, up over $22 million compared to 2008. Working capital (receivables, inventories and accounts payable) generated $226 million of cash inflows, driven by inventory and accounts receivable reductions which were partially offset by lower accounts payable. These working capital reductions, while partially attributable to lower sales volumes, were engendered by broadly practiced SFS disciplines including effective sales and operations planning, a deliberate focus on reducing slow moving inventories, and vigilant receivable collections. Additionally, the Company implemented a receivable securitization facility in December 2009 which enabled a $35 million cash inflow. This strong working capital performance is apparent from the improvement in working capital turns from 5.9 in 2008 to a record 7.9 at year end 2009. Cash outflows for restructuring activities totaled $58 million in 2009, an increase of $25 million over 2008, arising from the significant cost reduction actions initiated in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first half of 2009 as the Company right sized its cost structure amidst sales pressures associated with weak macro economic conditions. In 2008, cash flow from operations totaled $517 million, down $27 million compared to 2007. Operating cash flow reflects a $46 million reduction for taxes paid on the gain from the CST/berger divestiture, even though the directly related gross proceeds are reported as an investing cash flow. Working capital generated $123 million of cash inflows, driven by accounts receivables reflecting the disciplines of SFS and a concerted effort to reduce past due accounts, and to a lesser extent inventory reductions. Cash outflows for restructuring activities totaled $33 million in 2008, a decrease of $25 million over 2007, primarily pertaining to cost reduction actions initiated in the fourth quarter and the continuing payments under the Facom Europe initiatives. The other non cash element of cash provided by operating activities is comprised of various items including non cash gains on debt extinguishments, inventory losses, interest accretion on the convertible notes, and loan cost amortization among other factors. Other non cash operating cash flows represent items necessary to reconcile net earnings to net cash provided by operating activities. Capital expenditures were $93 million in 2009, $141 million in 2008, and $87 million in 2007. The lower capital expenditures in 2009 pertain to reduced capitalized software investments and the prior year purchase of a previously leased distribution facility that did not re occur. The higher capital expenditures in 2008 as compared with 2007 were primarily attributable to investment in the North American SAP information system implementation, and the aforementioned purchase of a distribution facility. Free cash flow, as defined in the following table, was $446 million in 2009, $422 million in 2008, and $457 million in 2007, considerably exceeding net earnings. Management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity, as well as its ability to fund future growth and provide a dividend to shareowners. In 2008, free cash flow also excludes the income taxes paid on the CST/berger divestiture due to the fact the taxes are non recurring and the directly related gross cash proceeds are classified in investing cash flows. Free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service, other borrowing activity, discretionary dividends on the Companys common stock and business acquisitions, among other items. (Millions of Dollars) 2009 2008 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 539 $ 517 $ 544 Less: capital expenditures (73 ) (95 ) (66 ) Less: capitalized software (20 ) (46 ) (21 ) Add: taxes paid on CST/berger divestiture included in operating cash flow 46 Free cash flow $ 446 $ 422 $ 457 Based on its demonstrated ability to generate cash flow from operations as well as its strong balance sheet and credit position at January 2, 2010, the Company believes over the long term it has the financial flexibility to deploy capital to its shareholders advantage through a combination of acquisitions, dividends, debt repayment, and potential future share repurchases. The Company expects free cash flow in 2010 to be approximately $300 to $350 million which assumes a modest improvement in working capital turns from 2009 year end levels. 26 Table of Contents This forecast represents approximately a $100 to $150 million reduction from the 2009 free cash flow, primarily because the 2.0 times improvement in working capital turns achieved in 2009 as reflected in the $226 million increase in current year free cash flow will not repeat to the same extent in 2010. The projected 2010 free cash flow is more than sufficient to meet the Companys requirements for funding the stock dividend, debt service and other matters. In 2009, the Company expended $24 million for several small acquisitions. In 2008, acquisition spending totaled $575 million, mainly for the GdP, Scan Modul, Sonitrol and Xmark businesses within the Security segment. 2007 acquisition spending amounted to $643 million, primarily pertaining to the HSM, InnerSpace and Bedcheck businesses. Investing cash flows, aside from the previously discussed capital expenditures and acquisitions, were minor in 2009. Such other investing cash flows in 2008 include $205 million in gross proceeds from sales of businesses, after transaction costs, primarily pertaining to the divestiture of the CST/berger laser measuring tool business in July 2008. As previously mentioned, the $46 million of income taxes paid on the gain are reported as an operating cash outflow and thus the total cash inflow from the 2008 divestitures amounts to $159 million. On February 27, 2008, the Company amended its credit facility to provide for an increase and extension of its committed credit facility to $800 million from $550 million. In May 2008, the Companys commercial paper program was also increased to $800 million. The credit facility is diversified amongst thirteen financial institutions. The credit facility is designated as a liquidity back stop for the Companys commercial paper program. The amended and restated facility expires in February 2013. As of January 2, 2010, there were no outstanding loans under this facility and the Company had $87 million of commercial paper outstanding. In addition, the Company has uncommitted short term lines of credit with numerous foreign banks aggregating $197 million, of which $188 million was available at January 2, 2010. Short term arrangements are reviewed annually for renewal. Aggregate credit lines total $997 million, of which $90 million was utilized and reported as outstanding short term borrowings as of January 2, 2010. Liquidity and Related Outlook Following Consummation of the Black Decker Merger: It is currently anticipated that, upon closing of the merger, the Company will enter into a new, additional revolving credit facility of approximately $700 million, and will increase its commercial paper facility by this same amount. The terms of such facility (including with respect to interest rates and other matters) will be negotiated and are not currently known. Stanley intends to target strong investment grade credit ratings following the merger. The Companys stand alone debt is currently rated by Standard Poors (SP), Moodys Investor Service (Moodys) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch). As of January 2, 2010 the ratings for senior unsecured debt were A, A3, and A by SP, Moodys, and Fitch, respectively, each with a negative ratings outlook or under review for possible downgrade associated with the pending merger with Black Decker. The Companys stand alone short term debt, or commercial paper, ratings are A 1, P 2, and F2 by SP, Moodys, and Fitch, respectively. Black Deckers stand alone ratings for senior unsecured debt as of year end 2009 were BBB, Baa3, and BBB by SP, Moodys, and Fitch, respectively. Failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings level could adversely affect the Companys cost of funds, liquidity and access to capital markets, but would not have an adverse effect on the Companys ability to access the previously discussed $800 million committed credit facility, nor the proposed incremental committed credit facility the Company plans to put in place post merger. Based upon discussions with all three ratings agencies, the Company expects that following the consummation of the merger, its senior unsecured debt will be rated A, Baa1, and A by SP, Moodys and Fitch, respectively, and anticipates its short term borrowing ratings will be A 2, P 2 and F2 by SP, Moodys and Fitch, respectively. The Company will receive $320 million of cash proceeds in May, 2010 from the forward stock purchase contracts element of the Equity Units, which will be used to repay current debt maturities and reduce commercial paper borrowings. The Company has $401 million of cash and $87 million of commercial paper outstanding at January 2, 2010. In their Form 10 K filing on February 19, 2010, Black Decker reported $1.083 billion of cash at December 31, 2009 and no amount outstanding under its revolving credit facility, although this position may fluctuate in the normal course of business through the merger closing date. As of January 28, 2010, as disclosed in the previously mentioned Form S 4 filing, Black Decker had $175 million of long term bank debt that is subject to change in control covenants, which will be repaid by the Company at or within 90 days of closing. Post merger, the combined debt of the new Stanley Black Decker, which will aggregate approximately $2.6 billion, will have well staggered maturities over many years. Management believes the combined Stanley Black Decker will have ample liquidity and a healthy capital structure both for the near and long term following the consummation of the merger expected to occur on March 12, 2010. Financing Activities: Payments on long term debt amounted to $65 million in 2009, $45 million in 2008, and $228 million in 2007. Net repayments of short term borrowings totaled $120 million in 2009 and $74 million in 2008. In 2009 free cash flow (after paying the long standing common stock dividend) was largely deployed toward debt reduction, including the previously mentioned $59 million payment to early extinguish $103 million of junior subordinated debt securities. 27 Table of Contents In 2008, the Company utilized the proceeds from the $250 million of long term debt issued in September 2008 as well as the $159 million in net proceeds from divestitures to repay short term borrowings, which was partially offset by the cash outflows for business acquisitions and other matters. Net proceeds from short term borrowings totaled $192 million in 2007, and the cash inflows were used to fund acquisitions and repurchases of common stock. On September 29, 2008 the Company issued $250.0 million of unsecured Term Notes maturing October 1, 2013 (the 2013 Term Notes) with fixed interest payable semi annually, in arrears at a rate of 6.15% per annum. The 2013 Term Notes rank equally with all of the Companys existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The Company received net proceeds of $248.0 million which includes a discount of $0.5 million to achieve a 6.15% interest rate and $1.5 million of fees associated with the transaction. The proceeds were utilized to repay short term borrowings. The Company increased its cash dividend per common share to $1.30 in 2009. Dividends per common share increased 3.2% in 2009, 3.3% in 2008, and 3.4% in 2007. The Company intends to maintain its historical dividend policy with a commitment to responsible, continued dividend growth. The Company repurchased $3 million of common stock in 2009. In 2008 the Company repurchased 2.2 million shares of its common stock for $103 million (an average of $46.11 per share), and in 2007 3.8 million shares were repurchased for $207 million (an average of $54.64 per share). Proceeds from the issuance of common stock totaled $61 million in 2009, $19 million in 2008 and $97 million in 2007, with fluctuations related to the level of employee and retiree stock option exercises. In 2007 this includes $19 million in proceeds from the sale of stock warrants in connection with the Equity Units offering discussed further below. The Company initially funded the $546 million HSM acquisition with a combination of short term borrowings and cash. A $500 million 364 day revolving credit bridge facility was entered into on January 8, 2007, of which $130.0 million was utilized to acquire HSM; the remainder of the HSM purchase price was funded through commercial paper borrowings and cash. On March 20, 2007, the Company completed two security offerings: Equity Units, which consisted of $330 million of five year convertible notes and $330 million of three year forward stock purchase contracts; and $200 million of unsecured three year fixed rate term notes. With respect to the $860 million in offerings, the Company will not receive the cash pertaining to the forward stock purchase contracts until May 2010. The $488 million net cash proceeds of these offerings and the related equity instruments described below were used to pay down the short term bridge facility and commercial paper borrowings. As more fully discussed in Note A Significant Accounting Policies, after application of FSP APB 14 1, the $330 million five year convertible notes were bifurcated into $275 million of debt and $55 million of equity, pertaining to the conversion option feature of the convertible notes. In November 2008, the Company repurchased $10 million of the Equity Units for $5.3 million in cash. To properly account for the transaction, the Equity Unit elements were bifurcated as effectively the Company paid $10 million to extinguish the convertible notes and received $4.7 million from the seller to settle its obligation under the forward stock purchase contracts to purchase shares of the Companys common stock at a minimum purchase price of approximately $54.23 per share on May 17, 2010. At the repurchase date, the Companys common stock had a closing market value of $25.38. The remaining liability for fees payable associated with the $10 million of settled forward stock purchase contracts was reversed, resulting in an increase to equity of $0.7 million. The related $10 million in convertible note hedges and stock warrants, which are described further below, were unwound with a nominal impact to equity. As a result of the various elements associated with the $10 million Equity Unit repurchase transaction there was an insignificant gain recorded in earnings and a net increase in equity of $5.4 million. The convertible notes are pledged and held as collateral to guarantee the Equity Unit investors obligation to purchase shares in May 2010 under the stock purchase contracts. The convertible notes reflect a conversion price of approximately $64.50, or a 19% premium as of the date of issuance. At maturity, the Company must repay the convertible note principal in cash. Additionally, to the extent that the conversion option is in the money the Company, at its election, will deliver either cash or shares of common stock based on a conversion rate and the applicable market value of the Companys common stock at that time. A maximum of approximately 5.9 million shares may be issued in May 2010 under the stock purchase contracts, essentially at the higher of approximately $54.23 or market value at that time. The Company simultaneously entered into related convertible note hedge and stock warrant transactions with financial institutions. Share dilution pertaining to the conversion option of the convertible notes will occur in interim periods if the share price exceeds approximately $64.50. 28 Table of Contents At maturity in 2012, the convertible note hedge will offset the potentially dilutive impact of the conversion option aspect of the convertible notes. Because the convertible note hedge is anti dilutive, it will not be included in any diluted shares outstanding computation prior to its maturity. However, at maturity, the aggregate effect of the convertible notes and the convertible note hedge is that there will be no net increase in the Companys common shares. The Company also issued unregistered stock warrants that are exercisable during the period August 17, 2012 through September 28, 2012; the 4.9 million stock warrants outstanding as of January 2, 2010 have a strike price of $86.83 (subject to standard anti dilution protection for increases in the dividend rate, stock splits etc.). In the event the stock warrants become in the money during their 5 year term, due to the market value of the Companys common stock exceeding the strike price, there will be a related increase in diluted shares outstanding utilized in the determination of diluted earnings per share. The combined terms of the convertible note hedge, stock warrants, and convertible notes in substance re establish the conversion option aspect of the convertible notes at 60% above the $54.23 market value of the Companys common stock, such that in effect the Company will retain the benefits of share price appreciation, if any, up to a market value equal to the stock warrant strike price. Additionally the Company will retain benefits of share price appreciation, if any, through the maturity of the stock purchase contract element of the Equity Units that will entail issuance of $320 million of common shares at the higher of approximately $54.23 or market price in May 2010. Refer to Note H, Long Term Debt and Financing Arrangements, for further detail. Contractual Obligations: The following summarizes the Companys significant contractual obligations and commitments that impact its liquidity: Payments Due by Period (Millions of Dollars) Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Long term debt(a) $ 1,293 $ 208 $ 512 $ 260 $ 313 Interest payments on long term debt(b) 141 49 61 26 5 Operating leases 126 37 46 21 22 Derivatives(c) 51 78 (20 ) (7 ) Equity purchase contract fees 8 8 Material purchase commitments 9 9 Deferred compensation 20 3 4 3 10 Outsourcing and other obligations(d) 36 20 6 3 7 Pension funding obligations(e) 17 17 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,701 $ 429 $ 609 $ 306 $ 357 (a) Future payments on long term debt above encompass all payments related to aggregate debt maturities. Refer to Note A Significant Accounting Policies, under the caption New Accounting Standards, for more information regarding the interest accretion that will gradually increase the carrying value of the Convertible Notes to $320 million in May 2012. (b) Future interest payments on long term debt reflect the applicable fixed interest rate or the variable rate in effect at January 2, 2010 for floating rate debt. (c) Future cash flows on derivative financial instruments reflect the fair value as of January 2, 2010. The ultimate cash flows on these instruments will differ, perhaps significantly, based on applicable market interest and foreign currency rates at their maturity. (d) To the extent the Company can reliably determine when payments will occur pertaining to unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, the related amount will be included in the table above. However, due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with the $30 million of such liabilities at January 2, 2010, the Company is unable to make a reliable estimate of when (if at all) amounts may be paid to the respective taxing authorities. (e) The Company anticipates that funding of its pension and post retirement benefit plans in 2010 will approximate $17 million. That amount principally represents contributions either required by regulations or laws or, with respect to unfunded plans, necessary to fund current benefits. The Company has not presented estimated pension and post retirement funding in the table above beyond 2010 as funding can vary significantly from year to year based upon changes in the fair value of the plan assets, actuarial assumptions, and curtailment/settlement actions. 29 Table of Contents The merger agreement with Black Decker contains certain termination rights and provides that upon the termination of the merger under specific circumstances, including a change in the recommendation of the Companys Board of Directors, the Company would owe Black Decker a cash termination fee of $125 million. Aside from debt payments, for which there is no tax benefit associated with repayment of principal, and the equity purchase contract fees, payment of the above contractual obligations will typically generate a cash tax benefit such that the net cash outflow will be lower than the gross amounts indicated. Other Significant Commercial Commitments: Amount of Commitment Expirations Per Period (Millions of Dollars) Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter U.S. lines of credit $ 800 $ $ $ 800 $ Short term borrowings, long term debt and lines of credit are explained in detail within Note H, Long Term Debt and Financing Arrangements, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. MARKET RISK Market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments, currencies, commodities and other items traded in global markets. The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, stock prices, and commodity prices. Exposure to foreign currency risk results because the Company, through its global businesses, enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies. The Companys predominant exposures are in European, Canadian, British, Australian, and Asian currencies, including the Chinese Renminbi (RMB) and the Taiwan Dollar. Certain cross currency trade flows arising from sales and procurement activities as well as affiliate cross border activity are consolidated and netted prior to obtaining risk protection through the use of various derivative financial instruments which may include: purchased basket options; purchased options; and currency forwards. The Company is thus able to capitalize on its global positioning by taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures and portfolio efficiencies to reduce the cost of purchasing derivative protection. At times, the Company also enters into forward exchange contracts and purchased options to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of non functional currency denominated receivables and payables, predominately for affiliate transactions. Gains and losses from these hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on the underlying net exposures, assets and liabilities being hedged. Management determines the nature and extent of currency hedging activities, and in certain cases, may elect to allow certain currency exposures to remain un hedged. The Company has also entered into cross currency swaps, to provide a partial hedge of the net investments in certain subsidiaries and better match the cash flows of operations to debt service requirements. Management estimates the foreign currency impact from these financial instruments at the end of 2009 would have been approximately an $8 million pre tax loss based on a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in all derivative currency positions; this effect would occur from an appreciation of the foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The Company follows risk management policies in executing derivative financial instrument transactions, and does not use such instruments for speculative purposes. The Company does not hedge the translation of its non U.S. dollar earnings in foreign subsidiaries. As mentioned above, the Company routinely has cross border trade and affiliate flows that cause a transactional impact on earnings from foreign exchange rate movements. The Company is also exposed to currency fluctuation volatility from the translation of foreign earnings into U.S. dollars, as previously discussed. It is more difficult to quantify the transactional effects from currency fluctuations than the translational effects. Aside from the use of derivative instruments which may be used to mitigate some of the exposure, transactional effects can potentially be influenced by actions the Company may take; for example, if an exposure occurs from a European entity sourcing product from a U.S. supplier it may be possible to change to a European supplier. Management estimates the combined translational and transactional impact of a 10% overall movement in exchange rates is approximately $0.25 per diluted share. With respect to transactional foreign currency market risk, the Company sources significant products from China and other Asian low cost countries for resale in other regions. To the extent the Chinese RMB or these other currencies appreciate with respect to the U.S. dollar, the Company may experience cost increases on such purchases which could adversely impact profitability. In the event significant RMB or other currency appreciation occurs, the Company would initiate customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related cost increases, but it is possible such actions would not fully offset the potential unfavorable impact. The Companys exposure to interest rate risk results from its outstanding debt obligations, short term investments, and derivative financial instruments employed in the management of its debt portfolio. The debt portfolio including both trade and affiliate debt, is managed to achieve capital structure targets and reduce the overall cost of borrowing by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt as well as interest rate swaps, and cross currency swaps. 30 Table of Contents The Companys primary exposure to interest rate risk comes from its floating rate debt in the U.S. and Europe and is fairly represented by changes in LIBOR and EURIBOR rates. At January 2, 2010, the impact of a hypothetical 10% increase in the interest rates associated with the Companys floating rate derivative and debt instruments would have an immaterial effect on the Companys financial position and results of operations. The Company has exposure to commodity prices in many businesses, particularly brass, nickel, resin, aluminum, copper, zinc, steel, and energy used in the production of finished goods. Generally, commodity price exposures are not hedged with derivative financial instruments, but instead are actively managed through customer product and service pricing actions, procurement driven cost reduction initiatives and other productivity improvement projects. In 2009, the Company experienced much less significant commodity, energy and wage inflation than in the past few years. However such inflation increased costs by approximately $140 million in 2008 and $67 million in 2007, which management mitigated to a large extent through various customer pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives. Management presently expects inflation in 2010 to be recovered through customer pricing and as a result it is not anticipated that such net inflation will have a material adverse impact on 2010 earnings. However if commodity prices increase in the future, there would be an unfavorable impact on earnings to the extent not recovered through pricing and other actions. Fluctuations in the fair value of the Companys common stock affect domestic retirement plan expense as discussed in the ESOP section of MDA. Additionally, the Company has $21 million of liabilities as of January 2, 2010 pertaining to unfunded defined contribution plans for certain U.S. employees for which there is mark to market exposure. The assets held by the Companys defined benefit plans are exposed to fluctuations in the market value of securities, primarily global stocks and fixed income securities. The funding obligations for these plans would increase in the event of adverse changes in the plan asset values, although such funding would occur over a period of many years. This is exemplified by the fact that while there was a $48 million gain on pension plan assets in 2009 and a $71 million loss on pension plan assets in 2008 associated with volatile financial markets, the Company expects funding obligations on its defined benefit plans will modestly decrease to approximately $17 million in 2010 as compared with $20 million in 2009. The Company employs diversified asset allocations to help mitigate this risk. Management has worked to minimize this exposure by freezing and terminating defined benefit plans where appropriate. The Company has access to financial resources and borrowing capabilities around the world. There are no instruments within the debt structure that would accelerate payment requirements due to a change in credit rating. The Company has the flexibility to elect deferral of interest payments on its ETPS obligation for up to 5 years. While there can be no guarantee of the future, the Company has an investment grade credit rating and has enjoyed uninterrupted access to the commercial paper and bank markets throughout the recent credit crunch. Further, the Company has not encountered liquidity difficulties historically when similar credit tightening has occurred due to macro economic issues. Moreover, the Companys existing credit facilities and sources of liquidity, including operating cash flows, are considered adequate to conduct business as normal. Accordingly, based on present conditions and past history, management believes it is unlikely that operations will be materially affected by any potential deterioration of the general credit markets that may occur. The Company believes that its strong financial position, operating cash flows, committed long term credit facilities and borrowing capacity, and ready access to equity markets provide the financial flexibility necessary to continue its record of annual dividend payments, to invest in the routine needs of its businesses, to make strategic acquisitions and to fund other initiatives encompassed by its growth strategy. OTHER MATTERS Employee Stock Ownership Plan As detailed in Note L, Employee Benefit Plans, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) under which the ongoing U.S. Cornerstone and 401(K) defined contribution plans are funded. Overall ESOP expense is affected by the market value of Stanley stock on the monthly dates when shares are released, among other factors. Net ESOP activity amounted to income of $8 million in 2009, and $11 million and $2 million of expense in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The ESOP income in 2009 stems from the suspension of the Cornerstone benefits and the reduction of the 401(K) match, as a percentage of employee contributions, as part of cost saving actions. The Company has reinstated these benefits for 2010 and expects there will be an increase in expense in 2010 more aligned with 2008 and prior years. The increase in expense in 2008 versus 2007 was mostly attributable to the average market value of shares released which decreased from $56.04 in 2007 to $43.65 in 2008, as well as increased benefits pertaining to the headcount expansion from acquisitions. ESOP expense could increase in the future if the market value of the Companys common stock declines. 31 Table of Contents Customer Related Risks The Company has significant customers, particularly home centers and major retailers, though individually there are none that exceed 6% of consolidated sales. The loss or material reduction of business from any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on the Companys results of operations and cash flows, until either such customers were replaced or the Company made the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of business. There are no individually material credit exposures from particular customers. While the Company has strong credit policies and disciplined management of receivables, due to weak economic conditions or other factors it is reasonably possible that certain customers creditworthiness may decline and losses from receivable write offs may increase. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Refer to Note A, Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact to the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial position. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Preparation of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements are described in Note A, Significant Accounting Policies. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the Consolidated Financial Statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters with inherent uncertainty. The most significant areas involving management estimates are described below. Actual results in these areas could differ from managements estimates. Allowance For Doubtful Accounts The Companys estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on two methods. The amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved. First, a specific reserve is established for individual accounts where information indicates the customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations. In these cases, management uses its judgment, based on the surrounding facts and circumstances, to record a specific reserve for those customers against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected. These specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received. Second, a reserve is determined for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to receivable aging categories. These percentages are based on historical collection and write off experience. If circumstances change, for example, due to the occurrence of higher than expected defaults or a significant adverse change in a major customers ability to meet its financial obligation to the Company, estimates of the recoverability of receivable amounts due could be reduced. Inventories Lower Of Cost or Market, Slow Moving and Obsolete Inventories in the U.S. are predominantly valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market, while non U.S. inventories are valued at the lower of FIFO cost or market. The calculation of LIFO reserves, and therefore the net inventory valuation, is affected by inflation and deflation in inventory components. The Company ensures all inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market, and continually reviews the carrying value of discontinued product lines and stock keeping units (SKUs) to determine that these items are properly valued. The Company also continually evaluates the composition of its inventory and identifies obsolete and or slow moving inventories. Inventory items identified as obsolete and or slow moving are evaluated to determine if write downs are required. The Company assesses the ability to dispose of these inventories at a price greater than cost. If it is determined that cost is less than market value, cost is used for inventory valuation. If market value is less than cost, the Company writes down the related inventory to that value. If a write down to the current market value is necessary, the market value cannot be greater than the net realizable value, or ceiling (defined as selling price less costs to sell and dispose), and cannot be lower than the net realizable value less a normal profit margin, also called the floor. If the Company is not able to achieve its expectations regarding net realizable value of inventory at its current value, further write downs would be recorded. Property, Plant and Equipment The Company generally values Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Impairment losses are recorded when indicators of impairment, such as plant closures, are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount. The impairment loss is quantified by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to the weighted average discounted cash flows, which consider various possible outcomes for the disposition of the assets (i.e. sale, leasing, etc.). Primarily as a result of plant rationalization, certain facilities and equipment are not currently used in operations. The Company recorded $7 million in asset impairment losses in 2009 primarily as a result of restructuring initiatives, and such losses may occur in the future. 32 Table of Contents Goodwill and Intangible Assets The Company acquires businesses in purchase transactions that result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets. The determination of the value of intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350 20 Goodwill acquired goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing at least annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists. Other intangible assets are amortized and are tested for impairment when appropriate. The Company completed acquisitions in 2009 and 2008 valued at $24 million and $572 million respectively. The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses. The Company reported $1.818 billion of goodwill and $305 million of indefinite lived trade names at January 2, 2010. In accordance with ASC 350 20, management tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is a reportable operating segment as defined in ASC 280, Segment Reporting, or one level below a reportable operating segment (component level) as determined by the availability of discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by operating segment management or an aggregate of component levels of a reportable operating segment having similar economic characteristics. The Company has seven reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit (including the value of goodwill) is greater than its fair value, an impairment may exist. An impairment charge would be recorded to the extent that the recorded value of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value. The Company assesses the fair value of its reporting units based on a discounted cash flow valuation model. The key assumptions used are discount rates and perpetual growth rates applied to cash flow projections. Also inherent in the discounted cash flow valuation are near term revenue growth rates over the next five years. These assumptions contemplate business, market and overall economic conditions. The fair value of indefinite lived trade names is also assessed using a discounted cash flow valuation model. The key assumptions used include discount rates, royalty rates, and perpetual growth rates applied to the projected sales. As required by the Companys policy, goodwill and indefinite lived trade names were tested for impairment in the third quarter of 2009. Based on this testing, the Company determined that the fair value of its reporting units and indefinite lived trade names exceeded their carrying values. The discount rate used in testing goodwill for impairment in the third quarter of 2009 was 10.5% for all reporting units. The near term revenue growth rates and the perpetual growth rates, which varied for each reporting unit, ranged from 1% to 9%, and 2% to 5%, respectively. In 2009 as compared with 2008, in consideration of market conditions, the discount rate assumption increased 100 basis points, and perpetual growth rates decreased 100 basis points in some reporting units, which had the effect of reducing the estimated fair values. Management performed sensitivity analyses on the fair values resulting from the discounted cash flows valuation utilizing more conservative assumptions that reflect reasonably likely future changes in the discount rate, perpetual and near term revenue growth rates in all reporting units. The discount rate was increased by 100 basis points with no impairment indicated. The perpetual growth rates were decreased by 100 basis points with no impairment indicated. The near term revenue growth rates were reduced by 150 basis points with no impairment indicated. Based upon our 2009 annual impairment testing analysis, including our consideration of reasonably likely adverse changes in assumptions described above, management believes it is not reasonably likely that an impairment will occur in any of the reporting units over the next twelve months. In the event that our operating results in the future do not meet current expectations, management, based upon conditions at the time, would consider taking restructuring or other actions as necessary to maximize profitability. Accordingly, the above sensitivity analysis, while a useful tool, should not be used as a sole predictor of impairment. A thorough analysis of all the facts and circumstances existing at that time would need to be performed to determine if recording an impairment loss was appropriate. Environmental The Company incurs costs related to environmental issues as a result of various laws and regulations governing current operations as well as the remediation of previously contaminated sites. Future laws and regulations are expected to be increasingly stringent and will likely increase the Companys expenditures related to routine environmental matters. The Companys policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The amount of liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. The liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties. As assessments and remediation progress at individual sites, the amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available. 33 Table of Contents As of January 2, 2010, the Company had reserves of $30 million for remediation activities associated with Company owned properties as well as for Superfund sites, for losses that are probable and estimable. The range of environmental remediation costs that is reasonably possible is $16 million to $52 million which is subject to change in the near term. The Company may be liable for environmental remediation of sites it no longer owns. Liabilities have been recorded on those sites in accordance with this policy. Income Taxes The future tax benefit arising from net deductible temporary differences and tax loss carry forwards is $49 million at January 2, 2010. The Company believes earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits. For those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax loss carry forwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely, a valuation allowance is provided. The valuation allowance as of January 2, 2010 amounted to $24 million. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company estimates future taxable income, considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies, the realizability of tax loss carry forwards and the future reversal of existing temporary differences. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels. In the event the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future, the unrealizable amount would be charged to earnings in the period in which that determination is made. By contrast, if the Company were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts, it would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a favorable adjustment to earnings in the period in which that determination is made. The Company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still under audit based on the most current available information, which involves inherent uncertainty. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. See Note Q, Income Taxes, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Risk Insurance To manage its insurance costs efficiently, the Company self insures for certain U.S. business exposures and generally has low deductible plans internationally. For domestic workers compensation, automobile and product liability (liability for alleged injuries associated with the Companys products), the Company generally purchases outside insurance coverage only for severe losses (stop loss insurance) and these lines of insurance involve the most significant accounting estimates. While different stop loss deductibles exist for each of these lines of insurance, the maximum stop loss deductible is set at no more than $5 million per occurrence and $27 million in the aggregate. The process of establishing risk insurance reserves includes consideration of actuarial valuations that reflect the Companys specific loss history, actual claims reported, and industry trends among statistical and other factors to estimate the range of reserves required. Risk insurance reserves are comprised of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts expected for development of these claims, as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims discounted to present value. The cash outflows related to risk insurance claims are expected to occur over a maximum of approximately 8 to 10 years. The Company believes the liabilities recorded for these U.S. risk insurance reserves, totaling $42 million and $45 million as of January 2, 2010 and January 3, 2009, respectively, are adequate. Due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate. Warranty The Company provides product and service warranties which vary across its businesses. The types of warranties offered generally range from one year to limited lifetime, while certain products carry no warranty. Further, the Company sometimes incurs discretionary costs to service its products in connection with product performance issues. Historical warranty and service claim experience forms the basis for warranty obligations recognized. Adjustments are recorded to the warranty liability as new information becomes available. The Company believes the $67 million reserve for expected warranty claims as of January 2, 2010 is adequate, but due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process, including forecasting future product reliability levels and costs of repair as well as the estimated age of certain products submitted for claims, the ultimate claim costs may differ from the recorded warranty liability. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENT Synthetic Leases The Company is a party to synthetic leasing programs for one of its major distribution centers and certain U.S. personal property, predominately vehicles and equipment. The programs qualify as operating leases for accounting purposes, such that only the monthly rent expense is recorded in the Statement of Operations and the liability and value of the underlying assets are off balance sheet. 34 Table of Contents These lease programs are utilized primarily to reduce overall cost and to retain flexibility. The cash outflows for lease payments approximate the $15 million of rent expense recognized in fiscal 2009. As of January 2, 2010, the estimated fair value of assets and remaining obligations for these properties were $51 million and $44 million, respectively.
