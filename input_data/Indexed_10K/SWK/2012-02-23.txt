ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The financial and business analysis below provides information which the Company believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. This financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes. All references to Notes in this Item 7 refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. The following discussion and certain other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10 K contain statements reflecting the Companys views about its future performance that constitute forward looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about the industry and markets in which the Company operates and managements beliefs and assumptions. Any statements contained herein (including without limitation statements to the effect that Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. or its management believes, expects, anticipates, plans and similar expressions) that are not statements of historical fact should be considered forward looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. There are a number of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, those set forth, or incorporated by reference, below under the heading Cautionary Statements. The Company does not intend to update publicly any forward looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Strategic Objectives The Company has maintained a consistent strategic framework over time: Maintaining portfolio transition momentum by continuing diversification toward higher growth, higher profit businesses, increasing relative weighting of emerging markets and opportunistically consolidating the tool industry; Being selective and operating in markets where brand is meaningful, the value proposition is definable and sustainable through innovation and global cost leadership is achievable; Pursuing growth on multiple fronts through building existing growth platforms such as security (both electronic and mechanical) and engineered fastening and growing the more nascent stage infrastructure and healthcare platforms; Accelerating progress via SFS. Stanley has pursued this strategy which involves industry, geographic and customer diversification, in order to pursue sustainable revenue, earnings and cash flow growth. In May 2011, the Companys GICS code was changed to Industrials Capital Goods Machinery from Consumer Discretionary Consumer Durables Household Durables which reflects the evolution of the Company. The Companys vision to be a consolidator of the tool industry and to increase its relative weighting in emerging markets has been significantly enhanced by the Merger, which along with the impact from the Companys diversification strategy has driven continued improvements in financial performance. Sales outside the U.S. represented 49% of total net sales in 2011, up from 29% in 2002. As further illustration of our diversification strategy, 2011 sales to U.S. and international home centers and mass merchants were approximately 23%, including nearly 16% in sales to the Companys two largest customers, which is down from 31% in 2010, 23 including 20% in sales to the Companys two largest customers. As acquisitions in the various growth platforms (electronic and mechanical security, engineered fastening, infrastructure and healthcare solutions) are made in future years, the proportion of sales to these valued U.S. and international home center and mass merchant customers is expected to continue to decrease. Execution of this strategy has entailed approximately $4.6 billion of acquisitions since 2002 (aside from the Merger), several divestitures and increased brand investment, enabled by strong cash flow generation. During the same time period, the Company has returned 47% of free cash flow to its shareowners. The Companys long term financial objectives are: 4 6% organic revenue growth; 10 12% total revenue growth; Mid teens percentage EPS growth; Free cash flow greater than or equal to net income; Return on capital employed (ROCE) of 15%; Continued dividend growth; and Strong investment grade credit rating. The Companys long term capital allocation objectives pertaining to the deployment of free cash flow are: Invest approximately 2/3 in acquisitions; and Return approximately 1/3 to shareowners, as the Company remains committed to continued dividend growth and opportunistic share buy backs. The following represent examples of executing on our strategic objectives: 2011 Acquisitions In September 2011, the Company completed the acquisition of Niscayah Group AB (Niscayah) for a total purchase price of $984.5 million. Niscayah is one of the largest access control and surveillance solutions providers in Europe. Niscayahs integrated security solutions include video surveillance, access control, intrusion alarms and fire alarm systems, and its offerings include design and installation services, maintenance and repair, and monitoring systems. The acquisition expands and complements the Companys existing security product offerings and further diversifies the Companys operations and international presence. Management believes the acquisition of Niscayah will result in approximately $80 million in cost synergies by the end of 2013. Additionally, the acquisition is expected to provide a benefit of approximately $0.45 of earnings per diluted share (excluding expected acquisition related charges of $60 million to $80 million) by 2014, with $0.20 in 2012. In September 2011, the Company acquired Microtec Enterprises, Inc. (Microtec, which operates under the business name AlarmCap) for $59 million, net of cash acquired. AlarmCap is one of the leading security alarm service providers in Canada, serving more than 79,000 residential and commercial customers. It offers customers a full suite of security and related monitoring products and services, including intrusion, smoke detection and environmental services. AlarmCap and Niscayah are being integrated into the Companys Security segment. In January 2011, the Company acquired InfoLogix, Inc. (Infologix) for $60 million, net of cash acquired. Infologix is a leading provider of enterprise mobility solutions for the healthcare and commercial industries and has added an established provider of mobile workstations and asset tracking solutions to the Companys existing healthcare solutions operations, which operates under the Companys Security segment. 24 By completing these three acquisitions in 2011, and the acquisitions of Stanley Solutions de Securite (SSDS) and GMT in 2010, the Company has further advanced its strategy of becoming a global market leader in the commercial security industry. On a pro forma combined basis (assuming Niscayah and other 2011 acquisitions were purchased at the beginning of 2011), annual revenues of the Security segment have grown to $3.3 billion, with 48% of the total earned outside of the U.S. On a pro forma basis (assuming the Merger and 2010 Security segment acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the fiscal year) Security segment revenues were $2.2 billion in 2010, of which 30% were earned outside of the U.S. Security revenue would have accounted for 31% of the Companys total revenues in 2011 on a pro forma basis, compared to 10% in 2002 which is the year that the security expansion strategy was launched. 2011 Divestitures The Company sold three small businesses for total cash proceeds of $27 million. The largest of these businesses was part of the Companys Industrial segment, with the two smaller businesses being part of the Companys Security segment. Net sales associated with these businesses were $61 million, $66 million, and $54 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These businesses were sold as the related product lines provided limited growth opportunity or were not considered part of the Companys core offerings. The operating results of these three businesses have been reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented. Merger In March of 2010, Stanley completed a merger with Black & Decker. Black & Decker is recognized worldwide for its strong brand names and a superior reputation for quality, design, innovation and value. Management believes the Merger represented a transformative event bringing together two highly complementary companies with iconic brands, rich business histories and common distribution channels, yet minimal product overlap. The Merger also enabled a global offering in hand and power tools, as well as hardware, thus enhancing the Companys value proposition to customers. Management believes the Merger will result in approximately $450 million ($485 million on an annualized basis) in cost synergies, which are expected to be achieved by the end of 2012 and which will help fuel future profit growth and facilitate global cost leadership. The Company is on track with the integration of Stanley and Black & Decker, and realized approximately $350 million of cost synergies through 2011. Additionally, revenue synergies from the Merger are projected to be in the range of $300 million to $400 million by the end of 2013, which implies a benefit of approximately $0.35 $0.50 of earnings per diluted share. Revenue synergies are predominantly being derived from geographic expansion, cross selling opportunities and brand expansion. Acquisition of CRC Evans In July 2010, the Company acquired CRC Evans for a purchase price of $451.2 million, net of cash acquired. CRC Evans immediately established a scalable, global growth business platform for the Company to capitalize on favorable end market trends in the oil and gas infrastructure area. CRC Evans is a supplier of specialized tools, equipment and services used in the construction of oil and natural gas transmission pipelines. CRC Evans also sells and rents custom pipe handling and joint welding and coating equipment used in the construction of large and small diameter pipelines. The acquisition of CRC Evans diversifies the Companys revenue base and provides the Company with a strategic and profitable growth platform. CRC Evans has been consolidated into the Companys Industrial segment. 25 Driving Further Profitable Growth Within Existing Platforms While diversifying the business portfolio through expansion in the Companys specified growth platforms is important, management recognizes that the branded tool and storage product offerings in the CDIY and Industrial segment businesses are important foundations of the Company that provide strong cash flow generation and growth prospects. Management is committed to growing these businesses through innovative product development, as evidenced by the success of the 12 volt, 18 volt and 20 volt MAX lithium ion power tool lines in the CDIY segment, brand support, continued investment in emerging markets and strong focus on global cost competitiveness to foster vitality over the long term. The Companys industrial and automotive repair tool business within the Industrial segment is creating significant organic growth through a vertical integration of hand tool, power tool and engineered storage solutions. The integration of these products and solutions has won new customers and increased volume to existing customers in the automotive aftermarket, military, infrastructure, aerospace and industrial industries. Continuing to Invest in the Stanley Black & Decker Brands The Company has a strong portfolio of brands associated with high quality products including Stanley&reg;, FatMax&reg;, DEWalt&reg;, Black & Decker&reg;, Porter Cable&reg;, Bostitch&reg;, Facom&reg;, Mac&reg;, Proto&reg;, CRC&reg;, Emhart Teknologiestm, Vidmar&reg;, Niscayah&reg;, Kwikset&reg; and Baldwin&reg;. The Stanley&reg; and Black & Decker&reg;, brands are recognized as two of the worlds great brands and are one of the Companys most valuable assets. Sustained brand support has yielded a steady improvement across the spectrum of legacy Stanley brand awareness measures, notably a climb in unaided Stanley hand tool brand awareness from 27% in 2005 to 48% in 2011. Stanley and DEWalt had prominent signage at 13 major league baseball stadiums or 40% of all major league baseball games. The Company is also maintaining long standing NASCAR racing sponsorships which will entail brand exposure over 36 race weekends in 2012. The Company is in year four of a ten year alliance agreement with the Walt Disney World Resort&reg; whereby Stanley&reg; and DEWalt&reg; logos are displayed on construction walls throughout the theme parks and Stanley&reg;, Mac&reg;, Proto&reg;, and Vidmar&reg; brand logos and or products are featured in various attractions where they will be seen by millions of visitors each year. Additionally, Stanley is The Official Tool Provider of the Walt Disney World Resort&reg;. In 2009 the Company also began advertising in the English Premier League which is the number one soccer league in the world, watched weekly by 650 million people around the world. In 2012 and 2013, the Company will advertise in approximately 225 televised events. Starting in 2011 the Company became a sponsor of the Liverpool Football Club and the Fulham Football Club including player rights, hospitality assets and stadium signage. The Company advertises in 60 televised Professional Bull Riders events in the US and Brazil and sponsors three riders. Additionally the Company sponsors a team and two riders in Moto GP, the worlds premiere motorcycle racing series. The Company will continue to allocate its brand and advertising spend wisely generating more than 25 billion brand impressions annually. The Stanley Fulfillment System SFS employs continuous improvement techniques to streamline operations and drive efficiency throughout the supply chain. SFS has five primary elements that work in concert: sales and operations planning (S&OP), operational lean, complexity reduction, global supply management, and order to cash excellence. S&OP is a dynamic and continuous unified process that links and balances supply and demand in a manner that produces world class fill rates while minimizing DSI (Days Sales of Inventory). Operational lean is the systemic application of lean principles in progressive steps throughout the enterprise to optimize flow toward a pre defined end state by eliminating waste, increasing efficiency and driving value. Complexity reduction is a focused and overt effort to eradicate costly and unnecessary complexity from our products, supply chain and back room process and organizations. Complexity reduction enables all other SFS elements and, when successfully deployed, results in world class cost, speed of execution and customer satisfaction. Global supply management focuses on strategically leveraging the companys scale to achieve the best possible price and payment terms with the best possible quality, service and delivery among all categories of spend. Order to cash excellence is a methodical, 26 process based approach that provides a user friendly, automated and error proof customer experience from intent to purchase to shipping and billing to payment, while minimizing cash collection cycle time and DSO (Days Sales Outstanding). Other benefits of SFS include reductions in lead times, rapid realization of synergies during acquisition integrations, and focus on employee safety. SFS disciplines helped to mitigate the substantial impact of material and energy price inflation that was experienced in recent years. SFS is instrumental in the reduction of working capital evidenced by the improvement in working capital turns for legacy Stanley from 4.6 in 2003 to 8.6 at the end of 2009, directly preceding the merger. Closing out 2010, once blended with the legacy Black & Decker working capital turns of 4.7, working capital turns for the combined company were 5.7. The opportunity to deploy SFS across the entire combined enterprise and increase turns represents a significant opportunity to generate incremental free cash flow. Through the initial integration of the legacy Black & Decker businesses and the ongoing improvement of the legacy Stanley businesses with the SFS model, working capital turns experienced a 23% improvement from 5.7 at the end of 2010 to 7.0 (excluding the impact of Niscayah) at the end of 2011. In 2012 and beyond, the Company plans to further leverage SFS to generate ongoing improvements both in the existing business and future acquisitions in working capital turns, cycle times, complexity reduction and customer service levels. Certain Items Impacting Earnings Merger and Acquisition Related Charges Impacting 2011, 2010 and 2009 Earnings Throughout MD&A, the Company has provided a discussion of the outlook and results both inclusive and exclusive of the merger and acquisition related charges. The amounts and measures, including gross profit and segment profit, on a basis excluding such charges are considered relevant to aid analysis and understanding of the Companys results aside from the material impact of the merger and acquisition related charges; the measures are utilized internally by management to understand business trends, as once the aforementioned anticipated cost synergies from the Merger and acquisitions are realized, such charges are not expected to recur. The merger and acquisition related charges are as follows: 2011 The Company reported $256 million in pre tax charges during 2011 pertaining to the Merger and other acquisition activities, which were comprised of the following: $37 million reducing Gross profit primarily pertaining to facility closure related charges; $99 million in Selling, general & administrative expenses primarily for integration related administrative costs and consulting fees, as well as employee related matters; $51 million in Other net predominantly for transaction costs; and $69 million in Restructuring and asset impairment charges primarily for severance and the planned closures of facilities. The tax effect on the above charges, some of which were not tax deductible, in 2011 was $56 million, resulting in an after tax charge of $200 million, or $1.18 per diluted share. 27 2010 The Company reported $538 million in pre tax charges in 2010, pertaining to the Merger and other acquisition activities, which were comprised of the following: $195 million in Cost of sales related primarily to inventory step up amortization stemming from the initial turn of the Black & Decker and CRC Evans acquired inventories, which were written up in purchase accounting to fair value, by $174 million. Additionally, Cost of sales includes $21 million of facility closure related charges; $82 million in Selling, general & administrative expenses for certain executive and merger related compensation costs and integration related consulting fees; $37 million in Other net for transaction costs, inclusive of $20 million of pension curtailment gains. $224 million in Restructuring and asset impairment charges primarily for severance (including costs for certain Black & Decker executives triggered by the change in control), as well as charges associated with the closure of facilities. The tax effect on the above charges during 2010, some of which were not tax deductible, was $117 million, resulting in after tax merger and acquisition related charges of $421 million, or $2.80 per diluted share. 2009 In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company incurred $18 million in after tax charges, or $0.22 per diluted share, primarily related to the transaction and integration planning costs associated with the Merger. Outlook for 2012 This outlook discussion is intended to provide broad insight into the Companys near term earnings and cash flow generation prospects. The Company expects diluted earnings per share to approximate $4.71 to $4.97 in 2012, inclusive of $242 million of merger and acquisition related charges as well as the charges associated with the newly announced $150 million in cost actions. Excluding such charges, 2012 earnings per dilutive share is expected to be in the range of $5.75 to $6.00. The Company expects free cash flow, excluding merger & acquisition related charges and payments, to approximate $1.2 billion. The 2012 outlook assumes that organic net sales will increase 1 2% on a pro forma basis (assumes Niscayah was owned for the full year 2011); the Company will continue to execute on Black & Decker cost and revenue synergies, along with the cost synergies associated with the Niscayah integration; and the Company will deliver on proactive cost containment actions in addition to integration driven cost synergies as part of offsetting continued inflation headwinds and adverse foreign exchange movements. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Below is a summary of the Companys operating results at the consolidated level, followed by an overview of business segment performance. Terminology: The terms legacy Stanley, organic and core are utilized to describe results aside from the impact of the Merger and acquisitions during their initial 12 months of ownership. This ensures appropriate comparability to operating results of prior periods. 28 The Company has included information as if the Merger had occurred on January 3, 2010 for the year ended January 1, 2011 (pro forma information) which also includes a discussion regarding legacy Black & Deckers performance in relation to the prior year. This pro forma analysis is provided to aid understanding of the current year trends compared to the prior year since the Merger occurred March 12, 2010. Net Sales: Net sales were $10.376 billion in 2011, as compared to $8.344 billion in 2010, a 24% increase. Organic sales volume provided a 5% increase in net sales, the impact of a full year of results from the Merger provided an 11% increase to sales, the impact of other acquisitions (primarily Niscayah and CRC Evans), provided an additional 7% increase in net sales while the favorable effects of foreign currency translation in all regions, but most significantly in Europe and Asia, contributed an additional 1% to net sales. The primary drivers of the organic volume growth continues to be new product introductions resulting in market share gains and continued high growth rates in emerging markets, inclusive of continued revenue synergy realizations from the Merger. On a geographic basis, 2011 organic sales increased 5% in the Americas (25% in Latin America), 3% in Europe and 6% in Asia. Excluding the engineered fastening business in Japan and China, where it has experienced the continued effects of the first quarter 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami, organic sales in Asia were up 25% as compared to full year 2010. On a pro forma basis, net sales increased 12%, with acquisitions accounting for 6% of the increase, organic growth providing 4% of the increase and 2% reflecting the benefit of foreign currency translation. Organic sales volume increased 4% in CDIY, 10% in Industrial and 1% in Security. CDIYs organic volume growth was primarily driven by strength in professional power tools via new product introductions and increased promotional activity on older generation products. This growth was offset by lower sales volume in hand tools and fastening largely due to soft end markets in the retail channels, the ongoing impact of lower volume from Pfister resulting from the loss of business at a major customer in the first quarter of 2011 and lower sales of outdoor products in the first half of the year due to inclement weather in North America. Organic sales volume growth in the Industrial segment was strong in each major business component and in most geographic regions due primarily to the success of new products and increased market share gains. Within the Security segment, limited overall organic sales growth reflects 6% organic sales growth from heathcare solutions due to strong sales in the patient security and radio frequency identification (RFID) enabled systems, offset by lower electronic security solutions installation revenues and delays in the remodeling expenditures at a large mechanical access solutions customer. Net sales were $8.344 billion in 2010, as compared to $3.683 billion in 2009, a 127% increase. The Merger provided a 115% increase to sales, along with 7% from other acquisitions, primarily SSDS and CRC Evans. Organic unit volume increased 5%, while price and currency were both flat compared to the prior year. Organic sales growth was driven by the successful launch of various new products which generally have been well received by customers, and overall improvement in end market demand, especially in industrial and emerging markets. By segment, legacy Stanley unit volume increased 3% in CDIY, decreased 3% in Security, which was negatively impacted by the continued weakness in U.S. commercial construction markets along with a large U.S. retailers inventory correction, and increased 25% in Industrial. The Industrial segment benefited from strong end user demand, market share gain, and global customer re stocking in certain distribution channels which subsided by the fourth quarter. On a geographic basis, legacy Stanley unit volume sales increased 3% in the Americas (17% in Latin America), 6% in Europe, and 12% in the Asian region. On a pro forma basis, the legacy Black & Decker business achieved strong unit volume growth of 11%, reflecting positive end market demand including robust sales growth in emerging markets, along with strong new product performance, particularly the 12 volt lithium ion power tools. Gross Profit: The Company reported gross profit of $3.794 billion, or 36.6% of net sales, in 2011, compared to $2.935 billion, or 35.2% of net sales, in 2010. The inclusion of a full year of Black & Decker as well as acquisition activity (specifically Niscayah and CRC Evans) were the main drivers behind the overall increase in gross profit. Further, gross profit was negatively impacted by $37 million of merger and acquisition related 29 charges in 2011 related largely to facility closures and $195 million in 2010, pertaining to the inventory step up amortization from the initial turn of Black & Decker and CRC Evans inventories and facility closure costs. The gross profit rates excluding these charges were 36.9% in 2011 as compared to 37.5% of net sales in 2010. The lower gross profit margin rate in 2011, excluding merger and acquisition related charges, is primarily due to the effect of commodity inflation, and CDIY promotional discounting on older generation products, all of which combined, outweighed the positive impacts of organic volume related increases, price increases in response to commodity inflation, cost synergies and productivity initiatives. The Company reported gross profit of $2.935 billion, or 35.2% of net sales, in 2010, compared to $1.492 billion, or 40.5% of net sales, in 2009. The addition of Black & Decker and acquisition activity were the main drivers to the overall increase in gross profit. Gross profit in 2010 was negatively impacted by $195 million of merger and acquisition related charges as previously discussed. Aside from merger and acquisition related charges, gross profit increased to $3.130 billion, or 37.5% of net sales, in 2010. This performance was driven by sales volume leverage, benefits from prior year restructuring actions, and the continued execution of productivity initiatives, partially offset by unfavorable commodity inflation. SG&A Expense: Selling, general and administrative expenses, inclusive of the provision for doubtful accounts (SG&A), were $2.552 billion, or 24.6% of net sales, in 2011 as compared $2.153 billion, or 25.8% of net sales, in 2010. Merger and acquisition related charges totaled $99 million in 2011 and $82 million in 2010 for certain executive and merger related compensation costs and integration related consulting fees. Excluding merger and acquisition related charges, SG&A was 23.6% of net sales in 2011 compared with 24.8% of net sales in the prior year. The favorable SG&A rate primarily reflects sales volume leverage and cost synergies partially offset by the impact of acquisitions. On a pro forma basis, including merger and acquisition related charges, SG&A expense was $2.373 billion, or 25.6% of net sales, in 2010. SG&A expenses were $2.153 billion, or 25.8% of net sales, in 2010 as compared with $1.016 billion, or 27.6% of net sales in 2009. Merger and acquisition related charges totaled $82 million in 2010 and $5 million in 2009 for certain executive and merger related compensation costs and integration related consulting fees. Black & Decker and acquisitions contributed an additional $985 million of operating SG&A. The remaining increase in SG&A primarily relates to corporate overhead, discussed below, investments to fund future growth, and the reinstatement of certain U.S. retirement benefits that were temporarily suspended in 2009 as part of cost saving measures. Excluding merger and acquisition related charges, SG&A for 2010 was $2.071 billion, or 24.8% of net sales. The improvement in the SG&A rate (as a percentage of sales) mainly reflects sales volume leverage, savings from restructuring actions and cost synergies, along with the other aforementioned factors. Distribution center costs (i.e. warehousing and fulfillment facility and associated labor costs) are classified within SG&A. This classification may differ from other companies who may report such expenses within cost of sales. Due to diversity in practice, to the extent the classification of these distribution costs differs from other companies, the Companys gross margins may not be comparable. Such distribution costs classified in SG&A amounted to $240 million, $197 million and $101 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase is primarily attributable to the inclusion of the full year of Black & Decker results in the 2011 period, as well as higher sales volume in the current year. Corporate Overhead: The corporate overhead element of SG&A and gross profit, which is not allocated to the business segments, amounted to $245 million in 2011 and 2010, and $71 million in 2009. The increase from 2009 to 2010 was primarily attributable to the inclusion of a full nine months of Black & Decker in 2010. The previously discussed merger and acquisition related charges, that unfavorably impacted corporate overhead, totaled $75 million in 2011, $81 million in 2010 and $5 million in 2009. Corporate overhead, excluding merger and acquisition related costs, represented 1.6%, 2.0% and 1.8% of net sales in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 30 Other net: Other net expense totaled $278 million of expense in 2011 compared to $199 million of expense in 2010. The increase primarily pertains to higher amortization expense from intangible assets associated with recent acquisitions, $14 million of incremental merger and acquisition related charges, and the impact of defined benefit plan curtailment gains of $20 million in 2010. Other net amounted to $199 million of expense in 2010 compared to $138 million of expense in 2009. The increase is primarily related to higher intangible asset amortization expense and $37 million of merger and acquisition related charges, inclusive of $20 million of defined benefit plan curtailment gains. Gain on Debt Extinguishment: In May 2009, the Company repurchased $103 million of its junior subordinated debt securities for $59 million in cash and recognized a $44 million pre tax gain on extinguishment. Interest, net: Net interest expense in 2011 was $113 million, compared to $101 in 2010 and $61 million in 2009. The increase in net interest expense mainly relates to the incremental interest costs associated with new debt issuances in the second half of 2010, partially offset by higher interest income. The increase in 2010 versus 2009 relates to higher long term borrowing levels resulting primarily from the $1.8 billion in debt acquired in connection with the Merger. Income Taxes: The Companys effective tax rate was 11% in 2011 compared to 16% in 2010 and 19% in 2009. The low tax rate in 2011 can be largely attributable to the inclusion of $73 million of benefits from a favorable settlement of certain tax contingencies, benefits resulting from foreign tax credits, and the distribution of domestic and foreign earnings. The effective tax rate differed from the statutory tax rates in 2010 primarily due to various non deductible transaction costs and other restructuring costs associated with the Merger, which were principally offset by the inclusion of $36 million of benefits attributable to the favorable settlement of certain tax contingencies. The lower effective tax rate versus statutory tax rates in 2009 primarily relates to benefits realized upon resolution of certain tax audits. The effective tax rate may vary in future periods based upon changes in domestic and foreign earnings, changes in the tax law in the jurisdictions the Company operates, as well as other factors. Business Segment Results The Companys reportable segments are aggregations of businesses that have similar products, services and end markets, among other factors. The Company utilizes segment profit (which is defined as net sales minus cost of sales and SG&A aside from corporate overhead expense), and segment profit as a percentage of net sales to assess the profitability of each segment. Segment profit excludes the corporate overhead expense element of SG&A, Other net (inclusive of intangible asset amortization expense), restructuring and asset impairments, interest income, interest expense, and income tax expense. Corporate overhead is comprised of world headquarters facility expense, cost for the executive management team and the expense pertaining to certain centralized functions that benefit the entire Company but are not directly attributable to the businesses, such as legal and corporate finance functions. Refer to Note O, Restructuring and Asset Impairments, and Note F, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the amount of restructuring charges and asset impairments, and intangibles amortization expense, respectively, attributable to each segment. As discussed previously, the Companys operations are classified into three business segments: CDIY, Security, and Industrial. CDIY: The CDIY segment is comprised of the professional power tool and accessories businesses, the consumer power tool business and the hand tools, fasteners & storage business. The professional power tool and accessories business sells professional grade corded and cordless electric power tools and equipment including drills, impact wrenches and drivers, grinders, saws, routers and sanders. The consumer power tool business sells corded and 31 cordless power tools, lawn and garden products and home products. The hand tools, fasteners & storage business sells measuring and leveling tools, planes, hammers, demolition tools, knives, saws and chisels. Fastening products include pneumatic tools and fasteners including nail guns, nails, staplers and staples. Storage products include tool boxes, sawhorses and storage units. (Millions of Dollars) 2011 2010 2009 Net sales $ 5,237 $ 4,368 $ 1,258 Segment profit $ 682 $ 459 $ 141 % of Net sales 13.0 % 10.5 % 11.2 % CDIY net sales increased $869 million, or 20%, in 2011 compared with 2010. The inclusion of a full year of Black & Decker results generated 14% of the increase, unit volume sales growth contributed 4% and favorable foreign currency translation contributed 2% to the sales increase. The segment unit volume increase was a function of growth in the Americas, Asia and emerging markets since 2010. Organic sales growth was primarily due to approximately 13% of incremental growth in the professional power tools and accessories business driven by the success of the 18 volt and 20 volt MAX lithium ion product lines launched in 2011, in addition to the continued strength of the 12 volt lithium ion power tool products launched in 2010, all three of which are marketed under the DEWalt, Porter Cable, and Black & Decker brands. Other contributing factors include a continued focus on Merger related revenue synergies, increases in sales of the newly launched DEWalt hand tool line, which began shipping to distributors in June and select promotional activity for older product lines, primarily Ni Cad. Segment profit increased $223 million from 2010, inclusive of $20 million in merger and acquisition related charges. Excluding those charges, 2011 segment profit was $702 million, or 13.4% of net sales, which compares to 2010 segment profit excluding merger and acquisition related charges of $585 million, or a consistent segment profit rate of 13.4%. Aside from the impact of merger and acquisition related charges declining by $107 million, segment profit increased in 2011 due to the favorable impact of cost synergies, higher sales volume and continued growth in Latin America. CDIY segment profits in 2011 also reflect the unfavorable impact of unrecovered commodity cost inflation, the impact of promotional spending associated with older generation products (which offset other product list price increases), and the continued impact of the previously discussed Pfister business loss. CDIY net sales increased $3.110 billion, or 247%, in 2010 compared with 2009. Black & Decker generated 245% of the increase, favorable foreign currency translation contributed 1% to sales and price had a negative 1% impact. Segment unit volume increased over 2%, reflecting a 3% increase in the Americas and 14% in Asia, which was partially offset by a 2% decline in Europe. Organic sales growth was aided by new product introductions including Bostitch hand tools and Stanley branded storage units and strength in Latin America. These factors more than offset sluggish market conditions in developed countries in North America, Western Europe and Australia. Additionally, CDIY further improved service levels (fill rates) over 2009. Pro forma Black & Decker sales increased 8% over 2009 with negative 1% price offset by 1% favorable currency translation. Black & Decker benefited from the successful global launch of the 12 volt compact lithium ion power tools marketed under the DEWalt, Porter Cable and Black & Decker brands, other new product introductions in home products, and strength in emerging markets. Segment profit increased $318 million and reflects $127 million of merger and acquisition related charges comprised of inventory step up amortization from the initial turn of the Black & Decker inventory and facility closure related costs. Excluding the merger and acquisition related charges, segment profit was $585 million, or 13.4% of sales. The expansion of the segment profit amount and rate, excluding merger and acquisition related charges, was attributable to achievement of integration cost synergies, sales volume leverage and annual productivity initiatives. Negative inflation/price arbitrage partially offset this profit rate expansion. 32 Security: The Security segment is comprised of the electronic security solutions and the mechanical access solutions businesses. The electronic security solutions business designs, supplies and installs electronic security systems and provides electronic security services, including alarm monitoring, video surveillance, fire alarm monitoring, systems integration and system maintenance. Purchasers of these systems typically contract for ongoing security systems monitoring and maintenance at the time of initial equipment installation. The electronic security business also sells healthcare solutions which include medical carts and cabinets, asset tracking, infant protection, pediatric protection, patient protection, wander management, fall management, and emergency call products. The mechanical access solutions business sells automatic doors, residential and commercial hardware, locking mechanisms, electronic keyless entry systems, keying systems, tubular and mortise door locksets. (Millions of Dollars) 2011 2010 2009 Net sales $ 2,639 $ 2,084 $ 1,543 Segment profit $ 399 $ 309 $ 305 % of Net sales 15.1 % 14.8 % 19.8 % Security net sales increased $555 million, or 27%, in 2011. The impact of acquisitions, principally Niscayah and Infologix, provided 25% of the sales increase, organic sales growth was 1% and favorable foreign currency translation resulted in a 1% increase. More specifically, electronic security solutions organic sales increased 4%, which was largely attributed to installation and recurring monthly revenue growth in the U.S., France and the U.K. Healthcare operations achieved 6% in organic sales growth due to both patient security and RFID enabled storage systems. Mechanical access solutions organic sales were down 2% due primarily to the continued softness in commercial and residential construction, lower sales in the Access Technologies business resulting from remodeling delays at its largest customer and by declines within the residential lock business resulting from a significant U.S customer inventory correction in the legacy Black & Decker hardware and home improvement business. Segment profit increased $90 million and includes $32 million of merger and acquisition related charges. The impact from acquisitions (primarily Niscayah and Infologix) was the primary driver of the increase in segment profit. Excluding merger and acquisition related charges, segment profit was $431 million, or 16.3% of net sales in 2011, which compares with $352 million, or 16.9% of net sales in 2010 (excluding $43 million in merger and acquisition related charges from 2010). Further, upon the exclusion of Niscayahs impact on 2011, in addition to merger and acquisition related charges, segment profit was 17.3% of net sales in 2011. The decline in the segment profit rate excluding merger and acquisition related charges is due to both unrecovered cost inflation and the temporary dilutive effect on the segment profit rate from recent acquisitions. Security segment sales increased 35% in 2010, reflecting a 29% contribution from the Merger and 8% from acquisitions, principally the March 2010 SSDS acquisition and the fourth quarter 2010 GMT Chinese hardware business. Modest price and favorable foreign currency translation provided a combined 1% sales benefit, with organic sales volume decreasing 3%. The mechanical access solutions sales volume decline was associated with continued slow commercial construction markets and a large U.S. retailers inventory reduction that affected the hardware business. On a pro forma basis, the Black & Decker hardware and home improvement business achieved 7% higher sales, with 6% unit volume growth, 2% favorable foreign currency translation and a 1% price decline. The HHI Kwikset&reg; and Baldwin&reg; new product introductions fueled the higher sales, overcoming the unfavorable impact of a residential hardware customers inventory destocking. Electronic security solutions had a low single digit sales volume decrease as a solid performance by the healthcare solutions business was more than offset by weakness in commercial installations in the U.S. and U.K. security businesses. 33 Segment profit in 2010 reflects $43 million of merger and acquisition related charges, comprised of facility closure related costs and inventory step up amortization from the initial turn of the Black & Decker inventory. Segment profit amounted to $352 million, or 16.9% of sales, aside from these costs. This 16.9% segment profit rate reflects 40 basis points of dilution from Black & Decker and acquired companies, such that legacy Stanley achieved a 17.3% segment profit rate excluding merger and acquisition related charges. The increase in the total segment profit amount is attributable to Black & Decker and acquisitions which more than offset lower profits in the legacy Stanley business. The legacy Stanley performance pertained to lower absorption from reduced sales volume, due to weak construction markets and the previously mentioned customer inventory correction, along with inflation that pressured the segment profit rate. These factors more than offset the benefits from productivity improvements and restructuring actions with respect to legacy Stanley. Industrial: The Industrial segment is comprised of the industrial and automotive repair, engineered fastening and infrastructure businesses. The industrial and automotive repair business sells hand tools, power tools, and engineered storage solution products. The engineered fastening business primarily sells engineered fasteners designed for specific applications. The businesses product lines include stud welding systems, blind rivets and tools, blind inserts and tools, drawn arc weld studs, engineered plastic fasteners, self piercing riveting systems and precision nut running systems. The infrastructure business consists of CRC Evans business, and the Companys legacy hydraulics business. The businesss product lines include custom pipe handling machinery, joint welding and coating machinery, weld inspection services and hydraulic tools and accessories. (Millions of Dollars) 2011 2010 2009 Net sales $ 2,501 $ 1,892 $ 881 Segment profit $ 406 $ 259 $ 101 % of Net sales 16.2 % 13.7 % 11.5 % Industrial net sales increased $609 million, or 32%, in 2011 compared with 2010. The impact of the Merger and other acquisitions (primarily CRC Evans) provided a 19% increase in net sales, organic growth provided an additional 10% and favorable foreign currency contributed 3% for 2011. The Engineered Fastening business had 13% organic growth through gains in market share, specifically in North America and Europe, as well as expansion into new automotive platforms and growth within the commercial aerospace market. The Industrial and Automotive Repair business achieved 11% organic growth due to market demand, new products, strong hand tool sales within the North American industrial distribution channel, and continued growth in the Mac Tools mobile distribution channel. Geographically, the Industrial segment achieved organic growth in North America, primarily driven by the Industrial and Automotive Repair and hydraulic tools businesses, in Europe, primarily from Engineered Fastening, and in the emerging markets, mostly from Industrial and Automotive Repair. On a pro forma basis, the Industrial segment net sales increased 21%, with the acquisition impact, primarily from CRC Evans, accounting for 8% of the increase, organic growth providing 10% of the increase, along with a 3% benefit from foreign currency translation. Segment profit increased $147 million and reflects $9 million of merger and acquisition related charges. Excluding the merger and acquisition related charges, segment profit is $415 million, or 16.6% of net sales in 2011, which compares with $286 million (excluding merger and acquisition related charges of $27 million), or 15.1% of net sales, in the corresponding 2010 period. The strong improvement in segment profit and the profit rate is primarily attributable to sales volume leverage, cost synergies, successful pricing actions and overall strong market conditions in the Industrial segment. Industrial segment net sales rose 115% in 2010 compared with 2009. Black & Decker provided 78% of the sales increase and the CRC Evans acquisition contributed 13%. Unfavorable foreign currency translation, driven by Europe, reduced sales by 2% while price provided a 1% increase in sales. Sales unit volume gains were 25% 34 primarily attributable to customer supply chain restocking, which subsided in the third quarter, market share gains, and strong end user demand fueled by higher global production levels and new product introductions. The Americas and Europe each posted robust 20% volume growth, and were outpaced by Asia. The industrial and automotive repair business enjoyed significant market share gains, end user market growth in all North American sales channels, particularly through industrial distribution. The hydraulic tools business also attained strong volume gains further aided by favorable steel scrap markets. On a pro forma basis, the Black & Decker Engineered Fastening business grew a substantial 29% associated with significantly higher automotive vehicle production in the Americas and Japan and increased customer penetration. The pro forma Black & Decker sales were comprised of 26% unit volume, negative 1% price, 1% favorable foreign currency translation and 3% from an acquisition. Merger and acquisition related charges, primarily inventory step up amortization from the initial turn of the Black & Decker and CRC Evans inventories, amounted to $27 million in 2010. Excluding the merger and acquisition related charges, segment profit was $286 million, or 15.1% of net sales, representing a robust 360 basis point expansion of the segment profit rate. This strong performance was enabled by the accretive impact of Black & Decker and CRC Evans, along with favorable operating leverage and a reduced cost structure in the legacy Stanley businesses. Over one third of the segment profit rate improvement pertains to the legacy Stanley business and the remainder to the inclusion of Black & Decker and CRC Evans. RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES At December 31, 2011 restructuring reserves totaled $84.1 million. A summary of the restructuring reserve activity from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011 is as follows (in millions): 1/1/11 Acquisitions NetAdditions Usage Currency 12/31/11 2011 Actions Severance and related costs $ $ 5.7 $ 67.0 $ (17.4 ) $ (1.3 ) $ 54.0 Asset impairments 0.2 (0.2 ) Facility closure 2.7 (2.7 ) Other 1.6 (1.5 ) 0.1 Subtotal 2011 actions 5.7 71.5 (21.8 ) (1.3 ) 54.1 Pre 2011 Actions Severance and related costs 97.8 (5.7 ) (65.5 ) 1.8 28.4 Facility closure 2.3 3.9 (5.0 ) 1.2 Other 1.1 1.3 (2.0 ) 0.4 Subtotal Pre 2011 actions 101.2 (0.5 ) (72.5 ) 1.8 30.0 Total $ 101.2 $ 5.7 $ 71.0 $ (94.3 ) $ 0.5 $ 84.1 2011 Actions: During 2011, the Company recognized $68.6 million of restructuring charges associated with the Merger, Niscayah, and other acquisitions, relating to activities initiated in the current year. Of those charges, $64.3 million relates to severance charges associated with the reduction of 1,425 employees, $2.5 million relates to facility closure costs, $0.2 million relates to asset impairments, and $1.6 million represents other charges. As a result of the Niscayah acquisition, the Company has assumed $5.7 million of restructuring reserves recorded by Niscayah prior to the acquisition as part of legacy cost reduction initiatives in 2010. In addition, the Company continued to initiate cost reduction actions in 2011 that were not associated with the Merger or other acquisitions, resulting in severance and related charges of $2.7 million pertaining to the reduction of 83 employees, and facility closure costs of $0.2 million. Of the $71.5 million recognized for 2011 actions, $21.8 million has been utilized to date, with $54.1 million of reserves remaining as of December 31, 2011. The Company expects the vast majority to be utilized in 2012. 35 Pre 2011 Actions: For the year ended January 1, 2011 the Company initiated restructuring activities associated with the Merger and acquisition of Stanley Solutions de S&eacute;curit&eacute; (SSDS). Charges recognized in 2011 associated with these prior year initiatives amounted to $7.2 million, offset by $7.7 million of releases of reserves related to residual liabilities, which included $0.5 million of reserve releases not associated with the Merger and other acquisitions. As of January 1, 2011, the reserve balance related to these pre 2011 actions totaled $101.2 million. Utilization of the reserve balance related to pre 2011 actions was $72.5 million in 2011. The vast majority of the remaining reserve balance of $30.0 million is expected to be utilized in 2012. Segments: The $71.0 million of charges recognized in 2011 includes $31.0 million pertaining to CDIY; $30.1 million pertaining to Security; and $9.9 million pertaining to Industrial. In addition to the restructuring charges described in the preceding paragraphs, the Company recognized $136.0 million and $277.9 million of restructuring related costs in 2011 and 2010, respectively, pertaining to the Merger and other acquisition related activity. All of these charges impact gross profit or selling, general and administrate expenses, and include accelerated depreciation and other charges associated with facility closures as well as certain integration related administration and consulting costs. FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity, Sources and Uses of Capital: The Companys primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and available lines of credit under various credit facilities. Operating Activities: Cash flow from operations was $999 million in 2011 compared to $739 million in 2010, representing a $260 million increase. Cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by merger and acquisition related charges and payments of $218 million and $382 million for 2011 and 2010, respectively. After adjusting for the impact of the decrease in merger and acquisition related charges and payments, cash flows from operations improved in 2011 by a net amount of $312 million due to increases in earnings. Cash flow from operations reflects a continued focus on working capital (receivables, inventories and accounts payable), resulting in $134 million of inflows in 2011 and $135 million of inflows in 2010. Working capital turns improved to 7.0 times (excluding Niscayah) at December 31, 2011, as compared to 5.7 times for 2010, which reflects improvements in both days outstanding of accounts receivable and accounts payable, while inventory turns remained consistent. The improvement in overall working capital turns reflects the process driven improvements from SFS. SFS principles continue to be deployed across all businesses and regions to improve working capital efficiency over time. In 2010, cash flow from operations was $739 million, a $202 million increase compared to $537 million in 2009. Cash flows from operations improved in 2010 primarily due to an increase in various non cash expenses associated with the Merger and the other 2010 acquisitions. Such expenses include, among other items, $174 million of inventory step up amortization, a $41 million increase in intangible asset amortization, and a $108 million increase in other depreciation and amortization. Inflows from working capital (receivables, inventories and accounts payable) were $135 million in 2010, compared with inflows of $226 million in 2009. The change from 2009 is driven by higher receivables and inventory associated with improved 2010 sales volume. Working capital turns improved to 5.7 times at January 1, 2011 as compared to 5.2 times for 2009 (pro forma with Black & Decker) due to improvements in days outstanding accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable. Cash flow from operations in 2010 was also negatively impacted by approximately $382 million in payments for merger and acquisition related items including $182 million in discretionary cash contributions to improve the funded status of legacy Black & Decker pension plans. 36 Free Cash Flow: Management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity, as well as its ability to fund future growth and provide a dividend to shareowners. As previously discussed, operating cash flow was affected by $218 million and $382 million of merger and integration related charges and payments in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Additionally, capitalized expenditures include $89 million of Merger and integration spending in 2011. Free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service, other borrowing activity, discretionary dividends on the Companys common stock and business acquisitions, among other items. (Millions of Dollars) 2011 2010 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 999 $ 739 $ 537 Less: capital expenditures (302 ) (185 ) (94 ) Free cash flow $ 697 $ 554 $ 443 When merger and acquisition related charges and payments, along with capital expenditures related to merger and acquisition activity, are added back to the Companys free cash flow, the resulting amounts are $1,004 million in 2011 and $936 million in 2010. Based on its demonstrated ability to generate cash flow from operations as well as its strong balance sheet and credit position at December 31, 2011, the Company believes over the long term it has the financial flexibility to deploy capital to its shareowners advantage through a combination of acquisitions, dividends, and potential future share repurchases. Investing Activities: Cash flow used by investing activities was $1.464 billion in 2011 compared to cash flows provided by investing activities of $270 million in 2010 and cash flow used by investing activities of $115 million in 2009. The majority of the increase in cash outflows is from business acquisitions in 2011 which totaled $1.180 billion largely due to the Companys acquisition of Niscayah, as previously discussed. Aside from Niscayah, the Company completed nine other acquisitions in 2011, the largest of which were Infologix and Microtec, which were purchased for $60 million and $59 million, respectively. In 2010 the Company expended $550 million for ten acquisitions, mainly for CRC Evans within the Industrial segment, and SSDS and GMT within the Security segment. The cash flow provided by investing activities in 2010 also includes $949 million of cash acquired as part of the Merger. During 2009 the Company completed six acquisitions for $24 million. Capital and software expenditures were $302 million in 2011, $185 million in 2010, and $94 million in 2009. The increase in capital expenditures in 2011 was due to the previously mentioned $89 million of Merger and integration related capital expenditures, while the increase in 2010 is primarily due to nine and a half months of Black & Decker purchasing activity. Proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses were $57 million in 2011, $11 million in 2010 and $3 million in 2009. The increase in 2011 reflects $27 million of proceeds from the sale of three businesses. The remaining activity relates to assets sold in the normal course of business. Net financial instrument investing outflows were $39 million in 2011 compared with inflows of $45 million in 2010, pertaining to net investment hedge activity and $30 million of interest rate swap terminations in 2010 following the Merger. Financing Activities: Cash flow used by financing activities was $372 million in 2011 compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of $314 million in 2010 and cash flows used in financing activities of $249 million in 2009. Payments on long term debt amounted to $403 million in 2011, $516 million in 2010, and $65 million in 2009. The 2011 repayments pertain to $400 million of term notes that matured in June 2011. The 2010 repayments primarily relate to the maturing of the $200 million term notes and the $313 million of payments associated with the remarketing of the Convertible Notes. Net repayments of short term borrowings totaled $199 million in 2011, $264 million in 2010 and $120 million in 2009. 37 In November 2011, the Company received $399.6 million in proceeds from the $400 million issuance of senior unsecured 2021 Term Notes with a 3.4% fixed coupon rate. The Company used the proceeds from this offering to pay down commercial paper. In 2010, the Company received debt proceeds of $396.2 million relating to the $400 million in senior unsecured 2040 Term Bonds with a 5.2% fixed coupon rate. In connection with this debt offering the Company paid $48 million for the termination of two forward starting floating to fixed interest rate swaps. In 2010, the Company also completed a security offering of Convertible Preferred Units (the Convertible Preferred Units) which consisted of $632.5 million of eight year junior subordinated notes (the Notes) bearing interest at an initial fixed rate of 4.25% per annum and $632.5 million of five year forward Purchase Contracts (the Purchase Contracts) that obligate investors to purchase 6,325,0000 shares of the Companys 4.75% Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the Convertible Preferred Stock) for a price of $100 per share on November 17, 2015. The Notes initially rank equal in right of payment with all of the Companys other junior subordinated debt. With respect to the offering, the Company received $613.5 million of cash proceeds, net of underwriting fees, and will not receive cash pertaining to the Purchase Contracts until November 2015. The cash proceeds were used to redeem all of the Companys outstanding 5.902% Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debt Securities due 2045 of $312.7 million, to contribute $150.0 million to a U.S. pension plan to improve the funded status of the Companys pension obligations, to fund the $50.3 million cost of the capped call transaction as more fully described below, and the remainder was used to reduce outstanding short term borrowings and for other general corporate purposes. Refer to Note H, Long Term Debt and Financing Instruments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Convertible Preferred Units, Convertible Preferred Stock and the Notes. Simultaneous with the offering of the Convertible Preferred Units, the Company entered into capped call transactions (equity options) with counterparties. The total premium paid in 2010 for the capped call transactions was $50.3 million. Each of the capped call transactions has a term of approximately five years and in aggregate the transactions cover, subject to anti dilution adjustments, the maximum number of the Companys common shares issuable upon settlement of the Convertible Preferred Stock. These transactions provide the Company the right to buy shares of its own common stock from the counterparties at a strike price of $75.00 per share, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the Convertible Preferred Stock, and also obligate the Company to sell shares of its own common stock to the counterparties at a strike price of $97.95. The capped call transactions may be settled by net share settlement or, at the Companys option and subject to certain conditions, cash settlement, or physical settlement. The value received by the Company, if the capped call transactions are exercised when the Companys common stock price is above $75.00 (subject to anti dilution provisions), will be utilized to offset the dilution that may occur should holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock elect to convert. Refer to Note H, Long Term Debt and Financing Arrangements, for further detail. Cash payments for dividends were $276 million, $202 million, and $104 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in cash dividends in 2011 was primarily attributable to the increase in dividends per common share to $0.41 per share, as announced in February 2011 which represents the 44th consecutive year of dividend increases. The increase in 2010 cash dividend payments versus 2009 is due to higher shares outstanding stemming from the Merger. The Company repurchased $11 million of common stock in 2011, $5 million in 2010, and $3 million in 2009. Proceeds from the issuance of common stock totaled $120 million in 2011, $396 million in 2010 and $61 million in 2009. The Company received $320 million of cash proceeds in 2010 from the settlement of the forward stock purchase contracts element of the Equity Units. The remaining amounts in each year mainly relate to the exercise of stock options. 38 Credit Ratings and Liquidity: The Company maintains strong investment grade credit ratings from the major U.S. rating agencies on its senior unsecured debt (average A ), as well as its short term commercial paper borrowings. There have been no changes to any of the ratings during 2011. Failure to maintain strong investment grade rating levels could adversely affect the Companys cost of funds, liquidity and access to capital markets, but would not have an adverse effect on the Companys ability to access committed credit facilities. In March 2011, the Company entered into a new four year $1.2 billion committed credit facility (the Credit Agreement). In connection with entering into the Credit Agreement the Company terminated the existing $800.0 million Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Additionally, the $700.0 million 364 Day Credit Agreement dated as of March 12, 2010 expired in accordance with its terms on March 11, 2011. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement may include U.S. Dollars up to the $1.2 billion commitment or in Euro or Pounds Sterling subject to a foreign currency sublimit of $400.0 million and bear interest at a floating rate dependent upon the denomination of the borrowing. Repayments must be made on March 11, 2015 or upon an earlier termination date of the Credit Agreement, at the election of the Company. The Company has not drawn on the commitments provided by the Credit Agreement. In July 2011, in connection with the Niscayah acquisition, the Company entered into a $1.25 billion 364 day credit facility (Facility). Borrowings under the Facility may include U.S. Dollars or Euros up to the commitment and bear interest at a floating rate dependent upon the denomination of the borrowing. The Facility decreased to $750 million (as per the terms of the agreement) in December 2011 where it will remain until it expires in July 2012, or upon an earlier termination date at the election of the Company. The Company has not drawn on the commitments provided by the Facility. These credit facilities are designated to be liquidity back stops for the Companys commercial paper program. Finally, in August 2011, the Company increased its commercial paper program from $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion. As discussed in Note J, Capital Stock, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, in the third quarter of 2011 the Company entered into a forward share purchase contract on its common stock which obligates the Company to pay $350.0 million to the financial institution counterparty not later than August 2013, or earlier at the Companys option, for the 5,581,400 shares purchased. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $907 million as of December 31, 2011, comprised of $82 million in the U.S. and $825 million in foreign jurisdictions. As of January 1, 2011 cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.743 billion, comprised of $70 million in the U.S. and $1.673 billion in foreign jurisdictions. Concurrent with the Merger, the Company made a determination to repatriate certain legacy Black & Decker foreign earnings, on which U.S. income taxes had not previously been provided. As a result of this repatriation decision, the Company has recorded approximately $421.7 million of associated deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2011. Current plans and liquidity requirements do not demonstrate a need to repatriate other foreign earnings. Accordingly, all other undistributed foreign earnings of the Company are considered to be permanently reinvested, consistent with the Companys overall growth strategy internationally, including acquisitions and long term financial objectives (as demonstrated by the recent acquisition of Niscayah). No provision has been made for taxes that might be payable upon remittance of these undistributed foreign earnings. However, should management determine at a later point to repatriate additional foreign earnings, the Company would be required to accrue and pay taxes at that time. 39 Contractual Obligations: The following summarizes the Companys significant contractual obligations and commitments that impact its liquidity: Payments Due by Period (Millions of Dollars) Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Long term debt(a) $ 3,343 $ 527 $ 912 $ 305 $ 1,599 Interest payments on long term debt(b) 1,238 135 251 159 693 Operating leases 424 123 154 74 73 Inventory purchase commitments(c) 609 609 Deferred compensation 17 2 2 2 11 Marketing obligations 62 34 19 5 4 Derivatives (d) 66 66 Forward stock purchase contract (e) 350 350 Pension funding obligations(f) 110 110 Total contractual cash obligations $ 6,219 $ 1,606 $ 1,688 $ 545 $ 2,380 (a) Future payments on long term debt encompass all payments related to aggregate debt maturities, excluding certain fair value adjustments included in long term debt, as discussed further in Note H, Long Term Debt and Financing Arrangements. (b) Future interest payments on long term debt reflect the applicable fixed interest rate or the variable rate in effect at December 31, 2011 for floating rate debt. (c) Inventory purchase commitments primarily consist of open purchase orders to purchase raw materials, components, and sourced products. (d) Future cash flows on derivative instruments reflect the fair value as of December 31, 2011. The ultimate cash flows on these instruments will differ, perhaps significantly, based on applicable market interest and foreign currency rates at their maturity. (e) The Company is obligated to pay $350 million to the financial institution counterparty to the forward stock purchase contract in August 2013, and may elect to do so earlier. See Note J, Capital Stock, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (f) This amount principally represents contributions either required by regulations or laws or, with respect to unfunded plans, necessary to fund current benefits. The Company has not presented estimated pension and post retirement funding in the table above beyond 2012 as funding can vary significantly from year to year based upon changes in the fair value of the plan assets, actuarial assumptions, and curtailment/settlement actions. To the extent the Company can reliably determine when payments will occur pertaining to unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, the related amount will be included in the table above. However, due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with the $240 million of such liabilities at December 31, 2011, the Company is unable to make a reliable estimate of when (if at all) amounts may be paid to the respective taxing authorities. While there is no tax benefit associated with repayment of debt principal, tax obligations, the forward stock purchase contract and the equity purchase contract fees, payment of the other contractual obligations will typically generate a cash tax benefit such that the net cash outflow will be lower than the gross amounts indicated. 40 Other Significant Commercial Commitments: Amount of Commitment Expirations Per Period (Millions of Dollars) Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter U.S. lines of credit $ 1,950 $ 750 $ $ 1,200 $ Short term borrowings, long term debt and lines of credit are explained in detail within Note H, Long Term Debt and Financing Arrangements, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. MARKET RISK Market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments, currencies, commodities and other items traded in global markets. The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, stock prices, and commodity prices. Exposure to foreign currency risk results because the Company, through its global businesses, enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies. The Companys predominant exposures are in European, Canadian, British, Australian, and Asian currencies, including the Chinese Renminbi (RMB) and the Taiwan Dollar. Certain cross currency trade flows arising from sales and procurement activities as well as affiliate cross border activity are consolidated and netted prior to obtaining risk protection through the use of various derivative financial instruments which may include: purchased basket options; purchased options; collars, cross currency swaps and currency forwards. The Company is thus able to capitalize on its global positioning by taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures and portfolio efficiencies to reduce the cost of purchasing derivative protection. At times, the Company also enters into forward exchange contracts and purchased options to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of non functional currency denominated receivables and payables, predominately for affiliate transactions. Gains and losses from these hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on the underlying net exposures, assets and liabilities being hedged. Management determines the nature and extent of currency hedging activities, and in certain cases, may elect to allow certain currency exposures to remain un hedged. The Company has also entered into cross currency swaps and forward contracts, to provide a partial hedge of the net investments in certain subsidiaries and better match the cash flows of operations to debt service requirements. Management estimates the foreign currency impact from these financial instruments at the end of 2011 would have been approximately a $69 million pre tax loss based on a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in all net derivative currency positions; this effect would occur from depreciation of the foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The Company follows risk management policies in executing derivative financial instrument transactions, and does not use such instruments for speculative purposes. The Company does not hedge the translation of its non U.S. dollar earnings in foreign subsidiaries. As mentioned above, the Company routinely has cross border trade and affiliate flows that cause a transactional impact on earnings from foreign exchange rate movements. The Company is also exposed to currency fluctuation volatility from the translation of foreign earnings into U.S. dollars. It is more difficult to quantify the transactional effects from currency fluctuations than the translational effects. Aside from the use of derivative instruments which may be used to mitigate some of the exposure, transactional effects can potentially be influenced by actions the Company may take; for example, if an exposure occurs from a European entity sourcing product from a U.S. supplier it may be possible to change to a European supplier. Management estimates the combined translational and transactional impact of a 10% overall movement in exchange rates is approximately $101 million, or $0.59 per diluted share. The effect of foreign currency translation on diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was approximately $0.17 favorable in 2011, $0.14 favorable in 2010, and $0.04 unfavorable in 2009. 41 The Companys exposure to interest rate risk results from its outstanding debt and derivative obligations, short term investments, and derivative financial instruments employed in the management of its debt portfolio. The debt portfolio including both trade and affiliate debt, is managed to achieve capital structure targets and reduce the overall cost of borrowing by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt as well as interest rate swaps, and cross currency swaps. The Companys primary exposure to interest rate risk comes from its floating rate debt and derivatives in the U.S. and is fairly represented by changes in LIBOR rates. At December 31, 2011, the impact of a hypothetical 10% increase in the interest rates associated with the Companys floating rate derivative and debt instruments would have an immaterial effect on the Companys financial position and results of operations. The Company has exposure to commodity prices in many businesses, particularly brass, nickel, resin, aluminum, copper, zinc, steel, and energy used in the production of finished goods. Generally, commodity price exposures are not hedged with derivative financial instruments, but instead are actively managed through customer product and service pricing actions, procurement driven cost reduction initiatives and other productivity improvement projects. The Company experienced inflation, primarily commodity related, of approximately $236 million and $70 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively, while it experienced mild deflation in 2009. Price erosion has also occurred in 2011 and 2010, in addition to inflation, with the cumulative unfavorable impact exceeding $320 million. The impact of inflation is expected to continue in 2012, with cost and pricing actions being aggressively pursued to offset any adverse impact on operations. Fluctuations in the fair value of the Companys common stock affect domestic retirement plan expense as discussed in the ESOP section of MD&A. Additionally, the Company has $30 million of liabilities as of December 31, 2011 pertaining to unfunded defined contribution plans for certain U.S. employees for which there is mark to market exposure. The assets held by the Companys defined benefit plans are exposed to fluctuations in the market value of securities, primarily global stocks and fixed income securities. The funding obligations for these plans would increase in the event of adverse changes in the plan asset values, although such funding would occur over a period of many years. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were $119 million, $138 million and $48 million in investment returns on pension plan assets, respectively. The Company expects funding obligations on its defined benefit plans to be approximately $110 million in 2012. The Company employs diversified asset allocations to help mitigate this risk. Management has worked to minimize this exposure by freezing and terminating defined benefit plans where appropriate. The Company has access to financial resources and borrowing capabilities around the world. There are no instruments within the debt structure that would accelerate payment requirements due to a change in credit rating. The Companys existing credit facilities and sources of liquidity, including operating cash flows, are considered more than adequate to conduct business as normal. Accordingly, based on present conditions and past history, management believes it is unlikely that operations will be materially affected by any potential deterioration of the general credit markets that may occur. The Company believes that its strong financial position, operating cash flows, committed long term credit facilities and borrowing capacity, and ready access to equity markets provide the financial flexibility necessary to continue its record of annual dividend payments, to invest in the routine needs of its businesses, to make strategic acquisitions and to fund other initiatives encompassed by its growth strategy and maintain its strong investment grade credit ratings. 42 OTHER MATTERS Employee Stock Ownership Plan As detailed in Note L, Employee Benefit Plans, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has an ESOP under which the ongoing U.S. Cornerstone and 401(K) defined contribution plans are funded. Overall ESOP expense is affected by the market value of the Companys stock on the monthly dates when shares are released, among other factors. The Companys net ESOP activity resulted in expense of $28.4 million in 2011, expense of $3.4 million in 2010 and income of $8.0 million in 2009. The ESOP expense increased in 2011 compared to 2010 due to the merger of Black & Decker U.S. defined contribution plan into the ESOP in 2011. The ESOP income in 2009 stems from the suspension of the Cornerstone benefits and the reduction of the 401(K) match, as a percentage of employee contributions, as part of cost saving actions. ESOP expense could increase in the future if the market value of the Companys common stock declines. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Preparation of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements are described in Note A, Significant Accounting Policies. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the Consolidated Financial Statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters with inherent uncertainty. The most significant areas involving management estimates are described below. Actual results in these areas could differ from managements estimates. ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS The Companys estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on two methods. The amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved. First, a specific reserve is established for individual accounts where information indicates the customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations. In these cases, management uses its judgment, based on the surrounding facts and circumstances, to record a specific reserve for those customers against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected. These specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received. Second, a reserve is determined for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to receivable aging categories. These percentages are based on historical collection and write off experience. If circumstances change, for example, due to the occurrence of higher than expected defaults or a significant adverse change in a major customers ability to meet its financial obligation to the Company, estimates of the recoverability of receivable amounts due could be reduced. INVENTORIES LOWER OF COST OR MARKET, SLOW MOVING AND OBSOLETE Inventories in the U.S. are predominantly valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market, while non U.S. inventories are valued at the lower of FIFO cost or market. The calculation of LIFO reserves, and therefore the net inventory valuation, is affected by inflation and deflation in inventory components. The Company ensures all inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market, and continually reviews the carrying value of discontinued product lines and stock keeping units (SKUs) to determine that these items are properly valued. The Company also continually evaluates the composition of its inventory and identifies obsolete and or slow moving inventories. Inventory items identified as obsolete and or slow moving are evaluated to determine if write downs are required. The Company assesses the ability to dispose of these inventories at a price greater than cost. If it is determined that cost is less than market value, cost is used for inventory valuation. If market value is less than cost, the Company writes down the related inventory to that value. If a write down to the current market value is necessary, the market value cannot be greater than the net realizable value, or ceiling (defined as selling price less costs to sell and dispose), and cannot be lower than the net realizable value less a normal profit margin, also called the floor. If the Company is not able to achieve its expectations regarding net realizable value of inventory at its current value, further write downs would be recorded. 43 GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS The Company acquires businesses in purchase transactions that result in the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets. The determination of the value of intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350 20 Goodwill acquired goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing at least annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists. Definite lived intangible assets are amortized and are tested for impairment when appropriate. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses. The Company reported $6.920 billion of goodwill, $1.633 billion of indefinite lived trade names and $1.484 billion of definite lived intangibles at December 31, 2011. Management tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment as defined in ASC 280, Segment Reporting, or one level below an operating segment (component level) as determined by the availability of discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by operating segment management or an aggregate of component levels of a reportable operating segment having similar economic characteristics. If the carrying value of a reporting unit (including the value of goodwill) is greater than its fair value, an impairment may exist. An impairment charge would be recorded to the extent that the recorded value of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value. The Company assesses the fair value of its reporting units based on a discounted cash flow valuation model. The key assumptions used are discount rates and perpetual growth rates applied to cash flow projections. Also inherent in the discounted cash flow valuation are near term revenue growth rates over the next five years. These assumptions contemplate business, market and overall economic conditions. The fair value of indefinite lived trade names is also assessed using a discounted cash flow valuation model. The key assumptions used include discount rates, royalty rates, and perpetual growth rates applied to the projected sales. As required by the Companys policy, goodwill and indefinite lived trade names were tested for impairment in the third quarter of 2011. Based on this testing, the Company determined that the fair value of its reporting units and indefinite lived trade names exceeded their carrying values. The discount rates used in testing goodwill ranged from 8.5% to 11.5%. The near term growth rates and perpetual growth rates, which varied for each reporting unit, ranged from approximately 3% to 10% and 2% to 4%, respectively. Management performed sensitivity analyses on the fair values resulting from the discounted cash flows valuation utilizing more conservative assumptions that reflect reasonably likely future changes in the discount rate and perpetual growth rate in all reporting units. The discount rate was decreased by 100 basis points with no impairment indicated. The perpetual growth rates were decreased by 150 basis points with no impairment indicated. Based upon the Companys 2011 annual impairment testing analysis, including the consideration of reasonably likely adverse changes in assumptions described above, management believes it is not reasonably likely that an impairment will occur in any of the reporting units over the next twelve months. In the event that the Companys operating results in the future do not meet current expectations, management, based upon conditions at the time, would consider taking restructuring or other actions as necessary to maximize profitability. Accordingly, the above sensitivity analysis, while a useful tool, should not be used as a sole predictor of impairment. A thorough analysis of all the facts and circumstances existing at that time would need to be performed to determine if recording an impairment loss was appropriate. DEFINED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS The valuation of pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations is dependent on various assumptions. These assumptions, which are updated annually, include discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future salary increase rates, and health care cost trend rates. The Company considers current market conditions, including interest rates, to establish these assumptions. Discount rates are developed considering the yields available on high quality fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to the duration of the related benefit obligations. The Companys weighted average discount rates for the United States and international pension plans were 4.25% and 5.0%, respectively at December 31, 2011. 44 The Companys weighted average discount rate for both the United States and international pension plans was 5.25% at January 1, 2011. As discussed further in Note L, Employee Benefit Plans, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company develops the expected return on plan assets considering various factors, which include its targeted asset allocation percentages, historic returns, and expected future returns. For 2011 net periodic benefit cost the Companys expected rate of return assumption was 7.0% for both United States and international plans. The Company will use a 6.25% expected rate of return assumption for 2012 net periodic benefit cost reflecting a relatively higher proportion of fixed income plan assets. A 25 basis point reduction in the expected rate of return assumption would increase 2012 net periodic benefit cost by approximately $4 million, pre tax. The Company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate; however, differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect the Companys financial position or results of operations. To the extent that actual (newly measured) results differ from the actuarial assumptions, the difference is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, and, if in excess of a specified corridor, amortized over future periods. The expected return on plan assets is determined using the expected rate of return and the fair value of plan assets. Accordingly, market fluctuations in the fair value of plan assets can affect the net periodic benefit cost in the following year. The projected benefit obligation for defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $758 million at December 31, 2011. A 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate would have increased the projected benefit obligation by approximately $87 million at December 31, 2011. The primary Black & Decker U.S pension and post employment benefit plans were curtailed in late 2010, as well as the only material Black & Decker international plan, and in their place the Company implemented defined contribution benefit plans. As of December 31, 2011, 83% of the projected benefit obligation pertains to plans that have been frozen; the remaining defined benefit plans that are not frozen are predominantly small domestic union plans and those that are statutorily mandated in certain international jurisdictions. The Company recognized $32 million of defined benefit plan expense in 2011, which may fluctuate in future years depending upon various factors including future discount rates and actual returns on plan assets. ENVIRONMENTAL The Company incurs costs related to environmental issues as a result of various laws and regulations governing current operations as well as the remediation of previously contaminated sites. Future laws and regulations are expected to be increasingly stringent and will likely increase the Companys expenditures related to routine environmental matters. The Companys policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The amount of liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. The liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties. As assessments and remediation progress at individual sites, the amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had reserves of $165 million for remediation activities associated with Company owned properties as well as for Superfund sites, for losses that are probable and estimable. The range of environmental remediation costs that is reasonably possible is $140 million to $355 million which is subject to change in the near term. The Company may be liable for environmental remediation of sites it no longer owns. Liabilities have been recorded on those sites in accordance with this policy. INCOME TAXES Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized, using enacted tax rates, for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets, including net operating losses, are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 45 In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considers all positive and negative evidence including; estimates of future taxable income, considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies, the reliability of tax loss carry forwards and the future reversal of existing temporary differences. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels. In the event the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future, the unrealizable amount would be charged to earnings in the period in which that determination is made. By contrast, if the Company were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts, it would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a favorable adjustment to earnings in the period in which that determination is made. The company is subject to tax in a number of locations, including many state and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required when calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized benefit with respect to certain of our unrecognized tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months. These changes may be the result of settlement of ongoing audits or final decisions in transfer pricing matters. The Company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still under audit based on the most current available information, which involves inherent uncertainty. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. The Company recognizes interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of income taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. See Note Q, Income Taxes, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. RISK INSURANCE To manage its insurance costs efficiently, the Company self insures for certain U.S. business exposures and generally has low deductible plans internationally. For domestic workers compensation, automobile and product liability (liability for alleged injuries associated with the Companys products), the Company generally purchases outside insurance coverage only for severe losses (stop loss insurance) and these lines of insurance involve the most significant accounting estimates. While different stop loss deductibles exist for each of these lines of insurance, the maximum stop loss deductible is set at no more than $5 million per occurrence and $49 million in the aggregate per annum. The process of establishing risk insurance reserves includes consideration of actuarial valuations that reflect the Companys specific loss history, actual claims reported, and industry trends among statistical and other factors to estimate the range of reserves required. Risk insurance reserves are comprised of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts expected for development of these claims, as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims discounted to present value. The cash outflows related to risk insurance claims are expected to occur over a maximum of 13 years. The Company believes the liabilities recorded for these U.S. risk insurance reserves, totaling $112 million and $106 million as of December 31, 2011 and January 1, 2011, respectively, are adequate. Due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate. WARRANTY The Company provides product and service warranties which vary across its businesses. The types of warranties offered generally range from one year to limited lifetime, while certain products carry no warranty. Further, the Company sometimes incurs discretionary costs to service its products in connection with product performance issues. Historical warranty and service claim experience forms the basis for warranty obligations recognized. Adjustments are recorded to the warranty liability as new information becomes available. The Company believes the $129 million reserve for expected warranty claims as of December 31, 2011 is adequate, but due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process, including forecasting future product reliability levels and costs of repair as well as the estimated age of certain products submitted for claims, the 46 ultimate claim costs may differ from the recorded warranty liability. The Company also establishes a reserve for product recalls on a product specific basis during the period in which the circumstances giving rise to the recall become known and estimable for both company initiated actions and those required by regulatory bodies. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENT SYNTHETIC LEASES The Company is a party to synthetic leasing programs for one of its major distribution centers and certain U.S. personal property, predominately vehicles and equipment. The programs qualify as operating leases for accounting purposes, such that only the monthly rent expense is recorded in the Statement of Operations and the liability and value of the underlying assets are off balance sheet. These lease programs are utilized primarily to reduce overall cost and to retain flexibility. The cash outflows for lease payments approximate the $6 million of rent expense recognized in fiscal 2011. As of December 31, 2011 the estimated fair value of assets and remaining obligations for these properties were $36 million and $32 million, respectively. 47 CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 Certain statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K that are not historical, including but not limited to those regarding the Companys ability to: (i) meet its long term financial objectives including: 4 6% organic revenue growth; 10 12% total revenue growth; mid teens percentage EPS growth; free cash flow greater than or equal to net income; ROCE between 12 15%; continued dividend growth; and a strong investment grade credit rating; (ii) meet its long term capital allocation objectives pertaining to free cash flow including, investing approximately 2/3 in acquisitions and returning approximately 1/3 to shareowners as the Company remains committed to dividend growth and opportunistic share buy backs; (iii) achieve approximately $80 million in cost synergies in connection with the acquisition of Niscayah by the end of 2013; (iv) achieve a benefit of approximately $0.45 of earnings per diluted share (excluding expected acquisition related charges of $60 $80 million) by 2014 as a result of the Niscayah acquisition; (v) achieve $450 million ($485 million on an annualized basis) in cost synergies by the end of 2012 in connection with the integration of Black & Decker which will help fuel future profit growth and facilitate global cost leadership; (vi) achieve $300 million to $400 million in revenue synergies by 2013 resulting from the Merger, which implies a benefit of $0.35 to $0.50 of earnings per diluted share; and (vii) generate full year 2012 diluted earnings per share in the range of $4.71 to $4.97; generate full year 2012 EPS in the range of $5.75 to $6.00 per diluted share (excluding merger & acquisition related charges); and generate free cash flow for 2012 (excluding merger & acquisition related charges and payments) of approximately $1.2 billion (collectively, the Results); are forward looking statements and subject to risk and uncertainty.
