ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following information should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the financial statements and the notes thereto included in Item 8 of this report and with the discussion below on "Forward Looking Information." RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Southwestern reported record net income of $35.3 million in 2001, or $1.38 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared to a net loss of $46.7 million in 2000, or $1.86 per share, and net income of $9.9 million in 1999, or $.40 per share. The loss for 2000 includes one time charges for unusual items, including a $109.3 million judgment in the Hales lawsuit and $2.0 million for other litigation, an extraordinary loss on the early retirement of debt, and a $3.2 million gain from the sale of the Companys Missouri utility properties. Exclusive of these one time charges and the gain on sale, net income for 2000 would have been $20.5 million, or $.82 per share. Results for both 2001 and 2000 (excluding unusual items) reflect growth in oil and gas production volumes and higher oil and gas prices realized. Results for 1999 were negatively impacted by lower wellhead prices for the Companys oil and gas production and by unseasonably warm weather. Exploration and Production The Companys exploration and production segments revenue, profitability and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for natural gas and oil, which are dependent upon numerous factors beyond its control, such as economic, political and regulatory developments and competition from other sources of energy. The energy markets have historically been very volatile, and there can be no assurance that oil and gas prices will not be subject to wide fluctuations in the future. 2001 2000 1999 Revenues (in thousands) $ 153,937 $ 110,920 $ 75,039 Operating income (loss) (in thousands) $ 69,340 $ (70,584)(1) $ 16,451 Gas production (Bcf) 35.5 31.6 29.4 Oil production (MBbls) 719 676 578 Total production (Bcfe) 39.8 35.7 32.9 Average gas price per Mcf $ 3.85 $ 2.88 $ 2.21 Average oil price per Bbl $ 23.55 $ 22.99 $ 17.11 Operating expenses per Mcfe Production expenses $ 0.45 $ 0.40 $ 0.35 Production taxes $ 0.17 $ 0.15 $ 0.09 General & administrative expenses $ 0.34 $ 0.32 $ 0.30 Full cost pool amortization $ 1.14 $ 1.06 $ 1.00 (1) Includes a charge of $109.3 million for the Hales judgment and a charge of $2.0 million related to other litigation. Excluding these unusual items, operating income for the exploration and production segment would have been $40.7 million for 2000. Revenues and Operating Income The Companys exploration and production revenues increased 39% in 2001 and 48% in 2000. The increases were due to increases in production and higher average prices received. Operating income of the exploration and production segment was $69.3 million in 2001 compared to $40.7 million in 2000, excluding the impact of the Hales judgment and the other unusual items, and $16.5 million in 1999. The increase in 2001 was due to an 11% increase in equivalent oil and gas production and higher oil and gas prices realized, partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses. The increase in 2000 was due to an 8% increase in equivalent oil and gas production and higher oil and gas prices realized, partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses. Production and Sales Gas and oil production totaled 39.8 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe) in 2001, 35.7 Bcfe in 2000 and 32.9 Bcfe in 1999. The increase in 2001 production volumes resulted from the Companys continued exploration and development of its South Louisiana properties, the development of its Overton Field in East Texas and increased production in the Arkoma Basin. 20 The increase in 2000 production volumes resulted from new wells added in 2000 and 1999 in the Companys Permian Basin and South Louisiana operating areas, partially offset by the loss of production from certain wells in the Companys Mid Continent operating area that were sold at auction during 2000. Gas sales to unaffiliated purchasers were 30.4 Bcf in 2001, up from 23.8 Bcf in 2000 and 21.2 Bcf in 1999. Sales to unaffiliated purchasers are primarily made under contracts which reflect current short term prices and which are subject to seasonal price swings. Intersegment sales to the Companys utility subsidiary, Arkansas Western Gas Company (Arkansas Western) were 5.1 Bcf in 2001, 7.8 Bcf in 2000 and 8.2 Bcf in 1999. See "Gas Distribution Operating Costs and Expenses" below for further discussion of the utilitys gas purchases. The decrease in sales in 2001 was caused by Arkansas Westerns reduced supply requirements due to warmer weather and the sale of the utilitys Missouri gas distribution properties in May 2000. Weather in 2001, as measured in degree days, was 9% warmer than both normal and the prior year in Arkansas Westerns service territory. Weather was normal in 2000 and 21% colder than 1999; however, sales to Arkansas Western decreased in 2000 due to the sale of the utilitys Missouri properties. The Companys gas production provided approximately 33% of the utilitys requirements in 2001, 42% in 2000 and 41% in 1999. Future sales to Arkansas Westerns gas distribution systems will be dependent upon the Companys success in obtaining gas supply contracts with the utility systems. In the future, the Company will continue to bid to obtain these gas supply contracts, although there is no assurance that it will be successful. If successful, the Company cannot predict the amount of premium that would be associated with the new contracts. The Company expects future increases in its gas production to come primarily from sales to unaffiliated purchasers. The Company is unable to predict changes in the market demand and price for natural gas, including changes which may be induced by the effects of weather on demand of both affiliated and unaffiliated customers for the Companys production. Additionally, the Company holds a large amount of undeveloped leasehold acreage and producing acreage, and has an inventory of drilling leads, prospects and seismic data that will continue to be evaluated and developed in the future. The Companys exploration programs have been directed primarily toward natural gas in recent years. Commodity Prices The average price realized for the Companys gas production was $3.85 per Mcf in 2001, $2.88 per Mcf in 2000, and $2.21 per Mcf in 1999. The changes in the average price realized primarily reflects changes in average annual spot market prices and the effects of the Companys price hedging activities. The Companys hedging activities lowered the average gas price $.31 per Mcf in 2001, $1.04 per Mcf in 2000, and $.06 per Mcf in 1999. Additionally, the Company has historically received monthly demand charges related to sales made to its utility segment which has increased the Companys average gas price realized. The Company periodically enters into hedging activities with respect to a portion of its projected crude oil and natural gas production through a variety of financial arrangements intended to support oil and gas prices at targeted levels and to minimize the impact of price fluctuations (see Item 7A of this Form 10 K and Note 8 of the financial statements for additional discussion). The Companys policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings. At December 31, 2001, the Company had hedges in place on 33.0 Bcf of gas. Subsequent to December 31, 2001 and prior to March 13, 2002, the Company hedged an additional 10.5 Bcf of future gas production. There were no hedges in place at December 31, 2001 on the Companys future oil production. Subsequent to December 31, 2001 and prior to March 13, 2002, the Company hedged 277,500 barrels of its 2002 oil production. The Company currently has hedged approximately 65% of its 2002 anticipated gas production level and 40% of its anticipated oil production level. Disregarding the impact of hedges, the Company expects the average price it receives for its gas production to be approximately $.05 to $.10 per Mcf lower than average spot market prices, as market differentials that reduce the average prices received are partially offset by demand charges it receives under the contracts covering its intersegment sales to the Companys utility systems. Future changes in revenues from sales of the Companys gas production will be dependent upon changes in the market price for gas, access to new markets, maintenance of existing markets, and additions of new gas reserves. The Company realized an average price of $23.55 per barrel for its oil production for the year ended December 31, 2001, up from $22.99 per barrel for 2000 and $17.11 per barrel for 1999. The Companys hedging activities lowered the average oil price $.03 per barrel in 2001 and $6.39 per barrel in 2000. Hedges had no impact on the average realized oil price in 1999. Disregarding the impact of hedges, the Company expects the average price it receives for its oil production to be approximately $1.00 per barrel lower than average spot market prices, as market differentials reduce the average prices received. Operating Costs and Expenses Production expenses per Mcfe for this business segment were $.45 in 2001, compared to $.40 in 2000 and $.35 in 1999. Production taxes per Mcfe were $.17 in 2001, compared to $.15 in 2000 and $.09 in 1999. The increase in unit production 21 expenses in 2001 was due to increased workover expenses and an industry wide increase in costs related to normal production activities. The increase in unit production expenses in 2000 was due primarily to an increase in workover expenses. The increases in 2001 and 2000 production taxes per Mcfe were due to increased severance and ad valorem taxes that resulted from higher commodity prices. General and administrative expenses per Mcfe were $.34 in 2001, compared to $.32 in 2000 and $.30 in 1999. The increase in general and administrative costs per Mcfe in 2001 was due primarily to increased legal costs related to the resolution of litigation. The increase in general and administrative costs in 2000 as compared to 1999 resulted primarily from increases in incentive compensation pay that is dependent upon the operating results for this segment. The Companys full cost pool amortization rate averaged $1.14 per Mcfe for 2001, compared to $1.06 in 2000 and $1.00 in 1999. The rate increased in 2001 as compared to 2000 due primarily to negative revisions of proved reserves that resulted from a decline in average gas prices and to a $6.6 million decline in the balance of unevaluated costs excluded from amortization in the full cost pool. The average rate increased in 2000 due primarily to a $9.9 million decline in the balance of unevaluated costs excluded from amortization. The Company utilizes the full cost method of accounting for costs related to its oil and natural gas properties. Under this method, all such costs (productive and nonproductive) are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method. These capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test, however, which limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved gas and oil reserves discounted at 10 percent (standardized measure) plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties. Any costs in excess of this ceiling are written off as a non cash expense. The expense may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher oil and gas prices may subsequently increase the ceiling. Full cost companies must use the prices in effect at the end of each accounting quarter to calculate the ceiling value of its reserves. At December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, the Companys unamortized costs of oil and gas properties did not exceed this ceiling amount. At December 31, 2001, the Companys standardized measure was calculated based upon quoted market prices of $2.65 per Mcf for gas and $19.84 per barrel for oil, adjusted for market differentials. A decline in oil and gas prices from year end 2001 levels or other factors, without other mitigating circumstances, could cause a future write down of capitalized costs and a non cash charge against future earnings. In 2001, the Companys subsidiary, Southwestern Energy Production Company (SEPCO), formed a limited partnership with an investor to drill and complete the first 14 development wells in SEPCOs Overton Field located in Smith County, Texas. This partnership was created to provide capital necessary to accelerate the fields development. The Overton properties were acquired by SEPCO in April 2000 and have multiple development locations through the downspacing of the existing producing units. Because SEPCO is the sole general partner and owns a majority interest in the partnership, operating and financial results for the partnership are consolidated with the other operations of the Company and the investors share of the partnership activity is reported as a minority interest item in the financial statements. During 2001, the minority interest owner in the partnership contributed $13.5 million in capital to the limited partnership and received distributions of $1.5 million. The investors share of 2001 revenues, less operating costs and expenses, was $.9 million. Inflation impacts the Company by generally increasing its operating costs and the costs of its capital additions. The effects of inflation on the Companys operations prior to 2000 have been minimal due to low inflation rates. However, during both 2001 and 2000, the impact of inflation intensified in certain areas of the Companys exploration and production segment as shortages in drilling rigs, third party services and qualified labor developed due to an overall increase in the activity level of the domestic oil and gas industry. The Company anticipates that this impact is now decreasing along with the current level of commodity prices. Gas Distribution The operating results of the Companys gas distribution segment are highly seasonal. The extent and duration of heating weather also impacts the profitability of this segment, although the Company has a weather normalization clause that lessens the impact of revenue increases and decreases which might result from weather variations during the winter heating season. The gas distribution segments profitability is also dependent upon the timing and amount of regulatory rate increases that are filed with and approved by the Arkansas Public Service Commission (APSC). For periods subsequent to allowed rate increases, the Companys profitability is impacted by its ability to manage and control this segments operating costs and expenses. On May 31, 2000, the Company completed the sale of its Missouri gas distribution assets for $32.0 million. The sale resulted in a pretax gain of approximately $3.2 million and proceeds from the sale were used to pay down debt. As a result of the adverse Hales judgment, the Companys Board of Directors authorized management to pursue the sale of the Companys remaining gas distribution operations. The sale process did not result in an acceptable bid and the Company currently plans to operate these assets as a continuing part of its business. 22 2001 2000 1999 ($ in thousands except for Mcf amounts) Revenues $ 147,282 $ 151,234 $ 132,420 Gas purchases $ 96,058 $ 93,992 $ 68,876 Operating costs and expenses $ 40,878 $ 42,587 $ 46,357 Operating income $ 10,346 $ 14,655 $ 17,187 Deliveries (Bcf) Sales and end use transportation 24.0 30.4 31.6 Off system transportation 3.1 3.1 4.8 Average number of customers 134,041 152,773 177,328 Average sales rate per Mcf $ 8.26 $ 6.55 $ 5.67 Heating weather degree days 3,654 3,994 3,179 Percent of normal 91% 100% 79% Note: Data for 2000 and 1999 includes the operations of the Companys Missouri properties through the sale date of May 31, 2000. Excluding the Missouri operations, operating income would have been $12.6 million in 2000 and $14.6 million in 1999. Revenues and Operating Income Gas distribution revenues fluctuate due to the pass through of gas supply cost changes and the effects of weather. Because of the corresponding changes in purchased gas costs, the revenue effect of the pass through of gas cost changes has not materially affected net income. Gas distribution revenues decreased 3% in 2001 and increased 14% in 2000. The decrease in 2001 was due to the loss of revenues resulting from the sale of the utilitys Missouri assets and the effects of warmer weather, partially offset by a higher unit sales rate caused by high gas prices. The increase in 2000 was due to a higher sales rate and increased sales volumes caused by colder weather, partially offset by the loss of revenues resulting from the sale of the utilitys Missouri assets in May 2000. Weather during 2001 in the utilitys service territory was 9% warmer than both normal and the prior year. Weather in 2000 was normal and 21% colder than the prior year. Operating income for Southwesterns utility systems decreased 29% in 2001 and 15% in 2000. The decrease in 2001 resulted from the full year impact of the sale of the utilitys Missouri assets, the effects of warmer weather that were not fully offset by the Companys weather normalization clause in its tariffs and increased bad debt expense caused by record high natural gas prices experienced in the first part of 2001. The decrease in 2000 resulted from the sale of the Missouri assets and a $1.4 million annual rate reduction that was implemented in December 1999. Deliveries and Rates In 2001, Arkansas Western sold 17.0 Bcf to its customers at an average rate of $8.26 per Mcf, compared to 22.1 Bcf at $6.55 per Mcf in 2000 and 21.9 Bcf at $5.67 per Mcf in 1999. Additionally, Arkansas Western transported 7.0 Bcf in 2001, 8.3 Bcf in 2000 and 9.6 Bcf in 1999 for its end use customers. The decrease in volumes sold and transported in 2001 resulted from the sale of the utilitys Missouri properties and warmer weather. The decrease in the combined volumes sold and transported in 2000 resulted from the sale of the Missouri properties, partially offset by increased deliveries due to colder weather. The fluctuations in the average sales rates reflect changes in the average cost of gas purchased for delivery to the Companys customers, which are passed through to customers under automatic adjustment clauses. Total deliveries to industrial customers of the utility segment, including transportation volumes, were 9.5 Bcf in 2001, 11.8 Bcf in 2000 and 13.1 Bcf in 1999. The decline in deliveries in 2001 resulted from warmer heating weather and the sale of the utilitys Missouri assets. In 2000, the decline resulted from the sale of the Missouri assets. Arkansas Western also transported 3.1 Bcf of gas through its gathering system in both 2001 and 2000 for off system deliveries, all to the Ozark Gas Transmission System, compared to 4.8 Bcf in 1999. The level of off system deliveries each year generally reflects the changes of on system demands of the Companys gas distribution systems for the Companys gas production. The average off system transportation rate was approximately $.13 per Mcf, exclusive of fuel, in 2001 and $.10 per Mcf in 2000 and 1999. Gas distribution revenues in future years will be impacted by the utilitys gas purchase costs, customer growth and rate increases allowed by the APSC. In recent years, Arkansas Western has experienced customer growth of approximately 2% to 3% annually in its Northwest Arkansas service territory, while it has experienced little or no customer growth in its service 23 territory in Northeast Arkansas. Based on current economic conditions in the Companys service territories, the Company expects this trend in customer growth to continue. Tariffs implemented in Arkansas as a result of rate increases in both 1996 and 1997 contain a weather normalization clause to lessen the impact of revenue increases and decreases which might result from weather variations during the winter heating season. Rate increase requests, which may be filed in the future, will depend on customer growth, increases in operating expenses, and additional investment in property, plant and equipment. See "Regulatory Matters" below for additional discussion. Operating Costs and Expenses The changes in purchased gas costs for the gas distribution segment reflect volumes purchased, prices paid for supplies, the mix of purchases from intercompany versus third party sources and the sale of Missouri assets as discussed above. Other operating costs and expenses of the gas distribution segment decreased in both 2001 and 2000 due primarily to the sale of the utilitys Missouri assets. Operating costs in 2001 included increased bad debt expense caused by high natural gas prices. In October 1998, Arkansas Western instituted a competitive bidding process for its gas supply. These bid requests included replacement of the gas supply and no notice service previously provided by a long term gas supply contract between Arkansas Western and one of the Companys exploration and production subsidiaries, SEECO, Inc. (SEECO). In the initial 1998 bid, SEECO, along with the Companys marketing subsidiary, successfully bid on five of seven gas supply packages with prices based on the Reliant East Index plus a demand charge. Based on normal weather patterns, the volumes of gas projected to be supplied under these contracts were approximately equal to the historical annual volumes sold under the expired long term contract. However, under the new contracts, SEECO supplied most of Arkansas Westerns no notice service and less of its routine base requirements than it had under the previous contract. As a result, during periods of warmer weather, lower total gas volumes would be purchased by Arkansas Western than compared to periods of normal or colder weather. All of the bid packages originally secured by the Companys subsidiaries in 1998 have now expired. During the third quarter of 2001, SEECO successfully bid on gas supply packages representing approximately half of the requirements for Arkansas Western for 2002. SEECO was unsuccessful in bidding on a no notice gas supply package that it previously held that generated a significant portion of the demand charges it received on affiliated sales. Other purchases by Arkansas Western are made under long term contracts with flexible pricing provisions. Inflation impacts the Companys gas distribution segment by generally increasing its operating costs and the costs of its capital additions. The effects of inflation on the utilitys operations in recent years have been minimal due to low inflation rates. Additionally, delays inherent in the rate making process prevent the Company from obtaining immediate recovery of increased operating costs of its gas distribution segment. Regulatory Matters Arkansas Westerns rates and operations are regulated by the APSC. It operates through municipal franchises that are perpetual by state law, but are not exclusive within a geographic area. Although its rates for gas delivered to its retail customers are not regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), its transmission and gathering pipeline systems are subject to the FERCs regulations concerning open access transportation. As the regulatory focus of the natural gas industry has shifted from the federal level to the state level, some utilities across the nation have unbundled residential sales services from transportation services in an effort to promote greater competition. No such legislation or regulatory directives related to natural gas are presently pending in Arkansas. In Arkansas, the state legislature enacted Act 1556 for the deregulation of the retail sale of electricity by 2002. Act 1556 was modified by Act 324 of 2001 delaying the implementation of electric deregulation to not earlier than October 2003 and no later than October 2005. In December 2001, the APSC submitted its annual report to the Arkansas legislature on the development of electric deregulation and recommended that the legislature consider suspending deregulation to the year 2010 or 2012, or repeal Act 1556 (as modified by Act 324). It is unknown what final legislation will be adopted or, if it is adopted, what its final form will be. If electric deregulation occurs in Arkansas, legislative or regulatory precedents may be set that would also affect natural gas utilities in the future. These issues may include further unbundling of services and the regulatory treatment of stranded costs. Arkansas Western has historically maintained a substantial price advantage over electricity for most applications. This has enabled the utility to achieve excellent market penetration levels. However, during 2001 the high gas prices experienced in the 2000 2001 heating season temporarily eroded the price advantage. Arkansas Western has now regained its price advantage in substantially all markets as gas prices have declined. Arkansas Westerns most recent rate increase was approved in December 1996 for the utilitys Northwest region and in December 1997 for the Northeast region. The APSC approved increases of $5.1 million and $1.2 million, respectively. During 1999, the APSC initiated a proceeding in which it sought a $2.3 million reduction in the rates for the Northwest region. 24 In late 1999, the APSC and Arkansas Western reached a settlement in which the Northwest regions rates were reduced by $1.4 million. The reduction was primarily due to a downward adjustment to the return on equity that the APSC had established in the 1996 rate case. While Arkansas Western continues to experience customer growth and has aggressively controlled its costs, its return on investment has declined in recent years. The Company anticipates that it will seek rate relief to improve Arkansas Westerns profitability by filing a rate increase application with the APSC during 2002. In February 2001, the APSC approved a 90 day temporary tariff to collect additional gas costs not yet billed to customers through the utilitys normal purchased gas adjustment clause in its approved tariffs. The Company had under recovered purchased gas costs of $12.9 million in current assets at December 31, 2000. The level of under recovered costs had increased significantly during January 2001 as a result of rapidly increasing gas costs. The temporary tariff allowed the utility accelerated recovery of the gas costs it had incurred during the 2000 2001 winter heating season. In June 2001, the APSC established a set of policy principles for gas procurement for utilities. The APSC intends for these policy principles to guide utilities in their gas purchasing decisions. Utilities are required to take all reasonable and prudent steps necessary to develop a diversified gas supply portfolio. The portfolio should consist of an appropriate combination of different types of gas purchase contracts and or financial hedging instruments that are designed to yield the optimum balance of reliability, reduced volatility and reasonable price. Utilities will be required to submit on an annual basis their gas supply plan, along with their contracting and or hedging objectives, to the APSCs General Staff for review and determination as to whether it is consistent with these policy principles. If the plan includes a hedging strategy and it is determined to be consistent with the objectives of the policy principles, utilities will be allowed to flow any hedging gain or loss to customers through the purchased gas adjustment clause. During 2001, Arkansas Western submitted to the General Staff its annual gas supply plan for the 2001 2002 heating season and a revision to its purchased gas adjustment clause for the recovery of hedging gains and losses. Arkansas Westerns gas supply plan and the revision to its purchased gas adjustment clause were both approved by the APSC. Arkansas Western also purchases gas from unaffiliated producers under take or pay contracts. The Company believes that it does not have a significant exposure to liabilities resulting from these contracts and expects to be able to continue to satisfactorily manage its exposure to take or pay liabilities. In connection with the sale of its Missouri utility operations in 2000, the Company retained responsibility for five unresolved cases pertaining to the Missouri Public Service Commissions (MPSC) annual review of Arkansas Westerns gas cost purchasing practices and gas cost recovery. In November 2001, the MPSC approved a stipulation and agreement that settled all five cases. The settlement did not have a material effect on the Companys results of operations. Marketing and Other Marketing 2001 2000 1999 Revenues (in millions) $ 190.3 $ 207.7 $ 137.5 Operating income (in millions) $2.7 $2.5 $2.1 Gas volumes marketed (Bcf) 49.6 59.6 63.1 Operating income for the marketing segment was $2.7 million on revenues of $190.3 million in 2001, compared to $2.5 million on revenues of $207.7 million in 2000, and $2.1 million on revenues of $137.5 million in 1999. The Company marketed 49.6 Bcf in 2001, compared to 59.6 Bcf in 2000 and 63.1 Bcf in 1999. The decline in total volumes marketed in 2001 reflects the Companys increased focus on marketing its own production and limiting the marketing of third party volumes in an effort to reduce its credit risk. Of the total volumes marketed, purchases from the Companys exploration and production subsidiaries accounted for 66% in 2001, 33% in 2000 and 31% in 1999. The Company enters into hedging activities with respect to its gas marketing activities to provide margin protection (see Item 7A of this Form 10 K and Note 8 of the financial statements for additional discussion). NOARK Partnership The marketing segment also manages the Companys 25% interest in the NOARK Pipeline System, Limited Partnership (NOARK). The NOARK Pipeline was a 258 mile intrastate gas transmission system that extended across northern Arkansas interconnecting with the Companys distribution systems. The NOARK Pipeline had been operating below capacity and generating losses since it was placed in service in September 1992. In January 1998, the Company entered into an agreement with Enogex Inc. (Enogex), a subsidiary of OGE Energy Corp., to expand the NOARK system and provide access to Oklahoma gas supplies through an integration of NOARK with the Ozark Gas Transmission System (Ozark). Ozark was a 437 mile interstate pipeline system which began in eastern Oklahoma 25 and terminated in eastern Arkansas. Effective August 1, 1998, Enogex acquired Ozark and contributed the pipeline system to the NOARK partnership. Enogex also acquired the NOARK partnership interests not held by Southwestern. Enogex funded the acquisition of Ozark and the expansion and integration with NOARK, which resulted in Southwesterns interest in the partnership decreasing to 25% (from 48%) with Enogex owning a 75% interest. There are also provisions in the agreement with Enogex which allow for future revenue allocations to the Company above its 25% partnership interest if certain minimum throughput and revenue assumptions are not met. Ozark Pipeline, the new integrated system, became operational November 1, 1998, and includes 749 miles of pipeline with a total throughput capacity of 330 million cubic feet of gas per day (MMcf/d). Deliveries are currently being made by the integrated pipeline to portions of Arkansas Westerns distribution systems, and to the interstate pipelines with which it interconnects. Ozark Pipeline had an average daily throughput of 134.1 MMcf/d in 2001, 188.2 MMcf/d in 2000 and 167.5 MMcf/d in 1999. In 1998, NOARK had an average daily throughput of 27.3 MMcf/d before the integration with Ozark. As a result of a rate case filed in 2000, Ozark Pipelines maximum transportation rate increased from $.2455 per dekatherm to $.2867 per dekatherm effective November 1, 2000. At December 31, 2001, the Companys gas distribution subsidiary has transportation contracts with Ozark Pipeline for 66.9 MMcf/d of firm capacity. These contracts expire in 2002 and 2003 and are renewable annually thereafter until terminated with 180 days notice. The Companys share of the pretax loss from operations included in other income related to its NOARK investment was $1.5 million in 2001, $1.8 million in 2000, and $2.0 million in 1999. The improvements since 1999 result primarily from the ability to collect higher transportation rates on interruptible volumes. The Company believes that it will be able to continue to reduce the losses it has experienced on the NOARK project and expects its investment in NOARK to be realized over the life of the system (see Note 7 of the financial statements for additional discussion). As further explained in Note 11 of the financial statements, the Company has severally guaranteed the debt service on a portion of NOARKs outstanding debt. The outstanding balance was $73.0 million at December 31, 2001, and the Companys share of the guarantee relates to $43.8 million of that amount. This debt financed a portion of the original cost to construct the NOARK Pipeline. Other Income, Costs and Expenses Interest costs, net of capitalization, were up 2% in 2001 and 34% in 2000, both as compared to prior years. A decrease in interest costs in 2001 that resulted from lower average borrowings and a lower average interest rate was slightly more than offset by a lower level of capitalized interest related to the Companys oil and gas properties. The increase in 2000 was caused primarily by higher average borrowings that resulted from payment of the Hales judgment and a lower level of capitalized interest. Interest capitalized decreased 35% in 2001 and 26% in 2000. The reductions in capitalized interest are primarily due to decreases in the level of costs excluded from amortization in the Companys exploration and production segment. Other income (expense) in 2001 resulted from the Companys share of NOARKs operating loss, as discussed above, offset by interest income in the gas distribution segment related to under recovered gas purchase costs. The increase in other income in 2000 resulted from the $3.2 million gain on the sale of the Companys Missouri gas distribution assets and gains from the sale of other miscellaneous assets. Other income (expense) in 1999 related primarily to the Companys share of NOARKs operating loss and certain costs incurred related to a judgment bond that the Company was required to post after receiving the initial adverse verdict in the Hales case. The Hales judgment was the primary cause for the Companys deferred tax benefit of $28.9 million in 2000. Excluding the impact of this change in deferred income taxes, the changes in the provisions for current and deferred income taxes recorded each year result primarily from the level of taxable income, the collection of under recovered purchased gas costs, abandoned property costs, and the deduction of intangible drilling costs in the year incurred for tax purposes, netted against the turnaround of intangible drilling costs deducted for tax purposes in prior years. Intangible drilling costs are capitalized and amortized over future years for financial reporting purposes under the full cost method of accounting. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company depends on internally generated funds and its revolving line of credit discussed under Financing Requirements as its major sources of liquidity. Net cash provided by operating activities was $144.6 million in 2001, compared to cash used in operating activities of $53.2 million in 2000 and cash provided by operating activities of $58.1 million in 1999. The net cash used in operating activities in 2000 was a result of the Hales judgment and the impact of high year end gas prices on working capital. The primary components of cash generated from operations are net income, depreciation, depletion and amortization, the provision for deferred income taxes and changes in current assets and current liabilities. Net cash from operating activities provided over 100% of the Companys capital requirements for routine capital expenditures, cash dividends, and scheduled debt retirements in 2001 and 89% in 1999. 26 The Companys cash flow from operating activities is highly dependent upon market prices that the Company receives for its gas and oil production. The price that the Company receives for its production is also influenced by the Companys commodity hedging activities, as more fully discussed in Item 7A of this Form 10 K and Note 8 to the financial statements. Natural gas and oil prices are subject to wide fluctuations and have declined significantly in the first quarter of 2002 as compared to prices received during 2001. The Company expects 2002 cash flow from operating activities to decline from the 2001 level although it is unable to predict with any degree of accuracy the impact of the decline. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures totaled $106.1 million in 2001, $75.7 million in 2000, and $67.0 million in 1999. The Companys exploration and production segment expenditures included acquisitions of interests in oil and gas producing properties totaling $5.8 million in 2001, $6.7 million in 2000 and $9.4 million in 1999. The Companys reported capital investments in 2001 include the gross expenditures in the Overton Field partnership discussed previously. The owner of the minority interest in the Overton partnership funded $13.5 million of the Companys exploration and development expenditures during 2001. 2001 2000 1999 (in thousands) Exploration and production $ 98,964 $ 69,211 $ 59,004 Gas distribution 5,347 5,994 7,124 Other 1,749 512 839 $ 106,060 $ 75,717 $ 66,967 Capital investments planned for 2002 total approximately $68.0 million, consisting of $61.3 million for exploration and production, $5.7 million for gas distribution system improvements and $1.0 million for general purposes. The Company expects that its level of capital investments will be adequate to allow the Company to maintain its present markets, explore and develop its existing gas and oil properties as well as generate new drilling prospects, and finance improvements necessary due to normal customer growth in its gas distribution segment. The Company may adjust its level of future capital investments dependent upon the level of cash flow generated from operations. Financing Requirements Southwesterns total debt outstanding was $350.0 million at December 31, 2001. This compares to total debt of $396.0 million at December 31, 2000, including $171.0 million under a short term credit facility. In 2001, the Companys strong cash flow from operations allowed it to fund its capital program and pay down $46 million of debt. In July 2001, the Company arranged a new unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks to replace its existing short term credit facility that was put in place in July 2000. The new revolving credit facility has a current capacity of $155 million and expires in July 2004. The capacity of the revolving credit facility decreases to $140 million in June 2002 and to $125 million in June 2003. The interest rate on the new facility is calculated based upon the debt rating of the Company. The Company is currently paying 137.5 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The new credit facility contains covenants which impose certain restrictions on the Company. Under the credit agreement, the Company may not issue total debt in excess of 70% of its total capital, must maintain a certain level of shareholders equity, and must maintain a ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to interest expense at or above a stated ratio. The ratio of EBITDA to interest expense in effect through December 31, 2002 is 3.75. These covenants change over the term of the credit facility and generally become more restrictive. The Company was in compliance with its debt agreements at December 31, 2001. The Company has also entered into interest rate swaps for calendar year 2002 that allow the Company to pay a fixed average interest rate of 4.8% (based upon current rates under the revolving credit facility) on $100 million of its outstanding revolving debt. In July 2000, the Company replaced its then existing revolving credit facilities that had previously provided the Company access to $80.0 million of variable rate capital with a new credit facility that had a capacity of $180.0 million. This facility was used to fund the Hales judgment of $109.3 million, pay off the existing revolver balance and retire $22.0 million of private placement debt. The credit facility was also used to fund normal working capital needs. The interest rate on the facility was 112.5 basis points over the LIBOR rate and was 7.85% at December 31, 2000. The credit facility had a term of 364 days and expired in July 2001. In August 2000, the Company retired $22.0 million of 9.36% private placement notes. Certain costs of the redemption were expensed and are classified as an extraordinary loss, net of related income tax effects. 27 In 1997, the Company issued $60.0 million of 7.625% Medium Term Notes due 2027 and $40.0 million of 7.21% Medium Term Notes due 2017. These notes were issued under a supplement to the Companys $250.0 million shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in February 1997, for the issuance of up to $125.0 million of Medium Term Notes. The Company has $25.0 million of capacity remaining under the shelf registration statement. The Company also has $125.0 million of 6.7% Notes due in 2005 that were issued under the shelf registration. The Companys public notes are rated BBB by Standard and Poors and Baa3 by Moodys. If the Company were unable to comply with any of the covenants of its various debt agreements, a waiver would have to be requested to avoid a default under the agreements. Further, the Companys public debt could be downgraded by the rating agencies which could increase the cost of funds under its revolving credit facility. In June 1998, the NOARK partnership issued $80.0 million of 7.15% Notes due 2018. The notes require semi annual principal payments of $1.0 million that began in December 1998. The Company accounts for its investment in NOARK under the equity method of accounting and does not consolidate the results of NOARK. The Company and the other general partner of NOARK have severally guaranteed the principal and interest payments on the NOARK debt. The Companys share of the several guarantee is 60% and amounted to $43.8 million at December 31, 2001. The Company advanced $1.4 million to NOARK to fund its share of debt service payments in 2001 and advanced $3.3 million in 2000. If NOARK is unable to generate sufficient cash in the future to service its debt and the Company is required to continue contributing cash to fund its debt service guarantee, the Company could be required to record its share of the NOARK debt commitment under current accounting rules. At the end of 2001, the Companys capital structure consisted of 65.7% debt (excluding the Companys several guarantee of NOARKs obligations) and 34.3% equity, with a ratio of EBITDA to interest expense of 5.69. As part of its strategy to insure cash flow to fund its operations and meet the restrictive covenant tests under its debt agreements, the Company has hedged approximately 65% of its expected 2002 gas production and 40% of its expected 2002 oil production. The Company does not expect to reduce its long term debt materially in 2002, assuming commodity prices remain at or near current levels and the Companys capital investment plans do not change from current expectations. Working Capital The Company maintains access to funds that may be needed to meet seasonal requirements through its credit facility explained above. The Company had positive working capital of $21.7 million at the end of 2001, compared to net negative working capital of $127.0 million at the end of 2000 caused by the short term revolving credit facility balance of $171.0 million. Current assets decreased by 17% in 2001, while current liabilities (without consideration of short term debt) increased 4%. The decrease in current assets and the slight increase in current liabilities at December 31, 2001, was due primarily to decreases in accounts receivable, accounts payable and under recovered purchased gas costs that resulted from extremely high market prices for natural gas at year end 2000, offset by increases in gas stored underground, over recovered purchased gas costs, and current assets and liabilities recorded for derivatives at December 31, 2001. At December 31, 2001, Southwestern had over recovered purchased gas costs of $8.2 million, which will be refunded to its customers during 2002.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISKS Market risks relating to the Companys operations result primarily from the volatility in commodity prices, basis differentials and interest rates, as well as credit risk concentrations. The Company uses natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options and interest rate swaps to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil and in interest rates. The Board of Directors has approved risk management policies and procedures to utilize financial products for the reduction of defined commodity price and interest rate risks. These policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings. Credit Risks The Companys financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables and derivative contracts associated with commodities trading. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas. No single customer accounts for greater than 3% of accounts receivable. See the discussion of credit risk associated with commodities trading below. Interest Rate Risk The following table provides information on the Companys financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The table presents the Companys debt obligations, principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Variable average interest rates reflect the rates in effect at December 31, 2001 for borrowings under the Companys credit facility. The Companys policy is to manage interest rates through use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. Interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate. The Company has entered into interest rate swaps for the calendar year 2002 that allow the Company to pay a fixed average interest rate of 4.8% (based upon current rates under the revolving credit facility) on $100 million of its outstanding revolving debt. Expected Maturity Date Fair Value 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 Thereafter Total 12/31/01 ($ in millions) Fixed Rate $ 125.0 $ 100.0 $ 225.0 $ 231.2 Average Interest Rate 6.70% 7.46% 7.04% Variable Rate $ 125.0 $ 125.0 $ 125.0 Average Interest Rate 5.47% 5.47% Commodities Risk The Company uses over the counter natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options to hedge sales of Company production, to hedge activity in its marketing segment, and to hedge the purchase of gas in its utility segment against the inherent price risks of adverse price fluctuations or locational pricing differences between a published index and the NYMEX (New York Mercantile Exchange) futures market. These swaps and options include (1) transactions in which one party will pay a fixed price (or variable price) for a notional quantity in exchange for receiving a variable price (or fixed price) based on a published index (referred to as price swaps), (2) transactions in which parties agree to pay a price based on two different indices (referred to as basis swaps), and (3) the purchase and sale of index related puts and calls (collars) that provide a "floor" price below which the counterparty pays (production hedge) or receives (gas purchase hedge) funds equal to the amount by which the price of the commodity is below the contracted floor, and a "ceiling" price above which the Company pays to (production hedge) or receives from (gas purchase hedge) the counterparty the amount by which the price of the commodity is above the contracted ceiling. The primary market risks related to the Companys derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for natural gas and crude oil. However, the market price risk is offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related sale or purchase of the natural gas or sale of the oil that is hedged. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss as a result of non performance by the Companys counterparties. The counterparties are primarily major investment and commercial banks which management believes present minimal credit risks. The credit quality of each counterparty and the level of financial exposure the Company has to each counterparty are periodically reviewed to ensure limited credit risk exposure. The following table provides information about the Companys financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in commodity prices. The table presents the notional amount in Bcf (billion cubic feet) and MBbls (thousand barrels), the weighted average contract prices, and the total dollar contract amount by expected maturity dates. The "Carrying Amount" 29 for the contract amounts is calculated as the contractual payments for the quantity of gas or oil to be exchanged under futures contracts and does not represent amounts recorded in the Companys financial statements. The "Fair Value" represents values for the same contracts using comparable market prices at December 31, 2001. At December 31, 2001, the "Fair Value" exceeded the "Carrying Amount" of these financial instruments by $4.2 million. Expected Maturity Date 2002 2003 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair Amount Value Amount Value PRODUCTION AND MARKETING Natural Gas Swaps with a fixed price receipt Contract volume (Bcf) 13.4 9.2 Weighted average price per Mcf $ 2.88 $ 3.18 Contract amount (in millions) $ 38.6 $ 40.2 $ 29.3 $ 29.3 Swaps with a fixed price payment Contract volume (Bcf) .3 Weighted average price per Mcf $ 2.96 Contract amount (in millions) $ .7 $ .6 Price collars Contract volume (Bcf) 6.0 4.1 Weighted average floor price per Mcf $ 4.00 $ 3.00 Contract amount of floor (in millions) $ 24.0 $ 32.2 $ 12.3 $ 14.2 Weighted average ceiling price per Mcf $ 4.72 $ 4.65 Contract amount of ceiling (in millions) $ 28.3 $ 27.8 $ 19.0 $ 17.9 NATURAL GAS PURCHASES Swaps with a fixed price payment Contract volume (Bcf) 3.3 Weighted average price per Mcf $ 4.20 Contract amount (in millions) $ 13.9 $ 8.1 At December 31, 2001, the Company had a single financial instrument that is sensitive to changes in interest rates. This $50 million notional interest rate swap has a fixed rate of 4.33%. Its carrying amount of $2.2 million is calculated as the contractual payments for interest on the notional amount to be exchanged under futures contracts and does not represent amounts recorded in the Companys financial statements. The fair value of $1.2 million represents the value for the same contract using comparable market prices at December 31, 2001. At December 31, 2001, the "Carrying Amount" exceeded the "Fair Value" of this interest rate swap by $1.0 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2001, the Company entered into additional interest rate swaps totaling $50 million that have an average fixed rate of 2.58%. Subsequent to December 31, 2001 and prior to March 13, 2002, the Company entered into additional derivative contracts to hedge gas and oil production sales and utility gas purchases. Price collar hedges on 4.0 Bcf of 2002 gas production sales have floor prices ranging from $2.25 to $2.50 per Mcf and ceiling prices ranging from $3.00 to $3.75 per Mcf and a collar on 4.0 Bcf of 2003 gas production has a $3.00 per Mcf floor and a $4.75 per Mcf ceiling. Fixed price swaps on gas production sales of 2.5 Bcf in the second quarter of 2002 will yield a weighted average price of $2.61 per Mcf. Natural gas swaps on notional gas purchase volumes of .3 Bcf in 2002 and .7 Bcf in 2003 were executed under which the Company will pay a fixed price of $2.91 per Mcf. Under a crude oil swap the Company will receive a fixed price of $20.07 per barrel on a notional volume of 277,500 barrels. 30
