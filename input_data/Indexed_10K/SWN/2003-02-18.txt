ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This Form 10 K contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements for many reasons, including the risks described in Risk Factors and elsewhere in this annual report. You should read the following discussion with the Selected Financial Data and our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. OVERVIEW We operate in three segments: Exploration and Production, Natural Gas Distribution and Marketing, Transportation and Other. Our financial results depend on a number of factors, in particular natural gas and oil prices, the seasonality of our customers need for natural gas and our ability to market natural gas and oil on economically attractive terms to our customers. There has been significant price volatility in the natural gas and crude oil market in recent years. The volatility was attributable to a variety of factors impacting supply and demand, including weather conditions, political events and economic events we cannot control or predict. Our net income decreased from $35.3 million in 2001, or $1.38 per share on a fully diluted basis, to $14.3 million, or $0.55 per share in 2002. This decrease in net income was primarily a result of the negative impact of lower realized natural gas and oil prices on the operating income of our EP segment. A decrease in the operating income for our gas distribution segment also negatively impacted our net income in 2002. In 2000, we reported a net loss of $46.7 million, which included one time charges for a $109.3 million judgment we paid in connection with the Hales lawsuit and $2.0 million related to other litigation, a loss on the early retirement of debt, and a $3.2 million gain from the sale of our Missouri utility properties. Exclusive of these one time charges and the gain on sale, net income for 2000 would have been $20.5 million, or $0.82 per share. Revenues were $261.5 million in 2002, a decrease of 24% from $344.9 million in 2001, primarily reflecting lower realized natural gas and oil prices. Revenues in 2001 decreased 5% to $344.9 million from $363.9 million in 2000, reflecting lower volumes sold to unaffiliated parties by the marketing segment. This decline in volumes reflects our increased focus on marketing our own production and limiting the marketing of third party volumes in an effort to reduce our credit risk. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Exploration and Production Year ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Revenues (in thousands) $ 122,207 $ 153,937 $ 110,920 Operating income (loss) (in thousands) 36,048 69,340 (70,584 )(1) Gas production (Bcf) 36.0 35.5 31.6 Oil production (MBbls) 682 719 676 Total production (Bcfe) 40.1 39.8 35.7 Average gas price per Mcf $ 3.00 $ 3.85 $ 2.88 Average oil price per Bbl 21.02 23.55 22.99 Average unit costs per Mcfe Lease operating expenses $ 0.45 $ 0.45 $ 0.40 Taxes other than income taxes 0.19 0.17 0.16 General administrative expenses 0.32 0.34 0.32 Full cost pool amortization 1.16 1.14 1.06 (1) Includes a charge of $109.3 million paid by us in connection with the Hales judgment and a charge of $2.0 million related to other litigation. Excluding these unusual items, operating income for the E P segment would have been $40.7 million for 2000. 29 Table of Contents Revenues, Operating Income and Production Revenues. Our exploration and production revenues decreased 21% in 2002 to $122.2 million compared to $153.9 million in 2001. The decrease was primarily due to lower prices received for natural gas. Revenues increased 39% in 2001 to $153.9 million from $110.9 million in 2000. The increase was primarily due to increased natural gas and oil production and higher natural gas and oil prices. Operating Income. Operating income from our exploration and production segment was $36.0 million in 2002 compared to $69.3 million in 2001, and $40.7 million in 2000, excluding the impact of the Hales judgment and other unusual items charged that year. The decrease in 2002 was primarily due to the decrease in revenues caused by the lower realized natural gas and oil prices. The increase in 2001 was due to an 11% increase in natural gas and oil production and higher prices realized, partially offset by increased operating costs and expenditures. Production. Gas and oil production totaled 40.1 Bcfe in 2002, 39.8 Bcfe in 2001 and 35.7 Bcfe in 2000. Overall production in 2002 was up slightly over 2001 as increased production from our Overton Field properties in East Texas and from our Gulf Coast properties more than offset production declines in our Arkoma Basin and Permian Basin properties, and the sale of our non strategic Mid Continent properties in the fourth quarter of 2002. The increase in 2001 production volumes resulted from successful exploration and development of our South Louisiana properties, the development of our Overton Field and increased production in the Arkoma Basin. Gas sales to unaffiliated purchasers were 30.6 Bcf in 2002, up from 30.4 Bcf in 2001 and 23.8 Bcf in 2000. Sales to unaffiliated purchasers are primarily made under contracts that reflect current short term prices and are subject to seasonal price swings. Intersegment sales to Arkansas Western were 5.4 Bcf in 2002, 5.1 Bcf in 2001 and 7.8 Bcf in 2000. The increase in 2002 intersegment sales resulted from increased deliveries to Arkansas Western under our baseload contracts. The decrease in sales in 2001 was caused by Arkansas Westerns reduced supply requirements due to warmer weather and the sale of the utilitys Missouri gas distribution properties in May 2000. Weather in 2002, as measured in degree days, was 2% warmer than normal and 8% colder than the prior year. Weather in 2001 was 9% warmer than both normal and the prior year and was normal in 2000. Our gas production provided approximately 37% of the utilitys requirements in 2002, 33% in 2001 and 42% in 2000. Future sales to Arkansas Westerns gas distribution systems will be dependent upon our success in obtaining gas supply contracts with the utility systems. In the future, we will continue to bid to obtain these gas supply contracts, although there is no assurance that we will be successful. If successful, we cannot predict the amount of fixed demand charges, if any, that would be associated with the new contracts. We expect future increases in our gas production to come primarily from sales to unaffiliated purchasers. We are unable to predict changes in the market demand and price for natural gas, including changes that may be induced by the effects of weather on demand of both affiliated and unaffiliated customers for our production. Additionally, we hold a large amount of undeveloped leasehold acreage and producing acreage, and have an inventory of drilling leads, prospects and seismic data that will continue to be evaluated and developed in the future. Our exploration programs have been directed primarily toward natural gas in recent years. Commodity Prices The average price realized for our gas production was $3.00 per Mcf in 2002, $3.85 per Mcf in 2001, and $2.88 per Mcf in 2000. The changes in the average price realized primarily reflect changes in average annual spot market prices and the effects of our price hedging activities. Our hedging activities lowered the average gas price $0.11 per Mcf in 2002, $0.31 per Mcf in 2001, and $1.04 per Mcf in 2000. In 2002, the price was reduced $0.03 per Mcf due to $1.1 million of basis differential ineffectiveness associated with our cash flow hedges. There was no significant ineffectiveness recorded in 2001. Additionally, we have historically received monthly demand charges related to sales made to our utility segment, which has increased the average gas price realized. We periodically enter into hedging activities with respect to a portion of our projected natural gas and crude oil production through a variety of financial arrangements intended to support natural gas and oil prices at targeted levels and to minimize the impact of price fluctuations (we refer you to Item 7A of this Form 10 K and Note 8 to the financial statements for additional discussion). Our policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings. At December 31, 2002, we had hedges in place on 42.6 Bcf of gas production. Subsequent to December 31, 2002 and prior to February 14, 2003, we hedged an additional 3.0 Bcf of future gas production. At December 31, 2002 we had hedges in place on 240,000 barrels of future oil production. Subsequent to 30 Table of Contents December 31, 2002 and prior to February 14, 2003, we hedged an additional 100,000 barrels of future oil production. As of February 14, 2003, we have hedged approximately 75% of our 2003 anticipated gas production level and 65% of our anticipated oil production level. Disregarding the impact of hedges, we would normally expect the average price received for our gas production to be approximately $0.10 to $0.20 per Mcf lower than average spot market prices, as market differentials that reduce the average prices received are partially offset by demand charges received under the contracts covering our intersegment sales to our utility systems. Future changes in revenues from sales of our gas production will be dependent upon changes in the market price for gas, access to new markets, maintenance of existing markets, and additions of new gas reserves. We realized an average price of $21.02 per barrel for our oil production for the year ended December 31, 2002, down from $23.55 per barrel for 2001 and $22.99 per barrel for 2000. Our hedging activities lowered the average oil price $2.92 per barrel in 2002, $0.03 per barrel in 2001 and $6.39 per barrel in 2000. Disregarding the impact of hedges, we expect the average price received for our oil production to be approximately $1.25 lower than posted spot market prices. Operating Costs and Expenses Lease operating expenses per Mcfe for this business segment were $0.45 in 2002 and 2001, compared to $0.40 in 2000. Taxes other than income taxes per Mcfe were $0.19 in 2002, compared to $0.17 in 2001 and $0.16 in 2000. The increases in per unit lease operating expenses in 2002 and 2001 were due to increased workover expenses and changes in the geographic mix of production. Lease operating expense per unit should decrease in the future as a result of increased production from our Overton Field (lower average cost as compared to other areas), decreased production in Permian Basin properties (higher average cost as compared to other areas) and the sale of our Mid Continent properties that had the highest average cost per unit of all operating areas. The increases in 2002 and 2001 taxes other than income taxes per Mcfe were due to increased severance and ad valorem taxes that resulted from generally higher commodity prices and from the changing mix of production among taxing jurisdictions. General and administrative expenses per Mcfe were $0.32 in 2002, compared to $0.34 in 2001 and $0.32 in 2000. The increase in general and administrative costs per Mcfe in 2001 was due primarily to increased legal costs related to the resolution of litigation (approximately $0.07 per Mcfe). Excluding the impact of these litigation costs in 2001, general and administrative costs in 2002 were higher per unit due to increased pension, insurance and salary costs. Our full cost pool amortization rate averaged $1.16 per Mcfe for 2002, compared to $1.14 in 2001 and $1.06 in 2000. The rate increased in 2002 and 2001, due primarily to negative revisions of proved reserves that resulted from a decline in average gas prices and to a $6.6 million decline in 2001 in the balance of unevaluated costs excluded from amortization in the full cost pool. Unevaluated costs excluded from amortization have declined from $37.6 million at the beginning of 2000 to $25.5 million at the end of 2002. We utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our natural gas and oil properties. Under this method, all such costs (productive and nonproductive) are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method. These capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test, however, which limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved gas and oil reserves discounted at 10 percent (standardized measure) plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties. Any costs in excess of this ceiling are written off as a non cash expense. The expense may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling. Full cost companies must use the prices in effect at the end of each accounting quarter to calculate the ceiling value of their reserves. At December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, our unamortized costs of natural gas and oil properties did not exceed this ceiling amount. At December 31, 2002, our standardized measure was calculated based upon quoted market prices of $4.74 per Mcf for gas and $31.20 per barrel for oil, adjusted for market differentials. A decline in natural gas and oil prices from year end 2002 levels or other factors, without other mitigating circumstances, could cause a future write down of capitalized costs and a non cash charge against future earnings. In November 2002, we sold our remaining non strategic Mid Continent properties, including our properties in the Sho Vel Tum area in southern Oklahoma, the Anadarko Basin in western Oklahoma and the Sooner Trend in northwestern Oklahoma, for a total of $26.4 million. These properties represented approximately 32.9 Bcfe of reserves and produced approximately 2.5 Bcfe annually. We expect this divestiture to result in a decrease in our future average production costs per unit of production. 31 Table of Contents In 2001, our subsidiary, SEPCO, formed a limited partnership with an investor to drill and complete 14 development wells in SEPCOs Overton Field located in Smith County, Texas. The Overton properties were acquired by SEPCO in April 2000 and have multiple development locations through the downspacing of the existing producing units. Because SEPCO is the sole general partner and owns a majority interest in the partnership, operating and financial results for the partnership are consolidated with our other operations and the investors share of the partnership activity is reported as a minority interest item in the financial statements. During 2002 and 2001, the minority interest owner in the partnership contributed $0.5 million and $13.5 million, respectively, in capital to the limited partnership. The investors share of 2002 and 2001 revenues, less operating costs and expenses, was $1.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively. Inflation impacts us by generally increasing our operating costs and the costs of our capital additions. The effects of inflation on our operations prior to 2000 have been minimal due to low inflation rates. However, during both 2001 and 2000, the impact of inflation intensified in certain areas of our exploration and production segment as shortages in drilling rigs, third party services and qualified labor developed due to an overall increase in the activity level of the domestic natural gas and oil industry. We feel this impact has been decreasing in 2002 with the relative stabilization of commodity prices. Additionally, Southwestern has mitigated rising costs in certain situations by obtaining vendor commitments to multiple projects and by offering incentives to vendors for cost reduction efforts that directly impact the amount we pay for their services. Natural Gas Distribution The operating results of our gas distribution segment are highly seasonal and the extent and duration of heating weather significantly impacts the profitability of this segment, although we have a weather normalization clause that lessens the impact of revenue increases and decreases which might result from weather variations during the winter heating season. The gas distribution segments profitability is also dependent upon the timing and amount of regulatory rate increases that are filed with and approved by the APSC. For periods subsequent to allowed rate increases, our profitability is impacted by our ability to manage and control this segments operating costs and expenses. Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000(1) ($ in thousands except for per Mcf amounts) Revenues $ 115,850 $ 147,282 $ 151,234 Gas purchases $ 66,486 $ 96,058 $ 93,992 Operating costs and expenses $ 41,801 $ 40,878 $ 42,587 Operating income $ 7,563 $ 10,346 $ 14,655 Deliveries (Bcf) Sales and end use transportation 25.1 24.0 30.4 Off system transportation 2.2 3.1 3.1 Average number of customers 136,747 134,041 152,773 Average sales rate per Mcf $ 6.49 $ 8.26 $ 6.55 Heating weather degree days 3,950 3,654 3,994 Percent of normal 98% 91% 100% (1) Data for 2000 includes the operations of the Missouri properties through the sale date of May 31, 2000. Excluding the Missouri operations, operating income would have been $12.6 million in 2000. Revenues and Operating Income Gas distribution revenues fluctuate due to the effects of warm weather on demand for natural gas and the pass through of gas supply cost changes. Because of the corresponding changes in purchased gas costs, the revenue effect of the pass through of gas cost changes has not materially affected net income. 32 Table of Contents Gas distribution revenues decreased 21% in 2002 and decreased 3% in 2001. The decrease in 2002 was primarily due to a lower average sales rate caused by lower gas prices. The decrease in 2001 was due to the loss of revenues resulting from the sale of the utilitys Missouri assets in May 2000 and the effects of warmer weather, partially offset by a higher average sales rate caused by higher gas prices. Weather during 2002 in the utilitys service territory was 2% warmer than normal and 8% colder than the prior year, and was 9% warmer than both normal and the prior year in 2001. Weather was normal in 2000. Operating income for our utility systems decreased 27% in 2002 and 29% in 2001. The decrease in 2002 resulted from increased operating costs and expenses and reduced usage per customer due to customer conservation brought about by high gas prices in 2001. The decrease in 2001 operating income for this segment resulted from the full year impact of the sale of the utilitys Missouri assets, the effects of warmer weather that were not fully offset by the weather normalization clause in its tariffs and increased bad debt expense caused by record high natural gas prices experienced in the first part of 2001. Deliveries and Rates In 2002, Arkansas Western sold 16.7 Bcf to its customers at an average rate of $6.49 per Mcf, compared to 17.0 Bcf at $8.26 per Mcf in 2001 and 22.1 Bcf at $6.55 per Mcf in 2000. Additionally, Arkansas Western transported 8.4 Bcf in 2002, 7.0 Bcf in 2001 and 8.3 Bcf in 2000 for its end use customers. The decrease in volumes sold in 2002 resulted from customer conservation brought about by high gas prices in 2001 and from several industrial customers moving from system supply to transportation, partially offset by customer growth. The decrease in volumes sold and transported in 2001 resulted from the sale of the utilitys Missouri properties in 2000 and warmer weather. Arkansas Westerns tariffs contain a weather normalization clause to lessen the impact of revenue increases and decreases which might result from weather variations during the winter heating season. The fluctuations in the average sales rates reflect changes in the average cost of gas purchased for delivery to our customers, which are passed through to customers under automatic adjustment clauses. Total deliveries to industrial customers of the utility segment, including transportation volumes, were 9.9 Bcf in 2002, 9.5 Bcf in 2001 and 11.8 Bcf in 2000. The increase in deliveries in 2002 resulted from industrial growth in the region. The decline in deliveries in 2001 resulted from warmer heating weather and the sale of the utilitys Missouri assets. Arkansas Western also transported 2.2 Bcf of gas through its gathering system in 2002 compared to 3.1 Bcf in both 2001 and 2000 for off system deliveries, all to the Ozark Gas Transmission System. The level of off system deliveries each year generally reflects the changes of on system demands of our gas distribution systems for our gas production. The average off system transportation rate was approximately $0.13 per Mcf, exclusive of fuel, in 2002 and 2001, and $0.10 per Mcf in 2000. Gas distribution revenues in future years will be impacted by the utilitys gas purchase costs, customer growth and rate increases allowed by the APSC. In recent years, Arkansas Western has experienced customer growth of approximately 2% to 3% annually in its Northwest Arkansas service territory, while it has experienced little or no customer growth in its service territory in Northeast Arkansas. Based on current economic conditions in our service territories, we expect this trend in customer growth to continue. Operating Costs and Expenses The changes in purchased gas costs for the gas distribution segment reflect volumes purchased, prices paid for supplies, the mix of purchases from various gas supply contracts (base load, swing and no notice) and the sale of Missouri assets as discussed above. Operating costs and expenses increased in 2002 as compared to 2001 due to general inflationary effects and increased pension and insurance expenses. Other operating costs and expenses of the gas distribution segment decreased in 2001 as compared to 2000 due to the sale of the utilitys Missouri assets. Operating costs in 2001 also included increased bad debt expense caused by high natural gas prices in the 2000 2001 winter heating season. In October 1998, Arkansas Western instituted a competitive bidding process for its gas supply. Additionally, Arkansas Western annually submits its gas supply plan to the general staff of the APSC. As a result of the bidding process under the plan filed for the 2002 2003 gas purchase year, SEECO successfully bid on gas supply packages representing approximately two thirds of the requirements for Arkansas Western for 2003. The contracts awarded to SEECO expire through 2005. Arkansas Western enters into hedging activities from time to time with respect to its gas purchases to 33 Table of Contents protect against the inherent price risks of adverse price fluctuations. We refer you to Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks and Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information. Inflation impacts our gas distribution segment by generally increasing our operating costs and the costs of our capital additions. The effects of inflation on the utilitys operations in recent years have been minimal due to low inflation rates. Additionally, delays inherent in the rate making process prevent us from obtaining immediate recovery of increased operating costs of our gas distribution segment. Regulatory Matters Arkansas Westerns rates and operations are regulated by the APSC. Arkansas Western operates through municipal franchises that are perpetual by virtue of state law, but are not exclusive within a geographic area. Although its rates for gas delivered to its retail customers are not regulated by the FERC, its transmission and gathering pipeline systems are subject to the FERCs regulations concerning open access transportation. As the regulatory focus of the natural gas industry has shifted from the federal level to the state level, some utilities across the nation have unbundled residential sales services from transportation services in an effort to promote greater competition. No such legislation or regulatory directives related to natural gas are presently pending in Arkansas. In Arkansas, the state legislature enacted Act 1556 for the deregulation of the retail sale of electricity by 2002. Act 1556 was modified by Act 324 of 2001 delaying the implementation of electric deregulation to not earlier than October 2003 and no later than October 2005. In December 2001, the APSC submitted its annual report to the Arkansas legislature on the development of electric deregulation and recommended that the legislature consider suspending deregulation to the year 2010 or 2012, or repeal Act 1556 (as modified by Act 324). Furthermore, legislation has been recently introduced seeking to repeal the deregulation of the retail sale of electricity. It is unknown what final legislation will be adopted or, if it is adopted, what its final form will be. If electric deregulation occurs in Arkansas, legislative or regulatory precedents may be set that would also affect natural gas utilities in the future. These issues may include further unbundling of services and the regulatory treatment of stranded costs. Arkansas Western has historically maintained a substantial price advantage over electricity for most applications. This has enabled the utility to achieve excellent market penetration levels. However, during 2001 the high gas prices experienced in the 2000 2001 heating season temporarily eroded the price advantage. Arkansas Western has made progress in regaining price advantage in its markets as gas prices have declined from the levels experienced in the winter of 2000 2001. Arkansas Western filed an application with the APSC on November 8, 2002, for a rate increase of $11.0 million annually. The APSC has ten months to reach a decision on the amount of an allowed rate increase. As a result, any increase granted will become effective no later than September 2003. Arkansas Westerns last rate increase was approved in December 1996 for the utilitys Northwest region and in December 1997 for the Northeast region. The APSC approved increases of $5.1 million and $1.2 million, respectively. During 1999, the APSC initiated a proceeding in which it sought a $2.3 million reduction in the rates for the Northwest region. In late 1999, the APSC and Arkansas Western reached a settlement in which the Northwest regions rates were reduced by $1.4 million. The reduction was primarily due to a downward adjustment to the return on equity that the APSC had established in the 1996 rate case. Rate increase requests, which may be filed in the future, will depend on customer growth, increases in operating expenses, and additional investment in property, plant and equipment. While Arkansas Western continues to experience customer growth and has controlled its costs, its return on investment has declined in recent years. In February 2001, the APSC approved a 90 day temporary tariff to collect additional gas costs not yet billed to customers through the utilitys normal purchased gas adjustment clause in its approved tariffs. We had significant under recovered purchased gas costs as a result of the high prices paid for gas supply in the 2000 2001 heating season. The temporary tariff allowed the utility accelerated recovery of these gas costs. In April 2002, Arkansas Western filed a revised purchased gas adjustment clause that provides better matching between the time the gas costs are incurred and the time the costs are recovered. The APSC approved the new clause in May 2002. In April 2002, the APSC adopted Natural Gas Procurement Plan Rules for utilities. These rules require utilities to take all reasonable and prudent steps necessary to develop a diversified gas supply portfolio. The portfolio should consist of an appropriate combination of different types of gas purchase contracts and or financial hedging instruments that are designed to yield an optimum balance of reliability, reduced volatility and reasonable price. Utilities will be required to submit on an annual basis their gas supply plan, along with their contracting and or hedging objectives, to the staff of the 34 Table of Contents APSC for review and determination as to whether it is consistent with these policy principles. If the plan includes a hedging strategy and it is determined to be consistent with the objectives of the policy principles, utilities will be allowed to flow any hedging gain or loss to customers through the purchased gas adjustment clause. During 2001, Arkansas Western submitted its annual gas supply plan for the 2001 2002 heating season and a revision to its purchased gas adjustment clause for the recovery of hedging gains and losses to the staff of the APSC. In May 2002, Arkansas Western submitted its annual gas supply plan for the 2002 2003 heating season. Arkansas Western also purchases gas from unaffiliated producers under take or pay contracts. We believe that we do not have a significant exposure to liabilities resulting from these contracts and expect to be able to continue to satisfactorily manage our exposure to take or pay liabilities. Marketing, Transportation and Other Operating income from the marketing, transportation and other segment, which includes income from real property held by our subsidiary, A.W. Realty Company, was $2.9 million in 2002, compared to $3.0 million in 2001 and $2.5 million in 2000. EBITDA for these segments was $2.8 million in 2002, compared with $2.4 million in 2001 and $3.0 million in 2000. For a further discussion of our EBITDA reconciliation, we refer you to Business Other Items Reconciliation of Non GAAP Measures. Marketing Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Revenues (in millions) $ 131.1 $ 190.3 $ 207.7 Operating income (in millions) $ 2.7 $ 2.7 $ 2.5 Gas volumes marketed (Bcf) 45.5 49.6 59.6 Our operating income from marketing was $2.7 million on revenues of $131.1 million in 2002, compared to $2.7 million on revenues of $190.3 million in 2001, and $2.5 million on revenues of $207.7 million in 2000. We marketed 45.5 Bcf in 2002, compared to 49.6 Bcf in 2001 and 59.6 Bcf in 2000. The decline in total volumes marketed in 2002 and 2001 resulted primarily from the decline in volumes marketed to third parties. This reduction reflects our increased focus on marketing our own production and limiting the marketing of third party volumes in an effort to reduce our credit risk. Of the total volumes marketed, purchases from our exploration and production subsidiaries accounted for 67% in 2002, 66% in 2001 and 33% in 2000. We enter into hedging activities from time to time with respect to our gas marketing activities to provide margin protection. We refer you to Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks and Note 8 to the financial statements for additional discussion. Transportation The marketing, transportation and other segment also manages our 25% interest in NOARK. At December 31, 2002, Arkansas Western had transportation contracts with Ozark Pipeline for 66.9 MMcf per day of firm capacity. These contracts expire in 2003 and are renewable annually thereafter until terminated with 180 days notice. NOARK and Arkansas Western are currently renegotiating these contracts. Our recorded pre tax loss from operations included in other income related to our NOARK investment was $0.3 million in 2002, $1.5 million in 2001, and $1.8 million in 2000. The improvements in operating results since 2000 result primarily from NOARKs ability to collect higher transportation rates on interruptible volumes. We believe that we will be able to continue to reduce the losses from NOARK and expect our investment in NOARK to be realized over the life of the system. We refer you to Note 7 to the financial statements for additional discussion. We have severally guaranteed the debt service on a portion of NOARKs outstanding debt. NOARKs outstanding debt was $71.0 million at December 31, 2002, and our share of the guarantee was $42.6 million. This debt financed a portion of the original cost to construct the NOARK Pipeline. We were not required to advance any funds to NOARK in 2002, and advanced $1.4 million in 2001 primarily for debt service. We refer you to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of our guarantee of NOARK debt. 35 Table of Contents In January 2003, Ozark Pipeline sold a 28 mile portion of its pipeline system located in Oklahoma that had limited strategic value to the overall system. Sales proceeds to NOARK were $10.0 million. We received $2.5 million of cash proceeds from this sale and will record a gain of approximately $1.0 million in 2003. Other Income, Costs and Expenses Interest costs, net of capitalization, were down 9% in 2002 and down 4% in 2001, both as compared to prior years. Interest costs for 2000 have been restated from prior years presentations to reflect costs incurred for the early extinguishment of debt. These costs were previously presented as a net of tax extraordinary item but have been reclassed for presentation purposes as required by SFAS No. 145. Interest costs were down in 2002 due to lower average borrowings and a lower average interest rate. A decrease in interest costs in 2001 that resulted from lower average borrowings, a lower average interest rate and the early extinguishment of debt costs discussed above, was partially offset by a lower level of capitalized interest related to our natural gas and oil properties. Interest capitalized decreased 7% in 2002 and 35% in 2001. The reductions in capitalized interest are primarily due to the level of costs excluded from amortization in our exploration and production segment. Other income (expense) in 2002 resulted from our share of NOARKs results of operations, as discussed above, and interest costs on customer deposits in the gas distribution segment. Other income (expense) in 2001 resulted from our share of NOARKs results of operations, offset by interest income in the gas distribution segment related to under recovered gas purchase costs. Other income in 2000 resulted from a $3.2 million gain on the sale of our Missouri gas distribution assets and gains from the sale of other miscellaneous assets, partially offset by our share of NOARKs results of operations. The Hales judgment was the primary cause for our deferred tax benefit of $29.5 million in 2000. Excluding this impact, the changes in the provision for deferred income taxes recorded each year result primarily from the level of taxable income, the collection of under recovered purchased gas costs, abandoned property costs, and the deduction of intangible drilling costs in the year incurred for tax purposes, netted against the turnaround of intangible drilling costs deducted for tax purposes in prior years. Intangible drilling costs are capitalized and amortized over future years for financial reporting purposes under the full cost method of accounting. We recorded pension expense of $0.9 million in 2002 and a credit to expense of $0.1 million in 2001. The amount of pension expense recorded by us is determined by actuarial calculations and is also impacted by the funded status of our plans. At December 31, 2002 our pension plans were underfunded and a liability of $5.6 million was recorded on the balance sheet. As a result of the underfunded status and actuarial data to be completed in early 2003, we expect to record pension expense of $3.0 million to $5.0 million in 2003. For further discussion of our pension plans, we refer you to Note 4 to the financial statements. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We depend on internally generated funds and our revolving line of credit (discussed below under Financing Requirements) as our primary sources of liquidity. We may borrow up to $125.0 million under our revolving credit facility from time to time. As of February 14, 2003, we had $106.1 million of indebtedness outstanding under the revolving credit facility. We expect our capital expenditures (discussed below under Capital Expenditures) for 2003 to exceed the funds generated by our operations and the funds that may be available under our credit facility. In December 2002, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC pursuant to which we may from time to time during 2003, subject to market conditions, publicly offer equity, debt or other securities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $77.6 million in 2002, compared to $144.6 million in 2001. In 2000, net cash used in operating activities was $53.2 million as a result of the Hales judgment and the impact of high year end gas prices on working capital. The primary components of cash generated from operations are net income, depreciation, depletion and amortization, the provision for deferred income taxes and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash from operating activities provided 84% of our capital requirements for routine capital expenditures in 2002, and over 100% in 2001. 36 Table of Contents Our cash flow from operating activities is highly dependent upon market prices that we receive for our gas and oil production. The price received for our production is also influenced by our commodity hedging activities, as more fully discussed in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks and Note 8 to the financial statements. Natural gas and oil prices are subject to wide fluctuations. As a result, we are unable to forecast with certainty our future level of cash flow from operations. We adjust our discretionary uses of cash dependent upon cash flow available. If we are unable to raise funds in the capital markets in early 2003 as planned, we will be required to adjust our planned level of investment in capital projects in the EP segment. This, in turn, could negatively impact growth in production volumes and cash flow from operations, which could ultimately affect our ability to meet the covenants contained in the indentures governing our public debt as well as our revolving credit facility agreement. We do not anticipate being unable to meet our covenants and commitments. See Financing Requirements for further discussion of our debt covenants. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures totaled $92.1 million in 2002, $106.1 million in 2001, and $75.7 million in 2000. Our exploration and production segment expenditures included acquisitions of interests in natural gas and oil producing properties totaling $3.5 million in 2002, $7.3 million in 2001 and $7.4 million in 2000. Our reported capital investments in 2002 and 2001 include the gross expenditures in the Overton Field partnership discussed previously. The owner of the minority interest in the Overton partnership funded $0.5 million and $13.5 million of our exploration and development expenditures during 2002 and 2001, respectively. 2002 2001 2000 (in thousands) Exploration and production $ 85,201 $ 98,964 $ 69,211 Gas distribution 6,115 5,347 5,994 Other 746 1,749 512 $ 92,062 $ 106,060 $ 75,717 Capital investments planned for 2003 total approximately $145.6 million, consisting of $137.1 million for exploration and production, $7.7 million for gas distribution system improvements and $0.8 million for general purposes. We expect that this level of capital investments in 2003 will allow us to accelerate the development of our Overton Field properties in East Texas, maintain our present markets, explore and develop other existing gas and oil properties, generate new drilling prospects, and finance improvements necessary due to normal customer growth in our gas distribution segment. As discussed above, our 2003 capital investment program is expected to be funded through cash flow from operations, our revolving credit facility, and, subject to market conditions, one or more possible public offerings of equity, debt or other securities. We may adjust our level of future capital investments dependent upon our ability to consummate such offerings and our level of cash flow generated from operations. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As discussed above in Results of Operations, we hold a 25% general partnership interest in NOARK and account for our investment under the equity method of accounting. We and the other general partner of NOARK have severally guaranteed the principal and interest payments on NOARKs 7.15% Notes due 2018. This debt financed a portion of the original cost to construct the NOARK Pipeline. Our share of the guarantee is 60%. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the outstanding principal amount of these notes was $71.0 million and $73.0 million, respectively. Our share of the guarantee was $42.6 million and $43.8 million, respectively. The notes were issued in June 1998 and require semi annual principal payments of $1.0 million. Under the several guarantee, we are required to fund our share of NOARKs debt service which is not funded by operations of the pipeline. We were not required to advance any funds to NOARK in 2002, and advanced $1.4 million in 2001 primarily for debt service. Our share of the results of operations included in other income related to our NOARK investment were losses of $0.3 million in 2002, $1.5 million in 2001, and $1.8 million in 2000. The improvements in operating results since 2000 result primarily from the ability to collect higher transportation rates on interruptible volumes. We believe that we will be able to continue to reduce the losses we have experienced on the NOARK project and expect our investment in NOARK to be realized over the life of the system (see Note 7 of the financial statements for additional discussion). 37 Table of Contents NOARKs assets and liabilities as December 31, 2002 and 2001 are as follows: 2002 2001 (in thousands) Current assets $ 15,730 $ 8,363 Noncurrent assets 169,970 175,299 $ 185,700 $ 183,662 Current liabilities $ 7,631 $ 7,403 Long term debt 69,000 71,000 Partners capital 109,069 105,259 $ 185,700 $ 183,662 NOARKs results of operations for 2002, 2001 and 2000 are summarized below: 2002 2001 2000 (in thousands) Operating revenues $ 75,959 $ 81,662 $ 73,633 Pre tax net income (loss) $ 3,011 $ (1,047 ) $ (1,391 ) Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments We have assumed various contractual obligations and contingent commitments in the normal course of our operations and financing activities. Significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2002 are as follows: Contractual Obligations: Payments Due by Period Less than More than Total 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years 5 Years (in thousands) Long term debt $ 342,400 $ $ 242,400 $ 100,000 Operating leases(1) 2,653 729 1,428 496 Unconditional purchase obligations(2) Demand charges(3) 17,312 7,458 3,642 2,485 3,727 Other long term obligations(4) 1,860 1,860 $ 364,225 $ 10,047 $ 247,470 $ 2,981 $ 103,727 (1) We lease office space in Houston, Texas, office space in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and approximately twenty vehicles under operating leases expiring through 2006. (2) Our utility segment has volumetric commitments for the purchase of gas under competitive bid packages and wellhead contracts. Volumetric purchase commitments at December 31, 2002 totaled 3.1 Bcf, comprised of 1.3 Bcf in less than one year, 1.0 Bcf in one to three years, .5 Bcf in three to five years and .3 Bcf in more than five years. Our volumetric purchase commitments are priced at regional gas indices set at the first of each future month. These costs are recoverable from the utilitys end use customers. (3) Our utility segment has commitments for demand charges on firm gas purchase and firm transportation agreements. These costs are recoverable from the utilitys end use customers. (4) Our significant other contractual obligations for 2003 include approximately $0.8 million of land leases, approximately $0.5 million for drilling rig commitments and approximately $0.6 of various information technology support agreements. We refer you to Financing Requirements below for a discussion of the terms of our long term debt. 38 Table of Contents Contingent Liabilities or Commitments. We have the following commitments and contingencies that could create, increase or accelerate our liabilities. Substantially all of our employees are covered by defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans. Our return on the assets of these plans in 2002 was negative which, combined with other factors, is expected to result in an increase in pension expense and our required funding of the plans for 2003. At December 31, 2002 we recorded an accrued pension benefit liability of $5.6 million. As a result of the underfunded status and actuarial data to be completed in early 2003, we expect to record pension expense of $3.0 million to $5.0 million in 2003. See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional information. As discussed above in Off Balance Sheet Arrangements, we have guaranteed 60% of the principal and interest payments on NOARKs 7.15% Notes due 2018. At December 31, 2002 the principal outstanding for these notes was $71.0 million. The notes require semi annual principal payments of $1.0 million. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information. Financing Requirements Our total debt outstanding was $342.4 million at December 31, 2002 and $350.0 million at December 31, 2001. In July 2001, we arranged an unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks to replace our previous short term credit facility that was put in place in July 2000. The revolving credit facility has a maximum capacity of $125.0 million and expires in July 2004. At December 31, 2002, we had $117.4 million of outstanding debt under our revolving credit facility, with $7.6 million of borrowing availability. The interest rate on the new facility is calculated based upon our debt rating. We are currently paying 150 basis points over LIBOR. We have also entered into interest rate swaps for calendar year 2003 that allow us to pay a fixed average interest rate of 3.8% (based upon current rates under the revolving credit facility) on $40.0 million of our outstanding revolving debt. Our revolving credit facility contains covenants, which impose certain restrictions on us. Under the credit agreement at December 31, 2002, we may not issue total debt in excess of 70% of our total capital, must maintain a certain level of shareholders equity, and must maintain a ratio of EBITDA to interest expense at 3.75 or above. Effective March 31, 2003, the percentage of debt to total capital covenant decreases to 65% and the minimum ratio of EBITDA to interest expense covenant increases to 4.0. These covenants continue to change over the term of the credit facility and generally become more restrictive. We were in compliance with our debt agreements at December 31, 2002. Although we do not anticipate debt covenant violations, our ability to comply with our debt agreements is dependent upon the success of our exploration and development program and upon factors beyond our control, such as the market prices for natural gas and oil. In 1997, we publicly issued $60.0 million of 7.625% Medium Term Notes due 2027 and $40.0 million of 7.21% Medium Term Notes due 2017. In 1995, we publicly issued $125.0 million of 6.7% Notes due in 2005. Our publicly traded notes are rated BBB by Standard and Poors and Ba2 by Moodys. During 2002, Moodys downgraded our public debt from our previous Baa3 rating. The interest rate under the revolving credit facility increased 12.5 basis points in July 2002 as the result of the downgrade of our public debt by Moodys. Further downgrades of our public debt could increase the costs of funds under our revolving credit facility. In December 2002, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC for the purpose of qualifying the potential sale from time to time of up to an aggregate $300 million of equity, debt and other securities. In June 1998, the NOARK partnership issued $80.0 million of 7.15% Notes due 2018. The notes require semi annual principal payments of $1.0 million that began in December 1998. We account for our investment in NOARK under the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the results of NOARK. We and Enogex, the other general partner of NOARK, have severally guaranteed the principal and interest payments on the NOARK debt. Our share of the several guarantee is 60% and amounted to $42.6 million at December 31, 2002. We did not advance any funds to NOARK in 2002. In 2001, we advanced $1.4 million to NOARK to fund its share of debt service payments. If NOARK is unable to generate sufficient cash in the future to service our debt and we are required to contribute cash to fund our share of the debt service guarantee, we could be required to record our share of the NOARK debt commitment under current accounting rules. At the end of 2002, our capital structure consisted of 65.9% debt (excluding our several guarantee of NOARKs obligations) and 34.1% equity, with a ratio of EBITDA to interest expense of 4.65. EBITDA is a measure required by our debt covenants and is defined 39 Table of Contents as net income plus interest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Shareholders equity in the December 31, 2002 balance sheet includes an accumulated other comprehensive loss of $14.0 million related to our hedging activities that is required to be recorded under the provisions of SFAS No. 133. This amount is based on current market values of our hedges at December 31, 2002 and does not necessarily reflect the value that we will receive when the hedges are ultimately settled, nor does it take into account revenues to be received associated with the physical delivery of sales volumes hedged. Our debt covenants as to capitalization percentages exclude the effects of non cash entries that result from SFAS No. 133 as well as the non cash impact of any full cost ceiling write downs. Our capital structure, including our several guarantee of NOARKs obligations, would be 66.8% debt and 33.2% equity at December 31, 2002 without consideration of the accumulated other comprehensive loss related to SFAS No. 133. As part of our strategy to insure cash flow to fund our operations and meet the restrictive covenant tests under our debt agreements, we have hedged approximately 75% of our expected 2003 gas production and 65% of our expected 2003 oil production. The amount of long term debt we incur is dependent upon commodity prices and our capital expenditure plans. If commodity prices remain at or near current levels throughout 2003 and our capital expenditure plans do not change from current expectations, we do not expect to materially reduce our long term debt in 2003. If commodity prices significantly decrease, we may incur additional long term debt to fund our capital expenditure plans or we may modify our capital expenditure plans. We refer you to Business Other Items Reconciliation of Non GAAP Measures in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10 K for a table that reconciles EBITDA with our operating income as derived from our audited financial information. Working Capital We maintain access to funds that may be needed to meet seasonal requirements through our credit facility described above. We had positive working capital of $1.6 million at the end of 2002 and $21.7 million at the end of 2001. Current assets decreased by 18% in 2002 and current liabilities increased 4%. The decrease in current assets at December 31, 2002 was due primarily to decreases in amounts recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 133 for derivative activities, and decreases in accounts receivable, inventories and cash. Decreases in accounts payable and over recovered purchased gas costs in current liabilities were more than offset by increases in amounts recorded as current liabilities for derivative activities. At December 31, 2002, we had over recovered purchased gas costs of $5.7 million. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Natural Gas and Oil Properties We utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our natural gas and oil properties. We review the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties under the full cost accounting rules of the SEC on a quarterly basis. Under these rules, all such costs (productive and nonproductive) are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method. These capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test, however, which limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved gas and oil reserves discounted at 10 percent plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties. If the net capitalized costs of natural gas and oil properties exceed the ceiling, we will record a ceiling test write down to the extent of such excess. A ceiling test write down is a non cash charge to earnings. If required, it reduces earnings and impacts shareholders equity in the period of occurrence and results in lower depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in future periods. The write down may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling. The risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties increases when natural gas and oil prices are depressed or if there are substantial downward revisions in estimated proved reserves. Application of these rules during periods of relatively low oil or natural gas prices, even if temporary, increases the probability of a ceiling test write down. Based on natural gas and oil prices in effect on December 31, 2002, the unamortized cost of our natural gas and oil properties did not exceed the ceiling of proved natural gas and oil reserves. Natural gas pricing has historically been unpredictable and any significant declines could result in a ceiling test write down in subsequent quarterly or annual reporting periods. 40 Table of Contents Natural gas and oil reserves used in the full cost method of accounting cannot be measured exactly. Our estimate of natural gas and oil reserves requires extensive judgments of reservoir engineering data and is generally less precise than other estimates made in connection with financial disclosures. Assigning monetary values to such estimates does not reduce the subjectivity and changing nature of such reserve estimates. The uncertainties inherent in the disclosure are compounded by applying additional estimates of the rates and timing of production and the costs that will be incurred in developing and producing the reserves. We engage the services of an independent petroleum consulting firm to review reserves as prepared by our reservoir engineers. Hedging We use natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options and interest rate swaps to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil and in interest rates. Our policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings. The primary market risks related to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for natural gas and crude oil. However, the market price risk is offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related sale or purchase of the natural gas or sale of the oil that is hedged. Our derivative instruments are accounted for under SFAS No. 133 and are recorded at fair value in our financial statements. We utilize market based quotes from our hedge counterparties to value these open positions. These valuations are recognized as assets or liabilities in our balance sheet and, to the extent an open position is an effective cash flow hedge on equity production or interest rates, the offset is recorded in other comprehensive income. Results of settled commodity hedging transactions are reflected in natural gas and oil sales or in gas purchases. Results of settled interest rate hedges are reflected in interest expense. Any ineffective hedge, derivative not qualifying for accounting treatment as a hedge, or ineffective portion of a hedge is recognized immediately in earnings. Future market price volatility could create significant changes to the hedge positions recorded in our financial statements. We refer you to Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in this Form 10 K for additional information regarding our hedging activities. Regulated Utility Operations Our utility operations are subject to the rate regulation and accounting requirements of the APSC. Allocations of costs and revenues to accounting periods for ratemaking and regulatory purposes may differ from those generally applied by non regulated operations. Such allocations to meet regulatory accounting requirements are considered generally accepted accounting principles for regulated utilities provided that there is a demonstrated ability to recover any deferred costs in future rates. During the ratemaking process, the regulatory commission may require a utility to defer recognition of certain costs to be recovered through rates over time as opposed to expensing such costs as incurred. This allows the utility to stabilize rates over time rather than passing such costs on to the customer for immediate recovery. This causes certain expenses to be deferred as a regulatory asset and amortized to expense as they are recovered through rates. The regulatory commission has not required any unbundling of services, although large industrials are free to contract for their own gas supply. There are no regulations relating to unbundling of services currently anticipated; however, should such regulation be proposed and adopted, certain of these assets may no longer meet the criteria for deferred recognition and, accordingly, a write off of regulatory assets and stranded costs may be required. Pension Accounting We record our prepaid or accrued benefit cost, as well as our periodic benefit cost, for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans using measurement assumptions that we consider reasonable at the time of calculation (see Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion and disclosures regarding these benefit plans). Two of the assumptions that affect the amounts recorded are the discount rate, which estimates the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled, and the expected return on plan assets, which reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested. For 2002, the discount rate assumed is 6.8% and the expected return assumed is 9.0%. This compares to a discount rate of 7.0% and an expected return of 9.0% used in 2001. Using the assumed rates discussed above, we recorded pension expense of $0.9 million in 2002 and a credit to expense of $0.1 million in 2001. We reflected a pension liability of $5.6 million at December 31, 2002 and a prepaid benefit cost of $4.9 million at December 31, 2001. 41 Table of Contents Assuming a 1% change in the 2002 rates (lower discount rate and lower rate of return), we would have recorded pension expense of $1.7 million in 2002, and recorded an accrued pension liability of $10.7 million at December 31, 2002. Gas in Underground Storage We record our gas stored in inventory that is owned by the exploration and production segment at the lower of weighted average cost or market. Gas expected to be cycled within the next 12 months is recorded in current assets with the remaining stored gas reflected as a long term asset. The quantity and average cost of gas in storage was 10.4 Bcf at $3.10 at December 31, 2002 and 10.1 Bcf at $3.05 at December 31, 2001. The gas in inventory for the exploration and production segment is used primarily to supplement production in meeting the segments contractual commitments including delivery to customers of our gas distribution business, especially during periods of colder weather. As a result, demand fees paid by the gas distribution segment to the exploration and production segment, which are passed through to the utilitys customers, are a part of the realized price of the gas in storage. In determining the lower of cost or market for storage gas, we utilize the gas futures market in assessing the price we expect to be able to realize for our gas in inventory. Declines in the future market price of natural gas could result in us writing down our carrying cost of gas in storage. See further discussion of our significant accounting policies in Note 1 to the financial statements. FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION All statements, other than historical fact or present financial information, may be deemed to be forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements that address activities, outcomes and other matters that should or may occur in the future, including, without limitation, statements regarding the financial position, business strategy, production and reserve growth and other plans and objectives for our future operations, are forward looking statements. Although we believe the expectations expressed in such forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements are not guarantees of future performance. We have no obligation and make no undertaking to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements. Forward looking statements include the items identified in the preceding paragraph, information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations and other statements in this prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus identified by words such as anticipate, project, intend, estimate, expect, believe, predict, budget, projection, goal, plan, forecast, target or similar expressions. You should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements. They are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may affect our operations, markets, products, services and prices and cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. In addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with forward looking statements, risks, uncertainties and factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward looking statement include, but are not limited to: the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices for natural gas and oil; the timing and extent of our success in discovering, developing, producing, and estimating reserves; our future property acquisition or divestiture activities; the effects of weather and regulation on our gas distribution segment; increased competition; the impact of federal, state and local government regulation; 42 Table of Contents the financial impact of accounting regulations; changing market conditions and prices (including regional basis differentials); the comparative cost of alternative fuels; the availability of oil field personnel, services, drilling rigs, and other equipment; and any other factors listed in the reports we have filed and may file with the SEC. We caution you that these forward looking statements are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, incident to the exploration for and development, production and sale of natural gas and oil. These risks include, but are not limited to, commodity price volatility, third party interruption of sales to market, inflation, lack of availability of goods and services, environmental risks, drilling and other operating risks, regulatory changes, the uncertainty inherent in estimating proved natural gas and oil reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures and the other risks described in this Form 10 K. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data and the interpretation of that data by geological engineers. In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production activities may justify revisions of estimates that were made previously. If significant, these revisions would change the schedule of any further production and development drilling. Accordingly, reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities of natural gas and oil that are ultimately recovered. Should one or more of the risks or uncertainties described above or elsewhere in this Form 10 K occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements. We specifically disclaim all responsibility to publicly update any information contained in a forward looking statement or any forward looking statement in its entirety and therefore disclaim any resulting liability for potentially related damages. All forward looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISKS Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from the volatility in commodity prices, basis differentials and interest rates, as well as credit risk concentrations. We use natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options and interest rate swaps to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil and in interest rates. The Board of Directors has approved risk management policies and procedures to utilize financial products for the reduction of defined commodity price and interest rate risks. These policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings. Credit Risks Our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables and derivative contracts associated with commodities trading. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas. No single customer accounts for greater than 4% of accounts receivable. See the discussion of credit risk associated with commodities trading below. Interest Rate Risk The following table provides information on our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The table presents our debt obligations, principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Variable average interest rates reflect the rates in effect at December 31, 2002 for borrowings under our credit facility. Our policy is to manage interest rates through use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. Interest 43 Table of Contents rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate. We have entered into interest rate swaps for the calendar year 2003 that allow us to pay a fixed average interest rate of 3.8% (based upon current rates under the revolving credit facility) on $40.0 million of our outstanding revolving debt. Expected Maturity Date FairValue 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter Total 12/31/02 ($ in millions) Fixed Rate $ 125.0 $ 100.0 $ 225.0 $ 222.6 Average Interest Rate 6.70% 7.46% 7.04% Variable Rate $ 117.4 $ 117.4 $ 117.4 Average Interest Rate 3.23% 3.23% Commodities Risk We use over the counter natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options to hedge sales of our production, to hedge activity in our marketing segment, and to hedge the purchase of gas in our utility segment against the inherent price risks of adverse price fluctuations or locational pricing differences between a published index and the NYMEX, futures market. These swaps and options include (1) transactions in which one party will pay a fixed price (or variable price) for a notional quantity in exchange for receiving a variable price (or fixed price) based on a published index (referred to as price swaps), (2) transactions in which parties agree to pay a price based on two different indices (referred to as basis swaps), and (3) the purchase and sale of index related puts and calls (collars) that provide a floor price below which the counterparty pays (production hedge) or receives (gas purchase hedge) funds equal to the amount by which the price of the commodity is below the contracted floor, and a ceiling price above which we pay to (production hedge) or receives from (gas purchase hedge) the counterparty the amount by which the price of the commodity is above the contracted ceiling. The primary market risks related to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for natural gas and crude oil. However, the market price risk is offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related sale or purchase of the natural gas or sale of the oil that is hedged. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss as a result of non performance by our counterparties. The counterparties are primarily major investment and commercial banks which management believes present minimal credit risks. The credit quality of each counterparty and the level of financial exposure we have to each counterparty are periodically reviewed to ensure limited credit risk exposure. The following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in commodity prices. The table presents the notional amount in Bcf and MBbls, the weighted average contract prices, and the total dollar contract amount by expected maturity dates. The Carrying Amount for the contract amounts is calculated as the contractual payments for the quantity of gas or oil to be exchanged under futures contracts and does not represent amounts recorded in our financial statements. The Fair Value represents values for the same contracts using comparable market prices at December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2002, the Carrying Amount exceeded the Fair Value of these financial instruments by $20.5 million. 44 Table of Contents Expected Maturity Date 2003 2004 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair Amount Value Amount Value Production and Marketing Natural Gas Swaps with a fixed price receipt Contract volume (Bcf) 13.3 7.2 Weighted average price per Mcf $ 3.47 $ 4.01 Contract amount (in millions) $ 46.2 $ 31.3 $ 28.8 $ 27.0 Price collars Contract volume (Bcf) 15.9 8.0 Weighted average floor price per Mcf $ 3.16 $ 3.50 Contract amount of floor (in millions) $ 50.1 $ 50.8 $ 28.0 $ 30.2 Weighted average ceiling price per Mcf $ 4.84 $ 4.65 Contract amount of ceiling (in millions) $ 76.7 $ 71.3 $ 37.2 $ 33.2 Oil Swaps with a fixed price receipt Contract volume (MBbls) 240 Weighted average price per Bbl $ 25.40 Contract amount (in millions) $ 6.1 $ 5.7 Natural Gas Purchases Swaps with a fixed price payment Contract volume (Bcf) 2.7 Weighted average price per Mcf $ 3.42 Contract amount (in millions) $ 9.2 $ 12.3 At December 31, 2002, we had financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. This $40.0 million of notional interest rate swaps have an average fixed rate of 2.3%. Their carrying amount of $1.0 million is calculated as the contractual payments for interest on the notional amount to be exchanged under futures contracts and does not represent amounts recorded in our financial statements. The fair value of $0.6 million represents the value for the same contracts using comparable market prices at December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2002, the Carrying Amount exceeded the Fair Value of these interest rate swaps by $0.4 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2002 and prior to February 14, 2003, we entered into additional derivative contracts to hedge gas and oil production sales. A price collar hedge on 3.0 Bcf of 2003 gas production sales has a floor of $4.00 per Mcf and a ceiling of $5.97 per Mcf. A fixed price swap on oil production of 100 MBbls in 2003 will yield $29.40 per barrel. 45 Table of Contents
