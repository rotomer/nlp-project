ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This Form 10 K contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements for many reasons, including the risks described in "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this annual report. You should read the following discussion with the "Selected Financial Data" and our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. OVERVIEW Southwestern Energy Company is an integrated energy company primarily focused on natural gas. Our primary business is the exploration, development and production of natural gas and crude oil, with operations principally located in Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico and Louisiana. We also operate integrated natural gas distribution systems in northern Arkansas. As a complement to our other businesses, we provide marketing and transportation services in our core areas of operation. We operate our business in three segments: Exploration and Production, Natural Gas Distribution and Natural Gas Marketing. Our financial results depend on a number of factors, including in particular natural gas and oil prices, our ability to find and produce natural gas and oil, our ability to control costs, the seasonality of our customers need for natural gas and our ability to market natural gas and oil on economically attractive terms to our customers, all of which are dependent upon numerous factors beyond our control such as economic, political and regulatory developments and competition from other energy sources. There has been significant price volatility in the natural gas and crude oil market in recent years. The volatility was attributable to a variety of factors impacting supply and demand, including weather conditions, political events and economic events we cannot control or predict. We reported net income of $48.9 million in 2003, or $1.43 per share on a fully diluted basis, up from $14.3 million, or $0.55 per share in 2002. In 2001, we reported net income of $35.3 million, or $1.38 per share on a fully diluted basis. The increase in net income in 2003 was primarily a result of higher realized natural gas and oil prices and increased production volumes in our Exploration and Production, or E&P segment. The decrease in net income in 2002 was primarily the result of lower realized natural gas and oil prices on the operating income of our E&P segment. Operating income for our E&P segment was $84.7 million in 2003, up from $36.0 million in 2002 and $69.3 million in 2001. Operating income for our gas distribution segment was $6.8 million in 2003, compared to $7.6 million in 2002 and $10.3 million in 2001. The decreases in operating income for our gas distribution segment resulted from increased operati ng costs and expenses primarily related to higher pension, insurance and incentive compensation costs. Our cash flow from operating activities was $109.1 million in 2003, compared to $77.6 million in 2002 and $144.6 million in 2001. In 2001, our cash flow from operating activities included significant collections of accounts receivable and deferred gas costs that were generated in late 2000 by extremely high gas costs at that time. In 2003, our gas and oil production continued to increase, reaching 41.2 Bcfe, up 3% from 40.1 Bcfe in 2002 and 39.8 Bcfe in 2001. The increase in 2003 production resulted from an increase in production from our Overton Field in East Texas due to accelerated development of the field, which was partially offset by the loss of production from the sale of our Mid Continent properties in late 2002 and declining production from our South Louisiana properties. Our Mid Continent properties historically provided approximately 2.5 Bcfe of production annually. Production growth in 2003, without consideration of the sale of Mid Continent properties, would have been approximately 8%. In our E&P segment, we achieved a reserve replacement ratio of 351% in 2003 at a finding and development cost of $1.18 per Mcfe, excluding reserve revisions. Our year end reserves grew 21% to 503.1 Bcfe, up from 415.3 Bcfe at the end of 2002. Our results were primarily fueled by our continued drilling success in our Overton Field in East Texas as well as our continued successful development drilling program in the Arkoma Basin. Our capital investments totaled $180.2 million in 2003, up from $92.1 million in 2002 and $106.1 million in 2001. We invested $170.9 million in our E&P segment in 2003, compared to $85.2 million in 2002 and $99.0 million in 2001. Funds for our 2003 capital investments were provided by cash flow from operations and the $103.1 million of net proceeds from the sale of 9,487,500 shares of our common stock in the first quarter of 2003. Our equity offering in the first quarter of 2003, combined with our earnings during the year, improved our financial position and reduced our total debt to capitalization ratio to 45% at December 31, 2003 from 66% at December 31, 2002. 30 Table of Contents Our business strategy is focused on providing long term growth in the net asset value of our business. We prepare economic analyses for each of our drilling and acquisition opportunities and rank them based upon the expected present value added for each dollar invested, which we refer to as PVI. The PVI of the future expected cash flows for each project is determined using a 10% discount rate. We target adding at least $1.30 of discounted pre tax PVI for each dollar we invest in our E&P business. Our actual PVI results are utilized to help determine the allocation of our future capital investments. We are also focused on creating and capturing additional value beyond the wellhead through our natural gas distribution, marketing and transportation businesses. Capital investments planned for 2004 total $203.5 million, including $194.0 million for our E&P segment, which is an increase of 14% over our E&P capital investments in 2003. We continue to be focused on our strategy of adding value through the drillbit, as 80% of our 2004 E&P capital is allocated to drilling. Our E&P investments in 2004 will primarily be focused on our lower risk, higher rate of return development drilling programs in East Texas and the Arkoma Basin. We expect our capital program in 2004 to contribute to a targeted production and reserve growth of 15 20%. In 2004 we are targeting production to be approximately 47.5 Bcfe to 50.0 Bcfe, compared to 41.2 Bcfe in 2003. Our capital investments in 2004 will be funded by cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. With todays commodity price environment, our current capital program and our inventory of projects for the future, we believe we are well positioned to continue to build upon the momentum achieved in 2003. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Exploration and Production Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Revenues (in thousands) $ 176,245 $ 122,207 $ 153,937 Operating income (in thousands) $ 84,737 $ 36,048 $ 69,340 Gas production (Bcf) 38.0 36.0 35.5 Oil production (MBbls) 531 682 719 Total production (Bcfe) 41.2 40.1 39.8 Average gas price per Mcf, including hedges $ 4.20 $ 3.00 $ 3.85 Average gas price per Mcf, excluding hedges $ 5.15 $ 3.11 $ 4.16 Average oil price per Bbl, including hedges $ 26.72 $ 21.02 $ 23.55 Average oil price per Bbl, excluding hedges $ 29.66 $ 23.94 $ 23.58 Average unit costs per Mcfe Lease operating expenses $ 0.39 $ 0.45 $ 0.45 Taxes other than income taxes $ 0.22 $ 0.19 $ 0.17 General & administrative expenses $ 0.41 $ 0.32 $ 0.34 Full cost pool amortization $ 1.17 $ 1.16 $ 1.14 Revenues, Operating Income and Production Revenues. Our exploration and production revenues increased 44% in 2003 to $176.2 million compared to $122.2 million in 2002. The increase was primarily due to higher prices received for our natural gas and oil production and to slightly increased gas production volumes. Revenues decreased 21% in 2002 from $153.9 million in 2001. The decrease was primarily due to lower prices received for natural gas. Operating Income. Operating income from our exploration and production segment was $84.7 million in 2003, up from $36.0 million in 2002 and $69.3 million in 2001. The increase in 2003 was due to a 40% increase in the average price received for our natural gas production and a 3% increase in our equivalent production volumes, partially offset by increased operating costs and expenditures. The decrease in 2002 was primarily due to a decrease in revenues caused by the lower realized natural gas prices. Production. Gas and oil production totaled 41.2 Bcfe in 2003, 40.1 Bcfe in 2002 and 39.8 Bcfe in 2001. The increase in 2003 production resulted from an increase in production from our Overton Field in East Texas due to the accelerated development of the field, partially offset by declines experienced in our South Louisiana properties that began in the last 31 Table of Contents half of 2002, combined with the loss of production resulting from the November 2002 sale of our non strategic Mid Continent properties. Production from our Mid Continent properties historically averaged approximately 2.5 Bcfe annually. Overall production in 2002 was up slightly over 2001 as increased production from our Overton Field properties in East Texas and from our Gulf Coast properties more than offset production declines in our Arkoma Basin and Permian Basin properties. Gas sales to unaffiliated purchasers were 32.1 Bcf in 2003, up from 30.6 Bcf in 2002 and 30.4 Bcf in 2001. Sales to unaffiliated purchasers are primarily made under contracts that reflect current short term prices and are subject to seasonal price swings. Intersegment sales to Arkansas Western were 5.9 Bcf in 2003, 5.4 Bcf in 2002 and 5.1 Bcf in 2001. The changes in intersegment sales volumes reflect both the effects of weather and the ability of our E&P segment to obtain gas supply contracts that are periodically placed out for bids. Weather in 2003, as measured in degree days, was 1% warmer than normal and approximately even with the prior year. Weather in 2002 was 2% warmer than normal and 8% colder than the prior year. Weather in 2001 was 9% warmer than both normal and the prior year. Our gas production provided approximately 41% of the utilitys requirements in 2003, 37% in 2002 and 33% in 2001. Future sales to Arkansas Westerns gas distribution systems will be dependent upon our success in obtaining gas supply contracts with the utility systems. In the future, we will continue to bid to obtain these gas supply contracts, although there is no assurance that we will be successful. If successful, we cannot predict the amount of fixed demand charges, if any, that would be associated with the new contracts. We also sell gas directly to industrial and commercial transportation customers located on Arkansas Westerns gas distribution systems. We expect future increases in our gas production to come primarily from sales to unaffiliated purchasers. We are unable to predict changes in the market demand and price for natural gas, including changes that may be induced by the effects of weather on demand of both affiliated and unaffiliated customers for our production. Additionally, we hold a large amount of undeveloped leaseh old acreage and producing acreage, and have an inventory of drilling leads, prospects and seismic data that will continue to be evaluated and developed in the future. Our exploration programs have been directed primarily toward natural gas in recent years. Commodity Prices The average price realized for our gas production, including the effects of hedges, was $4.20 per Mcf in 2003, $3.00 per Mcf in 2002 and $3.85 per Mcf in 2001. The changes in the average price realized primarily reflect changes in average annual spot market prices and the effects of our price hedging activities. Our hedging activities lowered the average gas price $0.95 per Mcf in 2003, $0.11 per Mcf in 2002 and $0.31 per Mcf in 2001. Additionally, we have historically received demand charges related to sales made to our utility segment, which has increased our average gas price realized. We periodically enter into hedging activities with respect to a portion of our projected natural gas and crude oil production through a variety of financial arrangements intended to support natural gas and oil prices at targeted levels and to minimize the impact of price fluctuations (we refer you to Item 7A of this Form 10 K and Note 8 to the financial statements for additional discussion). Our policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings. At December 31, 2003, we had hedges in place on 37.2 Bcf of 2004 and 2005 gas production. Subsequent to December 31, 2003 and prior to February 23, 2004, we hedged an additional 4.0 Bcf of future gas production. At December 31, 2003 we had hedges in place on 426,000 barrels of 2004 oil production. As of February 23, 2004, we have hedged approximately 60 70% of our 2004 anticipated gas production level and 70 80% of our 2004 anticipated oil production level. Disregarding the impact of hedges, we would normally expect the average price received for our gas production to be approximately $0.15 to $0.20 per Mcf lower than average spot market prices, as market differentials that reduce the average prices received are partially offset by demand charges received under the contracts covering our intersegment sales to our utility systems. Future changes in revenues from sales of our gas production will be dependent upon changes in the market price for gas, access to new markets, maintenance of existing markets, and additions of new gas reserves. We realized an average price of $26.72 per barrel, including the effects of hedges, for our oil production for the year ended December 31, 2003, up from $21.02 per barrel for 2002 and $23.55 per barrel for 2001. Our hedging activities lowered the average oil price $2.94 per barrel in 2003, $2.92 per barrel in 2002 and $0.03 per barrel in 2001. Disregarding the impact of hedges, we expect the average price received for our oil production to be approximately $1.25 lower than posted spot market prices. 32 Table of Contents Operating Costs and Expenses Lease operating expenses per Mcfe for this business segment were $0.39 in 2003, down from $0.45 in both 2002 and 2001. Lease operating expenses per unit decreased in 2003 due to changes in the geographic mix of our production and higher workover expenses in 2002. Taxes other than income taxes per Mcfe were $0.22 in 2003, compared to $0.19 in 2002 and $0.17 in 2001. The increase in 2003 taxes other than income taxes per Mcfe was due to increased severance and ad valorem taxes that resulted from generally higher commodity prices and from the changing mix of our production among taxing jurisdictions. General and administrative expenses per Mcfe were $0.41 in 2003, compared to $0.32 in 2002 and $0.34 in 2001. The increase in general and administrative costs per Mcfe in 2003 was due primarily to increased pension, insurance and incentive compensation costs. We expect our cost per Mcfe for operating and general and administrative expense to decline in 2004 primarily due to our anticipated increase in production. Future changes in our general and administrative expenses are primarily dependent upon our salary costs, level of pension expense and the amount of incentive compensation paid to our employees. See "Critical Accounting Policies" below for further discussion of pension expense. Our full cost pool amortization rate averaged $1.17 per Mcfe for 2003, compared to $1.16 in 2002 and $1.14 in 2001. The amortization rate is impacted by reserve additions and the costs incurred for those additions, revisions of previous reserve estimates due to both price and well performance, and the level of unevaluated costs excluded from amortization. Unevaluated costs excluded from amortization were $39.0 million at the end of 2003, compared to $25.5 million at the end of 2002 and $26.2 million at the end of 2001. The increase in unevaluated costs at December 31, 2003 primarily resulted from unproved costs for wells in progress at year end and an increase in our undeveloped leasehold acreage related to our new venture areas. We utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our natural gas and oil properties. Under this method, all such costs (productive and nonproductive) are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method. These capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test, however, which limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved gas and oil reserves discounted at 10 percent (standardized measure) plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties. Any costs in excess of this ceiling are written off as a non cash expense. The expense may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling. Full cost companies must use the prices in effect at the end of each accounting quarter, including the impact of derivati ves qualifying as hedges, to calculate the ceiling value of their reserves. At December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, our unamortized costs of natural gas and oil properties did not exceed this ceiling amount. At December 31, 2003, our standardized measure was calculated based upon quoted market prices of $5.97 per Mcf for gas and $32.52 per barrel for oil, adjusted for market differentials. A decline in natural gas and oil prices from year end 2003 levels or other factors, without other mitigating circumstances, could cause a future write down of capitalized costs and a non cash charge against future earnings. In November 2002, we sold our remaining non strategic Mid Continent properties, including our properties in the Sho Vel Tum area in southern Oklahoma, the Anadarko Basin in western Oklahoma and the Sooner Trend in northwestern Oklahoma, for a total of $26.4 million. These properties represented approximately 32.9 Bcfe of reserves and produced approximately 2.5 Bcfe annually. This divestiture, along with increased production from the Overton Field, resulted in a decrease in our average production costs per unit of production in 2003. In 2001, our subsidiary, SEPCO, formed a limited partnership with an investor to drill and complete 14 development wells in SEPCOs Overton Field located in Smith County, Texas. The Overton properties were acquired by SEPCO in April 2000 and have multiple development locations through the downspacing of the existing producing units. Because SEPCO is the sole general partner and owns a majority interest in the partnership, operating and financial results for the partnership are consolidated with our other operations and the investors share of the partnership activity is reported as a minority interest item in the financial statements. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, the minority interest owner in the partnership contributed $0.1 million, $0.5 million and $13.5 million, respectively, in capital to the limited partnership. The investors share of 2003, 2002 and 2001 revenues, less operating costs and expenses, was $2.2 million, $1.5 mil lion and $0.9 million, respectively. Inflation impacts us by generally increasing our operating costs and the costs of our capital additions. The effects of inflation on our operations prior to 2000 have been minimal due to low inflation rates. However, since 2001, the impact of inflation has intensified in certain areas of our exploration and production segment as shortages in drilling rigs, third party services and qualified labor developed due to an overall increase in the activity level of the domestic natural gas and oil industry. We feel this impact increased in 2003 with an increase in the industry activity level caused by higher commodity 33 Table of Contents prices. Southwestern has mitigated rising costs in certain situations by obtaining vendor commitments to multiple projects and by offering incentives to vendors for increased efficiencies resulting in cost reductions. Natural Gas Distribution Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 ($ in thousands except for per Mcf amounts) Revenues $ 137,356 $ 115,850 $ 147,282 Gas purchases $ 84,926 $ 66,486 $ 96,058 Operating costs and expenses $ 45,664 $ 41,801 $ 40,878 Operating income $ 6,766 $ 7,563 $ 10,346 Deliveries (Bcf) Sales and end use transportation 24.7 25.1 24.0 Off system transportation 0.3 2.2 3.1 Customers at year end 141,573 139,543 136,242 Average sales rate per Mcf $ 7.93 $ 6.49 $ 8.26 Heating weather degree days 3,969 3,950 3,654 Percent of normal 99% 98% 91% Revenues and Operating Income Gas distribution revenues fluctuate due to the effects of warm weather on demand for natural gas and the pass through of gas supply cost changes. Because of the corresponding changes in purchased gas costs, the revenue effect of the pass through of gas cost changes has not materially affected net income. Gas distribution revenues increased 19% in 2003 and decreased 21% in 2002. The increase in 2003 gas distribution revenues was primarily due to a higher average sales rate caused by higher gas prices. The decrease in 2002 was primarily due to a lower average sales rate caused by lower gas prices. Weather during 2003 in the utilitys service territory was 1% warmer than normal and slightly above the prior year. Weather during 2002 was 2% warmer than normal and 8% colder than the prior year, and was 9% warmer than both normal and the prior year in 2001. Operating income for our utility systems decreased 11% in 2003 and decreased 27% in 2002. The decrease in 2003 and 2002 operating income for this segment resulted from increased operating costs and expenses and reduced usage per customer due to customer conservation brought about by high gas prices. In October 2003 we implemented a rate increase that will increase revenue and operating income by $4.1 million annually (see "Regulatory Matters" below for a discussion of the rate increase) and were also allowed to recover certain additional costs totaling $2.3 million over a two year period. Operating income in 2003 included a gain of $1.0 million related to the recovery of these costs. Gas distribution revenues in future years will be impacted by the utilitys gas purchase costs, customer growth and rate increases allowed by the APSC. In recent years, Arkansas Western has experienced customer growth of approximately 2% annually in its Northwest Arkansas service territory, while it has experienced little or no customer growth in its service territory in Northeast Arkansas. Based on current economic conditions in our service territories, we expect this trend in customer growth to continue. Deliveries and Rates In 2003, Arkansas Western sold 16.3 Bcf to its customers at an average rate of $7.93 per Mcf, compared to 16.7 Bcf at $6.49 per Mcf in 2002 and 17.0 Bcf at $8.26 per Mcf in 2001. Additionally, Arkansas Western transported 8.4 Bcf in 2003 and 2002, and 7.0 Bcf in 2001 for its end use customers. The decrease in volumes sold in 2003 primarily resulted from variations in weather and customer conservation brought about by high gas prices in recent years. The decrease in volumes sold in 2002 resulted from customer conservation and from several industrial customers moving from system supply to transportation. Arkansas Westerns tariffs contain a weather normalization clause to lessen the impact of revenue increases and decreases which might result from weather variations during the winter heating season. The fluctuations in the average sales rates reflect changes in the average cost of gas purchased for delivery to our customers, which a re passed through to customers under automatic adjustment clauses. Total deliveries to industrial customers of the utility segment, including transportation volumes, were 9.6 Bcf in 2003, 9.9 Bcf in 2002 and 9.5 Bcf in 2001. The decrease in deliveries in 2003 was due to customer conservation brought about by 34 Table of Contents high gas prices partially offset by continued industrial growth in the region. Arkansas Western also transported 0.3 Bcf of gas through its gathering system in 2003 compared to 2.2 Bcf in 2002 and 3.1 Bcf in 2001 for off system deliveries, all to the Ozark Gas Transmission System. The level of off system deliveries each year generally reflects the changes of on system demands of our gas distribution systems for our gas production. The average off system transportation rate was approximately $0.13 per Mcf, exclusive of fuel, in 2003, 2002 and 2001. Future volumes delivered to customers will be impacted by customer growth, weather and the effect that gas prices will continue to have on customer conservation. Operating Costs and Expenses The changes in purchased gas costs for the gas distribution segment reflect volumes purchased, prices paid for supplies and the mix of purchases from various gas supply contracts (base load, swing and no notice). Operating costs and expenses increased in 2003 as compared to 2002 due to general inflationary effects, increased general and administrative expenses and increased transmission expense. The increase in general and administrative expenses resulted from increases in pension, insurance and incentive compensation costs. The increase in transmission expense resulted from higher fuel costs. Operating costs and expenses increased in 2002 as compared to 2001 due to general inflationary effects and increased pension and insurance costs. Operating costs in 2001 also included increased bad debt expense caused by high natural gas prices in the 2000 2001 winter heating season. Future changes in our general and administrative expenses are primarily dependent upon our salary costs, level of pension expense and the amount of incentive compensation paid to our employees. See "Critical Accounting Policies" below for further discussion of pension expense. In October 1998, Arkansas Western instituted a competitive bidding process for its gas supply. Additionally, Arkansas Western annually submits its gas supply plan to the general staff of the APSC. As a result of the bidding process under the plan filed for the 2003 2004 gas purchase year, SEECO successfully bid on gas supply packages representing approximately 55% of the requirements for Arkansas Western for 2004. The contracts awarded to SEECO expire through 2005. Arkansas Western enters into hedging activities from time to time with respect to its gas purchases to protect against the inherent price risks of adverse price fluctuations. We refer you to "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks" and Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information. Inflation impacts our gas distribution segment by generally increasing our operating costs and the costs of our capital additions. The effects of inflation on the utilitys operations in recent years have been minimal due to low inflation rates. Additionally, delays inherent in the rate making process prevent us from obtaining immediate recovery of increased operating costs of our gas distribution segment. Regulatory Matters Arkansas Westerns rates and operations are regulated by the APSC. Arkansas Western operates through municipal franchises that are perpetual by virtue of state law, but are not exclusive within a geographic area. Although its rates for gas delivered to its retail customers are not regulated by the FERC, its transmission and gathering pipeline systems are subject to the FERCs regulations concerning open access transportation. As the regulatory focus of the natural gas industry has shifted from the federal level to the state level, some utilities across the nation have unbundled residential sales services from transportation services in an effort to promote greater competition. No such legislation or regulatory directives related to natural gas are presently pending in Arkansas. In Arkansas, the state legislature enacted Act 1556 for the deregulation of the retail sale of electricity by 2002. In December 2001, the APSC submitted its annual report to the Arkansas legislature on the development of electric deregulation and recommended that the legislature consider suspending deregulation to the year 2010 or 2012, or repeal Act 1556 (as modified by Act 324). In 2003, Act 1556 was repealed. During 2004, the APSC will conduct collaborative meetings to study the feasibility of a large user access program for electric service choice. Although Arkansas Western already provides transportation service for its large users, this collaborative process could set regulatory precedents that would also affect natural gas utilities in the future. These effects may include protection of other customer classes against cost shifting and the regulatory treatment of stranded costs. Arkansas Western has historically maintained a price advantage over electricity for most applications. This has enabled the utility to achieve excellent market penetration levels. However, during 2001 the high gas prices experienced in the 2000 2001 heating season temporarily eroded the price advantage. Arkansas Western has made progress in regaining price advantage in its markets as gas prices have declined from the levels experienced in the winter of 2000 2001. 35 Table of Contents Arkansas Western filed an application with the APSC on November 8, 2002, for a rate increase of $11.0 million annually. In the third quarter of 2003 we received regulatory approval from the APSC of a rate increase totaling $4.1 million annually, exclusive of costs to be recovered through Arkansas Westerns purchase gas adjustment clause. The order also entitled Arkansas Western to recover certain additional costs totaling $2.3 million through its purchase gas adjustment clause over a two year period. The rate increase was effective for all customer bills rendered on or after October 1, 2003. Arkansas Westerns last rate increase was approved in December 1996 for its Northwest region and in December 1997 for its Northeast region. The APSC approved increases of $5.1 million and $1.2 million, respectively. The two operating regions have since been combined into one. The difference between the $11.0 million rate adjustment requested by Arkansas Western and the rate adjustment contained in the approved order primarily results from a reduction in Arkansas Westerns requested return on equity and a change in Arkansas Westerns assumed capital structure. In the rate increase request that was filed with the APSC, we assumed an allowed return on equity of 12.9% and a capital structure of 48% debt and 52% equity. The final order provided for an allowed return on equity of 9.9% and an assumed capital structure of 52% debt and 48% equity. The 9.9% equity return is in line with the equity return approved in recent settlements that have been approved for the other two Arkansas local gas distribution companies. Rate increase requests, which may be filed in the future, will depend on customer growth, increases in operating expenses, and additional investment in property, plant and equipment. In February 2001, the APSC approved a 90 day temporary tariff to collect additional gas costs not yet billed to customers through the utilitys normal purchased gas adjustment clause in its approved tariffs. We had significant under recovered purchased gas costs as a result of the high prices paid for gas supply in the 2000 2001 heating season. The temporary tariff allowed the utility accelerated recovery of these gas costs. In April 2002, Arkansas Western filed a revised purchased gas adjustment clause that provides better matching between the time the gas costs are incurred and the time the costs are recovered. The APSC approved the new clause in May 2002. In April 2002, the APSC adopted Natural Gas Procurement Plan Rules for utilities. These rules require utilities to take all reasonable and prudent steps necessary to develop a diversified gas supply portfolio. The portfolio should consist of an appropriate combination of different types of gas purchase contracts and or financial hedging instruments that are designed to yield an optimum balance of reliability, reduced volatility and reasonable price. Utilities are also required to submit on an annual basis their gas supply plan, along with their contracting and or hedging objectives, to the staff of the APSC for review and determination as to whether it is consistent with these policy principles. If the plan includes a hedging strategy and it is determined to be consistent with the objectives of the policy principles, utilities will be allowed to flow any hedging gain or loss to customers through the purchased gas adjustment clause . During 2001, Arkansas Western submitted its annual gas supply plan for the 2001 2002 heating season and a revision to its purchased gas adjustment clause for the recovery of hedging gains and losses to the staff of the APSC. In May 2002 and April 2003, Arkansas Western submitted its annual gas supply plan for the 2002 2003 and 2003 2004 heating seasons. Arkansas Western also purchases gas from unaffiliated producers under take or pay contracts. We believe that we do not have a significant exposure to liabilities resulting from these contracts and expect to be able to continue to satisfactorily manage our exposure to take or pay liabilities. Marketing and Transportation Marketing Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Revenues (in millions) $202.0 $131.1 $190.3 Operating income (in millions) $ 2.6 $ 2.7 $ 2.7 Gas volumes marketed (Bcf) 42.7 45.5 49.6 Our operating income from natural gas marketing was $2.6 million on revenues of $202.0 million in 2003, compared to $2.7 million on revenues of $131.3 million in 2002 and $2.7 million on revenues of $190.3 million in 2001. The increase in revenues in 2003 resulted from higher prices received for gas sold and was offset by a corresponding increase in gas purchase expense. We marketed 42.7 Bcf in 2003, compared to 45.5 Bcf in 2002 and 49.6 Bcf in 2001. The decline in total volumes marketed in 2003 and 2002 resulted primarily from the decline in volumes marketed to third parties. This reduction reflects our continued focus on marketing our own production and limiting the marketing of third party volumes in an effort to reduce our credit risk. Of the total volumes marketed, production from our exploration and production 36 Table of Contents subsidiaries accounted for 75% in 2003, 67% in 2002 and 66% in 2001. We enter into hedging activities from time to time with respect to our gas marketing activities to provide margin protection. We refer you to "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks" and Note 8 to the financial statements for additional discussion. Transportation Our marketing group also manages our 25% interest in NOARK. At December 31, 2003, Arkansas Western had transportation contracts with Ozark Pipeline for 66.9 MMcf per day of firm capacity. These contracts are renewable annually until terminated with 180 days notice. NOARK and Arkansas Western are currently renegotiating these contracts. We recorded pre tax income from operations related to our NOARK investment of $1.1 million in 2003, compared to pre tax losses of $0.3 million in 2002 and $1.5 million in 2001. These amounts are recorded in other income (expense) in our income statement. The pre tax gain in 2003 included a gain of $1.3 million recognized on the sale of a 28 mile portion of NOARKs pipeline located in Oklahoma that had limited strategic value to the overall system. The trend in improved operating results has been primarily caused by NOARKs ability to collect higher transportation rates on interruptible volumes. We believe that we will be able to continue to improve NOARKs operating results and expect our investment in NOARK to be realized over the life of the system. We refer you to Note 7 to the financial statements for additional discussion. We have severally guaranteed the debt service on a portion of NOARKs outstanding debt. NOARKs outstanding debt was $69.0 million at December 31, 2003, and our share of the guarantee was $41.4 million. This debt financed a portion of the original cost to construct the NOARK Pipeline. We were not required to advance any funds to NOARK in 2003 and 2002, but we advanced $1.4 million in 2001 primarily for debt service. We refer you to "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Off Balance Sheet Arrangements" and Note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of our guarantee of NOARK debt. Interest Expense Interest costs, net of capitalization, were down 19% in 2003 and down 9% in 2002, both as compared to prior years. The decreases in interest costs were due to both comparatively lower average borrowings and lower average interest rates. In 2003, our average borrowings again decreased as net proceeds of $103.1 million from the sale of our common stock in the first quarter of 2003 were initially used to pay down our revolving credit facility. We are reborrowing the repaid amounts under the credit facility, as necessary, to fund the acceleration of the development of our Overton Field in East Texas and for general corporate purposes. Interest capitalized increased 21% in 2003 and decreased 7% in 2002. Changes in capitalized interest are primarily due to the level of costs excluded from amortization in our E&P segment. Income Taxes Our provision for deferred income taxes was an effective rate of 36.7% in 2003, 37.8% in 2002 and 38.3% in 2001. The changes in the provision for deferred income taxes recorded each year result primarily from the level of taxable income, the collection of under recovered purchased gas costs, abandoned property costs, and the deduction of intangible drilling costs in the year incurred for tax purposes, netted against the turnaround of intangible drilling costs deducted for tax purposes in prior years. Intangible drilling costs are capitalized and amortized over future years for financial reporting purposes under the full cost method of accounting. Pension Expense We recorded pension expense of $3.3 million in 2003, $0.9 million in 2002 and a credit to expense of $0.1 million in 2001. The amount of pension expense recorded by us is determined by actuarial calculations and is also impacted by the funded status of our plans. During 2003, we funded our pension plan with contributions of $3.0 million. At December 31, 2003, our pension plans were underfunded and a liability of $0.9 million was recorded on the balance sheet. As a result of the underfunded status and actuarial data to be completed in early 2004, we expect to record pension expense of $2.5 million to $3.0 million in 2004. For further discussion of our pension plans, we refer you to Note 4 to the financial statements and "Critical Accounting Policies" below. Other Revenues Revenues and operating income in 2003 included pre tax gains of $3.0 million related to the sale of real estate and certain property and equipment, and $3.1 million of pre tax gain related to the sale of gas in storage inventory. 37 Table of Contents Adoption of Accounting Principle Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" (FAS 143), was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2003. FAS 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. FAS 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made, and that the associated asset retirement costs be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset. The effect of this standard on our results of operations and financial condition at adoption was an increase in current and long term liabilities of $1.2 million and $5.5 million, respectively; a net increase in property, plant and equipment of $5.3 million; a cumulative effect of adoption expense of $0.9 million and a deferred tax asset of $0.5 million. As of December 31, 2003, we had $0.2 million of current liabilities and $7.4 million of long term liabilities associated with our asset retirement obligations. Subsequent to adoption, we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our future financial position or our results of operations. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We depend on internally generated funds and our unsecured revolving credit facilities (discussed below under "Financing Requirements") as our primary sources of liquidity. We may borrow up to $315 million under our new revolving credit facilities from time to time. As of February 23, 2004, we had $49.1 million of indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facilities. During 2004 we expect to draw on a portion of the funds available under our credit facilities to fund our planned capital expenditures (discussed below under "Capital Expenditures") for 2004 which are expected to exceed the net cash generated by our operations. In December 2002, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC pursuant to which we may from time to time, subject to market conditions, publicly offer equity, debt or other securities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $109.1 million in 2003, compared to $77.6 million in 2002 and $144.6 million in 2001. The primary components of cash generated from operations are net income, depreciation, depletion and amortization, the provision for deferred income taxes and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash from operating activities increased in 2003 due primarily to increased net income and the related increase in deferred income taxes. In 2001, $55.4 million of the $144.6 million of cash provided by operating activities resulted from changes in our operating assets caused by the collection of accounts receivable and under recovered purchased gas costs that resulted from the extremely high gas prices that were in effect at the end of 2000. Net cash from operating activities provided 65% of our cash requirements for capital expenditures in 2003, 84% in 2002 and over 100% in 2001. Our cash flow from operating activities is highly dependent upon market prices that we receive for our gas and oil production. The price received for our production is also influenced by our commodity hedging activities, as more fully discussed in "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks" and Note 8 to the financial statements. Natural gas and oil prices are subject to wide fluctuations. As a result, we are unable to forecast with certainty our future level of cash flow from operations. We adjust our discretionary uses of cash dependent upon cash flow available. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures totaled $180.2 million in 2003, $92.1 million in 2002 and $106.1 million in 2001. In 2003, capital expenditures for our E&P segment include $12.0 million of accrued expenditures. Additionally, our E&P segment expenditures included acquisitions of interests in natural gas and oil producing properties totaling $3.0 million in 2003, $3.5 million in 2002 and $7.3 million in 2001. Our reported capital investments for 2003, 2002 and 2001 include the gross expenditures in the Overton Field partnership discussed previously. The owner of the minority interest in the Overton partnership funded $0.5 million and $13.5 million of our E&P expenditures during 2002 and 2001, respectively. 2003 2002 2001 (in thousands) Exploration and production $ 170,886 $ 85,201 $ 98,964 Gas distribution 8,178 6,115 5,347 Other 1,139 746 1,749 $ 180,203 $ 92,062 $ 106,060 38 Table of Contents Our capital investments planned for 2004 total $203.5 million, consisting of $194.0 million for exploration and production, $7.9 million for gas distribution system improvements and $1.6 million for general purposes. We expect that this level of capital investments in 2004 will allow us to accelerate the development of our Overton Field properties in East Texas, maintain our present markets, explore and develop other existing gas and oil properties, generate new drilling prospects, and provide for improvements necessary due to normal customer growth in our gas distribution segment. As discussed above, our 2004 capital investment program is expected to be funded through cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facilities. We may adjust the level of 2004 capital investments dependent upon our level of cash flow generated from operations. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As discussed above in "Results of Operations," we hold a 25% general partnership interest in NOARK, which owns the Ozark Pipeline that is utilized to transport our gas production and the gas production of others. We account for our investment under the equity method of accounting. We and the other general partner of NOARK have severally guaranteed the principal and interest payments on NOARKs 7.15% Notes due 2018. This debt financed a portion of the original cost to construct the NOARK Pipeline. Our share of the guarantee is 60% and we are allocated 60% of the interest expense. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the outstanding principal amount of these notes was $69.0 million and $71.0 million, respectively. Our share of the guarantee was $41.4 million and $42.6 million, respectively. The notes were issued in June 1998 and require semi annual principal payments of $1.0 million. Under the several guarantee, we are required to fund our share of NOARKs debt service which is not funded by operations of the pipeline. We were not required to advance any funds to NOARK in 2003 and 2002, and advanced $1.4 million in 2001. We do not derive any liquidity, capital resources, market risk support or credit risk support from our investment in NOARK. Our share of the results of operations included in other income (expense) related to our NOARK investment was pre tax income of $1.1 million in 2003, and pre tax losses of $0.3 million in 2002 and $1.5 million in 2001. In 2003, our share of pre tax income included a gain of $1.3 million related to the sale of a 28 mile portion of NOARKs pipeline system in Oklahoma. The improvement in operating results in 2003 and 2002 resulted primarily from the ability to collect higher transportation rates on interruptible volumes. We believe that we will be able to continue to improve the operating results of the NOARK project and expect our investment in NOARK to be realized over the life of the system (see Note 7 of the financial statements for additional discussion). NOARKs assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 are as follows: 2003 2002 (in thousands) Current assets $ 20,642 $ 15,730 Noncurrent assets 161,994 169,970 $ 182,636 $ 185,700 Current liabilities $ 7,537 $ 7,631 Long term debt 67,000 69,000 Partners capital 108,099 109,069 $ 182,636 $ 185,700 NOARKs results of operations for 2003, 2002 and 2001 are summarized below: 2003 2002 2001 (in thousands) Operating revenues $ 72,038 $ 75,959 $ 81,662 Pre tax income (loss) $ 9,030 $ 3,011 $ (1,047) Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments We have various contractual obligations in the normal course of our operations and financing activities. Significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2003 are as follows: 39 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations: Payments Due by Period Less than More than Total 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years 5 Years (in thousands) Long term debt $ 278,800 $ $ 125,000 $ 53,800 $ 100,000 Operating leases (1) 6,126 1,224 2,183 911 1,808 Unconditional purchase obligations (2) Demand charges (3) 24,424 11,396 6,192 2,898 3,938 Other obligations (4) 5,567 5,467 50 50 $ 314,917 $ 18,087 $ 133,425 $ 57,659 $ 105,746 (1)We lease certain office space and equipment under non cancelable operating leases expiring through 2013. (2)Our utility segment has volumetric commitments for the purchase of gas under non cancelable competitive bid packages and non cancelable wellhead contracts. Volumetric purchase commitments at December 31, 2003 totaled 2.5 Bcf, comprised of 1.2 Bcf in less than one year, 0.8 Bcf in one to three years, 0.3 Bcf in three to five years and 0.2 Bcf in more than five years. Our volumetric purchase commitments are priced primarily at regional gas indices set at the first of each future month. These costs are recoverable from the utilitys end use customers. (3)Our utility segment has commitments for approximately $18.0 million of demand charges on non cancelable firm gas purchase and firm transportation agreements. These costs are recoverable from the utilitys end use customers. Our E&P segment has a commitment for approximately $6.4 million of demand transportation charges. (4)Our significant other contractual obligations include approximately $2.8 million for funding of benefit plans, approximately $0.6 million of land leases, approximately $1.0 million for drilling rig commitments and approximately $1.0 million of various information technology support and data subscription agreements. We refer you to "Financing Requirements" below for a discussion of the terms of our long term debt. Contingent Liabilities and Commitments We have the following commitments and contingencies that could create, increase or accelerate our liabilities. Substantially all of our employees are covered by defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans. Our return on the assets of these plans in 2002 was negative which, combined with other factors, resulted in an increase in pension expense and our required funding of the plans for 2003. At December 31, 2003 we recorded an accrued pension benefit liability of $0.9 million. As a result of the underfunded status and actuarial data to be completed in early 2004, we expect to record pension expense of $2.5 million to $3.0 million in 2004. See Note 4 to the financial statements and "Critical Accounting Policies" below for additional information. As discussed above in "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements," we have guaranteed 60% of the principal and interest payments on NOARKs 7.15% Notes due 2018. At December 31, 2003 the principal outstanding for these notes was $69.0 million. The notes require semi annual principal payments of $1.0 million. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information. Financing Requirements Our total debt outstanding was $278.8 million at December 31, 2003 and $342.4 million at December 31, 2002. In January 2004, we entered into a new $300 million three year unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks which replaced our previous $125 million credit facility that was due to expire in July 2004. We also have access to an additional $15 million of borrowing capacity under a separate three year unsecured credit facility entered into at the same time. At December 31, 2003, we had $53.8 million of outstanding debt under our prior revolving credit facility. The interest rate on each of the new facilities is calculated based upon our public debt rating and is currently 125 basis points over LIBOR. Our publicly traded notes are rated BBB by Standard and Poors and Ba2 by Moodys. Any downgrades in our public debt ratings could increase the cost of funds under our revolving credit facilities. Our revolving credit facilities contain covenants which impose certain restrictions on us. Under the credit agreements, we may not issue total debt in excess of 60% of our total capital, must maintain a certain level of shareholders equity, and must maintain a ratio of EBITDA to interest expense of 3.5 or above. Additionally, there are certain limitations on the amount of indebtedness that may be incurred by our subsidiaries. We were in compliance with the covenants of our debt agreements at December 31, 2003. Although we do not anticipate debt covenant violations, our ability to comply with our 40 Table of Contents debt agreements is dependent upon the success of our exploration and development program and upon factors beyond our control, such as the market prices for natural gas and oil. In 1997, we publicly issued $60.0 million of 7.625% Medium Term Notes due 2027 and $40.0 million of 7.21% Medium Term Notes due 2017. In 1995, we publicly issued $125.0 million of 6.7% Notes due in 2005. In December 2002, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC for the purpose of qualifying the potential sale from time to time of up to an aggregate $300 million of equity, debt and other securities. During the first quarter of 2003, we completed the sale of 9,487,500 shares of our common stock under the shelf registration statement. Aggregate net proceeds from the equity offering of $103.1 million were used to repay borrowings under our credit facility. We are reborrowing the repaid amounts as necessary to fund the acceleration of the development of our Overton Field in East Texas and for general corporate purposes. In June 1998, the NOARK partnership issued $80.0 million of 7.15% Notes due 2018. The notes require semi annual principal payments of $1.0 million that began in December 1998. We account for our investment in NOARK under the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the results of NOARK. We and Enogex, the other general partner of NOARK, have severally guaranteed the principal and interest payments on the NOARK debt. Our share of the several guarantee is 60% and amounted to $41.4 million at December 31, 2003. We did not advance any funds to NOARK in 2003 and 2002 and advanced $1.4 million in 2001. If NOARK is unable to generate sufficient cash in the future to service its debt and we are required to contribute cash to fund our share of the debt service guarantee, we could be required to record our share of the NOARK debt commitment under current accounting rules. At the end of 2003, our capital structure consisted of 45% debt (excluding our several guarantee of NOARKs obligations) and 55% equity, with a ratio of EBITDA to interest expense of 8.80. EBITDA is a measure required by our debt covenants and is defined as net income plus interest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Shareholders equity in the December 31, 2003 balance sheet includes an accumulated other comprehensive loss of $12.0 million related to our hedging activities that is required to be recorded under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (FAS 133). This amount is based on current market values of our hedges at December 31, 2003, and does not necessarily reflect the value that we will receive when the hedges are ultimately settled, nor does it take into account revenues to be received ass ociated with the physical delivery of sales volumes hedged. Our debt covenants as to capitalization percentages exclude the effects of non cash entries that result from FAS 133 as well as the non cash impact of any full cost ceiling write downs, and include the guarantee of NOARKs obligations. Our capital structure, including our several guarantee of NOARKs obligations, would be 48% debt and 52% equity at December 31, 2003 without consideration of the accumulated other comprehensive loss related to FAS 133. As part of our strategy to insure a certain level of cash flow to fund our operations, we have hedged approximately 60 70% of our expected 2004 gas production and 70 80% of our expected 2004 oil production. The amount of long term debt we incur is dependent upon commodity prices and our capital expenditure plans. If commodity prices remain at or near current levels throughout 2004 and our capital expenditure plans do not change from current expectations, we will increase our long term debt in 2004. If c ommodity prices significantly decrease, we may modify our capital expenditure plans. We refer you to "Business Overview Other Items Reconciliation of Non GAAP Measures" in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10 K for a table that reconciles EBITDA with our net income as derived from our audited financial information. Working Capital We maintain access to funds that may be needed to meet seasonal requirements through our credit facilities described above. We had positive working capital of $5.2 million at the end of 2003 and $1.6 million at the end of 2002. Current assets increased by 32% in 2003 and current liabilities increased 28%. The increase in current assets at December 31, 2003 was due primarily to increases in accounts receivable and gas in storage inventories. The increase in accounts receivable was caused by higher gas prices realized for sales made at the end of 2003, as compared to the end of 2002. Current gas in storage increased due to injections made during the summer of 2003 for anticipated use during the 2003 2004 heating season. The increase in current liabilities was due to an increase in accounts payable related to both amounts owed other interest owners for their share of gas and oil sales collected by us and to our increased level of capital investments in our E&P segment. 41 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Natural Gas and Oil Properties We utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our natural gas and oil properties. We review the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties under the full cost accounting rules of the SEC on a quarterly basis. Under these rules, all such costs (productive and nonproductive) are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method. These capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test, however, which limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved gas and oil reserves discounted at 10 percent plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties. If the net capitalized costs of natural gas and oil properties exceed the ceiling, we will record a ceiling test write down to the extent of such excess. A ceiling test write down is a non cash charge to earnings. If r equired, it reduces earnings and impacts shareholders equity in the period of occurrence and results in lower depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in future periods. The write down may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling. The risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties increases when natural gas and oil prices are depressed or if there are substantial downward revisions in estimated proved reserves. Application of these rules during periods of relatively low natural gas or oil prices due to seasonality or other reasons, even if temporary, increases the probability of a ceiling test write down. Based on natural gas and oil prices in effect on December 31, 2003, the unamortized cost of our natural gas and oil properties did not exceed the ceiling of proved natural gas and oil reserves. Natural gas pricing has historically been unpredictable and any significant declines could result in a ceiling test write down in subsequent quarterly or annual reporting periods. Natural gas and oil reserves used in the full cost method of accounting cannot be measured exactly. Our estimate of natural gas and oil reserves requires extensive judgments of reservoir engineering data and is generally less precise than other estimates made in connection with financial disclosures. Assigning monetary values to such estimates does not reduce the subjectivity and changing nature of such reserve estimates. The uncertainties inherent in the disclosure are compounded by applying additional estimates of the rates and timing of production and the costs that will be incurred in developing and producing the reserves. We engage the services of an independent petroleum consulting firm to review reserves as estimated by our reservoir engineers. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations" (FAS 141), and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (FAS 142), were issued in June 2001 and became effective for the Company on July 1, 2001, and January 1, 2002, respectively. The Company understands the majority of the oil and natural gas industry did not change accounting and disclosures for mineral interest use rights (leasehold acquisition costs) upon the implementation of FAS 141 and 142. However, an interpretation of FAS 141 and 142 is being considered as to whether mineral interest use rights in gas and oil properties are intangible assets. Under this interpretation mineral interest use rights for both undeveloped and developed leaseholds would be classified as intangible assets, separate from gas and oil properties. The classification as an intangible asset would not affect how these item s are accounted for under the full cost method of accounting with respect to the calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization or the calculation of the ceiling test of gas and oil properties. This interpretation would not affect our results of operations or cash flows. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had undeveloped leasehold of approximately $16.9 million and $8.7 million, respectively, that would be classified as "intangible undeveloped leasehold" if this interpretation were applied. Southwestern also had developed leasehold of approximately $9.3 million and $4.5 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, that would be classified as "intangible developed leasehold" if it applied the interpretation currently being considered. The portion of developed leasehold that would be reclassified represents the costs of developed leaseholds acquired or transferred to the full cost pool subsequent to June 30, 2001, the effective date of FAS 141. Additionally, FAS 142 requires that certain disclosures be made for all intangible assets. The Company has not made the disclosures set forth under FAS 142 related to the use rights of mineral interests. Southwestern will continue to classify the use rights of mineral interests in gas and oil properties as gas and oil properties until further guidance is provided. Hedging We use natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options and interest rate swaps to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil and in interest rates. Our policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings. The primary 42 Table of Contents market risks related to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for natural gas and crude oil. However, the market price risk is offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related sale or purchase of the natural gas or sale of the oil that is hedged. Our derivative instruments are accounted for under FAS 133 and are recorded at fair value in our financial statements. We utilize market based quotes from our hedge counterparties to value these open positions. These valuations are recognized as assets or liabilities in our balance sheet and, to the extent an open position is an effective cash flow hedge on equity production or interest rates, the offset is recorded in other comprehensive income. Results of settled commodity hedging transactions are reflected in natural gas and oil sales or in gas purchases. Results of settled interest rate hedges are reflected in interest expense. Any ineffective hedge, derivative not qualifying for accounting treatment as a hedge, or ineffective portion of a hedge is recognized immediately in earnings. Future market price volatility could create significant changes to the hedge positions recorded in our financial statements. We refer you to "Qua ntitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" in this Form 10 K for additional information regarding our hedging activities. Regulated Utility Operations Our utility operations are subject to the rate regulation and accounting requirements of the APSC. Allocations of costs and revenues to accounting periods for ratemaking and regulatory purposes may differ from those generally applied by non regulated operations. Such allocations to meet regulatory accounting requirements are considered generally accepted accounting principles for regulated utilities provided that there is a demonstrated ability to recover any deferred costs in future rates. During the ratemaking process, the regulatory commission may require a utility to defer recognition of certain costs to be recovered through rates over time as opposed to expensing such costs as incurred. This allows the utility to stabilize rates over time rather than passing such costs on to the customer for immediate recovery. This causes certain expenses to be deferred as a regulatory asset and amortized to expense as they are recovered through rates. The regulatory commission has not required any unbundling of services, although large industrials are free to contract for their own gas supply. There are no regulations relating to unbundling of services currently anticipated; however, should such regulation be proposed and adopted, certain of these assets may no longer meet the criteria for deferred recognition and, accordingly, a write off of regulatory assets and stranded costs may be required. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We record our prepaid or accrued benefit cost, as well as our periodic benefit cost, for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans using measurement assumptions that we consider reasonable at the time of calculation (see Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion and disclosures regarding these benefit plans). Two of the assumptions that affect the amounts recorded are the discount rate, which estimates the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled, and the expected return on plan assets, which reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested. For 2003, the discount rate assumed is 6.25% and the expected return assumed is 9.0%. This compares to a discount rate of 6.75% and an expected return of 9.0% used in 2002. Using the assumed rates discussed above, we recorded pension expense of $3.3 million in 2003 and $0.9 million in 2002. We reflected a pension liability of $0.9 million at December 31, 2003 and $5.6 million at December 31, 2002. During 2003, we also funded $3.0 million to our pension plan. In 2004, we expect to fund $2.4 million to our pension plans. Assuming a 1% change in the 2003 rates (lower discount rate and lower rate of return), we would have recorded pension expense of $4.3 million in 2003. Gas in Underground Storage We record our gas stored in inventory that is owned by the E&P segment at the lower of weighted average cost or market. Gas expected to be cycled within the next 12 months is recorded in current assets with the remaining stored gas reflected as a long term asset. The quantity and average cost of gas in storage was 10.4 Bcf at $3.33 at December 31, 2003 and 10.1 Bcf at $3.05 at December 31, 2002. The gas in inventory for the E&P segment is used primarily to supplement production in meeting the segments contractual commitments including delivery to customers of our gas distribution business, especially during periods of colder weather. As a result, demand fees paid by the gas distribution segment to the E&P segment, which are passed through to the utilitys customers, are a part of the realized price of the gas in storage. In determining the lower of cost or market for storage gas, we utilize the gas futures market in assessing the price we expect to be able to realize for our gas in 43 Table of Contents inventory. Declines in the future market price of natural gas could result in us writing down our carrying cost of gas in storage. See further discussion of our significant accounting policies in Note 1 to the financial statements. FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION All statements, other than historical fact or present financial information, may be deemed to be forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements that address activities, outcomes and other matters that should or may occur in the future, including, without limitation, statements regarding the financial position, business strategy, production and reserve growth and other plans and objectives for our future operations, are forward looking statements. Although we believe the expectations expressed in such forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements are not guarantees of future performance. We have no obligation and make no undertaking to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements. Forward looking statements include the items identified in the preceding paragraph, information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations and other statements in this Form 10 K identified by words such as "anticipate," "project," "intend," "estimate," "expect," "believe," "predict," "budget," "projection," "goal," "plan," "forecast," "target" or similar expressions. You should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements. They are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may affect our operations, markets, products, services and prices and cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. In addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with forward looking statements, risks, uncertainties and factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward looking statement include, but are not limited to: * the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices for natural gas and oil; * the timing and extent of our success in discovering, developing, producing and estimating reserves; * our future property acquisition or divestiture activities; * the effects of weather and regulation on our gas distribution segment; * increased competition; * the impact of federal, state and local government regulation; * the financial impact of accounting regulations; * changing market conditions and prices (including regional basis differentials); * the comparative cost of alternative fuels; * the availability of oil field personnel, services, drilling rigs and other equipment; and * any other factors listed in the reports we have filed and may file with the SEC. We caution you that these forward looking statements are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, incident to the exploration for and development, production and sale of natural gas and oil. These risks include, but are not limited to, commodity price volatility, third party interruption of sales to market, inflation, lack of availability of goods and services, environmental risks, drilling and other operating risks, regulatory changes, the uncertainty inherent in estimating proved natural gas and oil reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures and the other risks described in this Form 10 K. 44 Table of Contents Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data and the interpretation of that data by geological engineers. In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production activities may justify revisions of estimates that were made previously. If significant, these revisions would change the schedule of any further production and development drilling. Accordingly, reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities of natural gas and oil that are ultimately recovered. Should one or more of the risks or uncertainties described above or elsewhere in this Form 10 K occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements. We specifically disclaim all responsibility to publicly update any information contained in a forward looking statement or any forward looking statement in its entirety and therefore disclaim any resulting liability for potentially related damages. All forward looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISKS Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from the volatility in commodity prices, basis differentials and interest rates, as well as credit risk concentrations. We use natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options and interest rate swaps to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil and in interest rates. The Board of Directors has approved risk management policies and procedures to utilize financial products for the reduction of defined commodity price and interest rate risks. These policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings. Credit Risks Our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables and derivative contracts associated with commodities trading. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas. No single customer accounts for greater than 3% of accounts receivable at December 31, 2003. See the discussion of credit risk associated with commodities trading below. Interest Rate Risk The following table provides information on our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The table presents our debt obligations, principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Variable average interest rates reflect the rates in effect at December 31, 2003 for borrowings under our credit facility. Our policy is to manage interest rates through use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. Interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate. Fair Expected Maturity Date Value 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total 12/31/03 ($ in millions) Fixed rate $ $ 125.0 $ $ $ $ 100.0 $ 225.0 $ 236.2 Average Interest Rate 6.70% 7.46% 7.04% Variable Rate $ $ $ $ 53.8 $ $ $ 53.8 $ 53.8 Average Interest Rate 2.65% 2.65% Commodities Risk We use over the counter natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options to hedge sales of our production, to hedge activity in our marketing segment and to hedge the purchase of gas in our utility segment against the inherent price risks of adverse price fluctuations or locational pricing differences between a published index and the NYMEX futures market. These swaps and options include (1) transactions in which one party will pay a fixed price (or variable price) for a notional quantity in exchange for receiving a variable price (or fixed price) based on a published index (referred to as price swaps), (2) transactions in which parties agree to pay a price based on two different indices (referred to as basis swaps), and (3) the purchase and sale of index related puts and calls (collars) that provide a "floor" price below which the counterparty pays (production hedge) or receives (gas purchase hedge) funds equal to the amount by which the price of the commodity is below the contracted floor, and a "ceiling" price above which we pay to (production hedge) or receive from (gas purchase hedge) the counterparty the amount by which the price of the commodity is above the contracted ceiling. The primary market risks related to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for natural gas and crude oil. However, the market price risk is offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related sale or purchase of the natural gas or sale of the oil that is hedged. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss as a result of non performance by our counterparties. The counterparties are primarily major investment and commercial banks which management believes present minimal credit risks. The credit quality of each counterparty and the level of financial exposure we have to each counterparty are periodically reviewed to ensure limited credit risk exposure. The following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in commodity prices and that are used to hedge prices for gas and oil production, gas purchases and marketing volumes. The table presents the notional amount in Bcf and MBbls, the weighted average contract prices and the fair value by expected maturity dates. At December 31, 2003, the fair value of these financial instruments was an $18.9 million liability. 46 Table of Contents Expected Maturity Date 2004 2005 Production and Marketing Natural Gas Swaps with a fixed price receipt Contract volume (Bcf) 8.0 6.0 Weighted average price per Mcf $ 4.21 $ 4.67 Fair value (in millions) $ (10.3) $ (0.5) Price collars Contract volume (Bcf) 23.6 1.0 Weighted average floor price per Mcf $ 3.85 $ 4.50 Fair value of floor (in millions) $ 1.8 $ 0.3 Weighted average ceiling price per Mcf $ 6.48 $ 8.00 Fair value of ceiling (in millions) $ (11.5) $ (0.3) Swaps with a fixed price payment Contract volume (Bcf) 0.5 Weighted average price per Mcf $ 5.05 $ Fair value (in millions) $ 0.3 $ Oil Swaps with a fixed price receipt Contract volume (MBbls) 426 Weighted average price per Bbl $ 28.39 $ Fair value (in millions) $ (0.8) $ Natural Gas Purchases Swaps with a fixed price payment Contract volume (Bcf) 3.8 Weighted average price per Mcf $ 5.34 $ Fair value (in millions) $ 2.1 $ At December 31, 2003, the Company had outstanding fixed price basis differential swaps on 9.1 Bcf of 2004 gas production that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. The fair value of these differential swaps was an asset of $1.1 million at December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2002, the Company had outstanding natural gas price swaps on total notional volumes of 13.3 Bcf in 2003 and 7.2 Bcf in 2004 for which the Company received fixed prices ranging from $2.75 to $4.30 per MMBtu. Outstanding oil price swaps on 240 MBbls were in place that yielded the Company an average price of $25.40 per barrel. At December 31, 2002, the Company also had outstanding natural gas price swaps on total notional gas purchase volumes of 2.7 Bcf in 2003 for which the Company paid an average fixed price of $3.42 per Mcf. At December 31, 2002, the Company had collars in place on 15.9 Bcf in 2003 and 8.0 Bcf in 2004 of gas production. The 15.9 Bcf in 2003 had an average floor and ceiling price of $3.16 and $4.84 per MMBtu, respectively. The 8.0 Bcf in 2004 had an average floor and ceiling price of $3.50 and $4.65 per MMBtu, respectively. Subsequent to December 31, 2003 and prior to February 23, 2004, we entered into additional derivative contracts to hedge gas and oil production sales. Price collar hedges on 1.0 Bcf of 2005 gas production sales have an average floor of $4.50 per Mcf and an average ceiling of $8.35 per Mcf. Fixed price swaps on 3.0 Bcf of 2005 gas production will yield $4.93 per Mcf. 47 Table of Contents
