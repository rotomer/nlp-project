ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This Form 10 K contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements for many reasons, including the risks described in "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this annual report. You should read the following discussion with the "Selected Financial Data" and our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. OVERVIEW Southwestern Energy Company is an integrated energy company primarily focused on natural gas. Our primary business is the exploration, development and production of natural gas and crude oil, with operations principally located in Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico and Louisiana. We also operate integrated natural gas distribution systems in northern Arkansas. As a complement to our other businesses, we provide marketing services in each of our core areas of operation. We operate our business in three segments: Exploration and Production, Natural Gas Distribution and Natural Gas Marketing. Our business strategy is focused on providing long term growth in the net asset value of our business. We prepare economic analyses for each of our drilling and acquisition opportunities and rank them based upon the expected present value added for each dollar invested, which we refer to as PVI. The PVI of the future expected cash flows for each project is determined using a 10% discount rate. We target creating at least $1.30 of discounted pre tax PVI for each dollar we invest in our Exploration and Production, or E&P, business. Our actual PVI results are utilized to help determine the allocation of our future capital investments. We are also focused on creating and capturing additional value beyond the wellhead through our natural gas distribution, marketing and transportation businesses. In 2004, our gas and oil production continued to increase, reaching 54.1 Bcfe, up from 41.2 Bcfe in 2003 and 40.1 Bcfe in 2002. The 31% increase in 2004 production resulted from an increase in production from our Overton Field in East Texas due to accelerated development, increased production in the Arkoma Basin and production from our River Ridge discovery in New Mexico. Our financial and operating results depend on a number of factors, including in particular natural gas and oil prices, our ability to find and produce natural gas and oil, our ability to control costs, the seasonality of our customers needs for natural gas and our ability to market natural gas and oil on economically attractive terms to our customers, all of which are dependent upon numerous factors beyond our control such as economic, political and regulatory developments and competition from other energy sources. There has been significant price volatility in the natural gas and crude oil market in recent years. The volatility was attributable to a variety of factors impacting supply and demand, including weather conditions, political events and economic events we cannot control or predict. We reported net income of $103.6 million in 2004, or $2.80 per share on a fully diluted basis, up from $48.9 million, or $1.43 per share in 2003. In 2002, we reported net income of $14.3 million, or $0.55 per share on a fully diluted basis. The increases in net income in 2004 and 2003 were a result of increased production volumes and higher realized natural gas and oil prices in our E&P segment with higher gas prices being the primary factor in 2003. Operating income for our E&P segment was $164.6 million in 2004, up from $84.7 million in 2003 and $36.0 million in 2002. The increases in operating income for our E&P segment in 2004 and 2003 were also due to increased production volumes and higher realized prices. Operating income for our gas distribution segment was $8.5 million in 2004, compared to $6.8 million in 2003 and $7.6 million in 2002. The increase in operating income for our gas distribution segment in 2004 resulted primarily from increased rates implemented in October 2003. Our cash flow from operating activities was $237.9 million in 2004, compared to $109.1 million in 2003 and $77.6 million in 2002. In our E&P segment, we achieved a reserve replacement ratio of 365% in 2004 at a finding and development cost of $1.43 per Mcfe, including reserve revisions. Our year end reserves grew 28% to 645.5 Bcfe, up from 503.1 Bcfe at the end of 2003. Our results were primarily fueled by our continued drilling success in our Overton Field in East Texas as well as our continued successful conventional drilling program in the Arkoma Basin. Our capital investments totaled $295.0 million in 2004, up from $180.2 million in 2003 and $92.1 million in 2002. We invested $282.0 million in our E&P segment in 2004, compared to $170.9 million in 2003 and $85.2 million in 2002. Funds for our 2004 capital investments were provided by cash flow from operations and borrowings under our unsecured revolving line of credit. 33 Table of Contents Our cash flow and earnings provided by operating results in 2004 helped us to decrease our total debt to capitalization ratio to 42% at December 31, 2004, compared to 45% at December 31, 2003. Capital investments for 2005 are planned to be up to $352.7 million, including up to $339.0 million for our E&P segment, which is an increase of 20% over our E&P capital investments in 2004. The $339.0 million of exploration and production investments includes up to $100.2 million for the accelerated development of our Fayetteville Shale play that was announced during 2004, assuming that we continue to be encouraged by our drilling results. We continue to be focused on our strategy of adding value through the drillbit, as over 80% of our 2005 E&P capital is allocated to drilling. In addition to the planned investments in the Fayetteville Shale play, our E&P investments in 2005 will primarily be focused on our lower risk development drilling programs in East Texas and other conventional drilling in the Arkoma Basin. In 2005, we are targeting production to be approximately 61.0 Bcfe to 63.0 Bcfe, compared to 54.1 Bcfe in 2004, an increase of approximately 13% to 17%. We expect our capital investments in 2005 will be funded by cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. With todays commodity price environment, our current capital program and our inventory of projects for the future, we believe we are well positioned to continue to build upon the momentum achieved in recent years. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Exploration and Production Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Revenues (in thousands) $ 286,924 $ 176,245 $ 122,207 Operating income (in thousands) $ 164,585 $ 84,737 $ 36,048 Gas production (Bcf) 50.4 38.0 36.0 Oil production (MBbls) 618 531 682 Total production (Bcfe) 54.1 41.2 40.1 Average gas price per Mcf, including hedges $ 5.21 $ 4.20 $ 3.00 Average gas price per Mcf, excluding hedges $ 5.80 $ 5.15 $ 3.11 Average oil price per Bbl, including hedges $ 31.47 $ 26.72 $ 21.02 Average oil price per Bbl, excluding hedges $ 40.55 $ 29.66 $ 23.94 Average unit costs per Mcfe Lease operating expenses $ 0.38 $ 0.39 $ 0.45 General & administrative expenses $ 0.36 $ 0.41 $ 0.32 Taxes other than income taxes $ 0.28 $ 0.22 $ 0.19 Full cost pool amortization $ 1.20 $ 1.17 $ 1.16 Revenues, Operating Income and Production Revenues. Our E&P revenues increased 63% in 2004 to $286.9 million compared to $176.2 million in 2003. Increased gas production volumes and higher prices received for our natural gas and oil production contributed equally to the increased revenues. Revenues increased 44% in 2003 from $122.2 million in 2002. The increase was primarily due to higher prices received for our natural gas and oil production. Future changes in revenue can not be predicted reliably due to the market volatility of natural gas and crude oil prices. Operating Income. Operating income from our E&P segment was $164.6 million in 2004, up from $84.7 million in 2003 and $36.0 million in 2002. The increases in 2004 and 2003 were due to the increases in revenues, partially offset by increases in operating costs and expenditures. Production. Gas and oil production totaled 54.1 Bcfe in 2004, 41.2 Bcfe in 2003 and 40.1 Bcfe in 2002. The increase in 2004 production resulted primarily from an 8.2 Bcfe increase in production from our Overton Field in East Texas, a 1.3 Bcfe increase in our Arkoma Basin production, and 3.2 Bcfe from our River Ridge discovery in New Mexico. The increase in 2003 production resulted from a 7.7 Bcfe increase in production from our Overton Field, partially offset by a 3.3 Bcfe decline experienced in our South Louisiana properties and a loss of production resulting from the November 2002 sale of our non strategic Mid Continent properties that contributed approximately 2.5 Bcfe of production annually. 34 Table of Contents Although we expect production volumes in the near term to increase, we cannot guarantee our longer term success in discovering, developing, and producing reserves. Our ability to discover, develop and produce reserves is dependent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the availability of capital, the timing and extent of changes in natural gas and oil prices and competition. There are also many risks inherent to the discovery, development and production of natural gas and oil. We refer you to "Risk Factors" in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10 K for a discussion of these risks and the impact they could have on our financial condition and results of operations. Gas sales to unaffiliated purchasers were 45.0 Bcf in 2004, up from 32.1 Bcf in 2003 and 30.6 Bcf in 2002. Sales to unaffiliated purchasers are primarily made under contracts that reflect current short term prices and are subject to seasonal price swings. Intersegment sales to Arkansas Western were 5.4 Bcf in 2004, 5.9 Bcf in 2003 and 5.4 Bcf in 2002. The changes in intersegment sales volumes reflect both the effects of weather and the ability of our E&P segment to obtain gas supply contracts that are periodically placed out for bids. Weather in 2004, as measured in degree days, was 10% warmer than normal and 9% warmer than the prior year. Weather in 2003 was 1% warmer than normal and slightly above the prior year. Our gas production provided approximately 40% of the utilitys requirements in 2004, 41% in 2003 and 37% in 2002. We expect future increases in demand for our gas production to come primarily from sales to unaffiliated purchasers. Future sales to Arkansas Westerns gas distribution systems will be dependent upon our success in obtaining gas supply contracts with the utility systems. We expect to continue to bid to obtain these gas supply contracts, however there can be no assurance that we will be successful. If successful, we cannot predict the amount of fixed demand charges, if any, that would be associated with the new contracts. We also sell gas directly to industrial and commercial transportation customers located on Arkansas Westerns gas distribution systems. We are unable to predict changes in the market demand and price for natural gas, including changes that may be induced by the effects of weather on demand of both affiliated and unaffiliated customers for our production. Additionally, we hold a large amount of undeveloped leasehold acreage and pro ducing acreage, and have an inventory of drilling leads, prospects and seismic data that will continue to be evaluated and developed in the future. Our exploration programs have been directed primarily toward natural gas in recent years. Commodity Prices In order to ensure certain levels of cash flow, we periodically enter into hedging activities with respect to a portion of our projected natural gas and crude oil production through a variety of financial arrangements intended to support natural gas and oil prices at targeted levels and to minimize the impact of price fluctuations (we refer you to Item 7A of this Form 10 K and Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion). The average price realized for our gas production, including the effects of hedges, was $5.21 per Mcf in 2004, $4.20 per Mcf in 2003 and $3.00 per Mcf in 2002. The changes in the average price realized primarily reflect changes in average annual spot market prices and the effects of our price hedging activities. Our hedging activities lowered the average gas price $0.59 per Mcf in 2004, $0.95 per Mcf in 2003 and $0.11 per Mcf in 2002. Additionally, we have historically received demand charges re lated to sales made to our utility segment, which has increased our average gas price realized. Disregarding the impact of hedges, we would normally expect the average price received for our gas production to be approximately $0.30 to $0.50 per Mcf lower than average spot market prices, as market differentials that reduce the average prices received are partially offset by demand charges received under the contracts covering our intersegment sales to our utility systems. We realized an average price of $31.47 per barrel, including the effects of hedges, for our oil production for the year ended December 31, 2004, up from $26.72 per barrel for 2003 and $21.02 per barrel for 2002. Our hedging activities lowered the average oil price $9.08 per barrel in 2004, $2.94 per barrel in 2003 and $2.92 per barrel in 2002. Disregarding the impact of hedges, we expect the average price received for our oil production to be approximately $1.25 lower than posted spot market prices. At December 31, 2004, we had hedges in place on 71.6 Bcf of 2005 and 2006 gas production. At December 31, 2004 we had hedges in place on 480,000 barrels of 2005 and 2006 oil production. Subsequent to December 31, 2004 and prior to March 3, 2005, we hedged 4.0 Bcf of 2006 gas production under costless collars with floor prices of $5.50 per Mcf and ceiling prices ranging from $7.60 to $13.50 per Mcf. As of March 3, 2005, we have hedged approximately 70% to 80% of our 2005 anticipated gas production level and 60% to 70% of our 2005 anticipated oil production level. 35 Table of Contents Operating Costs and Expenses Lease operating expenses per Mcfe for the E&P segment were $0.38 in 2004, down from $0.39 in 2003 and $0.45 in 2002. Lease operating expenses per unit of production decreased in 2004 due primarily to a 31% increase in our production volumes. In 2004, lease operating expenses per unit averaged $0.18 per Mcfe for Overton Field and $0.31 per Mcfe for our conventional Arkoma Basin production. These two areas accounted for 78% of our total production in 2004. Although the per unit operating costs for these areas will continue to remain low compared to other operating areas, they will increase over time due to the natural maturing of the fields and inflationary pressures on total costs. We do not have sufficient operating history for our Fayetteville Shale play to forecast with accuracy the future operating costs that we may incur assuming the successful development of this play. Taxes other than income taxes per Mcfe were $0.28 in 2004, compared to $0.22 in 2003 and $0.19 in 2002. The increase in 2004 taxes other than income taxes per Mcfe was due to increased severance and ad valorem taxes that resulted from increases in commodity prices and from the changing mix of our production among taxing jurisdictions. General and administrative expenses per Mcfe for this segment were $0.36 in 2004, compared to $0.41 in 2003 and $0.32 in 2002. The decrease in general and administrative costs per Mcfe in 2004 from 2003 was due primarily to the 31% increase in production volumes, partially offset by an 18% increase in general and administrative expenses for this segment. Increased payroll and incentive compensation costs, partially offset by decreased pension expense and an increase in costs capitalized to the full cost pool under full cost accounting rules, accounted for the increase in general and administrative costs. We expect our cost per Mcfe for operating and general and administrative expenses to increase in 2005 primarily due to anticipated increases in oil field service costs and an increase in our staffing levels to accommodate our future expected growth. Future changes in our general and administrative expenses for this segment are primarily dependent upon our salary costs, level of pension expense and the amount of incentive compensation paid to our employees. Incentive compensation is based on operating and performance results. See "Critical Accounting Policies" below for further discussion of pension expense. Our full cost pool amortization rate averaged $1.20 per Mcfe for 2004, compared to $1.17 in 2003 and $1.16 in 2002. The amortization rate is impacted by reserve additions and the costs incurred for those additions, revisions of previous reserve estimates due to both price and well performance, and the level of unevaluated costs excluded from amortization. Although we expect our amortization rate to continue to increase in the near term as a result of increased costs in finding and developing gas and oil reserves (see discussion on inflation below), we cannot predict our future full cost pool amortization rate with accuracy due to the variability of each of the factors discussed above, as well as the uncertainty of the future success of our Fayetteville Shale play. Unevaluated costs excluded from amortization were $47.2 million at the end of 2004, compared to $39.0 million at the end of 2003 and $25.5 million at the end of 2002. The increase in une valuated costs since December 31, 2002 primarily resulted from an increase in our undeveloped leasehold acreage related to our Fayetteville Shale play. We utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our natural gas and oil properties. Under this method, all such costs (productive and nonproductive) are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method. These capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test, however, which limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved gas and oil reserves discounted at 10 percent (standardized measure) plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties. Any costs in excess of this ceiling are written off as a non cash expense. The expense may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling. Full cost companies must use the prices in effect at the end of each accounting quarter, including the impact of derivatives qualifying as hedges, to calculate the ceiling value of their reserves. At December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, our unamortized costs of natural gas and oil properties did not exceed this ceiling amount. At December 31, 2004, our standardized measure was calculated based upon quoted market prices of $6.18 per Mcf for Henry Hub gas and $43.45 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil, adjusted for market differentials. A decline in natural gas and oil prices from year end 2004 levels or other factors, without other mitigating circumstances, could cause a future write down of capitalized costs and a non cash charge against future earnings. In November 2002, we sold our remaining non strategic Mid Continent properties, including our properties in the Sho Vel Tum area in southern Oklahoma, the Anadarko Basin in western Oklahoma and the Sooner Trend in northwestern Oklahoma, for a total of $26.4 million. These properties represented approximately 32.9 Bcfe of reserves and produced approximately 2.5 Bcfe annually. This divestiture, along with increased production from the Overton Field, resulted in a 36 Table of Contents decrease in our average production costs per unit of production in 2003. Inflation impacts our E&P operations by generally increasing our operating costs and the costs of our capital additions. The effects of inflation on our operations prior to 2000 have been minimal due to low inflation rates. However, since 2001, the impact of inflation has intensified in certain areas of our exploration and production segment as shortages in drilling rigs, third party services and qualified labor developed due to an overall increase in the activity level of the domestic natural gas and oil industry. We feel this impact increased in 2004 and 2003 with increases in the industry activity level caused by higher commodity prices. We have mitigated rising costs in certain situations by obtaining vendor commitments to multiple projects and by offering performance bonuses related to increased efficiencies. Natural Gas Distribution Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 ($ in thousands except for per Mcf amounts) Revenues $ 152,449 $ 137,356 $ 115,850 Gas purchases $ 97,274 $ 84,926 $ 66,486 Operating costs and expenses $ 46,659 $ 45,664 $ 41,801 Operating income $ 8,516 $ 6,766 $ $7,563 Deliveries (Bcf) Sales and end use transportation 24.0 24.7 25.1 Off system transportation 1.0 0.3 2.2 Customers at year end 144,612 141,573 139,543 Average sales rate per Mcf $ 9.39 $ 7.93 $ 6.49 Heating weather degree days 3,678 3,969 3,950 Percent of normal 90% 99% 98% Revenues and Operating Income Gas distribution revenues fluctuate due to the effects of warm weather on demand for natural gas and the pass through of gas supply cost changes. Because of the corresponding changes in purchased gas costs, the revenue effect of the pass through of gas cost changes has not materially affected operating income. Gas distribution revenues increased 11% in 2004 and 19% in 2003. The increase in 2004 gas distribution revenues was primarily due to higher average sales rates as a result of higher gas prices and to the effects of a $4.1 million annual rate increase implemented in October 2003. The increase in 2003 gas distribution revenues was primarily due to a higher average sales rate caused by higher gas prices. Weather during 2004 in the utilitys service territory was 10% warmer than normal and 9% warmer than the prior year. Weather during 2003 was 1% warmer than normal and slightly above the prior year. Operating income for our utility systems increased 26% in 2004 and decreased 11% in 2003. The increase in 2004 operating income for this segment resulted primarily from rate increases implemented in late 2003 partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses. The decrease in 2003 operating income for this segment resulted from increased operating costs and expenses and reduced usage per customer due to customer conservation brought about by high gas prices. In October 2003, we implemented a rate increase that increased revenue and operating income by $4.1 million annually (see "Regulatory Matters" below for a discussion of the rate increase) and were also allowed to recover certain additional costs totaling $2.3 million over a two year period. Gas distribution revenues in future years will be impacted by the utilitys gas purchase costs, customer growth, usage per customer and rate increases allowed by the Arkansas Public Service Commission, or APSC. In recent years, Arkansas Western has experienced customer growth of approximately 2% annually in its Northwest Arkansas service territory, while it has experienced little or no customer growth in its service territory in Northeast Arkansas. Based on current economic conditions in our service territories, we expect this trend in customer growth to continue. While our utility segments results have improved since last year, we do not believe that it is earning its authorized rate of return. As a result, and as discussed below in "Regulatory Matters," on December 29, 2004, we filed a rate increase request for $9.7 million with the APSC. 37 Table of Contents Deliveries and Rates In 2004, Arkansas Western sold 15.5 Bcf to its customers at an average rate of $9.39 per Mcf, compared to 16.3 Bcf at $7.93 per Mcf in 2003 and 16.7 Bcf at $6.49 per Mcf in 2002. Additionally, Arkansas Western transported 8.5 Bcf in 2004 and 8.4 Bcf in 2003 and 2002 for its end use customers. The decreases in volumes sold in 2004 and 2003 primarily resulted from variations in weather and customer conservation brought about by high gas prices in recent years. Arkansas Westerns tariffs contain a weather normalization clause to lessen the impact of revenue increases and decreases which might result from weather variations during the winter heating season. The increase in the utility segments average sales rate for 2004 reflected changes in the average cost of gas purchased for delivery to our customers, which are passed through to customers under automatic adjustment clauses. Total deliveries to industrial customers of the utility segment, including transportation volumes, were 9.8 Bcf in 2004, 9.6 Bcf in 2003 and 9.9 Bcf in 2002. Changes in deliveries to industrial customers were impacted by customer conservation caused by high gas prices partially offset by continued industrial growth in the region. Arkansas Western also transported 1.0 Bcf of gas through its gathering system in 2004 compared to 0.3 Bcf in 2003 and 2.2 Bcf in 2002 for off system deliveries, all to the Ozark Gas Transmission System. The level of off system deliveries each year generally reflects the impact of weather changing the on system demands of our gas distribution systems for our gas production. The average off system transportation rate was approximately $0.13 per Mcf, exclusive of fuel, in 2004, 2003 and 2002. Future volumes delivered to customers will be impacted by customer growth, weather and the effect that gas prices will continue to have on customer conservation. Operating Costs and Expenses The changes in purchased gas costs for the gas distribution segment reflect volumes purchased, prices paid for supplies and the mix of purchases from various gas supply contracts (base load, swing and no notice). Operating costs and expenses, net of purchased gas costs, increased in 2004 to $46.7 million from $45.7 million in 2003. The increase was primarily due to a $0.6 million increase in transmission expense as a result of higher fuel costs and a $0.3 million increase in depreciation expense as a result of increases in property, plant and equipment. Operating costs and expenses, net of purchased gas costs, for 2003 increased to $45.7 million from $41.8 million in 2002 due primarily to a $2.6 million increase in general and administrative expenses and a $0.8 million increase in transmission expense. The increase in 2003 general and administrative expenses resulted from increased pension, insurance and incentive compensation costs. The incre ase in 2003 transmission expense resulted from higher fuel costs. Future changes in our general and administrative expenses for this segment are primarily dependent upon our salary costs, level of pension expense and the amount of incentive compensation paid to our employees. See "Critical Accounting Policies" below for further discussion of pension expense. In October 1998, Arkansas Western instituted a competitive bidding process for its gas supply. Additionally, Arkansas Western annually submits its gas supply plan to the general staff of the APSC. As a result of the bidding process under the plan filed for the 2004 2005 gas purchase year, SEECO successfully bid on gas supply packages representing approximately 55% of the requirements for Arkansas Western for 2005. The contracts awarded to SEECO expire through 2006. Arkansas Western enters into hedging activities from time to time with respect to its gas purchases to protect against the inherent price risks of adverse price fluctuations. Our utility segment hedged 4.5 Bcf of gas purchases in 2004 which had the effect of decreasing its total gas supply costs by $1.1 million. In 2003, our utility hedged 4.6 Bcf of its gas supply which decreased its total gas supply cost by $6.1 million. In 2002 , our utility hedged 4.7 Bcf of its gas supply which increased its total gas supply cost by $5.7 million. At December 31, 2004, Arkansas Western had 2.9 Bcf of future gas purchases hedged at an average purchase price of $6.54 per Mcf. We refer you to "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" and Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Inflation impacts our gas distribution segment by generally increasing our operating costs and the costs of our capital additions. The effects of inflation on the utilitys operations in recent years have been minimal due to low inflation rates. Additionally, delays inherent in the rate making process prevent us from obtaining immediate recovery of increased operating costs of our gas distribution segment. Regulatory Matters Arkansas Westerns rates and operations are regulated by the APSC. Arkansas Western operates through municipal franchises that are perpetual by virtue of state law, but may not be exclusive within a geographic area. Although its rates for gas delivered to its retail customers are not regulated by the FERC, its transmission and gathering pipeline 38 Table of Contents systems are subject to the FERCs regulations concerning open access transportation. As the regulatory focus of the natural gas industry has shifted from the federal level to the state level, some utilities across the nation have unbundled residential sales services from transportation services in an effort to promote greater competition. No such legislation or regulatory directives related to natural gas are presently pending in Arkansas and we have not unbundled our residential sales services. In 2003, Arkansas Act 1556 for the deregulation of the retail sale of electricity was repealed. During 2004, the APSC conducted collaborative meetings to study the feasibility of a large user access program for electric service choice. On September 30, 2004, the APSC issued a report to the legislature finding that it would not be feasible to implement a large user access program without shifting costs to other customer classes and recommending that no changes be made to the statutes which would affect access to competitive power supply by large users. We do not know what action the legislature may take in response to this report. Although Arkansas Western already provides transportation service for its large users, any developments regarding large user access programs for electricity could set regulatory precedents that would also affect natural gas utilities in the future. These effects may include protection of other customer classes against cost shifting and the regulatory treatment of stranded costs. In 2004, our analysis indicated that current revenues in our utility segment were not sufficient to cover the cost of providing utility service and earn the rate of return authorized by the APSC. Arkansas Westerns northwest Arkansas service area includes one of the fastest growing areas of the United States. However, declining consumption per residential customer has offset much of the revenue benefit of strong customer growth. Arkansas Western believes this declining consumption is a trend attributable to rising natural gas prices resulting in energy conservation in existing homes such as reducing thermostat settings, caulking, adding insulation and the replacement of older natural gas equipment with high efficiency equipment. As a result of the decline in consumption coupled with increases in operating cost and capital investments, on December 29, 2004, the gas distribution subsidiary filed a request with the APSC for an adjustment in its ra tes totaling $9.7 million, or 5.2%, annually. The APSC has ten months to review the filing and determine the amount of the increase to be approved, if any. Any rate increase allowed would likely be implemented in the fourth quarter of 2005. In September 2003, in response to our request for an $11.0 million rate increase, Arkansas Western received regulatory approval from the APSC of a rate increase totaling $4.1 million annually, exclusive of costs to be recovered through Arkansas Westerns purchase gas adjustment clause. The order also entitled Arkansas Western to recover certain additional costs totaling $2.3 million through its purchase gas adjustment clause over a two year period. The rate increase was effective for all customer bills rendered on or after October 1, 2003. In the rate increase request relating to the 2003 increase, we assumed an allowed return on equity of 12.9% and a capital structure of 48% debt and 52% equity. The final order provided for an allowed return on equity of 9.9% and an assumed capital structure of 52% debt and 48% equity. In our 2004 filing, we assumed a rate of return of 11.5% and a capital structure of 50% debt and 50% equity. Rate increase requests, which may be filed in the future, will depend on customer growth, increases in operating expenses, and additional investment in property, plant and equipment. In February 2001, the APSC approved a 90 day temporary tariff to collect additional gas costs not yet billed to customers through the utilitys normal purchased gas adjustment clause in its approved tariffs. We had significant under recovered purchased gas costs as a result of the high prices paid for gas supply in the 2000 2001 heating season. The temporary tariff allowed the utility accelerated recovery of these gas costs. In April 2002, Arkansas Western filed a revised purchased gas adjustment clause that provides better matching between the time the gas costs are incurred and the time the costs are recovered. The APSC approved the new clause in May 2002 and it is still in effect. In April 2002, the APSC adopted Natural Gas Procurement Plan Rules for utilities. These rules require utilities to take all reasonable and prudent steps necessary to develop a diversified gas supply portfolio. The portfolio should consist of an appropriate combination of different types of gas purchase contracts and or financial hedging instruments that are designed to yield an optimum balance of reliability, reduced volatility and reasonable price. Utilities are also required to submit on an annual basis their gas supply plan, along with their contracting and or hedging objectives, to the staff of the APSC for review and determination as to whether it is consistent with these policy principles. In May 2004, Arkansas Western submitted its annual gas supply plan for the 2004 2005 heating season to the staff of the APSC. Arkansas Western also purchases gas from unaffiliated producers under take or pay contracts. We believe that we do not have significant exposure to liabilities resulting from these contracts and expect to be able to continue to satisfactorily manage our exposure to take or pay liabilities. 39 Table of Contents Marketing Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Revenues (in millions) $ 315.0 $ 202.0 $ 131.1 Operating income (in millions) $ 3.2 $ 2.6 $ 2.7 Gas volumes marketed (Bcf) 57.0 42.7 45.5 Our operating income from natural gas marketing was $3.2 million on revenues of $315.0 million in 2004, compared to $2.6 million on revenues of $202.0 million in 2003 and $2.7 million on revenues of $131.1 million in 2002. The increase in revenues in 2004 resulted from increased volumes marketed and higher prices received for gas sold. The increase in revenues from higher prices was largely offset by a corresponding increase in gas purchase expense. We marketed 57.0 Bcf in 2004, compared to 42.7 Bcf in 2003 and 45.5 Bcf in 2002. The increase in volumes marketed in 2004 resulted from marketing our increased production volumes, largely related to our Overton Field in East Texas. The decline in total volumes marketed between 2003 and 2002 resulted primarily from a shift in our focus to marketing our own production in order to reduce our credit risk. Of the total volumes marketed, production from our exploration and production subsidiaries accounted f or 77% in 2004, 75% in 2003 and 67% in 2002. We enter into hedging activities from time to time with respect to our gas marketing activities to provide margin protection. We refer you to "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" and Note 8 to the financial statements for additional discussion. Transportation Our marketing group also manages our 25% interest in the Ozark Gas Transmission System. Additionally, our gas distribution subsidiary has a transportation contract with Ozark Gas Transmission System for 66.9 MMcf per day of firm capacity that expires in 2014. We recorded a pre tax loss from operations related to our investment of $0.4 million in 2004, compared to pre tax income of $1.1 million in 2003 and a pre tax loss of $0.3 million in 2002. These amounts are recorded in other income (expense) in our income statement. The pre tax loss in 2004 was primarily due to a $0.4 million negative adjustment from the operator of the pipeline for prior period allocations of income and expenses to the partners. The pre tax gain in 2003 included a gain of $1.3 million recognized on the sale of a 28 mile portion of Ozark Gas Transmission Systems pipeline located in Oklahoma that had limited strategic value to the overall system. We refer you to Note 7 to the financial statements for additional discussion. We have severally guaranteed the partnerships outstanding debt which was $67.0 million at December 31, 2004. Our share of the guarantee equaled $40.2 million. This debt financed a portion of the original construction costs. We advanced $2.1 million to NOARK in 2004 as an adjustment to prior period cash disbursements. No advances to NOARK were required in 2003 and 2002. We refer you to "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Off Balance Sheet Arrangements" and Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our guarantee of NOARK debt. Other Revenues In 2004 and 2003, other revenues included gains of $5.8 million and $3.0 million, respectively, related to sales of undeveloped real estate and certain property and equipment. Other revenues for 2004 and 2003 also included pre tax gains of $4.5 million and $3.1 million, respectively, related to the sale of gas in storage inventory. Interest Expense Interest costs, net of capitalization, were down 2% in 2004 and down 19% in 2003, both as compared to prior years. In 2004, higher interest costs that resulted from increased average borrowings were offset by an increase in capitalized interest in the E&P segment. The decrease in 2003 interest costs compared to 2002 was due to both comparatively lower average borrowings and lower average interest rates. In 2003, our average borrowings decreased as net proceeds of $103.1 million from the sale of our common stock in the first quarter of 2003 were initially used to pay down our revolving credit facility. Interest capitalized increased 56% in 2004 and increased 21% in 2003. Changes in capitalized interest are primarily due to the level of costs excluded from amortization in our E&P segment. These costs increased in 2004 and 2003 due primarily to initial leasehold investments in our Fayetteville Shale play and increased drilling activity. 40 Table of Contents Income Taxes Our provision for deferred income taxes was an effective rate of 36.6% in 2004, 36.7% in 2003 and 37.8% in 2002. The changes in the provision for deferred income taxes recorded each year result primarily from the level of taxable income, adjusted for permanent differences. Pension Expense We recorded pension expense of $2.2 million in 2004, $3.3 million in 2003 and $0.9 million in 2002. The amount of pension expense recorded by us is determined by actuarial calculations and is also impacted by the funded status of our plans. During 2004, we funded our pension plan with contributions of $1.9 million. At December 31, 2004, our pension plans were underfunded and a liability of $1.5 million was recorded on the balance sheet. As a result of the underfunded status and actuarial data to be completed in early 2005, we expect to record pension expense of $2.0 million to $2.5 million in 2005. For further discussion of our pension plans, we refer you to Note 4 to the financial statements and "Critical Accounting Policies" below. Adoption of Accounting Principles In September 2004, the staff of the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 106 (SAB 106) to express the staffs views regarding application of FAS 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," by oil and gas producing companies following the full cost accounting method. SAB 106 addressed the computation of the full cost ceiling test to avoid double counting asset retirement costs, the disclosures a full cost accounting company is expected to make regarding the impacts of FAS 143, and the amortization of estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs that are expected to result from future development activities. The accounting and disclosures described in SAB 106 have been adopted by the Company as of the third quarter of 2004 and did not have a material impact on the financial position of the Company, or on its results of operations. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" (FAS 143), was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2003. FAS 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. FAS 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made, and that the associated asset retirement costs be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset. The effect of this standard on our results of operations and financial condition at adoption was an increase in current and long term liabilities of $1.2 million and $5.5 million, respectively; a net increase in property, plant and equipment of $5.3 million; a cumulative effect of adoption expense of $0.9 million and a d eferred tax asset of $0.5 million. As of December 31, 2004, we had $0.5 million of current liabilities and $8.1 million of long term liabilities associated with our asset retirement obligations. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of newly issued accounting pronouncements. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We depend on internally generated funds and our unsecured revolving credit facility (discussed below under "Financing Requirements") as our primary sources of liquidity. We may borrow up to $500 million under our new revolving credit facility from time to time. As of March 3, 2005, we had approximately $80 million of indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility. During 2005 we expect to draw on a portion of the funds available under our credit facility to fund our planned capital expenditures (discussed below under "Capital Expenditures"), which are expected to exceed the net cash generated by our operations. Net cash provided by operating activities was $237.9 million in 2004, compared to $109.1 million in 2003 and $77.6 million in 2002. The primary components of cash generated from operations are net income, depreciation, depletion and amortization, the provision for deferred income taxes and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash from operating activities increased in 2004 and 2003 due primarily to increased net income and the related increases in deferred income taxes generated by our E&P segment. Net cash from operating activities provided 81% of our cash requirements for capital expenditures in 2004, 65% in 2003 and over 84% in 2002. We believe that our operating cash flow and our credit facility will be adequate to meet our capital, debt repayment and operating requirements for 2005. We fund our day to day operating expenses and capital expenditures from operating cash flows, supplemented as needed by borrowings under our credit facility. We may choose to refinance certain portions of these borrowings by issuing long term debt in the public or private debt markets. We may utilize our existing 41 Table of Contents shelf registration statement or we may file a new shelf registration statement with the SEC in order to facilitate such financings. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures totaled $295.0 million in 2004, $180.2 million in 2003 and $92.1 million in 2002. Capital expenditures for our E&P segment included $3.9 million in 2004, $12.0 million in 2003 and a negative $0.3 million in 2002 related to the change in the amount of accrued expenditures. Additionally, our E&P segment expenditures included acquisitions of interests in natural gas and oil producing properties totaling $14.2 million in 2004, $3.0 million in 2003 and $3.5 million in 2002. 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands) Exploration and production $ 281,988 $ 170,886 $ 85,201 Gas distribution 7,298 8,178 6,115 Other 5,704 1,139 746 $ 294,990 $ 180,203 $ 92,062 Our capital investments for 2005 are planned to be up to $352.7 million, consisting of up to $339.0 million for exploration and production, $10.4 million for gas distribution system improvements and $3.3 million for general purposes. Based on the results achieved to date and assuming that the oil and gas price environment continues to be favorable, we expect to allocate up to $100.2 million of our 2005 E&P capital to our Fayetteville Shale play. We expect that our planned level of capital investments in 2005 will allow us to continue the development of our Overton Field properties in East Texas, continue our conventional drilling in the Arkoma Basin, maintain our present markets, explore and develop other existing gas and oil properties, generate new drilling prospects, and provide for improvements necessary due to normal customer growth in our gas distribution segment. As discussed above, our 2005 capital investment program is expected to be funded through cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility. We may adjust the level of 2005 capital investments dependent upon our level of cash flow generated from operations and our ability to borrow under our credit facility. Financing Requirements Our total debt outstanding was $325.0 million at December 31, 2004 and $278.8 million at December 31, 2003. The balance at December 31, 2004 includes $125.0 million of notes which are due December 2005. Our intent is to repay the notes using borrowings under our revolving credit facility, however we may seek to re finance these notes by issuing long term debt in the public or private markets. In January 2005, we amended and restated our previous $300 million revolving credit facility due to expire in January 2007, increasing the borrowing capacity to $500 million and extending the expiration to January 2010. The amended and restated revolving credit facility replaced the $300 million credit facility and another smaller credit facility. At December 31, 2004, we had $100.0 million of outstanding debt under our prior revolving credit facility. The interest rate on the new facility is calculated based upon our public debt rating and is currently 1 25 basis points over LIBOR. Our publicly traded notes were downgraded in January 2005 by Standard and Poors to BBB from BBB, and continue to be rated Ba2 by Moodys. Any future downgrades in our public debt ratings could increase the cost of funds under our revolving credit facility. Our revolving credit facility contains covenants which impose certain restrictions on us. Under the credit agreements, we may not issue total debt in excess of 60% of our total capital, must maintain a certain level of shareholders equity, and must maintain a ratio of EBITDA to interest expense of 3.5 or above. Additionally, there are certain limitations on the amount of indebtedness that may be incurred by our subsidiaries. We were in compliance with the covenants of our credit agreements at December 31, 2004. Although we do not anticipate debt covenant violations, our ability to comply with our credit agreement is dependent upon the success of our exploration and development program and upon factors beyond our control, such as the market prices for natural gas and oil. If we are unable to borrow under our credit facility, we would have to decrease our capital expenditure plans. In 1997, we publicly issued $60.0 million of 7.625% Medium Term Notes due 2027 and $40.0 million of 7.21% Medium Term Notes due 2017. In 1995, we publicly issued $125.0 million of 6.7% Notes due in December 2005. In December 2002, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC for the purpose of qualifying the potential sale from time to time of up to an aggregate $300 million of equity, debt and other securities. During the first quarter of 2003, we completed the sale of 9,487,500 shares of our common stock under the shelf registration statement. Aggregate net proceeds from the equity offering of $103.1 million were used to repay borrowings under our credit facility. 42 Table of Contents In June 1998, the NOARK partnership issued $80.0 million of 7.15% Notes due 2018. The notes require semi annual principal payments of $1.0 million that began in December 1998. We account for our investment in NOARK under the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the results of NOARK. We and Enogex, the other general partner of NOARK, have severally guaranteed the principal and interest payments on the NOARK debt. Our share of the several guarantee is 60% and amounted to $40.2 million at December 31, 2004. We advanced $2.1 million to NOARK in 2004 as an adjustment to prior period cash disbursements and were not required to advance any funds in 2003 or 2002. If NOARK is unable to generate sufficient cash in the future on a sustainable basis to service its debt and we are continually required to contribute cash to fund our share of the debt service guarantee, we could be required to record our share of the NOARK debt commitment under cur rent accounting rules. At the end of 2004, our capital structure consisted of 42% debt (excluding our several guarantee of NOARKs obligations) and 58% equity, with a ratio of EBITDA to interest expense of 15.1. EBITDA is a measure required by our debt covenants and is defined as net income plus interest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Shareholders equity in the December 31, 2004 balance sheet includes an accumulated other comprehensive loss of $18.8 million related to our hedging activities that is required to be recorded under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (FAS 133). This amount is based on current market values of our hedges at December 31, 2004, and does not necessarily reflect the value that we will receive or pay when the hedges ultimately are settled, nor does it take into account revenues to be received associated wi th the physical delivery of sales volumes hedged. Our debt covenants as to capitalization percentages exclude the effects of non cash entries that result from FAS 133 as well as the non cash impact of any full cost ceiling write downs, and include the guarantee of NOARKs obligations. Our capital structure, including our several guarantee of NOARKs obligations of $40.2 million, would be 44% debt and 56% equity at December 31, 2004, without consideration of the accumulated other comprehensive loss related to FAS 133 of $18.8 million. As part of our strategy to insure a certain level of cash flow to fund our operations, we have hedged approximately 70% to 80% of our expected 2005 gas production and 60% to 70% of our expected 2005 oil production. The amount of long term debt we incur will be dependent upon commodity prices and our capital expenditure plans. If commodity prices remain at or near current levels throughout 2005 and our capital expenditure plans do not change from current expectations, we will increase our long term debt in 2005. If commodity prices significantly decrease, we may decrease and or reallocate our planned capital expenditures significantly. We refer you to "Business Overview Other Items Reconciliation of Non GAAP Measures" in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10 K for a table that reconciles EBITDA with our net income as derived from our audited financial information. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As discussed above in "Results of Operations Transportation," we hold a 25% general partnership interest in NOARK, which owns the Ozark Gas Transmission System that is utilized to transport our gas production and the gas production of others. We account for our investment under the equity method of accounting. We and the other general partner of NOARK have severally guaranteed the principal and interest payments on NOARKs 7.15% Notes due 2018, issued to finance a portion of the original construction costs. Our share of the guarantee is 60% and we are allocated 60% of the interest expense. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the outstanding principal amount of these notes was $67.0 million and $69.0 million, respectively. Our share of the guarantee was $40.2 million and $41.4 million, respectively. The notes were issued in June 1998 and require semi annual principal payments of $1.0 million. Under the several guarantee, we are required to fund our share of NOARKs debt service which is not funded by operations of the pipeline. We advanced $2.1 million to NOARK in 2004 as an adjustment to prior period cash disbursements and were not required to advance any funds in 2003 or 2002. We do not derive any liquidity, capital resources, market risk support or credit risk support from our investment in NOARK. Our share of the results of operations included in other income (expense) related to our NOARK investment was a pre tax loss of $0.4 million in 2004, pre tax income of $1.1 million in 2003 and a pre tax loss of $0.3 million in 2002. The pre tax loss in 2004 was primarily due to a $0.4 million negative adjustment from the operator of the pipeline for prior period allocations of income and expenses to the partners. In 2003, our share of pre tax income included a gain of $1.3 million related to the sale of a 28 mile portion of the pipeline located in Oklahoma. We believe that we will be able to continue to improve the operating results of the NOARK project and expect our investment in NOARK to be realized over the life of the system (see Note 7 of the financial statements for additional discussion). 43 Table of Contents NOARKs assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 are as follows: 2004 2003 (in thousands) Current assets $ 11,375 $ 20,642 Noncurrent assets 158,149 161,994 $ 169,524 $ 182,636 Current liabilities $ 9,610 $ 7,537 Long term debt 65,000 67,000 Partners capital 94,914 108,099 $ 169,524 $ 182,636 NOARKs results of operations for 2004, 2003 and 2002 are summarized below: 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands) Operating revenues $ 77,347 $ 72,038 $ 75,959 Pre tax income $ 8,756 $ 9,030 $ 3,011 Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments We have various contractual obligations in the normal course of our operations and financing activities. Significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2004 were as follows: Contractual Obligations: Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years More than 5 Years (in thousands) Long term debt $ 325,000 $ 125,000 $ $ 60,000 $ 140,000 Operating leases(1) 10,204 1,691 3,056 2,980 2,477 Unconditional purchase obligations(2) Demand charges(3) 103,163 11,613 19,468 20,025 52,057 Other obligations(4) 6,305 6,179 101 25 $ 444,672 $ 144,483 $ 22,625 $ 83,030 $ 194,534 (1)We lease certain office space and equipment under non cancelable operating leases expiring through 2013. (2)Our utility segment has volumetric commitments for the purchase of gas under non cancelable competitive bid packages and non cancelable wellhead contracts. Volumetric purchase commitments at December 31, 2004 totaled 1.7 Bcf, comprised of 1.4 Bcf in less than one year, 0.2 Bcf in one to three years and 0.1 Bcf in three to five years. Our volumetric purchase commitments are priced primarily at regional gas indices set at the first of each future month. These costs are recoverable from the utilitys end use customers. (3)Our utility segment has commitments for approximately $97.5 million of demand charges on non cancelable firm gas purchase and firm transportation agreements. These costs are recoverable from the utilitys end use customers. Our E&P segment has a commitment for approximately $5.7 million of demand transportation charges. (4)Our other significant contractual obligations include approximately $2.4 million for funding of benefit plans, approximately $0.4 million of land leases, approximately $2.1 million for drilling rig commitments and approximately $1.0 million of various information technology support and data subscription agreements. We refer you to "Financing Requirements" above for a discussion of the terms of our long term debt. Contingent Liabilities and Commitments We have the following commitments and contingencies that could create, increase or accelerate our liabilities. Substantially all of our employees are covered by defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans. Our return on the assets of these plans in 2002 was negative which, when combined with other factors, resulted in an increase in pension expense and our required funding of the plans for 2004 and 2003. At December 31, 2004, we recorded an accrued pension benefit liability of $1.5 million. As a result of the underfunded status and actuarial data to be completed in early 2005, we expect to record pension expense of $2.0 million to $2.5 million in 2005. See Note 4 to the financial statements and "Critical Accounting Policies" below for additional information. 44 Table of Contents As discussed above in "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements," we have guaranteed 60% of the principal and interest payments on NOARKs 7.15% Notes due 2018. At December 31, 2004, the outstanding principal of these notes was $67.0 million. The notes require semi annual principal payments of $1.0 million. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information. Working Capital We maintain access to funds that may be needed to meet capital requirements through our credit facility described above. We had negative working capital of $2.7 million at the end of 2004 and positive working capital of $5.2 million at the end of 2003. Current assets increased by 31% in 2004 and current liabilities increased 41%. The change in working capital from 2003 to 2004 primarily relates to the increase in our current hedging liability at December 31, 2004. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Natural Gas and Oil Properties We utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our natural gas and oil properties. Under the full cost accounting rules of the SEC, all such costs (productive and nonproductive) are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method. Unevaluated costs are reviewed twice a year for individual impairment. Capitalized costs within the full cost pool are subjected quarterly to a ceiling test, which limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved gas and oil reserves discounted at 10 percent plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties. If the net capitalized costs of natural gas and oil properties exceed the ceiling, we will record a ceiling test write down to the extent of such excess. A ceiling test write down is a non cash charge to earnings. If required, it reduces earnin gs and impacts shareholders equity in the period of occurrence and results in lower depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in future periods. The write down may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling. The risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties increases when natural gas and oil prices are depressed or if there are substantial downward revisions in estimated proved reserves. Under the SECs full cost accounting rules, our reserves are required to be priced using prices in effect at the end of the reporting period. Application of these rules during periods of relatively low natural gas or oil prices due to seasonality or other reasons, even if temporary, increases the probability of a ceiling test write down. Based on natural gas and oil prices in effect on December 31, 2004, the unamortized cost of our natural gas and oil properties did not exceed the ceiling of proved natural gas and oil reserves. Natural gas pricing has historically been unpredictable and any significant declines could result in a ceiling test write down in subsequent quarterly or annual reporting periods. Natural gas and oil reserves used in the full cost method of accounting cannot be measured exactly. Our estimate of natural gas and oil reserves requires extensive judgments of reservoir engineering data and is generally less precise than other estimates made in connection with financial disclosures. Our reservoir engineers prepare our reserve estimates under the supervision of our management. Reserve estimates are prepared for each of our properties annually by the reservoir engineers assigned to the asset management team in the geographic locations in which the property is located. These estimates are reviewed by senior engineers who are not part of the asset management teams and the executive vice president of our E&P subsidiaries. Finally, the estimates of our proved reserves together with the audit report of Netherland Sewell & Associates, Inc. (discussed below) are reviewed by our Audit Committee. In each of the past three years, revisions to our proved reserve estimates represented no greater than 3% of our total proved reserve estimates, which we believe is indicative of the effectiveness of our internal controls. Proved developed reserves generally have a higher degree of accuracy in this estimation process, when compared to proved undeveloped and proved non producing reserves, as production history and pressure data over time is available for the majority of our proved developed properties. Proved developed reserves account for 83% of our total reserve base. Assigning monetary values to such estimates does not reduce the subjectivity and changing nature of such reserve estimates. The uncertainties inherent in the reserve estimates are compounded by applying additional estimates of the rates and timing of production and the costs that will be incurred in developing and producing the reserves. We cannot assure you that our internal controls sufficiently address the numerous uncertainties and risks that are inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas and oil reserves and projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures as many factors are beyond our control. We refer you to "The natural gas and oil reserves data we report are only estimates and may prove to be inaccurate." under the heading "Risk Factors" in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10 K for a more detailed discussion of these uncertainties, risks and other factors. 45 Table of Contents We engage the services of Netherland Sewell & Associates, Inc., an independent petroleum engineering firm, to audit our reserves as estimated by our reservoir engineers. Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. reports the results of the reserves audit to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. In conducting its audit, the engineers and geologists of Netherland, Sewell & Associates study the Companys major properties in detail and independently develop reserve estimates. Minor properties (typically representing less then 20% of the total) are also audited, but less rigorously. For the year ended December 31, 2004, Netherland, Sewell & Associates issued its audit opinion as to the reasonableness of our reserve estimates, stating that our estimated proved oil and gas reserves are, in the aggregate, reasonable and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles. A decline in gas and oil prices used to calculate the discounted future net revenues of our reserves affects both the present value of cash flows and the quantity of reserves reported. Our reserve base is 92% natural gas, therefore changes in oil prices used do not have as significant an impact as gas prices on cash flows and reported reserve quantities. Reported discounted cash flows and reserve quantities at December 31, 2004 were $892 million and 645.5 Bcfe. An assumed decrease of $1.00 per Mcf in the December 31, 2004 gas price used to price our reserves would have resulted in an approximate $150 million to $175 million decline in our future cash flows discounted at 10% and an approximate decrease of 10 Bcfe of our reported reserves. Under this assumption, our unamortized costs remained below the ceiling of proved natural gas and oil reserves. The decline in reserve quantities, assuming this decrease in gas price, would have the impact of incr easing our unit of production amortization of the full cost pool. The unit of production rate for amortization is adjusted quarterly based on changes in reserve estimates. Hedging We use natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options and interest rate swaps to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil and in interest rates. Our policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings to minimize the risk of uncollectability. In recent years, we have hedged 70% to 80% of our annual production. The primary market risks related to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for natural gas and crude oil. However, the market price risk is offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related sale or purchase of the natural gas or sale of the oil that is hedged. Our derivative instruments are accounted for under FAS 133 and are recorded at fair value in our financial statements. We have established the fair value of derivative instruments using estimates determined by our counterparties, with such estimates evaluated internally using established index prices and other sources. These valuations are recognized as assets or liabilities in our balance sheet and, to the extent an open position is an effective cash flow hedge on equity production or interest rates, the offset is recorded in other comprehensive income. Results of settled commodity hedging transactions are reflected in natural gas and oil sales or in gas purchases. Results of settled interest rate hedges are reflected in interest expense. Any ineffective hedge, derivative not qualifying for accounting treatment as a hedge, or ineffective portion of a hedge is recognized immediately in earnings. We recorded a loss in revenues of $2.6 million in 20 04, a gain of $0.6 million in 2003 and a loss of $1.1 million in 2002 related to the changes in ineffectiveness of our commodity hedges. Future market price volatility could create significant changes to the hedge positions recorded in our financial statements. We refer you to "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" in this Form 10 K for additional information regarding our hedging activities. Regulated Utility Operations Our utility operations are subject to the rate regulation and accounting requirements of the APSC. Allocations of costs and revenues to accounting periods for ratemaking and regulatory purposes may differ from those generally applied by non regulated operations. Such allocations to meet regulatory accounting requirements are considered generally accepted accounting principles for regulated utilities provided that there is a demonstrated ability to recover any deferred costs in future rates. During the ratemaking process, the regulatory commission may require a utility to defer recognition of certain costs to be recovered through rates over time as opposed to expensing such costs as incurred. This allows the utility to stabilize rates over time rather than passing such costs on to the customer for immediate recovery. This causes certain expenses to be deferred as a regulatory asset and amortized to expense as they are recovered through rates. The APSC has not required any unbundling of services, although large industrials are free to contract for their own gas supply. There are no pending regulations relating to unbundling of services; however, should such regulation be proposed and adopted, certain of these assets may no longer meet the criteria for deferred recognition and, accordingly, a write off of regulatory assets and stranded costs may be required. 46 Table of Contents Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We record our prepaid or accrued benefit cost, as well as our periodic benefit cost, for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans using measurement assumptions that we consider reasonable at the time of calculation (see Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion and disclosures regarding these benefit plans). Two of the assumptions that affect the amounts recorded are the discount rate, which estimates the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled, and the expected return on plan assets, which reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested. For the December 31, 2004 benefit obligation and the periodic benefit cost to be recorded in 2005, the discount rate assumed is 6.0% and the expected return assumed is 9.0%. This compares to a discount rate of 6.25% and an expected return of 9.0% used in the prior year. Using the assumed rates discussed above, we recorded pension expense of $2.2 million in 2004 and $3.3 million in 2003. We reflected a pension liability of $1.5 million at December 31, 2004 and $0.9 million at December 31, 2003. During 2004, we also funded $1.9 million to our pension plans. In 2005, we expect to fund $2.0 million to our pension plans. Assuming a 1% change in the 2004 rates (lower discount rate and lower rate of return), we would have recorded pension expense of $3.3 million in 2004. Gas in Underground Storage We record our gas stored in inventory that is owned by the E&P segment at the lower of weighted average cost or market. Gas expected to be cycled within the next 12 months is recorded in current assets with the remaining stored gas reflected as a long term asset. The quantity and average cost of gas in storage was 9.3 Bcf at $3.49 per Mcf at December 31, 2004, compared to 10.4 Bcf at $3.33 per Mcf at December 31, 2003. The gas in inventory for the E&P segment is used primarily to supplement production in meeting the segments contractual commitments including delivery to customers of our gas distribution business, especially during periods of colder weather. As a result, demand fees paid by the gas distribution segment to the E&P segment, which are passed through to the utilitys customers, are a part of the realized price of the gas in storage. In determining the lower of cost or market for storage gas, we utilize the gas futures market in assessing the price we expect to be able to realize for our gas in inventory. A significant decline in the future market price of natural gas could result in us writing down our carrying cost of gas in storage. See further discussion of our significant accounting policies in Note 1 to the financial statements. FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION All statements, other than historical fact or present financial information, may be deemed to be forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements that address activities, outcomes and other matters that should or may occur in the future, including, without limitation, statements regarding the financial position, business strategy, production and reserve growth and other plans and objectives for our future operations, are forward looking statements. Although we believe the expectations expressed in such forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements are not guarantees of future performance. We have no obligation and make no undertaking to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements. Forward looking statements include the items identified in the preceding paragraph, information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations and other statements in this Form 10 K identified by words such as "anticipate," "project," "intend," "estimate," "expect," "believe," "predict," "budget," "projection," "goal," "plan," "forecast," "target" or similar expressions. You should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements. They are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may affect our operations, markets, products, services and prices and cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. In addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with forward looking statements, risks, uncertainties and factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward looking statement include, but are not limited to: the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices for natural gas and oil; 47 Table of Contents the timing and extent of our success in discovering, developing, producing and estimating reserves; the extent to which the Fayetteville Shale play can replicate the results of other productive shale gas plays; the potential for significant variability in reservoir characteristics of the Fayetteville Shale over such a large acreage position; our ability to fund our planned capital expenditures; our future property acquisition or divestiture activities; the effects of weather and regulation on our gas distribution segment; increased competition; the impact of federal, state and local government regulation; the financial impact of accounting regulations and critical accounting policies; changing market conditions and prices (including regional basis differentials); the comparative cost of alternative fuels; conditions in capital markets and changes in interest rates; the availability of oil field personnel, services, drilling rigs and other equipment; and any other factors listed in the reports we have filed and may file with the SEC. We caution you that these forward looking statements are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, incident to the exploration for and development, production and sale of natural gas and oil. These risks include, but are not limited to, commodity price volatility, third party interruption of sales to market, inflation, lack of availability of goods and services, environmental risks, drilling and other operating risks, regulatory changes, the uncertainty inherent in estimating proved natural gas and oil reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures and the other risks described in this Form 10 K. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data and the interpretation of that data by geological engineers. In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production activities may justify revisions of estimates that were made previously. If significant, these revisions would change the schedule of any further production and development drilling. Accordingly, reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities of natural gas and oil that are ultimately recovered. Should one or more of the risks or uncertainties described above or elsewhere in this Form 10 K occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements. We specifically disclaim all responsibility to publicly update any information contained in a forward looking statement or any forward looking statement in its entirety and therefore disclaim any resulting liability for potentially related damages. All forward looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from the volatility in commodity prices, basis differentials and interest rates, as well as credit risk concentrations. We use natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options and interest rate swaps to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil and in interest rates. Our Board of Directors has approved risk management policies and procedures to utilize financial products for the reduction of defined commodity price and interest rate risks. These policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings. Credit Risks Our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables and derivative contracts associated with commodities trading. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas. No single customer accounts for greater than 3% of accounts receivable at December 31, 2004. In addition, please see the discussion of credit risk associated with commodities trading below. Interest Rate Risk The following table provides information on our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The table presents our debt obligations, principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Variable average interest rates reflect the rates in effect at December 31, 2004 for borrowings under our credit facility. Our policy is to manage interest rates through use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. Interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate. Expected Maturity Date Fair Value 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total 12/31/04 ($ in millions) Fixed Rate $ 125.0 $ $ $ $ 60.0 $ 40.0 $ 225.0 $ 235.4 Average Interest Rate 6.70% 7.63% 7.21% 7.04% Variable Rate $ $ $ $ $ $ 100.0 $ 100.0 $ 100.0 Average Interest Rate 3.66% 3.66% Commodities Risk We use over the counter natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options to hedge sales of our production, to hedge activity in our marketing segment and to hedge the purchase of gas in our utility segment against the inherent price risks of adverse price fluctuations or locational pricing differences between a published index and the NYMEX futures market. These swaps and options include (1) transactions in which one party will pay a fixed price (or variable price) for a notional quantity in exchange for receiving a variable price (or fixed price) based on a published index (referred to as price swaps), (2) transactions in which parties agree to pay a price based on two different indices (referred to as basis swaps), and (3) the purchase and sale of index related puts and calls (collars) that provide a "floor" price below which the counterparty pays (production hedge) or receives (gas purchase hedge) funds equal to the amount by which the pri ce of the commodity is below the contracted floor, and a "ceiling" price above which we pay to (production hedge) or receive from (gas purchase hedge) the counterparty the amount by which the price of the commodity is above the contracted ceiling. The primary market risks relating to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for natural gas and crude oil. However, the market price risk is offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related sale or purchase of the natural gas or sale of the oil that is hedged. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss as a result of non performance by our counterparties. The counterparties are primarily major investment and commercial banks which management believes present minimal credit risks. The credit quality of each counterparty and the level of financial exposure we have to each counterparty are periodically reviewed to ensure limited credit risk exposure. The following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in commodity prices and that are used to hedge prices for gas and oil production, gas purchases and marketing volumes. The table presents the notional amount in Bcf and MBbls, the weighted average contract prices and the fair value by expected maturity dates. At December 31, 2004, the fair value of these financial instruments was a $34.5 million liability. 49 Table of Contents Expected Maturity Date 2005 2006 Production and Marketing Natural Gas Swaps with a fixed price receipt Contract volume (Bcf) 12.9 5.0 Weighted average price per Mcf $5.11 $5.89 Fair value (in millions) $(15.0) $(1.6) Price collars Contract volume (Bcf) 33.4 22.0 Weighted average floor price per Mcf $4.68 $4.64 Fair value of floor (in millions) $3.5 $5.0 Weighted average ceiling price per Mcf $8.30 $8.69 Fair value of ceiling (in millions) $(12.3) $(8.8) Swaps with a fixed price payment Contract volume (Bcf) 0.2 Weighted average price per Mcf $6.07 $ Fair value (in millions) $ $ Oil Swaps with a fixed price receipt Contract volume (MBbls) 360 120 Weighted average price per Bbl $33.17 $37.30 Fair value (in millions) $(3.4) $(0.4) Natural Gas Purchases Swaps with a fixed price payment Contract volume (Bcf) 2.9 Weighted average price per Mcf $6.54 $ Fair value (in millions) $(1.4) $ At December 31, 2004, the Company had outstanding fixed price basis differential swaps on 4.1 Bcf of 2005 gas production that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. The fair value of these differential swaps was a liability of $0.1 million at December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2003, the Company had outstanding natural gas price swaps on total notional volumes of 8.0 Bcf at a weighted average price of $4.21 per Mcf in 2004 and 6.0 Bcf at a weighted average price of $4.67 per Mcf in 2005. Outstanding oil price swaps on 426 MBbls were in place that yielded the Company an average price of $28.39 per barrel during 2004. At December 31, 2003, the Company also had outstanding natural gas price swaps on total notional gas purchase volumes of 3.8 Bcf in 2004 for which the Company paid an average fixed price of $5.34 per Mcf. At December 31, 2003, the Company had collars in place on 23.6 Bcf in 2004 and 1.0 Bcf in 2005 of gas production. The 23.6 Bcf in 2004 had an average floor and ceiling price of $3.85 and $6.48 per Mcf, respectively. The 1.0 Bcf in 2005 had an average floor and ceiling price of $4.50 and $8.00 per Mcf, respectively. Subsequent to December 31, 2004 and prior to March 3, 2005, we hedged 4.0 Bcf of 2006 gas production under costless collars with floor prices of $5.50 per Mcf and ceiling prices ranging from $7.60 to $13.50 per Mcf. 50 Table of Contents
