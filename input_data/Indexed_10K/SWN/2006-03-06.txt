ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This Form 10 K contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements for many reasons, including the risks described in Risk Factors and elsewhere in this annual report. You should read the following discussion with the Selected Financial Data and our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. All historical per share information in the Selected Financial Data, financial statements, footnotes and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations have been adjusted to reflect the two for one stock splits effected on June 3, 2005 and November 17, 2005. OVERVIEW Southwestern Energy Company is an independent energy company primarily focused on natural gas. Our primary business is the exploration, development and production of natural gas and crude oil within the United States, with operations principally located in Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico and Louisiana. We are also focused on creating and capturing additional value at and beyond the wellhead through our established natural gas distribution, marketing and transportation businesses and our expanding gathering activities. Our marketing and our gas gathering businesses are collectively referred to as our Midstream Services. We operate principally in three segments: Exploration and Production (or E&P), Natural Gas Distribution and Midstream Services. Our business strategy is focused on providing long term growth in the net asset value of our business, which we achieve in our E&P business through the drillbit. In our E&P business, we prepare economic analyses for each of our drilling and acquisition opportunities and rank them based upon the expected present value added for each dollar invested, which we refer to as PVI. The PVI of the future expected cash flows for each project is determined using a 10% discount rate. We target creating at least $1.30 of discounted pre tax PVI for each dollar we invest in our E&P projects. Our actual PVI results are utilized to help determine the allocation of our future capital investments. We currently derive the vast majority of our operating income and cash flow from the natural gas production of our E&P business and expect this to continue in the future. We expect that growth in our operating income and revenues will primarily depend on natural gas prices and our ability to increase our natural gas production. There has been significant price volatility in the natural gas and crude oil market in recent years due to a variety of factors we cannot control or predict. These factors, which include weather conditions, political and economic events, and competition from other energy sources, impact supply and demand for natural gas. In addition, the price we realize for our gas production is affected by our hedging activities as well as locational differences in market prices. Our ability to increase our natural gas production is dependent upon our ability to economically find and produce natural gas, our abil ity to control costs, and our ability to market natural gas on economically attractive terms to our customers. In 2005, our gas and oil production continued to increase, reaching 61.0 Bcfe, up from 54.1 Bcfe in 2004 and 41.2 Bcfe in 2003. The 13% increase in 2005 production resulted from a 5.4 Bcfe increase in production from our Overton Field in East Texas and a 1.9 Bcfe increase in our Arkoma production. We reported net income of $147.8 million in 2005, or $0.95 per share on a fully diluted basis, up from $103.6 million, or $0.70 per share in 2004. In 2003, we reported net income of $48.9 million, or $0.36 per share on a fully diluted basis. The increases in net income in 2005 and 2004 were a result of increased production volumes and higher realized natural gas and oil prices in our E&P segment. Operating income for our E&P segment was $234.8 million in 2005, up from $164.6 million in 2004 and $84.7 million in 2003. The increases in operating income for our E&P segment in 2005 and 2004 were also due to increased production volumes and higher realized prices, partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses. Operating income for our gas distribution segment was $4.9 million in 2005, compared to $8.5 million in 2004 and $6.8 million in 2003. The decrease in operating income for our gas distribution segment in 2005 resulted primarily f rom warmer weather, increased customer conservation and increased operating costs and expenses. The increase in operating income for our gas distribution segment in 2004 resulted primarily from increased rates implemented in October 2003. Our gas distribution segment also implemented increased rates in October 2005 which will generate approximately $4.6 million of annual revenue. Our cash flow from operating activities was $304.5 million in 2005, compared to $237.9 million in 2004 and $109.1 million in 2003. In our E&P segment, we achieved a reserve replacement ratio of 399% in 2005 at a finding and development cost of $1.71 per Mcfe, including reserve revisions, but excluding $35.1 million of capital invested in acquiring drilling rigs. Our year end reserves grew 28% to 826.8 Bcfe, up from 645.5 Bcfe at the end of 2004. Our results were primarily fueled 37 SWN Table of Contents by the continued success of our drilling in our Overton Field in East Texas and our emerging Fayetteville Shale play in Arkansas. Our capital investments totaled $483.1 million in 2005, up from $295.0 million in 2004 and $180.2 million in 2003. We invested $451.3 million in our E&P segment in 2005 (including $35.1 million invested in drilling rigs), compared to $282.0 million in 2004 and $170.9 million in 2003. Funds for our 2005 capital investments were provided by cash flow from operations and our follow on equity offering in September 2005, which raised approximately $580.0 million, net of related expenses. We also applied a portion of the net proceeds of the equity offering to the repayment of our indebtedness. As a result, our total debt to capitalization ratio decreased to 8% at December 31, 2005 from 42% at December 31, 2004. For 2006, planned capital investments of $830.1 million include $770.3 million for our E&P segment, which is an increase of 71% over our E&P capital investments in 2005. The $770.3 million of exploration and production investments includes $338.3 million for the accelerated development of our Fayetteville Shale play and $78.5 million for the fabrication of drilling rigs. We continue to be focused on our strategy of adding value through the drillbit, as approximately 80% of our 2006 E&P capital, excluding our investment in drilling rigs, is allocated to drilling. In addition to the planned investments in the Fayetteville Shale play, our E&P investments in 2006 will be focused on our lower risk development drilling programs in East Texas and other conventional drilling in the Arkoma Basin. In 2006, we are targeting production to be approximately 74.0 Bcfe to 76.0 Bcfe, compared to 61.0 Bcfe in 2005, an increase of app roximately 21% to 25%. We expect our capital investments in 2006 to be funded by cash flow from operations, the remaining net proceeds from our equity offering and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. With todays commodity price environment, our current capital program and our inventory of projects for the future, we believe we are well positioned to continue to build upon the momentum achieved in recent years. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Exploration and Production Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Revenues (in thousands) $403,234 $ 286,924 $ 176,245 Operating income (in thousands) $234,759 $ 164,585 $ 84,737 Gas production (Bcf) 56.8 50.4 38.0 Oil production (MBbls) 705 618 531 Total production (Bcfe) 61.0 54.1 41.2 Average gas price per Mcf, including hedges $ 6.51 $ 5.21 $ 4.20 Average gas price per Mcf, excluding hedges $ 7.73 $ 5.80 $ 5.15 Average oil price per Bbl, including hedges $ 42.62 $ 31.47 $ 26.72 Average oil price per Bbl, excluding hedges $ 54.37 $ 40.55 $ 29.66 Average unit costs per Mcfe Lease operating expenses $ 0.48 $ 0.38 $ 0.39 General & administrative expenses $ 0.46 $ 0.36 $ 0.41 Taxes other than income taxes $ 0.37 $ 0.28 $ 0.22 Full cost pool amortization $ 1.42 $ 1.20 $ 1.17 Revenues, Operating Income and Production Revenues. Our E&P revenues increased 41% in 2005 to $403.2 million compared to $286.9 million in 2004. Higher prices received for our natural gas and oil production accounted for approximately 62% of the increase in 2005 revenues, with increased gas production volumes accounting for the remaining 38%. Revenues increased 63% in 2004 from $176.2 million in 2003. The increase was primarily due to increased gas production and higher prices received for our natural gas and oil production. Revenues for 2005, 2004 and 2003 also include pre tax gains of $3.1 million, $4.5 million and $3.1 million, respectively, related to the sale of gas in storage inventory. 38 SWN Table of Contents Operating Income. Operating income from our E&P segment was $234.8 million in 2005, up from $164.6 million in 2004 and $84.7 million in 2003. The increases in 2005 and 2004 were due to the increases in revenues, partially offset by increases in operating costs and expenses. Production. Gas and oil production totaled 61.0 Bcfe in 2005, 54.1 Bcfe in 2004 and 41.2 Bcfe in 2003. The increase in 2005 production resulted from a 5.4 Bcfe increase in production from our Overton Field in East Texas and a 1.9 Bcfe increase in our Arkoma production, primarily from the Fayetteville Shale. Production during 2005 was reduced by the effect of the curtailment of a portion of our Overton Field production due to repairs of a transmission line that is not operated by us and by the effect of Hurricane Katrina. Combined, these events reduced our production by an estimated 1.0 Bcfe. The increase in 2004 production resulted primarily from an 8.2 Bcfe increase in production from our Overton Field in East Texas, a 1.3 Bcfe increase in our Arkoma Basin production, and 3.2 Bcfe from our River Ridge discovery in New Mexico. Although we expect production volumes in 2006 to increase primarily due to the development of our Fayetteville Shale play, we cannot guarantee our longer term success in discovering, developing, and producing reserves. Our ability to discover, develop and produce reserves is dependent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the availability of capital, the timing and extent of changes in natural gas and oil prices and competition. There are also many risks inherent to the discovery, development and p roduction of natural gas and oil. We refer you to Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10 K for a discussion of these risks and the impact they could have on our financial condition and results of operations. Gas sales to unaffiliated purchasers were 51.7 Bcf in 2005, up from 45.0 Bcf in 2004 and 32.1 Bcf in 2003. Sales to unaffiliated purchasers are primarily made under contracts that reflect current short term prices and are subject to seasonal price swings. Intersegment sales to Arkansas Western were 5.1 Bcf in 2005, 5.4 Bcf in 2004 and 5.9 Bcf in 2003. We expect future increases in demand for our gas production to come primarily from sales to unaffiliated purchasers. Future sales to Arkansas Westerns gas distribution systems will be dependent upon our success in obtaining gas supply contracts with the utility systems. We are unable to predict changes in the market demand and price for natural gas, including changes that may be induced by the effects of weather on demand of both affiliated and unaffiliated customers for our production. Additionally, we hold a large amount of undeveloped leasehold acreage and producing acreage, and have an inventory of drilling leads, prospects and seismic data that will continue to be evaluated and developed in the future. Our exploration programs have been and continue to be directed primarily toward natural gas. Commodity Prices We periodically enter into various hedging and other financial arrangements with respect to a portion of our projected natural gas and crude oil production in order to ensure certain desired levels of cash flow and to minimize the impact of price fluctuations (we refer you to Item 7A of this Form 10 K and Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion). The average price realized for our gas production, including the effects of hedges, was $6.51 per Mcf in 2005, $5.21 per Mcf in 2004 and $4.20 per Mcf in 2003. The changes in the average price realized primarily reflect changes in average annual spot market prices and the effects of our price hedging activities. Our hedging activities lowered the average gas price $1.22 per Mcf in 2005, $0.59 per Mcf in 2004 and $0.95 per Mcf in 2003. Disregarding the impact of hedges, historically the average price received for our gas production has been approximately $0.30 to $0.50 per M cf lower than average spot market prices due to locational market differentials that reduce the average prices received. In 2005, widening market differentials caused the difference in the average price received to be approximately $0.90 per Mcf. Assuming a NYMEX commodity price for 2006 of $8.00 per Mcf of gas, our differential for the average price received for our gas production is expected to be approximately $0.60 to $0.70 per Mcf below the NYMEX Henry Hub index price, including the impact of our basis hedges. As of December 31, 2005, we have hedged basis differentials on production volumes of 38.3 Bcf in 2006, 39.9 Bcf in 2007 and 2.0 Bcf in 2008 as a means to partially reduce the effect of market differentials on prices we receive. We realized an average price of $42.62 per barrel, including the effects of hedges, for our oil production for the year ended December 31, 2005, up from $31.47 per barrel for 2004 and $26.72 per barrel for 2003. Our hedging activities lowered the average oil price by $11.75 per barrel in 2005, $9.08 per barrel in 2004 and $2.94 per barrel in 2003. Disregarding the impact of hedges, we expect the average price received for our oil production to be approximately $1.50 lower than posted spot market prices in 2006. At December 31, 2005, we had commodity price hedges in place on 92.9 Bcf of 2006, 2007 and 2008 gas production and basis hedges on 80.2 Bcf of 2006, 2007 and 2008 gas production. At December 31, 2005, we had hedges in place on 120,000 barrels of 2006 oil production. Subsequent to December 31, 2005 and prior to February 20, 2006, we hedged an additional 6.0 Bcf of 2008 gas production under costless collars with floor prices ranging from $7.00 to $9.00 per Mcf and ceiling prices ranging from $12.55 to $15.80 per Mcf. Additionally, we hedged the basis differential on the 6.0 Bcf of 2008 gas production. As of February 20, 2006, we have hedged approximately 70% to 75% of our 2006 39 SWN Table of Contents anticipated gas production level and 15% to 20% of our 2006 anticipated oil production level. Operating Costs and Expenses Lease operating expenses per Mcfe for the E&P segment were $0.48 in 2005, up from $0.38 in 2004 and $0.39 in 2003. Lease operating expenses per unit of production increased in 2005 due primarily to increases in compression, saltwater disposal and gas processing costs as well as generally higher oil field service costs. We expect our average lease operating expenses per Mcfe for this segment to increase in the future as our Overton and conventional Arkoma producing fields that have lower per unit operating costs, as compared to our other producing areas, continue to mature. Additionally, inflationary pressures continue to have an impact in all of our operating areas. We do not have sufficient operating history for our Fayetteville Shale area to forecast with accuracy the future operating costs that we may incur related to the production from this area. Taxes other than income taxes per Mcfe were $0.37 in 2005, compared to $0.28 in 2004 and $0.22 in 2003. The increases in 2005 and 2004 taxes other than income taxes per Mcfe were primarily due to increased severance and ad valorem taxes that resulted from increases in commodity prices. General and administrative expenses per Mcfe for this segment were $0.46 in 2005, compared to $0.36 in 2004 and $0.41 in 2003. The increase in general and administrative costs per Mcfe in 2005 from 2004 was due primarily to increased payroll costs relating to the expansion of our E&P operations due to the Fayetteville Shale play and to increased incentive compensation costs. The number of employees in our E&P segment increased to 280 at December 31, 2005 from 147 at December 31, 2004. We expect our cost per Mcfe for operating and general and administrative expenses to increase in 2006 primarily due to anticipated increases in oil field service costs and a continued increase in our staffing levels to accommodate our future expected growth. Future changes in our general and administrative expenses for this segment are primarily dependent upon our salary costs, level of pension expense, option expensing under FAS 123(R) and the amount of incentive compensation paid to our employees. For eligible employees, incentive compensation is based on the achievement of certain operating and performance results, including targeted cash flow, production, proved reserve additions, present value added for each dollar of capital invested, and lease operating expenses and general and administrative expenses per unit of production. See Critical Accounting Policies below for further discussion of pension expense and Adoption of Accounting Principles for further discussion of option expensing under FAS 123(R). Our full cost pool amortization rate averaged $1.42 per Mcfe for 2005, compared to $1.20 in 2004 and $1.17 in 2003. The amortization rate is impacted by reserve additions and the costs incurred for those additions, revisions of previous reserve estimates due to both price and well performance, and the level of unevaluated costs excluded from amortization. Although we expect our amortization rate to continue to increase in the near term as a result of increased costs in finding and developing gas and oil reserves (see discussion on inflation below), we cannot predict our future full cost pool amortization rate with accuracy due to the variability of each of the factors discussed above, as well as the uncertainty of the future success of our Fayetteville Shale play. Unevaluated costs excluded from amortization were $115.2 million at the end of 2005, compared to $47.2 million at the end of 2004 and $39.0 million at the end of 2003. The increase in unevaluate d costs since December 31, 2004 resulted primarily from an increase in our undeveloped leasehold acreage related to our Fayetteville Shale play and increased drilling activity. We utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our natural gas and oil properties. Under this method, all such costs (productive and nonproductive) are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method. These capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test, however, which limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved gas and oil reserves discounted at 10 percent (standardized measure) plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties. Any costs in excess of this ceiling are written off as a non cash expense. The expense may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling. Full cost companies must use the prices in effect at the end of each accounting quarter, including the impact of derivatives qualifying as hedges, to calculate the ceiling value of their reserves. At December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, our unamortized costs of natural gas and oil properties did not exceed this ceiling amount. At December 31, 2005, our standardized measure was calculated based upon quoted market prices of $10.08 per Mcf for Henry Hub gas and $61.04 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil, adjusted for market differentials. A significant decline in natural gas and oil prices from year end 2005 levels or other factors, without other mitigating circumstances, could cause a future write down of capitalized costs and a non cash charge against future earnings. Inflation impacts our E&P operations by generally increasing our operating costs and the costs of our capital additions. The effects of inflation on our operations prior to 2000 were minimal due to low inflation rates. However, since 2001, as commodity prices have increased, the impact of inflation has intensified in our E&P segment as shortages in 40 SWN Table of Contents drilling rigs, third party services and qualified labor have risen due to increased activity levels in the natural gas and oil industry. This impact will continue to increase to the extent commodity prices remain high or further increase. We have endeavored to mitigate rising costs by obtaining vendor pricing commitments for multiple projects and by offering performance bonuses related to increased economic efficiencies. Natural Gas Distribution Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 ($ in thousands except for per Mcf amounts) Revenues $ 178,482 $ 152,449 $ 137,356 Gas purchases $ 120,852 $ 97,274 $ 84,926 Operating costs and expenses $ 52,719 $ 46,659 $ 45,664 Operating income $ 4,911 $ 8,516 $ 6,766 Deliveries (Bcf) Sales and end use and off system transportation 23.2 25.0 25.0 Sales customers at year end 147,820 144,612 141,573 Average sales rate per Mcf $ 11.85 $ 9.39 $ 7.93 Heating weather degree days 3,744 3,678 3,969 Percent of normal 91% 90% 99% Revenues and Operating Income Gas distribution revenues fluctuate due to the effects of warm weather on demand for natural gas and the pass through of gas supply cost changes. Because of the corresponding changes in purchased gas costs, the revenue effect of the pass through of gas cost changes has not materially affected operating income. Gas distribution revenues increased 17% in 2005 and 11% in 2004. The increase in 2005 gas distribution revenues was primarily due to higher average sales rates as a result of higher gas prices and to the effects of a $4.6 million annual rate increase implemented in October 2005. The increase in 2004 gas distribution revenues was primarily due to higher average sales rates as a result of higher gas prices and to the effects of a $4.1 million annual rate increase implemented in October 2003. Weather during 2005 in the utilitys service territory was 9% warmer than normal and 1% colder than the prior year. Weather during 2004 in the utilitys ser vice territory was 10% warmer than normal and 9% warmer than the prior year. Operating income for our gas distribution systems decreased 42% in 2005 and increased 26% in 2004. The decrease in 2005 operating income for this segment resulted primarily from increased operating costs and expenses along with warmer than normal weather. The increase in 2004 operating income for this segment resulted primarily from rate increases implemented in late 2003, partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses. Gas distribution revenues in future years will be impacted by the utilitys gas purchase costs, customer growth, usage per customer and rate increases allowed by the Arkansas Public Service Commission, or APSC. Deliveries and Rates In 2005, Arkansas Western sold 14.4 Bcf to its customers at an average rate of $11.85 per Mcf, compared to 15.5 Bcf at $9.39 per Mcf in 2004 and 16.3 Bcf at $7.93 per Mcf in 2003. Additionally, Arkansas Western transported 8.8 Bcf in 2005, compared to 8.5 Bcf in 2004 and 8.4 Bcf in 2003 for its end use customers. The decreases in volumes sold in 2005 and 2004 primarily resulted from variations in weather and customer conservation brought about by high gas prices in recent years. Arkansas Westerns tariffs contain a weather normalization clause to lessen the impact of revenue increases and decreases which might result from weather variations during the winter heating season. The increase in the gas distribution segments average sales rate for 2005 reflected changes in the average cost of gas purchased for delivery to our customers, which are passed through to customers under automatic adjustment clauses. Total deliveries to industrial customers of the gas distribution segment, including transportation volumes, were 10.0 Bcf in 2005, 9.8 Bcf in 2004 and 9.6 Bcf in 2003. Changes in deliveries to industrial customers are impacted by customer conservation caused by high gas prices and by continued industrial growth in the region. Arkansas Western also transported less than 0.1 Bcf of gas through its gathering system in 2005, compared to 1.0 Bcf in 2004 and 0.3 Bcf in 2003 for off system deliveries, all to the Ozark Gas Transmission System. The level of off system deliveries each year generally reflects the impact of weather changing the on system demands of our gas distribution systems for our gas production. The average off system transportation rate was approximately $0.13 per Mcf, exclusive of fuel, in 2005, 2004 and 2003. 41 SWN Table of Contents Future volumes delivered to customers will be impacted by customer growth, weather and the effect that gas prices will continue to have on customer conservation. Operating Costs and Expenses The changes in purchased gas costs for the gas distribution segment reflect volumes purchased, prices paid for supplies and the mix of purchases from various gas supply contracts (base load, swing and no notice). Operating costs and expenses, net of purchased gas costs, increased in 2005 to $52.7 million from $46.7 million in 2004. The increase was primarily due to a $2.8 million increase in general and administrative expenses due to increased salaries and incentive compensation costs, and a $1.3 million increase in transmission expense as a result of higher fuel costs. Operating costs and expenses for 2004, net of purchased gas costs, increased to $46.7 million from $45.7 million in 2003 due primarily to a $0.6 million increase in transmission expense as a result of higher fuel costs and a $0.3 million increase in depreciation expense as a result of increases in property, plant and equipment. Future changes in our general and administrative expenses for this segment are primarily dependent upon our salary costs, level of pension expense, option expensing under FAS 123(R) and the amount of incentive compensation paid to our employees. See Critical Accounting Policies and Adoption of Accounting Principles below for further discussion of pension expense and option expensing, respectively. In October 1998, Arkansas Western instituted a competitive bidding process for its gas supply. Additionally, Arkansas Western annually submits its gas supply plan to the general staff of the APSC. As a result of the bidding process under the plan filed for the 2005 2006 gas purchase year, SEECO successfully bid on gas supply packages representing approximately 44% of the requirements for Arkansas Western for 2006. The contracts awarded to SEECO expire through 2007. Arkansas Western enters into hedging activities from time to time with respect to its gas purchases to protect against the inherent price risks of adverse price fluctuations. Our gas distribution segment hedged 4.2 Bcf of gas purchases in 2005 which had the effect of increasing its total gas supply costs by $2.4 million. In 2004, our utility hedged 4.5 Bcf of its gas supply which decreased its total gas supply cost by $1.1 million. In 2003, our utility hedged 4.6 Bcf of its gas supply whi ch decreased its total gas supply cost by $6.1 million. At December 31, 2005, Arkansas Western had 1.8 Bcf of future gas purchases hedged at an average purchase price of $12.71 per Mcf. We refer you to Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Inflation impacts our gas distribution segment by generally increasing our operating costs and the costs of our capital additions. The effects of inflation on the utilitys operations in recent years have been minimal due to low inflation rates. Additionally, delays inherent in the rate making process prevent us from obtaining immediate recovery of increased operating costs of our gas distribution segment. Regulatory Matters Arkansas Westerns rates and operations are regulated by the APSC and it operates through municipal franchises that are perpetual by virtue of state law. These franchises, however, may not be exclusive within a geographic area. Although its rates for gas delivered to its retail customers are not regulated by the FERC, its transmission and gathering pipeline systems are subject to the FERCs regulations concerning open access transportation. As the regulatory focus of the natural gas industry has shifted from the federal level to the state level, some utilities across the nation are required to unbundle residential sales services from transportation services in an effort to promote greater competition. There is no such legislation in Arkansas and no regulatory directives related to natural gas are presently pending. In recent years, there have been efforts by the Arkansas legislature and the APSC concerning issues of deregulation of the retail sa le of electricity and a large user access program for electric service choice. Legislation adopted in 2001 for the deregulation of the retail sale of electricity was repealed in 2003 and no legislation has been taken regarding implementing a large user access program. In April 2002, the APSC adopted Natural Gas Procurement Plan Rules for utilities. These rules require utilities to take all reasonable and prudent steps necessary to develop a diversified gas supply portfolio. The portfolio should consist of an appropriate combination of different types of gas purchase contracts and or financial hedging instruments that are designed to yield an optimum balance of reliability, reduced volatility and reasonable price. Utilities are also required to submit on an annual basis their gas supply plan, along with their contracting and or hedging objectives, to the staff of the APSC for review and determination as to whether it is consistent with these policy principles. Arkansas Western also purchases gas from unaffiliated producers under take or pay contracts. We believe that we do not have significant exposure to liabilities resulting from these contracts and expect to be able to continue to satisfactorily manage our exposure to take or pay liabilities. 42 SWN Table of Contents In October 2005, in response to Arkansas Westerns request for a $9.7 million rate increase, the APSC approved a rate increase totaling $4.6 million annually, exclusive of costs to be recovered through Arkansas Westerns purchase gas adjustment clause. The rate increase was effective for deliveries made to customers on or after October 31, 2005. The request relating to the October 2005 increase assumed a rate of return of 11.5% and a capital structure of 50% debt and 50% equity. The APSC order provided for an allowed return on equity of 9.7% and as assumed capital structure of 54% debt and 46% equity. In its order approving the rate increase, the APSC stated that it would consider in future generic proceedings, certain regulatory changes including a streamlined ratecase process, a revenue decoupling mechanism designed to encourage efficiency and conservation, and a performance based methodology designed to allow a vari able return on equity adjustment within a reasonable range. In September 2003, in response to our request for an $11.0 million rate increase, Arkansas Western received regulatory approval from the APSC of a rate increase totaling $4.1 million annually, exclusive of costs to be recovered through Arkansas Westerns purchase gas adjustment clause. The order also entitled Arkansas Western to recover certain additional costs totaling $2.3 million through its purchase gas adjustment clause over a two year period. The rate increase was effective for all customer bills rendered on or after October 1, 2003. Rate increase requests, which may be filed in the future, will depend on customer growth, increases in operating expenses, and additional investment in property, plant and equipment. Midstream Services Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Revenues (in millions) $ 459.9 $ 315.0 $ 202.0 Gas purchases (in millions) $ 451.1 $ 310.7 $ 198.1 Operating income (in millions) $ 5.7 $ 3.2 $ 2.6 Gas volumes marketed (Bcf) 61.9 57.0 42.7 Our operating income from Midstream Services was $5.7 million on revenues of $459.9 million in 2005, compared to $3.2 million on revenues of $315.0 million in 2004 and $2.6 million on revenues of $202.0 million in 2003. The increase in revenues in 2005 resulted from increased volumes marketed and an increase in natural gas commodity prices. The increase in revenues from higher prices was largely offset by a corresponding increase in gas purchase expense. The increase in operating income during 2005 was primarily due to higher marketing margins on natural gas sales caused in large part by the increased volatility of locational market differentials in our core operating areas. We marketed 61.9 Bcf in 2005, compared to 57.0 Bcf in 2004 and 42.7 Bcf in 2003. The increase in volumes marketed in 2005 and 2004 resulted from marketing our increased production volumes, largely related to our Overton Field in East Texas. Of the total volumes marketed, production from our exploration and production subsidiaries accounted for 76% in 2005, 77% in 2004 and 75% in 2003. We enter into hedging activities from time to time with respect to our gas marketing activities to provide margin protection. We refer you to Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note 8 to the financial statements for additional discussion. Midstream services also had gathering revenues of $1.0 million in 2005 related to gathering systems it owns in Arkansas. Gathering revenues and expenses for this segment are expected to continue to grow in the future as gathering systems supporting our Fayetteville Shale play are constructed. Transportation At December 31, 2005, we owned a 25% interest in the Ozark Gas Transmission System. We recorded pre tax income from operations related to our investment of $1.6 million in 2005, compared to a pre tax loss of $0.4 million in 2004 and pre tax income of $1.1 million in 2003. These amounts are recorded in other income (expense) in our income statement. The increase in pre tax income in 2005 results from an increase in volumes transported and higher transportation rates collected for those volumes. The pre tax loss in 2004 was primarily due to a $0.4 million negative adjustment from the operator of the pipeline for prior period allocations of income and expenses to the partners. The pre tax gain in 2003 included a gain of $1.3 million recognized on the sale of a 28 mile portion of Ozark Gas Transmission Systems pipeline located in Oklahoma that had limited strategic value to the overall system. We refer you to Note 7 to the consolidated financial stateme nts for additional discussion. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had guaranteed $39.0 million and $40.2 million, respectively, of the partnership debt. This debt financed a portion of the original construction costs. No advances to NOARK were required in 2005 and 2003. We advanced $2.1 million to NOARK in 2004 as an adjustment to prior period cash disbursements. We 43 SWN Table of Contents refer you to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our guarantee of NOARK debt. Our gas distribution subsidiary has a transportation contract with Ozark Gas Transmission System for 66.9 MMcf per day of firm capacity that expires in 2014. Additionally, our Midstream Services segment has transportation contracts with Ozark Gas Transmission System for a total of 20.0 MMcf per day of firm capacity through 2006. Other Revenues In 2005, 2004 and 2003, other revenues included gains of $0.4 million, $5.8 million and $3.0 million, respectively, related to sales of undeveloped real estate and certain property and equipment. Other revenues for 2005, 2004 and 2003 also included pre tax gains of $3.1 million, $4.5 million and $3.1 million, respectively, related to the sale of gas in storage inventory. Interest Expense and Interest Income Interest costs, net of capitalization, were down 11% in 2005 and down 2% in 2004, both as compared to prior years. In 2005, interest expense was reduced primarily due to lower average borrowings under our revolving debt facility as a result of our equity offering in September 2005. We refer you to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Requirements and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt. In 2004, higher interest costs that resulted from increased average borrowings were offset by an increase in capitalized interest in the E&P segment. Interest capitalized increased 114% in 2005 and increased 56% in 2004. Changes in capitalized interest are primarily due to the level of costs excluded from amortization in our E&P segment and the capitalization of interest during the construction phase of our drilling rigs. Costs excluded from amortization in the E&P segment increased to $115.2 million at December 31, 2005, compared to $47.2 million at December 31, 2004. Total capital expenditures for our E&P segment were $451.3 million in 2005, up from $282.0 million in 2004. During 2005, we earned interest income of $3.4 million related to our cash investments. This amount is recorded in other income. Income Taxes Our provision for deferred income taxes was an effective rate of 36.9% in 2005, 36.6% in 2004 and 36.7% in 2003. The changes in the provision for deferred income taxes recorded each year result primarily from the level of taxable income, adjusted for permanent differences. Pension Expense We recorded pension expense of $2.3 million in 2005, $2.2 million in 2004 and $3.3 million in 2003. The amount of pension expense recorded by us is determined by actuarial calculations and is also impacted by the funded status of our plans. During 2005, we funded our pension plan with contributions of $1.8 million. At December 31, 2005, our pension plans were underfunded and a liability of $7.9 million was recorded on the balance sheet. As a result of the underfunded status and actuarial data to be completed in early 2006, we expect to record pension expense of $3.3 million in 2006. For further discussion of our pension plans, we refer you to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements and Critical Accounting Policies below. Adoption of Accounting Principles In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement on Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share Based Payment, revising FASB Statement 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation and superseding APB opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. This statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of services provided by employees and directors received in exchange for an award of equity instruments, including stock options, at a grant date fair value. The fair value cost is then recognized over the period that services are provided. We will adopt FAS 123R in the first quarter of 2006 using the modified prospective method with no restatement of prior periods. In Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K, we disclose the effect on net income and earnings per share for years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of FAS 123 to stock based employee compensation. 44 SWN Table of Contents In April 2005, the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107) to provide additional guidance regarding the application of FAS 123 (Revised 2004). SAB 107 permits registrants to choose an appropriate valuation technique or model to estimate the fair value of share options, assuming consistent application, and provides guidance for the development of assumptions used in the valuation process. Additionally, SAB 107 discusses disclosures to be made under Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in registrants periodic reports upon adoption of this standard. In November 2005, the FASB issued final Staff Position (FSP) FAS No. 123R 3, Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share Based Payment Awards. The FSP provides an alternative method of calculating excess tax benefits (the APIC pool) from the method defined in FAS 123R for share based payments. A one time election to adopt the transition method in this FSP is available to those entities adopting FAS 123R using either the modified retrospective or modified prospective method and is available for up to one year from the initial adoption of FAS 123R or effective date of the FSP. However, until an entity makes its election, it must follow the guidance in FAS 123R. FSP 123R 3 is effective upon initial adoption of FAS 123R and will become effective for us in the first quarter of 2006. We are currently evaluating the potential impact on our financial position and results of operations of calculating the APIC pool with this alternative method. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we amended the stock option agreements under our incentive plan to allow for the immediate vesting of option awards made on or after December 8, 2005, upon the death, disability or retirement of the plan participant. This change did not affect options issued prior to December 8, 2005 and will not reduce expenses expected to be incurred under FAS 123R. It will result in an earlier recognition of expenses for those participants who have reached retirement age. In March 2005, the FASB issued FSP No. FIN 46(R) 5, Implicit Variable Interests under FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. This FSP clarifies that when applying the variable interest consolidation model, a reporting enterprise should consider whether it holds an implicit variable interest in a variable interest entity (VIE) or potential VIE. FSP No. FIN 46(R) 5 is effective as of April 1, 2005. Upon the adoption of FSP No. FIN 46(R) 5, we did not identify any potential or implicit VIEs. In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47 (FIN 47), Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143. FIN 47 requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value can be reasonably estimated. FIN 47 states that a conditional asset retirement obligation is a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing or method of settlement are conditional upon a future event that may or may not be within control of the entity. FIN 47 is effective no later than the end of the first fiscal year ending after December 15, 2005. The adoption of FIN 47 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections (FAS 154). FAS 154 changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle and requires retrospective applications to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable. This new accounting standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The adoption of this accounting principle is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We depend on internally generated funds, our unsecured revolving credit facility (discussed below under Financing Requirements) and funds accessed through public debt and equity markets as our primary sources of liquidity. We may borrow up to $500 million under our revolving credit facility from time to time. In September 2005, we consummated an underwritten offering of 9,775,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. The net proceeds of the offering were approximately $580.0 million after deduction of the underwriting discounts and offering expenses. Of the net proceeds, $186.7 million was used to pay down outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility, $125.0 million was used to pay our 6.70% Notes due December 2005 and the remainder was invested in short term cash equivalents pending our use for capital expenditures. As of February 20, 2006, we had no indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility. During 2006, we expect to draw on a portion of the funds available under our credit facility to fund our planned capital expenditures (discussed below under Capital Expenditures), which are expected to exceed the net cash generated by our operations and cash investments. Net cash provided by operating activities was $304.5 million in 2005, compared to $237.9 million in 2004 and $109.1 million in 2003. The primary components of cash generated from operations are net income, depreciation, depletion and amortization, the provision for deferred income taxes and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash from 45 SWN Table of Contents operating activities increased in 2005 and 2004 due mainly to increased net income and the related increases in deferred income taxes generated by our E&P segment. Net cash from operating activities provided 63% of our cash requirements for capital expenditures in 2005, 81% in 2004 and 65% in 2003. We believe that our operating cash flow, remaining funds from the 2005 equity offering and our credit facility will be adequate to meet our capital and operating requirements for 2006. We may choose to refinance certain portions of our borrowings by issuing long term debt in the public or private debt markets. Our cash flow from operating activities is highly dependent upon the market prices that we receive for our gas production. The price received for our production is also influenced by our commodity hedging activities, as more fully discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements included in this Form 10 K and Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Natural gas and oil prices are subject to wide fluctuations. As a result, we are unable to forecast with certainty our future level of cash flow from operations. We adjust our discretionary uses of cash dependent upon cash flow available. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures totaled $483.1 million in 2005, $295.0 million in 2004 and $180.2 million in 2003. Capital expenditures included $28.1 million in 2005, $3.9 million in 2004, and $12.0 million in 2003 related to the change in the amount of accrued expenditures. Our E&P segment expenditures included no significant acquisition of interests in natural gas and oil producing properties in 2005, compared to $14.2 million in 2004 and $3.0 million in 2003. 2005 2004 2003 (in thousands) Exploration and production $ 451,289 $ 281,988 $ 170,886 Gas distribution 10,908 7,298 8,178 Midstream services 15,840 10 Other 5,014 5,704 1,129 $ 483,051 $ 294,990 $ 180,203 Our capital investments for 2006 are planned to be $830.1 million, consisting of $770.3 million for exploration and production including $78.5 million for the acquisition of drilling rigs, $37.5 for midstream services, $11.9 million for gas distribution system improvements and $10.4 million for general purposes. We expect to allocate $338.3 million of our 2006 E&P capital to our Fayetteville Shale play. We expect that our planned level of capital investments in 2006 will allow us to accelerate the drilling in the Fayetteville Shale, continue the development of our Overton Field properties in East Texas, continue our conventional drilling in the Arkoma Basin, maintain our present markets, explore and develop other existing gas and oil properties, generate new drilling prospects, and provide for improvements necessary due to normal customer growth in our gas distribution segment. As discussed above, our 2006 capital investment pr ogram is expected to be funded through cash flow from operations, the remaining net proceeds from our equity offering, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We may adjust the level of 2006 capital investments dependent upon our level of cash flow generated from operations and our ability to borrow under our credit facility. Financing Requirements Our total debt outstanding was $100.0 million at December 31, 2005 and $325.0 million at December 31, 2004. In January 2005, we amended and restated our previous $300 million revolving credit facility due to expire in January 2007, increasing the borrowing capacity to $500 million and extending the expiration to January 2010. At December 31, 2005, we had no outstanding debt under our revolving credit facility. The interest rate on the facility is calculated based upon our public debt rating and is currently 125 basis points over LIBOR. Our publicly traded notes were downgraded in January 2005 by Standard and Poors to BBB from BBB, and continue to be rated Ba2 by Moodys. Any future downgrades in our public debt ratings could increase the cost of funds under our revolving credit facility. Our revolving credit facility contains covenants which impose certain restrictions on us. Under the credit agreements, we may not issue total debt in excess of 60% of our total capital, must maintain a certain level of shareholders equity, and must maintain a ratio of EBITDA to interest expense of 3.5 or above. Additionally, there are certain limitations on the amount of indebtedness that may be incurred by our subsidiaries. We were in compliance with all of the covenants of our credit agreements at December 31, 2005. Although we do not anticipate any violations of our financial covenants, our ability to comply with those covenants is dependent upon the success of our exploration and development program and upon factors beyond our control, such as the market prices for natural gas and oil. If we are unable to borrow under our credit facility, we would have to decrease our capital expenditure plans. 46 SWN Table of Contents During the third quarter of 2005, we completed the sale of 9,775,000 shares of our common stock under an effective shelf registration statement. The net proceeds of the offering were approximately $580.0 million after deduction of the underwriting discounts and offering expenses. Of the net proceeds, $186.7 million was used to pay down outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility, $125.0 million was used to pay the 6.70% Notes due December 2005 and the remainder was invested in short term cash investments. In 1997, we publicly issued $60.0 million of 7.625% Medium Term Notes due 2027 and $40.0 million of 7.21% Medium Term Notes due 2017. In June 1998, the NOARK partnership issued $80.0 million of 7.15% Notes due 2018, which were severally guaranteed by us and Enogex, Inc., the other general partner. The notes required semi annual principal payments of $1.0 million that began in December 1998. In the fourth quarter of 2005, Enogex sold its interest in NOARK to Atlas Pipeline Partners, L.P. (Atlas) and used a portion of the sales proceeds to prepay its share of NOARKs debt. NOARKs remaining outstanding debt at December 31, 2005 was $39.0 million, all of which is guaranteed by us, and now requires semi annual payments of $0.6 million. We account for our investment in NOARK under the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the results of NOARK. We did not advance any funds to NOARK in 2005, compared to $2.1 million of advancements in 2004, and no advances were required in 2003. If NOARK is unable to generate sufficient cash in the future on a sustainable basis to servic e its debt and we are continually required to contribute cash to fund our debt service guarantee, we could be required to record the NOARK debt commitment under current accounting rules. At the end of 2005, our capital structure consisted of 8% debt (excluding our guarantee of NOARKs obligations) and 92% equity, with a ratio of EBITDA to interest expense of 22.4. EBITDA is a measure required by our credit facility financial covenants and is defined as net income plus interest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Shareholders equity in the December 31, 2005 balance sheet includes an accumulated other comprehensive loss of $99.8 million related to our hedging activities that is required to be recorded under the provisions of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (FAS 133). This amount is based on current market values of our hedges at December 31, 2005, and does not necessarily reflect the value that we will receive or pay when the hedges ultimately are settled, nor does it take into account revenues to be received associated with the ph ysical delivery of sales volumes hedged. Our credit facilitys financial covenants with respect to capitalization percentages exclude the effects of non cash entries that result from FAS 133 as well as the non cash impact of any full cost ceiling write downs, and include the guarantee of NOARKs obligations. Our capital structure, including our guarantee of NOARKs obligations of $39.0 million, would be 10% debt and 90% equity at December 31, 2005, without consideration of the accumulated other comprehensive loss related to FAS 133 of $99.8 million. As part of our strategy to ensure a certain level of cash flow to fund our operations, we have hedged approximately 70% to 75% of our expected 2006 gas production and 15% to 20% of our expected 2006 oil production. The amount of long term debt we incur will be dependent upon commodity prices and our capital expenditure plans. If commodity prices remain at or near 2005 levels throughout 2006 and our capital expenditure plans do not change, we will i ncrease our long term debt in 2006. If commodity prices significantly decrease, we may decrease and or reallocate our planned capital expenditures. We refer you to Business Other Items Reconciliation of Non GAAP Measures in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10 K for a table that reconciles EBITDA with our net income as derived from our audited financial information. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As discussed above in Results of Operations Transportation, we hold a 25% general partnership interest in NOARK, which owns the Ozark Gas Transmission System that is utilized to transport our gas production and the gas production of others. We account for our investment under the equity method of accounting. As a result of the sale by Enogex of its interests in NOARK and their related prepayment of their portion of NOARKs 7.15% Notes due 2018, we are the sole guarantor of the outstanding notes at December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the outstanding principal amount of these notes was $39.0 million and $67.0 million, respectively. In 2004, our share of the notes was $40.2 million. The notes require semi annual principal payments of $0.6 million. Under the guarantee, we are required to fund the notes to the extent that they are not funded by our share of the operations of the pipeline. We did not advance funds to NOARK in 2005. We advanced $2.1 million to NOARK in 2004 as an adjustment to prior period cash disbursements and were no t required to advance any funds in 2003. We do not derive any liquidity, capital resources, market risk support or credit risk support from our investment in NOARK. Our share of the results of operations included in other income (expense) related to our NOARK investment was pre tax income of $1.6 million in 2005, a pre tax loss of $0.4 million in 2004 and pre tax income of $1.1 million in 2003. The increase in pre tax income in 2005 was primarily due to increased throughput and higher average rates charged to customers. The pre tax loss in 2004 was primarily due to a $0.4 million negative adjustment from the operator of the pipeline for prior period allocations of income and expenses to the partners. In 2003, our share of pre tax income included 47 SWN Table of Contents a gain of $1.3 million related to the sale of a 28 mile portion of the pipeline located in Oklahoma. We believe that we will be able to continue to improve the operating results of the NOARK project and expect our investment in NOARK to be realized over the life of the system (see Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion). Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments We have various contractual obligations in the normal course of our operations and financing activities. Significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2005 were as follows: Contractual Obligations: Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years More than 5 Years (in thousands) Long term debt $ 100,000 $ $ $ 60,000 $ 40,000 Interest on senior notes(1) 49,158 7,459 14,918 7,306 19,475 Operating leases(2) 17,019 2,985 6,022 5,128 2,884 Unconditional purchase obligations(3) Operating agreements(4) 22,544 19,564 2,980 Rental compression(5) 27,125 5,440 12,009 7,883 1,793 Demand charges(6) 95,693 14,571 19,251 20,461 41,410 Drilling rigs(7) 62,294 62,294 Other obligations(8) 10,176 9,770 406 $ 384,009 $ 122,083 $ 55,586 $ 100,778 $ 105,562 (1) Interest on the senior notes includes interest through 2009 on the $60 million notes that are due in 2027 and putable at the holders option in 2009. (2) We lease certain office space and equipment under non cancelable operating leases expiring through 2013. (3) Our Gas Distribution segment has volumetric commitments for the purchase of gas under non cancelable competitive bid packages and non cancelable wellhead contracts. Volumetric purchase commitments at December 31, 2005 totaled 1.2 Bcf, comprised of 0.7 Bcf in less than one year, 0.3 Bcf in one to three years and 0.2 Bcf in three to five years. Our volumetric purchase commitments are priced primarily at regional gas indices set at the first of each future month. These costs are recoverable from the utilitys end use customers. (4) Our E&P segment has commitments for up to $22.5 million in termination fees related to rig operator agreements in the event that the agreements are terminated. (5) Our E&P and Midstream Services segments have commitments for approximately $27.1 million of compressor rental fees associated primarily with our Overton operations and our Fayetteville Shale play. (6) Our Gas Distribution segment has commitments for approximately $88.7 million of demand charges on non cancelable firm gas purchase and firm transportation agreements. These costs are recoverable from the utilitys end use customers. Our E&P segment has commitments for approximately $5.4 million of demand transportation charges, and our Midstream Services segment has commitments for approximately $1.6 million of demand transportation charges. (7) Our E&P segment has commitments related to the purchase of ten drilling rigs expected to be delivered within 2006 for approximately $62.3 million, including ancillary equipment. (8) Our other significant contractual obligations include approximately $5.3 million of land leases, approximately $2.4 million for funding of benefit plans, approximately $1.1 million for drilling and well commitments and approximately $0.9 million for various information technology support and data subscription agreements. In the second quarter of 2005, we entered into an agreement to fabricate five new land drilling rigs for an aggregate purchase price of $37.7 million. In the third quarter of 2005, we entered into an agreement to fabricate an additional five land drilling rigs for an aggregate purchase price of $40.7 million. Including change orders, ancillary equipment and supplies, the total cost of these ten rigs is approximately $97.4 million. Payments made under these agreements were $35.1 million in 2005 with the remainder due in 2006. We refer you to Financing Requirements above for a discussion of the terms of our long term debt. Contingent Liabilities and Commitments We have the following commitments and contingencies that could create, increase or accelerate our liabilities. Substantially all of our employees are covered by defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans. Our return on the assets of these plans was lower than our assumed rate of return which, when combined with other factors including an increase in 48 SWN Table of Contents employees, resulted in an increase in pension expense and our required funding of the plans for 2005 and 2004. At December 31, 2005, we recorded an accrued pension benefit liability of $7.9 million. As a result of the underfunded status and actuarial data to be completed in early 2006, we expect to record pension expense of $3.3 million in 2006. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements and Critical Accounting Policies below for additional information. As discussed above in Off Balance Sheet Arrangements, we are the sole guarantor of the principal and interest payments on NOARKs 7.15% Notes due 2018. At December 31, 2005, the outstanding principal of these notes was $39.0 million. The notes require semi annual principal payments of $0.6 million. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. We are subject to litigation and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. Management believes, individually or in aggregate, such litigation and claims will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or our results of operations but these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and managements view may change in the future. If an unfavorable final outcome were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material impact on our financial position and the results of operations for the period in which the effect becomes reasonably estimable. A lawsuit was filed against us in 2001 alleging a breach of an agreement to indemnify the other party against settlement payments related to the Companys Boure prospect in Louisiana. The allegations were contested and, in 2002, we were granted a motion for summary judgment by the trial court. The case was appealed to the First Court of Appeals in Houston , Texas, which subsequently transferred the appeal to the Thirteenth Court of Appeals in Corpus Christi. The appeal was briefed and argued during 2003. On April 14, 2005, the Thirteenth Court of Appeals reversed the orders of the trial court and rendered judgment denying our motion for summary judgment and granting the motion for summary judgment of the other party. Our motion for rehearing with the Thirteenth Court of Appeals was denied on May 19, 2005. In August of 2005, we filed a petition for review with the Texas Supreme Court. In October of 2005, the Texas Supreme Court invited additional briefing by the parties, which both parties have done. The matter is currently pending before the Texas Supreme Court. Should the other party prevail on the appeal, we could be required to pay approximately $2.1 million, plus pre judgment interest and attorneys fees. Based on an assessment of this litigation by us and our legal counsel, no accrual for loss is currently recorded. Working Capital We maintain access to funds that may be needed to meet capital requirements through our credit facility described above. We had positive working capital of $158.7 million at the end of 2005 and negative working capital of $2.7 million at the end of 2004. Current assets included $222.4 million of remaining proceeds from our 2005 equity offering that is invested in cash investments. Current liabilities increased $168.7 million, due primarily to an increase in our current hedging liability and accounts payable accruals at December 31, 2005. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Natural Gas and Oil Properties We utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our natural gas and oil properties. Under the full cost accounting rules of the SEC, all such costs (productive and nonproductive) are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method. Unevaluated costs are reviewed twice a year for individual impairment. Capitalized costs within the full cost pool are subjected quarterly to a ceiling test, which limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved gas and oil reserves discounted at 10 percent plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties. If the net capitalized costs of natural gas and oil properties exceed the ceiling, we will record a ceiling test write down to the extent of such excess. A ceiling test write down is a non cash charge to earnings. If required, it reduces earnings and impac ts shareholders equity in the period of occurrence and results in lower depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in future periods. The write down may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling. The risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties increases when natural gas and oil prices are depressed or if there are substantial downward revisions in estimated proved reserves. Under the SECs full cost accounting rules, our reserves are required to be priced using prices in effect at the end of the reporting period. Application of these rules during periods of relatively low natural gas or oil prices due to seasonality or other reasons, even if temporary, increases the probability of a ceiling test write down. Based on natural gas and oil prices in effect on December 31, 2005, the unamortized cost of our natural gas and oil properties did not exceed the ceiling of proved natural gas and oil reserves. Natural gas pricing has historically been unpredictable and any significant declines could result in a ceiling test write down in subsequent quarterly or annual reporting periods. 49 SWN Table of Contents Natural gas and oil reserves used in the full cost method of accounting cannot be measured exactly. Our estimate of natural gas and oil reserves requires extensive judgments of reservoir engineering data and is generally less precise than other estimates made in connection with financial disclosures. Our reservoir engineers prepare our reserve estimates under the supervision of our management. Reserve estimates are prepared for each of our properties annually by the reservoir engineers assigned to the asset management team in the geographic locations in which the property is located. These estimates are reviewed by senior engineers who are not part of the asset management teams and the president of our E&P subsidiaries. Final authority over the estimates of our proved reserves rests with our Board of Directors. In each of the past three years, revisions to our proved reserve estimates represented no grea ter than 4% of our total proved reserve estimates, which we believe is indicative of the effectiveness of our internal controls. Proved developed reserves generally have a higher degree of accuracy in this estimation process, when compared to proved undeveloped and proved non producing reserves, as production history and pressure data over time is available for the majority of our proved developed properties. Proved developed reserves account for 73% of our total reserve base. Assigning monetary values to such estimates does not reduce the subjectivity and changing nature of such reserve estimates. The uncertainties inherent in the reserve estimates are compounded by applying additional estimates of the rates and timing of production and the costs that will be incurred in developing and producing the reserves. We cannot assure you that our internal controls sufficiently address the numerous uncertainties and risks that are inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas and oil reserves and projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures as many factors are beyond our control. We refer you to The natural gas and oil reserves data we report are only estimates and may prove to be inaccurate. in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of Part I of this Form 10 K for a more detailed discussion of these uncertainties, risks and other factors. We engage the services of Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., an independent petroleum engineering firm, to audit our reserves as estimated by our reservoir engineers. Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. reports the results of the reserves audit to our Board of Directors. In conducting its audit, the engineers and geologists of Netherland, Sewell & Associates study our major properties in detail and independently develop reserve estimates. For the year ended December 31, 2005, Netherland, Sewell & Associates issued its audit opinion as to the reasonableness of our reserve estimates, stating that our estimated proved oil and gas reserves are, in the aggregate, reasonable and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles. A decline in gas and oil prices used to calculate the discounted future net revenues of our reserves affects both the present value of cash flows and the quantity of reserves reported. Our reserve base is 93% natural gas, therefore changes in oil prices used do not have as significant an impact as gas prices on cash flows and reported reserve quantities. Reported discounted cash flows and reserve quantities at December 31, 2005 were $1,420.8 million and 826.8 Bcfe. An assumed decrease of $1.00 per Mcf in the December 31, 2005 gas price used to price our reserves would have resulted in an approximate $140 million to $150 million decline in our future cash flows discounted at 10% and an approximate decrease of 5 Bcfe of our reported reserves. Under this assumption, our unamortized costs remained below the ceiling of proved natural gas and oil reserves. The decline in reserve quantities, assuming this decrease in gas price, would have the impact of increasing our unit of production amortization of the full cost pool. The unit of production rate for amortization is adjusted quarterly based on changes in reserve estimates. Hedging We use natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options and interest rate swaps to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil and in interest rates. Our policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings to minimize the risk of uncollectability. In recent years, we have hedged 60% to 80% of our annual production. The primary market risks related to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for natural gas and crude oil. However, the market price risk is offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related sale or purchase of the natural gas or sale of the oil that is hedged. Our derivative instruments are accounted for under FAS 133, as amended by FAS 138 and 149, and are recorded at fair value in our financial statements. We have established the fair value of derivative instruments using estimates determined by our counterparties, with such estimates evaluated internally using established index prices and other sources. These valuations are recognized as assets or liabilities in our balance sheet and, to the extent an open position is an effective cash flow hedge on equity production or interest rates, the offset is recorded in other comprehensive income. Results of settled commodity hedging transactions are reflected in natural gas and oil sales or in gas purchases. Results of settled interest rate hedges are reflected in interest expense. Any ineffective hedge, derivative not qualifying for accounting treatment as a hedge, or ineffective portion of a hedge is recognized immediately in earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded a gain of $19.1 million related to differential swaps which was partially offset by a $9.4 million loss 50 SWN Table of Contents related to the change in estimated ineffectiveness of our cash flow hedges. We recorded a loss in revenues of $2.6 million in 2004 and a gain of $0.6 million in 2003 related to the changes in ineffectiveness of our commodity hedges. Future market price volatility could create significant changes to the hedge positions recorded in our financial statements. We refer you to "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" in Item 7A of Part II of this Form 10 K for additional information regarding our hedging activities. Regulated Utility Operations Our utility operations are subject to the rate regulation and accounting requirements of the APSC. Allocations of costs and revenues to accounting periods for ratemaking and regulatory purposes may differ from those generally applied by non regulated operations. Such allocations to meet regulatory accounting requirements are considered generally accepted accounting principles for regulated utilities provided that there is a demonstrated ability to recover any deferred costs in future rates. During the ratemaking process, the regulatory commission may require a utility to defer recognition of certain costs to be recovered through rates over time as opposed to expensing such costs as incurred. This allows the utility to stabilize rates over time rather than passing such costs on to the customer for immediate recovery. This causes certain expenses to be deferred as a regulatory asset and amortized to expense as they are recovered through rates. The APSC has not required any unbundling of services, although large industrials are free to contract for their own gas supply. There are no pending regulations relating to unbundling of services; however, should such regulation be proposed and adopted, certain of these assets may no longer meet the criteria for deferred recognition and, accordingly, a write off of regulatory assets and stranded costs may be required. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We record our prepaid or accrued benefit cost, as well as our periodic benefit cost, for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans using measurement assumptions that we consider reasonable at the time of calculation (see Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion and disclosures regarding these benefit plans). Two of the assumptions that affect the amounts recorded are the discount rate, which estimates the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled, and the expected return on plan assets, which reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested. For the December 31, 2005 benefit obligation and the periodic benefit cost to be recorded in 2006, the discount rate assumed is 5.5%. For the 2006 periodic benefit cost, the expected return assumed is 8.25%. This compares to a discount rate of 6.0% and an expected return of 9.0% used in the prior year. Using the assumed rates discussed above, we recorded pension expense of $2.3 million in 2005 and $2.2 million in 2004 related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. We reflected a pension liability of $7.9 million at December 31, 2005 and $1.5 million at December 31, 2004. During 2005, we also funded $1.8 million to our pension plans. In 2006, we expect to fund $3.9 million to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Assuming a 1% change in the 2005 rates (lower discount rate and lower rate of return), we would have recorded pension expense of $3.4 million in 2005. Gas in Underground Storage We record our gas stored in inventory that is owned by the E&P segment at the lower of weighted average cost or market. Gas expected to be cycled within the next 12 months is recorded in current assets with the remaining stored gas reflected as a long term asset. The quantity and average cost of gas in storage was 8.5 Bcf at $3.78 per Mcf at December 31, 2005, compared to 9.3 Bcf at $3.49 per Mcf at December 31, 2004. The gas in inventory for the E&P segment is used primarily to supplement production in meeting the segments contractual commitments including delivery to customers of our gas distribution business, especially during periods of colder weather. As a result, demand fees paid by the gas distribution segment to the E&P segment, which are passed through to the utilitys customers, are a part of the realized price of the gas in storage. In determining the lower of cost or market for storage gas, we utilize the gas futures market in assessing the price we expect to be able to realize for our gas in inventory. A significant decline in the future market price of natural gas could result in us writing down our carrying cost of gas in storage. See further discussion of our significant accounting policies in Note 1 to the financial statements. 51 SWN Table of Contents FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION All statements, other than historical fact or present financial information, may be deemed to be forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

In addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with forward looking statements, risks, uncertainties and factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward looking statement include, but are not limited to: the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices for natural gas and oil; the timing and extent of our success in discovering, developing, producing and estimating reserves; the extent to which the Fayetteville Shale play can replicate the results of other productive shale gas plays; the potential for significant variability in reservoir characteristics of the Fayetteville Shale over such a large acreage position; the extent of our success in drilling and completing horizontal wells; our ability to determine the most effective and economic fracture stimulation for the Fayetteville Shale formation; our lack of experience owning and operating drilling rigs; our ability to fund our planned capital expenditures; our future property acquisition or divestiture activities; the effects of weather and regulation on our gas distribution segment; increased competition; the impact of federal, state and local government regulation; the financial impact of accounting regulations and critical accounting policies; changing market conditions and prices (including regional basis differentials); the comparative cost of alternative fuels; conditions in capital markets and changes in interest rates; the availability of oilfield personnel, services, drilling rigs and other equipment; and any other factors listed in the reports we have filed and may file with the SEC. We caution you that forward looking statements contained in this Form 10 K are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, incident to the exploration for and development, production and sale of natural gas and oil. These risks include, but are not limited to, commodity price volatility, third party interruption of sales to market, inflation, lack of availability of goods and services, environmental risks, drilling and other operating risks, regulatory changes, the uncertainty inherent in estimating proved natural gas and oil reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures and the other risks described in Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10 K. 52 SWN Table of Contents Estimates of our proved natural gas and oil reserves and the estimated future net revenues from such reserves are based upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC relating to natural gas and oil prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. The process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is complex. This process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. Therefore, these estimates are inherently imprecise. Actual future production, natural gas and oil prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable natural gas and oil reserves will most likely vary from those estimated. Such variances may be material. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves set forth in this Form 10 K. Our properties may also be susceptible to hydrocarbon drainage from production by other operators on adjacent properties. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing natural gas and oil prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. At December 31, 2005, approximately 27% of our estimated proved reserves were proved undeveloped and 5% were proved developed non producing. Proved undeveloped reserves and proved developed non producing reserves, by their nature, are less certain than proved developed producing reserves. Estimates of reserves in the non producing categories are nearly always based on volumetric calculations rather than the performance data used to estimate producing reserves. Recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. Recovery of proved developed non producing reserves requires capital expenditures to recomplete into the zones behind pipe and is subject to the risk of a successful recompletion. Production revenues from proved undeveloped and proved developed non producing reserves will not be realized, if at all, until sometime in the future. The reserve data assumes t hat we will make significant capital expenditures to develop our reserves. Although we have prepared estimates of our natural gas and oil reserves and the costs associated with these reserves in accordance with industry standards, we cannot assure you that the estimated costs are accurate, that development will occur as scheduled or that the actual results will be as estimated. You should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows referred to in this Form 10 K is the current fair value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. Any changes in consumption by gas purchasers or in governmental regulations or taxation could also affect actual future net cash flows. The timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of natural gas and oil properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves and their present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor, which is required by the SEC to be used in calculating discounted futur e net cash flows for reporting purposes, is not necessarily the most accurate discount factor for our company. Should one or more of the risks or uncertainties described above or elsewhere in this Form 10 K occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements. We specifically disclaim all responsibility to publicly update any information contained in a forward looking statement or any forward looking statement in its entirety and therefore disclaim any resulting liability for potentially related damages. All forward looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. 53 SWN Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from the volatility in commodity prices, basis differentials and interest rates, as well as credit risk concentrations. We use natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options and interest rate swaps to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil and in interest rates. Our Board of Directors has approved risk management policies and procedures to utilize financial products for the reduction of defined commodity price and interest rate risks. These policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings. Credit Risk Our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables and derivative contracts associated with commodities trading. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas. No single customer accounts for greater than 3% of accounts receivable at December 31, 2005. In addition, please see the discussion of credit risk associated with commodities trading below. Interest Rate Risk The following table provides information on our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The table presents our debt obligations, principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. At December 31, 2005, we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility. Our policy is to manage interest rates through use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. Interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate. Expected Maturity Date Fair Value 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total 12/31/05 ($ in millions) Fixed Rate $ $ $ $ $ 60.0 $ 40.0 $ 100.0 $ 105.4 Average Interest Rate 7.63% 7.21% 7.46% Commodities Risk We use over the counter natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options to hedge sales of our production, to hedge activity in our marketing segment and to hedge the purchase of gas in our utility segment against the inherent price risks of adverse price fluctuations or locational pricing differences between a published index and the NYMEX futures market. These swaps and options include (1) transactions in which one party will pay a fixed price (or variable price) for a notional quantity in exchange for receiving a variable price (or fixed price) based on a published index (referred to as price swaps), (2) transactions in which parties agree to pay a price based on two different indices (referred to as basis swaps), and (3) the purchase and sale of index related puts and calls (collars) that provide a floor price below which the counterparty pays (production hedge) or receives (gas purchase hedge) funds equal to the amount by which the p rice of the commodity is below the contracted floor, and a ceiling price above which we pay to (production hedge) or receive from (gas purchase hedge) the counterparty the amount by which the price of the commodity is above the contracted ceiling. The primary market risks relating to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for natural gas and crude oil. However, the market price risk is offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related sale or purchase of the natural gas or sale of the oil that is hedged. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss as a result of non performance by our counterparties. The counterparties are primarily major investment and commercial banks which management believes present minimal credit risks. The credit quality of each counterparty and the level of financial exposure we have to each counterparty are periodically reviewed to ensure limited credit risk exposure. The following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in commodity prices and that are used to hedge prices for gas and oil production, gas purchases and marketing volumes. The table presents the notional amount in Bcf and MBbls, the weighted average contract prices and the fair value by expected maturity dates. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of these financial instruments was a $153.2 million liability. 54 SWN Table of Contents Expected Maturity Date 2006 2007 2008 Production and Marketing Natural Gas Swaps with a fixed price receipt Contract volume (Bcf) 7.9 12.0 Weighted average price per Mcf $ 6.64 $ 6.66 $ Fair value (in millions) $ (32.1) $ (37.9) $ Price collars Contract volume (Bcf) 43.0 28.0 2.0 Weighted average floor price per Mcf $ 5.47 $ 6.64 $ 8.00 Fair value of floor (in millions) $ 1.6 $ 8.6 $ 1.5 Weighted average ceiling price per Mcf $ 10.13 $ 11.91 $ 19.40 Fair value of ceiling (in millions) $ (73.3) $ (34.4) $ (2.0) Swaps with a fixed price payment Contract volume (Bcf) 0.2 Weighted average price per Mcf $ 11.11 $ $ Fair value (in millions) $ 0.1 $ $ Oil Swaps with a fixed price receipt Contract volume (MBbls) 120 Weighted average price per Bbl $ 37.30 $ $ Fair value (in millions) $ (3.1) $ $ Natural Gas Purchases Swaps with a fixed price payment Contract volume (Bcf) 0.7 Weighted average price per Mcf $ 13.03 $ $ Fair value (in millions) $ (1.2) $ $ At December 31, 2005, the Company had outstanding fixed price basis differential swaps on 13.0 Bcf of 2006, 29.9 Bcf of 2007 and 2.0 Bcf of 2008 gas production that qualified for hedge accounting treatment. At December 31, 2005, the Company had outstanding fixed price basis differential swaps on 25.3 Bcf of 2006 and 10.0 Bcf of 2007 gas production that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded a gain of $19.1 million related to the differential swaps that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment which was partially offset by a $9.4 million loss related to the change in estimated ineffectiveness of our cash flow hedges. At December 31, 2004, the Company had outstanding natural gas price swaps on total notional volumes of 12.9 Bcf at a weighted average price of $5.11 per Mcf in 2005 and 5.0 Bcf at a weighted average price of $5.89 per Mcf in 2006. Outstanding oil price swaps at December 31, 2004 on 360 MBbls were yielding us an average price of $33.17 per barrel during 2005. At December 31, 2004, the Company also had outstanding natural gas price swaps on total notional gas purchase volumes of 2.9 Bcf in 2005 for which the Company paid an average fixed price of $6.54 per Mcf. At December 31, 2004, the Company had collars in place on 33.4 Bcf in 2005 and 22.0 Bcf in 2006 of gas production. The collars relating to 2005 production have a weighted average floor and ceiling price of $4.68 and $8.30 per Mcf, respectively. The collars relating to 2006 production have a weighted average floor and ceiling price of $4.64 and $8.69 per Mcf, respectively. Subsequent to December 31, 2005 and prior to February 20, 2006, we hedged 6.0 Bcf of 2008 gas production under costless collars with floor prices ranging from $7.00 to $9.00 per Mcf and ceiling prices ranging from $12.55 to $15.80 per Mcf. Additionally, we hedged the basis differential on the 6.0 Bcf of 2008 gas production. 55 SWN Table of Contents
