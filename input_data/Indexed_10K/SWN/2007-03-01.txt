ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This Form 10 K contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements for many reasons, including the risks described in Item 1A, Risk Factors in Part I and elsewhere in this annual report. You should read the following discussion with the Selected Financial Data and our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. Historical per share information provided for years prior to 2005, in Item 6. Selected Financial Data, financial statements, footnotes and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations has been adjusted to reflect the two for one stock splits effected on June 3, 2005 and November 17, 2005. OVERVIEW Southwestern Energy Company is an independent energy company primarily focused on natural gas. Our primary business is the exploration, development and production of natural gas and crude oil within the United States, with operations principally located in Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico. We are also focused on creating and capturing additional value at and beyond the wellhead through our established natural gas distribution and marketing businesses and our expanding gathering activities. Our marketing and our gas gathering businesses are collectively referred to as our Midstream Services. We operate principally in three segments: Exploration and Production (E&P), Midstream Services and Natural Gas Distribution. Our business strategy is focused on providing long term growth in the net asset value of our business, which we achieve in our E&P business through the drillbit. In our E&P business, we prepare economic analyses for each of our drilling and acquisition opportunities and rank them based upon the expected present value added for each dollar invested, which we refer to as PVI. The PVI of the future expected cash flows for each project is determined using a 10% discount rate. We target creating at least $1.30 of discounted pre tax PVI for each dollar we invest in our E&P projects. Our actual PVI results are utilized to help determine the allocation of our future capital investments. We derive the vast majority of our operating income and cash flow from the natural gas production of our E&P business and expect this to continue in the future. We expect that growth in our operating income and revenues will primarily depend on natural gas prices and our ability to increase our natural gas production. In recent years, there has been significant price volatility in natural gas and crude oil prices due to a variety of factors we cannot control or predict. These factors, which include weather conditions, political and economic events, and competition from other energy sources, impact supply and demand for natural gas, which determines the pricing. In addition, the price we realize for our gas production is affected by our hedging activities as well as locational differences in market prices. Our ability to increase our natural gas production is dependent upon our ability to economically find and produce natu ral gas, our ability to control costs and our ability to market natural gas on economically attractive terms to our customers. In 2006, our gas and oil production increased 19% to 72.3 Bcfe. Gas and oil production increased 13% to 61.0 Bcfe in 2005. The increase in 2006 production primarily resulted from an increase in production from our Fayetteville Shale play. We reported net income of $162.6 million in 2006, or $0.95 per share on a fully diluted basis, up 10% from the prior year. Net income in 2005 increased approximately 43% to $147.8 million, or $0.95 per share, compared to 2004. The increase in net income in 2006 was a result of increased production volumes in our E&P segment, a gain on the sale of our NOARK investment and decreased interest expense, partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses. The increase in net income in 2005 was a result of increased production volumes and higher realized natural gas and oil prices in our E&P segment. Our cash flow from operating activities increased 41% to $429.9 million in 2006, primarily due to increased production volumes in our E&P segment. Cash flow from operating activities in 2005 increased 28% to $304.5 million compared to 2004. Operating income for our E&P segment was $237.3 million in 2006, $234.8 million in 2005, and $164.6 mil lion in 2004. Operating income for our E&P segment increased marginally in 2006 as increased production volumes from our Fayetteville Shale play and East Texas were largely offset by increased operating costs and expenses. Operating income for our E&P segment increased in 2005 due to increased production volumes and higher realized prices. Operating income for our Midstream Services segment decreased 28% to $4.1 million in 2006 and increased 80% to $5.7 million in 2005, compared to prior years. Operating income for our Midstream Services segment decreased in 2006 as increased gathering revenues were more than offset by increased operating costs and expenses and a decrease in the margin generated by our marketing activities. Operating income for our Midstream Services segment increased in 2005 primarily due to favorable natural gas price opportunities along with increased volumes marketed. Operating income for our Natural Gas Distribution segment was $4.5 million in 2006, compared to $4.9 million in 2 005 and $8.5 million in 2004. The 38 SWN Table of Contents decrease in operating income for our Natural Gas Distribution segment in 2006 resulted primarily from warmer weather and increased operating costs and expenses, partially offset by increased rates implemented in October 2005. The decrease in operating income for our Natural Gas Distribution segment in 2005 resulted primarily from warmer weather and increased operating costs and expenses. Customer conservation in recent years has also impacted operating income for this segment. On May 2, 2006, we sold our 25% partnership interest in NOARK to Atlas Pipeline Partners, L.P., for $69.0 million. As part of the transaction, we assumed $39.0 million of debt obligations of NOARK Pipeline Finance, L.L.C., which we had previously guaranteed. We recognized a pre tax gain of $10.9 million ($6.7 million after tax) in the second quarter relating to the transaction. In our E&P segment, we achieved a reserve replacement ratio of 386% in 2006 at a finding and development cost of $2.75 per Mcfe, including reserve revisions, but excluding $93.6 million of capital invested in acquiring drilling rigs. Our year end reserves grew 24% to 1,026.3 Bcfe, up from 826.8 Bcfe at the end of 2005. Our results were primarily fueled by our Fayetteville Shale play in Arkansas. Our capital investments totaled $942.4 million in 2006, an increase of 95% compared to the prior year. Our 2005 capital investments were up 64% to $483.1 million. We invested $861.0 million in our E&P segment in 2006 (including $93.6 million invested in drilling rigs), compared to $451.3 million in 2005 and $282.0 million in 2004. Funds for our 2006 capital investments were provided by cash flow from operations, cash equivalents from our equity offering in 2005, $69.0 million of proceeds from the sale of our investment in NOARK and cash proceeds of $127.3 million from a sale/leaseback transaction to monetize our investment in 13 drilling rigs. As a result, our total debt to capitalization ratio increased slightly to 9% at December 31, 2006 from 8% at December 31, 2005. For 2007, our planned capital investments are $1.3 billion, an increase of 42% over 2006 capital spending. The capital investments for 2007 include $1.2 billion for our E&P segment, $84 million for our Midstream Services segment and $20 million for improvements to our utility system and other corporate purposes. The $1.2 billion of exploration and production investments includes $875 million for the development of our Fayetteville Shale play. We continue to be focused on our strategy of adding value through the drillbit, as approximately 82% of our 2007 E&P capital is allocated to drilling. In addition to the planned investments in the Fayetteville Shale play, our E&P investments in 2007 will be focused on our lower risk development drilling programs in East Texas and other conventional drilling in the Arkoma Basin. In 2007, we are targeting production to be approximately 105.0 Bcfe to 110.0 Bcfe, compared to 72.3 Bcfe in 2006, an increase of approximately 45% to 50%. We expect our capital investments in 2007 to be funded by cash flow from operations, cash equivalents at December 31, 2006, borrowings under our recently amended revolving credit facility and or funds raised in the public debt and equity markets. We expect growth in our reported production volumes and our oil and gas reserve quantities in 2007 given the current commodity price environment and our continued success in our Fayetteville Shale project. We also believe we will have access to sufficient capital to carry out our plans while maintaining an acceptable balance between debt and equity financing. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Exploration and Production Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Revenues (in thousands) $ 491,545 $ 403,234 $ 286,924 Operating income (in thousands) $ 237,307 $ 234,759 $ 164,585 Gas production (Bcf) 68.1 56.8 50.4 Oil production (MBbls) 698 705 618 Total production (Bcfe) 72.3 61.0 54.1 Average gas price per Mcf, including hedges $ 6.55 $ 6.51 $ 5.21 Average gas price per Mcf, excluding hedges $ 6.37 $ 7.73 $ 5.80 Average oil price per Bbl, including hedges $ 58.36 $ 42.62 $ 31.47 Average oil price per Bbl, excluding hedges $ 63.17 $ 54.37 $ 40.55 Average unit costs per Mcfe: Lease operating expenses $ 0.66 $ 0.48 $ 0.38 General & administrative expenses $ 0.58 $ 0.46 $ 0.36 Taxes other than income taxes $ 0.30 $ 0.37 $ 0.28 Full cost pool amortization $ 1.90 $ 1.42 $ 1.20 39 SWN Table of Contents Revenues, Operating Income and Production Revenues. Revenues for our E&P segment increased 22% in 2006 to $491.5 million due to a 20% increase in gas production volumes. Revenues increased 41% in 2005 to $403.2 million, primarily due to higher prices received for our natural gas and oil production and increased gas production. We expect our production volumes to continue to increase primarily due to the development of our Fayetteville Shale play in Arkansas. Gas and oil prices are difficult to predict and are subject to wide price fluctuations. As of February 23, 2007, we have hedged 79.5 Bcf, 57.0 Bcf and 8.0 Bcf of our 2007, 2008 and 2009 gas production, respectively, to help limit our exposure to price fluctuations. Revenues for 2006, 2005 and 2004 also include pre tax gains of $4.0 million, $3.1 million and $4.5 million, respectively, related to the sale of gas in storage inventory. Operating Income. Operating income from our E&P segment was $237.3 million in 2006, compared to $234.8 million in 2005, as revenues from increased production volumes were largely offset by increased operating costs and expenses. Operating income was up 43% in 2005 compared to 2004 due to an increase in revenue primarily driven by increased production volumes and higher realized prices. Production. Gas and oil production was up approximately 19% to 72.3 Bcfe in 2006 and up 13% to 61.0 Bcfe in 2005, compared to prior periods. The increase in 2006 was the result of a 10.0 Bcf increase in production from our Fayetteville Shale play and a 4.0 Bcf increase in our East Texas production, partially offset by declines in production from our Permian and Gulf Coast properties. Our production in the Fayetteville Shale play in 2006 was negatively impacted in the last part of the year by a shortage of pressure pumping equipment and completion crews in the play area. Additional equipment and crews are now available in the play area and are currently keeping pace with our drilling activity. The increase in 2005 production resulted from a 5.4 Bcfe increase in production from our Overton Field in East Texas and a 1.9 Bcfe increase in production from the Fayetteville Shale. Production during 2005 was reduced by the effect of the curtailment of a por tion of our Overton Field production due to repairs of a transmission line and by the effect of Hurricane Katrina. Combined, these events reduced our production by an estimated 1.0 Bcfe. Gas sales to unaffiliated purchasers were up 23% to 63.4 Bcf in 2006 and up 15% to 51.7 Bcf in 2005, compared to the prior years. Sales to unaffiliated purchasers are primarily made under contracts that reflect current short term prices and are subject to seasonal price swings. Intersegment sales to Arkansas Western decreased 7% to 4.7 Bcf in 2006 and decreased 6% to 5.1 Bcf in 2005. We expect future increases in demand for our gas production to come from sales to unaffiliated purchasers. We are unable to predict changes in the market demand and price for natural gas, including weather related changes affecting demand of both affiliated and unaffiliated customers for our production. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we completed the sale of our remaining South Louisiana properties to a private company for $12.7 million. These properties had proved reserves of 7.0 Bcfe and produced approximately 1.1 Bcfe annually. With this divestiture, we no longer have producing properties in the South Louisiana area. We are targeting 2007 gas and oil production of 105.0 to 110.0 Bcfe, an increase of 45% to 50% over our 2006 production. Based on early production histories and modeling and assuming continued positive results, approximately 45.0 to 50.0 Bcf of our 2007 targeted gas production is projected to come from our activities in the Fayetteville Shale play. Although we expect production volumes in 2007 to increase, we cannot guarantee our longer term success in discovering, developing, and producing reserves, including with respect to our Fayetteville Shale play. Our ability to discover, develop and produce reserves is dependent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the availability of capital, the timing and extent of changes in natural gas and oil prices and competition. There are also many risks inherent to the discovery, development and production of natural gas and oil. We refer you to Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10 K for a discussion of these risks and the impact they could have on our financial condition and results of operations. Commodity Prices We periodically enter into various hedging and other financial arrangements with respect to a portion of our projected natural gas and crude oil production in order to ensure certain desired levels of cash flow and to minimize the impact of price fluctuations, including fluctuations in locational market differentials (we refer you to Item 7A of this Form 10 K and Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion). The average price realized for our gas production, including the effects of hedges, increased slightly to $6.55 per Mcf in 2006 and increased 25% to $6.51 per Mcf in 2005. The changes in the average price realized primarily reflect changes in average annual spot market prices and the effects of our price hedging activities. Our hedging activities increased the average gas price $0.18 per Mcf in 2006, compared to reductions of $1.22 per Mcf in 2005 and $0.59 per Mcf in 2004. In recent years, locational differences in marke t prices for natural gas have been wider than historically experienced. Disregarding the impact of hedges, historically 40 SWN Table of Contents the average price received for our gas production was approximately $0.30 to $0.50 per Mcf lower than average NYMEX spot market prices due to the locational market differentials. However, during both 2006 and 2005, widening market differentials caused the difference in our average price received for our gas production to be approximately $0.90 per Mcf lower than spot market prices. Assuming a NYMEX commodity price for 2007 of $7.00 per Mcf of gas, our differential for the average price received for our gas production is expected to be approximately $0.65 to $0.70 per Mcf below the NYMEX Henry Hub index price, including the impact of our basis hedges. As of December 31, 2006, we have financially protected future gas production volumes of 64.3 Bcf in 2007 and 38.1 Bcf in 2008 from the impact of widening basis differentials through our hedging activities and sales arrangements. In addition to the basis hedges discussed above, at December 31, 2006, we had NYMEX commodity price hedges in place on 65.0 Bcf of 2007 and 35.0 Bcf of 2008 expected future gas production. Subsequent to December 31, 2006 and prior to February 23, 2007, we hedged 12.5 Bcf of 2007, 11.0 Bcf of 2008 and 4.0 Bcf of 2009 gas production under fixed price swaps with a sales price ranging from $7.29 to $8.62. Additionally, we hedged 2.0 Bcf of 2007, 11.0 Bcf of 2008 and 4.0 Bcf of 2009 gas production under costless collars with floor prices ranging from $7.25 to $8.50 per Mcf and ceiling prices ranging from $9.07 to $10.95 per Mcf. As of February 19, 2007, we have hedged approximately 75% of our 2007 anticipated gas production level. We realized an average price of $58.36 per barrel, including the effects of hedges, for our oil production for the year ended December 31, 2006, up approximately 37% from the prior year. The 2005 realized average price of $42.62 per barrel, including the effects of hedges, for our oil production was up 35% from 2004. The average price we received for our oil production in 2006, 2005 and 2004 was reduced by $4.81, $11.75 and $9.08 per barrel, respectively, due to the effects of our hedging activities. Assuming a NYMEX commodity price of $60.00 per barrel of oil for 2007, we expect the average price received for our oil production during 2007 to be approximately $1.00 per barrel lower than average spot market prices, as market differentials reduce the average prices received. Operating Costs and Expenses Lease operating expenses per Mcfe for the E&P segment were $0.66 in 2006, compared to $0.48 in 2005 and $0.38 in 2004. Lease operating expenses per unit of production increased in 2006 due primarily to increases in gathering and other costs related to our operations in the Fayetteville Shale play. We expect our per unit operating cost for this segment to range between $0.82 and $0.87 per Mcfe in 2007 due to increased production volumes from the Fayetteville Shale play. Additionally, inflationary pressures continue to have an impact in all of our operating areas. General and administrative expenses per Mcfe for this segment were $0.58 in 2006, up from $0.46 in 2005 and $0.36 in 2004. The increases in general and administrative costs per Mcfe in 2006 and 2005 were due primarily to increased payroll and related costs associated with the expansion of our E&P operations due to the Fayetteville Shale play and to increased incentive compensation costs. We added 494 new employees during 2006, most of which were hired in our E&P segment, and we expect to hire an additional 171 employees in 2007. Approximately 300 of the total new hires during 2006 were employed by our drilling company. We expect our cost per unit for general and administrative expenses to decline in 2007 and to range between $0.41 and $0.46 per Mcfe. The expected decrease in per unit costs is due to increased production volumes from our Fayetteville Shale play and a reduced rate of expansion in our E&P workforce. Fu ture changes in our general and administrative expenses for this segment are primarily dependent upon our salary costs, level of pension expense, stock based compensation expensing under Statement on Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R Share Based Payment (FAS 123R) and the amount of incentive compensation paid to our employees. For eligible employees, a portion of incentive compensation is based on the achievement of certain operating and performance results, including targeted cash flow, production, proved reserve additions, present value added for each dollar of capital invested, and lease operating expenses and general and administrative expenses per unit of production, while another portion is discretionary based upon an employees performance. Additional discretionary awards may also be awarded under the incentive compensation plan. See Critical Accounting Policies below for further discussion of pension expense, and Adoption of Accounting Principles below f or further discussion of stock based compensation expensing under FAS 123R. Our full cost pool amortization rate averaged $1.90 per Mcfe for 2006, $1.42 per Mcfe for 2005 and $1.20 per Mcfe for 2004. The amortization rate is impacted by reserve additions and the costs associated with those additions, revisions of previous reserve estimates due to both price and well performance, write downs that result from full cost ceiling tests and the level of unevaluated costs excluded from amortization. We cannot predict our future full cost pool amortization rate with accuracy due to the variability of each of the factors discussed above, as well as the uncertainty of the amount of future reserves attributed to our Fayetteville Shale play. Unevaluated costs excluded from amortization were 41 SWN Table of Contents $166.8 million at the end of 2006, compared to $122.3 million at the end of 2005 and $47.2 million at the end of 2004. The increase in unevaluated costs since December 31, 2004 resulted primarily from an increase in our undeveloped leasehold acreage related to our Fayetteville Shale play and increased drilling activity. We utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to the exploration, development and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves. Under this method, all such costs (productive and nonproductive), including salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities, are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method. These capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test that limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved gas and oil reserves discounted at 10 percent (standardized measure) plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties. Any costs in excess of the ceiling are written off as a non cash expense. The expense may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling. Full cost companie s must use the prices in effect at the end of each accounting quarter, including the impact of derivatives qualifying as hedges, to calculate the ceiling value of their reserves. However, commodity price increases subsequent to the end of a reporting period but prior to the release of periodic reports may be utilized to calculate the ceiling value of reserves. At December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, our unamortized costs of natural gas and oil properties did not exceed this ceiling amount. At December 31, 2006, our standardized measure was calculated based upon quoted market prices of $5.64 per Mcf for Henry Hub gas and $57.25 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil, adjusted for market differentials, and included approximately $135.2 million related to the positive effects of future cash flow hedges of gas production. At December 31, 2005, our standardized measure was calculated based upon quoted market prices of $10.08 per Mcf for Henry Hub gas and $61.04 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil, a nd at December 31, 2004, our standardized measure was calculated based upon quoted market prices of $6.18 per Mcf for Henry Hub gas and $43.45 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil. A decline in natural gas and oil prices from year end 2006 levels or other factors, without other mitigating circumstances, could cause a future write down of capitalized costs and a non cash charge against future earnings. Inflation impacts our E&P operations by generally increasing our operating costs and the costs of our capital additions. The effects of inflation on our operations prior to 2000 were minimal due to low inflation rates. However, since 2001, as commodity prices have increased, the impact of inflation has intensified in our E&P segment as shortages in drilling rigs, third party services and qualified labor have risen due to increased activity levels in the natural gas and oil industry. This impact will continue to increase to the extent commodity prices remain high or further increase. We have endeavored to mitigate rising costs by obtaining vendor pricing commitments for multiple projects and by offering performance bonuses related to increased economic efficiencies. Taxes other than income taxes per Mcfe were $0.30 in 2006, $0.37 in 2005 and $0.28 in 2004, and vary from year to year primarily due to changes in severance and ad valorem taxes that result from the fluctuations in commodity prices. The timing and amount of production and reserve additions attributed to our Fayetteville Shale play could have a material impact on our per unit costs; if production or reserves additions are lower than projected, our per unit costs would increase. Midstream Services Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Revenues (in millions) $ 475.2 $ 459.9 $ 315.0 Gas purchases (in millions) $ 458.9 $ 451.1 $ 310.7 Operating costs and expenses (in millions) $ 12.2 $ 3.1 $ 1.1 Operating income (in millions) $ 4.1 $ 5.7 $ 3.2 Gas volumes marketed (Bcf) 72.7 61.9 57.0 Revenues from our Midstream Services segment were up 3% in 2006 and up 46% in 2005, as compared to prior years. The increase in revenues in 2006 resulted from increased marketing and gathering activities. The increase in 2005 revenues was primarily due to an increase in natural gas commodity prices. Increases and decreases in marketing revenues due to changes in commodity prices are largely offset by corresponding changes in gas purchase expense. Midstream Services had gathering revenues of $7.9 million in 2006, related to its gathering systems in Arkansas, compared to $1.0 million in 2005. Gathering revenues and expenses for this segment are expected to continue to grow in the future as reserves related to our Fayetteville Shale play are developed and production increases. Operating income from our Midstream Services segment decreased 28% in 2006 and increased 80% in 2005. The decrease in 2006 was due to increased operating co sts and expenses that resulted from increased staffing and other costs associated with our growing gathering activities, and a decrease in the margin generated by our marketing activities caused in part by increased volatility of locational market differentials in our core operating areas. Operating income from natural gas marketing 42 SWN Table of Contents activities fluctuates depending on the margin we are able to generate between the purchase of the commodity and the ultimate disposition of the commodity. In 2005, we were able to generate higher margins on our marketing efforts. We marketed 72.7 Bcf in 2006, compared to 61.9 Bcf in 2005 and 57.0 Bcf in 2004. The increase in volumes marketed in 2006 and 2005 resulted from marketing our increased production volumes, largely related to our Fayetteville Shale play and our Overton Field in East Texas. Additionally in 2006, volumes marketed for third parties increased due to production growth in areas where we have historically provided marketing services to other working interest owners. Of the total volumes marketed, production from our E&P subsidiaries accounted for 72% in 2006, 76% in 2005 and 77% in 2004. We enter into hedging activities from time to time with respect to our gas marketing activities to prov ide margin protection. We refer you to Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information. On April 10, 2006, our Midstream Services unit entered into a three year firm transportation agreement with Ozark Gas Transmission System to transport volumes increasing to 175,000 MMBtu per day in the later stages of the contract. On August 22, 2006, we amended the agreement to increase the maximum volumes transported from 175,000 MMBtu per day to 220,000 MMBtu per day in the later stages of the contract. Additionally, on January 25, 2007, we entered into a separate two year firm transportation agreement with Ozark Gas Transmission System to transport volumes of 50,000 MMBtu per day. On December 15, 2006, one of our Midstream Services subsidiaries entered into a precedent agreement pursuant to which we will contract for firm gas transportation services on two newly proposed pipeline laterals and related facilities of Texas Gas Transmission, LLC (Texas Gas), a subsidiary of Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP. Depending on regulatory approvals, th e expected in service date for both laterals is January 1, 2009. See Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments below for further discussion. Over the next several years, we expect our gathering revenues and operating expenses to increase significantly as our E&P segment grows its production volumes from the development of our Fayetteville Shale play. Natural Gas Distribution Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 ($ in thousands except for per Mcf amounts) Revenues $ 172,207 $ 178,482 $ 152,449 Gas purchases $ 112,922 $ 120,852 $ 97,274 Operating costs and expenses $ 54,811 $ 52,719 $ 46,659 Operating income $ 4,474 $ 4,911 $ 8,516 Deliveries (Bcf) Sales and end use and off system transportation 21.9 23.2 25.0 Sales customers at year end 151,003 147,820 144,612 Average sales rate per Mcf $ 12.30 $ 11.85 $ 9.39 Heating weather degree days 3,413 3,744 3,678 Percent of normal 83% 91% 90% Revenues and Operating Income Gas distribution revenues fluctuate due to the effects of warm weather on demand for natural gas and the pass through of gas supply cost changes. Because of the corresponding changes in purchased gas costs, the revenue effect of the pass through of gas cost changes has not materially affected operating income. Revenues for 2006 decreased 4% to $172.2 million and revenues for 2005 increased 17% to $178.5 million. The decrease in 2006 gas distribution revenues was primarily due to lower sales volumes as a result of warmer weather. The increase in 2005 gas distribution revenues was primarily due to higher average sales rates as a result of higher gas prices and the effects of a $4.6 million annual rate increase implemented in October 2005. Operating income for our Natural Gas Distribution segment decreased 9% in 2006 and decreased 42% in 2005. The decrease in 2006 operating income resulted primarily from warmer weather and increased operating costs and expenses partially offset by the effects of the rate increase implemented in October 2005. The decrease in 2005 operating income for this segment resulted primarily from increased operating costs and expenses. Gas distribution revenues in future years will be impacted by the utilitys gas purchase costs, customer growth, usage per customer and rate increases allowed by the Arkansas Public Service Commission, or APSC. Weather during 2006 in the utilitys service territory was 17% warmer than normal and 8% warmer than the prior year. Weather during 2005 in the utilitys service territory was 9% warmer than normal and 1% colder than the prior year. 43 SWN Table of Contents Deliveries and Rates In 2006, Arkansas Western sold 13.4 Bcf to its customers at an average rate of $12.30 per Mcf, compared to 14.4 Bcf at $11.85 per Mcf in 2005 and 15.5 Bcf at $9.39 per Mcf in 2004. Additionally, Arkansas Western transported 8.4 Bcf in 2006, compared to 8.8 Bcf in 2005 and 8.5 Bcf in 2004 for its end use customers. The decreases in volumes sold in 2006 and 2005 primarily resulted from warmer than normal weather and customer conservation brought about by high gas prices in recent years. Future volumes delivered to customers will be impacted by customer growth, weather and the effect that gas prices will continue to have on customer conservation. Arkansas Western has a transportation contract with Ozark Gas Transmission System for approximately 66,900 MMBtu per day of firm capacity that expires in 2014. Deliveries are made by the pipeline to portions of Arkansas Westerns distribution systems and to the interstate pipelines with which it interconnects. Operating Costs and Expenses The changes in purchased gas costs for the Natural Gas Distribution segment reflect volumes purchased, prices paid for supplies and the mix of purchases from various gas supply contracts (base load, swing and no notice). Operating costs and expenses, net of purchased gas costs, increased in 2006 to $54.8 million from $52.7 million in 2005. The increase was primarily due to an increase in general and administrative expenses due to increased salaries and incentive compensation costs. Operating costs and expenses for 2005, net of purchased gas costs, increased to $52.7 million from $46.7 million in 2004 due primarily to a $2.8 million increase in general and administrative expenses due to increased salaries and incentive compensation costs, and a $1.3 million increase in transmission expense as a result of higher fuel costs. Future changes in our general and administrative expenses for this segment are primarily dependent upon our salary costs, level of pens ion expense, stock based compensation expensing under FAS 123R and the amount of incentive compensation paid to our employees. See Critical Accounting Policies and Adoption of Accounting Principles below for further discussion of pension expense and stock based compensation expensing, respectively. Inflation impacts our Natural Gas Distribution segment by generally increasing our operating costs and the costs of our capital additions. The effects of inflation on the utilitys operations in recent years have been minimal due to low inflation rates. Additionally, delays inherent in the rate making process prevent us from obtaining immediate recovery of increased operating costs of our Natural Gas Distribution segment. Regulatory Matters Arkansas Westerns rates and operations are regulated by the APSC and it operates through municipal franchises that are perpetual by virtue of state law. These franchises, however, may not be exclusive within a geographic area. Although its rates for gas delivered to its retail customers are not regulated by the FERC, its transmission and gathering pipeline systems are subject to the FERCs regulations concerning open access transportation. In October 2005, in response to Arkansas Westerns request for a $9.7 million rate increase, the APSC approved a rate increase totaling $4.6 million annually, exclusive of costs to be recovered through Arkansas Westerns purchase gas adjustment clause. The rate increase was effective for deliveries made to customers on or after October 31, 2005. The request relating to the October 2005 increase assumed a rate of return of 11.5% and a capital structure of 50% debt and 50% equity. The APSC order provided for an allowed return on equity of 9.7% and an assumed capital structure of 54% debt and 46% equity. In its order approving the rate increase, the APSC stated that it would consider in future generic proceedings, certain regulatory changes including a streamlined rate case process, a revenue decoupling mechanism designed to encourage efficiency and conservation, and a performance based methodology designed to allow a var iable return on equity adjustment within a reasonable range. On September 25, 2006, our Natural Gas Distribution segment filed with the APSC an application to modify its general rates and charges. The application seeks to increase annual operating revenues by $13.1 million, a 6.8% annual increase. The APSC has 10 months to render a decision on the application. Any increase approved is expected to take effect in July 2007. On January 12, 2006, the APSC initiated a notice of inquiry regarding a rulemaking for developing and implementing energy efficiency programs. Following a collaborative process, the APSC issued energy efficiency rules on January 11, 2007. These rules require all gas and electric utilities, excluding electric cooperatives, to file energy efficiency plans and programs with the APSC. Quick start or pilot programs are to be implemented by late 2007, and comprehensive 44 SWN Table of Contents programs are to be implemented in 2009. Utilities will recover the costs of these programs from their customers. The APSC will address lost revenues associated with these programs in the utilities future rate cases. We have not yet determined the effect of these rules on our future operations and have not included any revenue loss in our pending rate case. On December 19, 2006, the APSC issued affiliate transactions rules. In January 2007, Arkansas Western and other utilities requested a rehearing of these rules. On February 16, 2007, the APSC issued an order granting a rehearing and staying the implementation of the affiliate transaction rules pending further review. A public hearing on this issue is scheduled for March 27, 2007. Arkansas Western anticipates that these rules, if not modified on rehearing, will increase its regulatory costs and overall cost of service. Rate increase requests, which may be filed in the future, will depend on APSC policies, customer growth, increases in operating expenses and additional investment in property, plant and equipment. Transportation On May 2, 2006, we sold our 25% partnership interest in NOARK Pipeline System, Limited Partnership (NOARK) to Atlas Pipeline Partners, L.P. for $69.0 million and recognized a pre tax gain of approximately $10.9 million ($6.7 million after tax) in the second quarter relating to the transaction. We recorded pre tax income from operations related to our investment in NOARK of $0.9 million in 2006, compared to $1.6 million in 2005 and a pre tax loss of $0.4 million in 2004. Income from operations and the gain on the sale in the second quarter of 2006 were recorded in other income in our statements of operations. We refer you to Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion. Other Revenues In 2006, 2005 and 2004, other revenues included pre tax gains of $4.0 million, $3.1 million and $4.5 million, respectively, related to the sale of gas in storage inventory. Other revenues for 2005 and 2004 also included pre tax gains of $0.4 million and $5.8 million, respectively, related to sales of undeveloped real estate. Interest Expense and Interest Income Interest costs, net of capitalization, were down 95% to $0.7 million in 2006 and down 11% to $15.0 million in 2005, both as compared to prior years. Interest expense decreased in 2006 due to decreased debt levels resulting from our equity offering in September 2005 and increased capitalized interest. Interest expense decreased in 2005 due primarily to increased capitalized interest. We refer you to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Requirements and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt. Interest capitalized increased to $11.8 million in 2006, up from $6.0 million in 2005 and $2.8 million in 2004. Changes in capitalized interest are primarily due to the level of investment in unevaluated properties and the capitalization of interest during the construction phase of our drilling rigs in our E&P segment. Costs excluded from amortization in the E&P segment increased to $166.8 million at December 31, 2006, compared to $122.3 million at December 31, 2005. Total capital investments for our E&P segment were $861.0 million in 2006, up from $451.3 million in 2005. During 2006 and 2005, we earned interest income of $6.3 million and $3.4 million, respectively, related to our cash investments. These amounts are recorded in other income. We did not have any interest income in 2004. Income Taxes In 2006, the state of Texas enacted legislation to replace its method of taxing businesses from a capital based tax to a tax on modified gross revenue. Although this change in taxation method was not effective until 2007, the provisions of Statement on Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (FAS 109), required us to record in 2006 the impact that this change has on our liability for deferred taxes. As a result, we recorded additional income tax expense of $1.8 million, net of federal income tax effect, in the second quarter of 2006. This one time adjustment increased our effective tax rate to approximately 37.9% for 2006, compared to 36.9% in 2005, and 36.6% in 2004. Other than the change resulting from Texas taxes discussed above, the changes in the provision for deferred income taxes recorded each period result primarily from the level of income before income taxes, adjusted for perman ent differences. 45 SWN Table of Contents Pension Expense We recorded an expense of $4.0 million in 2006 for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans, compared to $2.3 million in 2005 and $2.2 million in 2004. The amount of pension expense recorded is determined by actuarial calculations and is also impacted by the funded status of our plans. During 2006, $3.4 million was contributed to our pension plans and $0.4 million was contributed to our other postretirement plans. As of December 31, 2006, we have adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, or FAS 158. See Adoption of Accounting Principles below and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of FAS 158. For further discussion of our pension plans, we refer you to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements and Critical Accounting Policies below. Adoption of Accounting Principles In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, or FAS 157. This Statement defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosure related to the use of fair value measures in financial statements. The Statement is to be effective for our financial statements issued in 2008; however, earlier application is encouraged. We are currently evaluating the timing of adoption and the impact that adoption might have on our financial position or results of operations. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we adopted FAS 158 which requires us to recognize the funded status of each defined pension benefit plan, retiree health care and other postretirement benefit plans and post employment benefit plans on the balance sheet. Each over funded plan is recognized as an asset and each under funded plan is recognized as a liability. The initial impact of the adoption of the standard as well as subsequent changes in the funded status is recognized as a component of accumulated comprehensive loss in the statement of stockholders equity. Additional minimum pension liabilities and related intangible assets are also derecognized upon adoption of the new standard. FAS 158 requires initial application for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006. As a result of the application of FAS 158, we have recorded a liability of $13.8 million on our balance sheet in order to recognize the funded status of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. We have also recorded our unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized gains and losses from changes in plan assumptions as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). See Note 4 of our financial statements for further information on the impact of this standard on our financial statements. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, or FIN 48, to clarify certain aspects of accounting for uncertain tax positions, including issues related to the recognition and measurement of those tax positions. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this interpretation; however, we do not expect any material impacts on our results of operations and financial condition. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, or SAB 108. Due to diversity in practice among registrants, SAB 108 expresses SEC staff views regarding the process by which misstatements in financial statements are evaluated for purposes of determining whether financial statement restatement is necessary. SAB 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 had no impact on our financial position or our reported results from operations. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We depend primarily on internally generated funds, our unsecured revolving credit facility (discussed below under Financing Requirements) and funds accessed through public debt and equity markets as our primary sources of liquidity. In February 2007, we amended our revolving credit facility and may now borrow up to $750 million from time to time. The amount available under our revolving credit facility may be increased to $1 billion at any time upon our agreement with our existing or additional lenders. As of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, we had no indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility. During 2007, we expect to draw on a portion of the funds available under our credit facility to fund our planned capital investments (discussed below under Capital Investments), which are expected to exceed the net cash generated by our operations and cash investments that we had at December 31, 2006 that related to the proceeds from our December 2006 sale/leaseback transaction, as discussed below under Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. 46 SWN Table of Contents In September 2005, we consummated an underwritten offering of 9,775,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. The net proceeds of the offering were used to pay down outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility, to pay our 6.70% Notes due December 2005 and to fund capital investments. Net cash provided by operating activities increased 41% to $429.9 million in 2006, compared to a 28% increase in 2005 to $304.5 million. The primary components of cash generated from operations are net income, depreciation, depletion and amortization, the provision for deferred income taxes and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash from operating activities increased in 2006 and 2005 due mainly to increased net income, adjusted for increased depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and increased deferred income taxes generated by our E&P segment. Net cash from operating activities provided 46% of our cash requirements for capital investments in 2006, 63% in 2005 and 81% in 2004. At December 31, 2006, our capital structure consisted of 9% debt and 91% equity. We believe that our operating cash flow, cash investments at December 31, 2006 and borrowings under our credit facility will be adequate to meet our capital and operating requirements for 2007, however, we may also raise funds in the public debt and equity markets to meet a portion of our cash requirements. Our cash flow from operating activities is highly dependent upon the market prices that we receive for our gas and oil production. The price received for our production is also influenced by our commodity hedging activities, as more fully discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements included in this Form 10 K and Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Natural gas and oil prices are subject to wide fluctuations. As a result, we are unable to forecast with certainty our future level of cash flow from operations. We adjust our discretionary uses of cash dependent upon cash flow available. Capital Investments Our capital investments increased 95% to $942.4 million in 2006 and 64% to $483.1 million in 2005. Capital investments included $88.9 million in 2006, $28.1 million in 2005 and $3.9 million in 2004 related to accrued expenditures. Capital investments for 2006 in our E&P Segment included $767.4 million related to our primary business activities and $93.6 million related to the purchase of drilling rigs and related equipment which were sold in December 2006 as part of a sale and leaseback transaction. Our capital investments in 2005 also included $35.1 million related to construction payments on the rigs that were sold in 2006. Our E&P segment expenditures included $8.6 million for the acquisition of interests in natural gas and oil producing properties in 2006 and $14.2 million in 2004. 2006 2005 2004 (in thousands) Exploration and production Exploration and development $ 767,400 $ 416,161 $ 281,988 Drilling rigs 93,641 35,128 861,041 451,289 281,988 Midstream services 48,660 15,840 Natural gas distribution 11,232 10,908 7,298 Other 21,474 5,014 5,704 $ 942,407 $ 483,051 $ 294,990 Our capital investments for 2007 are planned to be $1,341 million, consisting of $1,237 million for exploration and production, $84 million for midstream services, and $20 million for gas distribution system improvements and general purposes. We expect to allocate $875 million of our 2007 E&P capital to our Fayetteville Shale play. Our planned level of capital investments in 2007 will allow us to significantly accelerate our drilling activity in the Fayetteville Shale, continue the development of our Overton Field and Angelina River Trend properties in East Texas, continue our conventional drilling in the Arkoma Basin, maintain our present markets, explore and develop other existing gas and oil properties, generate new drilling prospects, and provide for improvements necessary due to normal customer growth in our Natural Gas Distribution segment. As discussed above, our 2007 capital investment program is expected to be fund ed through cash flow from operations, cash investments at December 31, 2006, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We may also raise funds in the public debt and equity markets to fund a portion of our capital investment program. We may adjust the level of 2007 capital investments dependent upon our level of cash flow generated from operations and our ability to borrow under our credit facility. 47 SWN Table of Contents Financing Requirements Our total debt outstanding was $137.8 million at December 31, 2006 and $100.0 million at December 31, 2005. Our revolving credit facility was amended in February 2007 increasing our borrowing capacity to $750 million, with an accordion feature for an additional $250 million, lowering our borrowing cost and extending the maturity date to February 2012. At December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, we had no outstanding debt under our revolving credit facility. The interest rate on the facility is calculated based upon our public debt rating and is currently 87.5 basis points over LIBOR. The Credit Facility is guaranteed by our subsidiaries, Southwestern Energy Production Company, SEECO, Inc. and Southwestern Energy Services Company. The Credit Facility requires additional subsidiary guarantors if certain guaranty coverage levels are not satisfied. Our publicly traded notes were downgraded on August 1, 2006 by Standard and Poors to BB+ with a stable out look from BBB with a negative outlook. We have a Corporate Family Rating of Ba2 by Moodys, and our publicly traded notes were rated Ba3 by Moodys under Moodys Loss Given Default Assessment on September 19, 2006. Any future downgrades in our public debt ratings could increase our cost of funds under the credit facility. We do not expect our current ratings to impact our ability to obtain acceptable financing terms if we elect to access the public debt market in the future. Our revolving credit facility contains covenants which impose certain restrictions on us. Under the credit agreement, we may not issue total debt in excess of 60% of our total capital, must maintain a certain level of stockholders equity and must maintain a ratio of EBITDA to interest expense of 3.5 or above. Additionally, there are certain limitations on the amount of indebtedness that may be incurred by our subsidiaries. We were in compliance with all of the covenants of our credit agreement at December 31, 2006. Although we do not anticipate any violations of our financial covenants, our ability to comply with those covenants is dependent upon the success of our exploration and development program and upon factors beyond our control, such as the market prices for natural gas and oil. If we are unable to borrow under our credit facility, we would have to decrease our capital expenditure plans. At December 31, 2006, our capital structure consisted of 9% debt and 91% equity, with a ratio of EBITDA to interest expense of 610.5. Stockholders equity in the December 31, 2006 balance sheet includes an accumulated other comprehensive gain of $41.4 million related to our hedging activities that is required to be recorded under the provisions of Statement on Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (FAS 133), and a loss of $9.9 million related to changes in our pension liability and the adoption FAS 158. The amount recorded for FAS 133 is based on current market values of our hedges at December 31, 2006, and does not necessarily reflect the value that we will receive or pay when the hedges ultimately are settled, nor does it take into account revenues to be received associated with the physical delivery of sales volumes hedged. Our credit facilitys financial covenants wit h respect to capitalization percentages exclude the effects of non cash entries that result from FAS 133 and FAS 158 and the non cash impact of any full cost ceiling write downs. Our capital structure at December 31, 2006 would remain at 9% debt and 91% equity without consideration of the accumulated other comprehensive gain and loss related to FAS 133 and FAS 158. As part of our strategy to ensure a certain level of cash flow to fund our operations, we have hedged approximately 75% of our expected 2007 gas production. The amount of long term debt we incur will be dependent upon commodity prices and our capital expenditure plans. If commodity prices remain at or near their current levels throughout 2007, our capital expenditure plans do not change and we do not issue equity, we will increase our long term debt in 2007 by approximately $700 to $750 million. If commodity prices significantly decrease, we may decrease and or reallocate our planned capital investments. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements On December 29, 2006, we sold 13 of our existing drilling rigs and assigned our right to purchase two other drilling rigs to be delivered and related equipment to various financial institutions and leased the rigs from the buyers for an initial term of eight years from January 1, 2007 with aggregate rental payments of $19.6 million annually. We received proceeds of $127.3 million. This transaction was recorded as a sale and operating leaseback with an aggregate deferred gain of $7.4 million on the sale which will be amortized against the lease payments over the lease term. Subject to certain conditions, we have options to purchase the rigs and related equipment from the lessors at the end of the 84th month of the lease term at an agreed upon price or at the end of the lease term for its then fair market value. Additionally, we have the option to renew the lease for a negotiated renewal term at a periodic rental equal to the fair market re ntal value of the rigs as determined at the time of renewal. In accordance with our accounting procedures, the portion of the lease payments that represent drilling costs for our working interest in wells are capitalized to the full cost pool. On May 2, 2006, we sold our 25% partnership interest in NOARK to Atlas Pipeline Partners, L.P. for $69.0 million. As part of the transaction, we assumed and recorded $39.0 million of debt obligations of NOARK Pipeline 48 SWN Table of Contents Finance, L.L.C., which we had previously guaranteed as part of the financing of NOARK. At December 31, 2006, the balance of these debt obligations was $37.8 million. We did not advance funds to NOARK in 2006 or 2005, and we did not derive any liquidity, capital resources, market risk support or credit risk support from our investment in NOARK. Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments We have various contractual obligations in the normal course of our operations and financing activities. Significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2006 were as follows: Contractual Obligations: Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years More than 5 Years (in thousands) Long term debt (1) $ 137,800 $ 1,200 $ 62,400 $ 2,400 $ 71,800 Interest on senior notes (2) 67,353 10,140 16,986 10,530 29,697 Operating leases (3) 21,475 4,905 8,588 5,234 2,748 Unconditional purchase obligations (4) Operating agreements (5) 127,014 61,928 60,766 4,320 Rental compression (6) 90,517 18,046 37,359 28,110 7,002 Demand charges (7) 125,225 21,663 41,796 30,085 31,681 Rig Leases (8) 156,671 19,584 39,168 39,168 58,751 Other obligations (9) 22,522 21,790 732 $ 748,577 $ 159,256 $ 267,795 $ 119,847 $ 201,679 (1) Debt includes $37.8 million of 7.15% Notes due 2018 and requires semi annual principal payments of $0.6 million. (2) Interest on the senior notes includes interest through 2009 on the $60 million notes that are due in 2027 and putable at the holders option in 2009. (3) We lease certain office space and equipment under non cancelable operating leases expiring through 2013. (4) Our Natural Gas Distribution segment has volumetric commitments for the purchase of gas under non cancelable competitive bid packages and non cancelable wellhead contracts. Volumetric purchase commitments at December 31, 2006 totaled 0.7 Bcf, comprised of 0.4 Bcf in less than one year, 0.2 Bcf in one to three years and 0.1 Bcf in three to five years. Our volumetric purchase commitments are priced primarily at regional gas indices set at the first of each future month. These costs are recoverable from the utilitys end use customers. (5) Our E&P segment has commitments for up to $100.8 million in termination fees related to rig operator agreements and up to $3.7 million in termination fees related to rig servicing agreements in the event that the agreements are terminated. Additionally, our E&P segment has secured rig moving services by committing monthly take or pay amounts of $938,000, expiring in December 2008. (6) Our E&P and Midstream Services segments have commitments for approximately $90.5 million of compressor rental fees associated primarily with our Fayetteville Shale play and our Overton operations. (7) Our Midstream Services segment has commitments for approximately $42.0 million of demand transportation charges related to the Fayetteville Shale play. Our Natural Gas Distribution segment has commitments for approximately $80.8 million of demand charges on non cancelable firm gas purchase and firm transportation agreements. These costs are recoverable from the utilitys end use customers. Our E&P segment has commitments for approximately $2.4 million of demand transportation charges. (8) Our E&P segment has commitments related to the leasing of fifteen drilling rigs through 2014. (9) Our other significant contractual obligations include approximately $13.1 million related to seismic services, approximately $4.1 million for funding of benefit plans and approximately $1.7 million for various information technology support and data subscription agreements. We refer you to Financing Requirements above for a discussion of the terms of our long term debt. Contingent Liabilities and Commitments We have the following commitments and contingencies that could create liabilities for us or increase or accelerate our contingent liabilities. Substantially all of our employees are covered by defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans. Our return on the assets of these plans, when combined with other factors including an increase in employees, resulted in an increase in pension expense and our required funding of the plans for 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2006, we recognized a liability of $13.8 million as a result of the underfunded status of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. We expect to record pension expense of $5.7 million and a postretirement benefit expense of $0.7 million in 2007. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements and Critical Accounting Policies below for additional information. 49 SWN Table of Contents On April 10, 2006, our Midstream Services unit entered into a three year firm transportation agreement with Ozark Gas Transmission System to transport volumes increasing to 175,000 MMBtu per day in the later stages of the contract. On August 22, 2006, we amended the agreement to increase the maximum volumes transported from 175,000 MMBtu per day to 220,000 MMBtu per day in the later stages of the contract. Additionally, on January 25, 2007 our Midstream Services unit entered into a separate two year firm transportation agreement with Ozark Gas Transmission System to transport volumes of 50,000 MMBtu per day. On December 15, 2006, one of our Midstream Services subsidiaries entered into a precedent agreement pursuant to which we will contract for firm gas transportation services on two newly proposed pipeline laterals and related facilities of Texas Gas Transmission, LLC (Texas Gas), a subsidiary of Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP. We will be a Foundation Shipper for the project and will use the proposed laterals and related facilities primarily to deliver gas volumes produced from Southwesterns operations in its Fayetteville Shale play in central Arkansas. Depending on regulatory approvals, the expected in service date for both laterals is January 1, 2009. The first lateral line (Fayetteville Lateral) will originate in Conway County, Arkansas, and connect to Texas Gas mainline system in Coahoma County, Mississippi. The Fayetteville Lateral will be a minimum of 36 in diameter and would have an estimated ultimate capacity of up to 1 .1 Bcf per day. The second lateral (Greenville Lateral) will originate at the Texas Gas mainline system near Greenville, Mississippi, and extend eastward to interconnect with various interstate pipelines. The firm transportation agreements entered into by us pursuant to the precedent agreement will have an initial term of ten years and, over time, will enable us to transport up to 500,000 MMBtu per day on the Fayetteville Lateral and up to 400,000 MMBtu per day on the Greenville Lateral. We will also have the option to acquire up to 300,000 MMBtu per day of additional capacity on the Fayetteville Lateral and up to 240,000 MMBtu per day of additional capacity on the Greenville Lateral. Upon execution and delivery of the firm transportation agreements contemplated by the precedent agreement, our Midstream Services segment would have additional demand charges of $503.5 million that would be payable over the ten year term of the agreements. On December 29, 2006, we sold 13 of our existing drilling rigs and assigned our right to purchase two other drilling rigs to be delivered and related equipment to various financial institutions and leased the rigs from the buyers for an initial term of eight years from January 1, 2007 with aggregate rental payments of $19.6 million annually. We received proceeds of $127.3 million. This transaction was recorded as a sale and operating leaseback with an aggregate deferred gain of $7.4 million on the sale which will be amortized against the lease payments over the lease term. Subject to certain conditions, we have options to purchase the rigs and related equipment from the lessors at the end of the 84th month of the lease term at an agreed upon price or at the end of the lease term for its then fair market value. Additionally, we have the option to renew the lease for a negotiated renewal term at a periodic rental equal to the fair market re ntal value of the rigs as determined at the time of renewal. In accordance with our accounting procedures, the portion of the lease payments that represent drilling costs for our working interest in wells is capitalized to the full cost pool. We are subject to litigation and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. Management believes, individually or in aggregate, such litigation and claims will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or our results of operations but these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and managements view may change in the future. If an unfavorable final outcome were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material impact on our financial position and the results of operations for the period in which the effect becomes reasonably estimable. A lawsuit was filed against us in 2001 alleging a breach of an agreement to indemnify the other party against settlement payments related to our Boure prospect in Louisiana. The allegations were contested and, in 2002, we were granted a motion for summary judgment by the trial court. The case was appealed to the First Court of Appeals in Houston, Texas, which subsequently transferred the appeal to the Thirteenth Court of Appeals in Corpus Christi. The appeal was briefed and argued during 2003. On April 14, 2005, the Thirteenth Court of Appeals reversed the orders of the trial court and rendered judgment denying our motion for summary judgment and granting the motion for summary judgment of the other party. Our motion for rehearing with the Thirteenth Court of Appeals was denied on May 19, 2005. In August of 2005, we filed a petition for review with the Texas Supreme Court. In October of 2005, the Texas Supreme Cour t invited additional briefing by the parties. In March of 2006, the Texas Supreme Court requested that both parties submit full briefing on the merits of the case. After receiving full briefing from both sides, our petition for review with the Texas Supreme Court was denied on December 1, 2006, and the case has been remanded to the trial court for further disposition. Should the other party prevail in the case, we could be required to pay approximately $2.1 million, plus pre judgment interest and attorneys fees. Based on an assessment of this litigation by us and our legal counsel, we accrued a loss in the fourth quarter of 2006. 50 SWN Table of Contents Working Capital We maintain access to funds that may be needed to meet capital requirements through our credit facility described above. We had negative working capital of $55.0 million at the end of 2006 and positive working capital of $158.7 million at the end of 2005. Current assets at December 31, 2006 and 2005 included $42.0 and $222.4 million, respectively, of cash equivalents. The cash equivalents resulted from the proceeds of our drilling rig sale/leaseback in 2006 and from our equity offering in 2005, respectively. Current liabilities increased $76.5 million, due primarily to an increase in accounts payable related to our level of drilling activity, partially offset by a decrease in our current hedging liability at December 31, 2006. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Natural Gas and Oil Properties We utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to the exploration, development and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves. Under this method, all such costs (productive and nonproductive), including salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities, are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method. These capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test that limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved gas and oil reserves discounted at 10 percent (standardized measure) plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties. Any costs in excess of the ceiling are written off as a non cash expense. The expense may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling. Full cost companie s must use the prices in effect at the end of each accounting quarter, including the impact of derivatives qualifying as hedges, to calculate the ceiling value of their reserves. However, commodity price increases subsequent to the end of a reporting period but prior to the release of periodic reports may be utilized to calculate the ceiling value of reserves. At December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, our unamortized costs of natural gas and oil properties did not exceed this ceiling amount. At December 31, 2006, our standardized measure was calculated based upon quoted market prices of $5.64 per Mcf for Henry Hub gas and $57.25 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil, adjusted for market differentials. The ceiling value calculated at December 31, 2006 includes approximately $135.2 million related to the positive effects of future cash flow hedges of gas production. At December 31, 2005, our standardized measure was calculated based upon quoted market prices of $10.08 per Mcf for Henry Hub gas and $61.04 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil, and at December 31, 2004, our standardized measure was calculated based upon quoted market prices of $6.18 per Mcf for Henry Hub gas and $43.45 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil. A decline in natural gas and oil prices from year end 2006 levels or other factors, without other mitigating circumstances, could cause a future write down of capitalized costs and a non cash charge against future earnings. The risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties increases when natural gas and oil prices are depressed or if there are substantial downward revisions in estimated proved reserves. Under the SECs full cost accounting rules, our reserves are required to be priced using prices in effect at the end of the reporting period. Application of these rules during periods of relatively low natural gas or oil prices due to seasonality or other reasons, even if temporary, increases the probability of a ceiling test write down. Natural gas pricing has historically been unpredictable and any declines could result in a ceiling test write down in subsequent quarterly or annual reporting periods. Natural gas and oil reserves used in the full cost method of accounting cannot be measured exactly. Our estimate of natural gas and oil reserves requires extensive judgments of reservoir engineering data and is generally less precise than other estimates made in connection with financial disclosures. Our reservoir engineers prepare our reserve estimates under the supervision of our management. Reserve estimates are prepared for each of our properties annually by the reservoir engineers assigned to the asset management team in the geographic locations in which the property is located. These estimates are reviewed by senior engineers who are not part of the asset management teams and the president of our E&P subsidiaries. Final authority over the estimates of our proved reserves rests with our Board of Directors. In each of the past three years, performance revisions to our proved reserve estimates rep resented no greater than 5% of our total proved reserve estimates, which we believe is indicative of the effectiveness of our internal controls. Proved developed reserves generally have a higher degree of accuracy in this estimation process, when compared to proved undeveloped and proved non producing reserves, as production history and pressure data over time is available for the majority of our proved developed properties. Proved developed reserves account for 65% of our total reserve base at December 31, 2006. Assigning monetary values to such estimates does not reduce the subjectivity and changing nature of such reserve estimates. The uncertainties inherent in the reserve estimates are compounded by applying additional estimates of the rates and timing of production and the costs that will be incurred in developing and producing the reserves. We cannot assure you that our internal controls sufficiently address the numerous uncertainties and risks that are inherent in estimating quantities of natura l gas and oil reserves and projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures 51 SWN Table of Contents as many factors are beyond our control. We refer you to Although our estimated natural gas and oil reserve data is independently audited, our estimates may still prove to be inaccurate. in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of Part I of this Form 10 K for a more detailed discussion of these uncertainties, risks and other factors. We engage the services of Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., an independent petroleum engineering firm, to audit our reserves as estimated by our reservoir engineers. Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. reports the results of the reserves audit to our Board of Directors. In conducting its audit, the engineers and geologists of Netherland, Sewell & Associates study our major properties in detail and independently develop reserve estimates. For the year ended December 31, 2006, Netherland, Sewell & Associates issued its audit opinion as to the reasonableness of our reserve estimates, stating that our estimated proved oil and gas reserves are, in the aggregate, reasonable and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles. A decline in gas and oil prices used to calculate the discounted future net revenues of our reserves affects both the present value of cash flows and the quantity of reserves reported. Our reserve base is 95% natural gas, therefore changes in oil prices used do not have as significant an impact as gas prices on cash flows and reported reserve quantities. Reported discounted cash flows and reserve quantities at December 31, 2006 were $1,308.7 million and 1,026.3 Bcfe. An assumed decrease of $1.00 per Mcf in the December 31, 2006 gas price used to price our reserves would have resulted in an approximate $190 million decline in our future cash flows discounted at 10%, adjusted for the effects of commodity hedges, and an approximate decrease of 23 Bcfe of our reported reserves. Under this assumption, our unamortized costs would have exceeded the ceiling of proved natural gas and oil reserves. The decline in reserve quantities, assu ming this decrease in gas price, would have the impact of increasing our unit of production amortization of the full cost pool. The unit of production rate for amortization is adjusted quarterly based on changes in reserve estimates and capitalized costs. Hedging We use natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options and interest rate swaps to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil and in interest rates. Our policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings to minimize the risk of uncollectability. In recent years, we have hedged 60% to 80% of our annual production. The primary market risks related to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for natural gas and crude oil. However, the market price risk is offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related sale or purchase of the natural gas or sale of the oil that is hedged. Our derivative instruments are accounted for under FAS 133, as amended by FAS 138 and FAS 149, and are recorded at fair value in our financial statements. We have established the fair value of derivative instruments using data provided by our counterparties in conjunction with assumptions evaluated internally using established index prices and other sources. These valuations are recognized as assets or liabilities in our balance sheet and, to the extent an open position is an effective cash flow hedge on equity production or interest rates, the offset is recorded in other comprehensive income. Results of settled commodity hedging transactions are reflected in natural gas and oil sales or in gas purchases. Results of settled interest rate hedges are reflected in interest expense. Any derivative not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment or any ineffective portion of a properly designated hedge is recognized immediately in ear nings. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded a loss of $25.8 million related to basis differential swaps that did not qualify for hedge accounting which was partially offset by a $20.2 million gain related to the change in estimated ineffectiveness of our commodity cash flow hedges. We did not enter into any interest rate swaps in 2006, 2005 and 2004. Future market price volatility could create significant changes to the hedge positions recorded in our financial statements. We refer you to Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Item 7A of Part II of this Form 10 K for additional information regarding our hedging activities. Regulated Utility Operations Our utility operations are subject to the rate regulation and accounting requirements of the APSC. Allocations of costs and revenues to accounting periods for ratemaking and regulatory purposes may differ from those generally applied by non regulated operations. Such allocations to meet regulatory accounting requirements are considered generally accepted accounting principles for regulated utilities provided that there is a demonstrated ability to recover any deferred costs in future rates. During the ratemaking process, the regulatory commission may require a utility to defer recognition of certain costs to be recovered through rates over time as opposed to expensing such costs as incurred. This allows the utility to stabilize rates over time rather than passing such costs on to the customer for immediate recovery. This causes certain expenses to be deferred as a regulatory asset and amortized to expense as they are recovered through rates. The APSC has 52 SWN Table of Contents not required any unbundling of services, although large industrials are free to contract for their own gas supply. There are no pending regulations relating to unbundling of services; however, should such regulation be proposed and adopted, certain of these assets may no longer meet the criteria for deferred recognition and, accordingly, a write off of regulatory assets and stranded costs may be required. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We record our prepaid or accrued benefit cost, as well as our periodic benefit cost, for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans using measurement assumptions that we consider reasonable at the time of calculation (see Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion and disclosures regarding these benefit plans). Two of the assumptions that affect the amounts recorded are the discount rate, which estimates the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled, and the expected return on plan assets, which reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested. For the December 31, 2006 benefit obligation and the periodic benefit cost to be recorded in 2007, the discount rate assumed is 6.0%. For the 2007 periodic benefit cost, the expected return assumed is 8.0%. This compares to a discount rate of 5.5% and an expected return of 8.25% used in 2006. Using the assumed rates discussed above, we recorded pension expense of $4.0 million in 2006 and $2.3 million in 2005 related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. With the adoption of FAS 158 in December 2006, we recognized a liability of $13.8 million at December 31, 2006, compared to $8.6 million at December 31, 2005 related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. During 2006, we also funded $3.8 million to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. In 2007, we expect to fund $4.1 million to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans and recognize pension expense of $5.7 million and a postretirement benefit expense of $0.7 million. Assuming a 1% change in the 2006 rates (lower discount rate and lower rate of return), we would have recorded pension expense of $4.6 million in 2006. On September 29, 2006, FAS 158 was issued requiring, among other things, the recognition of the funded status of each defined pension benefit plan, retiree health care and other postretirement benefit plans and postemployment benefit plans on the balance sheet. Gas in Underground Storage We record our gas stored in inventory that is owned by the E&P segment at the lower of weighted average cost or market. Gas expected to be cycled within the next 12 months, assuming normal weather patterns, is recorded in current assets with the remaining stored gas reflected as a long term asset. The quantity and average cost of gas in storage was 9.6 Bcf at $3.89 per Mcf at December 31, 2006, compared to 8.5 Bcf at $3.78 per Mcf at December 31, 2005. The gas in inventory for the E&P segment is used primarily to supplement production in meeting the segments contractual commitments including delivery to customers of our Natural Gas Distribution segment, especially during periods of colder weather. As a result, demand fees paid by the Natural Gas Distribution segment to the E&P segment, which are passed through to the utilitys customers, are a part of the realized price of the gas in storage. In determining the lower of cost or market for storage gas, we utilize the gas futures market in assessing the price we expect to be able to realize for our gas in inventory. A significant decline in the future market price of natural gas could result in a write down of our gas in storage carrying cost.

All statements that address activities, outcomes and other matters that should or may occur in the future, including, without limitation, statements regarding the financial position, business strategy, production and reserve growth and other plans and objectives for our future operations, are forward looking statements. Although we believe the expectations expressed in such forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements are not guarantees of future performance. We have no obligation and make no undertaking to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements. Forward looking statements include the items identified in the preceding paragraph, information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations and other statements in this Form 10 K identified by words such as anticipate, project, intend, estimate, expect, believe, predict, budget, projection, goal, plan, forecast, target or similar expressions. You should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements. They are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may affect our operations, markets, products, services and prices and cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. In addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with forward looking statements, risks, uncertainties and factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward looking statement include, but are not limited to: the timing and extent of changes in market conditions and prices for natural gas and oil (including regional basis differentials); the timing and extent of our success in discovering, developing, producing and estimating reserves; the economic viability of, and our success in drilling, our large acreage position in the Fayetteville Shale play, overall as well as relative to other productive shale gas plays; our ability to determine the most effective and economic fracture stimulation for the Fayetteville Shale formation; the costs and availability of oilfield personnel services and drilling supplies, raw materials, and equipment and services, including pressure pumping equipment and crews in the Arkoma basin; our ability to fund our planned capital investments; our future property acquisition or divestiture activities; the effects of weather; increased competition; the impact of federal, state and local government regulation; the financial impact of accounting regulations and critical accounting policies; the comparative cost of alternative fuels; conditions in capital markets and changes in interest rates, and; any other factors listed in the reports we have filed and may file with the SEC. We caution you that forward looking statements contained in this Form 10 K are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, incident to the exploration for and development, production and sale of natural gas and oil. These risks include, but are not limited to, commodity price volatility, third party interruption of sales to market, inflation, lack of availability of goods and services, environmental risks, drilling and other operating risks, regulatory changes, the uncertainty inherent in estimating proved natural gas and oil reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures and the other risks described in Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10 K. Estimates of our proved natural gas and oil reserves and the estimated future net revenues from such reserves are based upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC relating to natural gas and oil prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital investments, taxes and availability of funds. The process of estimating natural gas and oil 54 SWN Table of Contents reserves is complex. This process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. Therefore, these estimates are inherently imprecise. Actual future production, natural gas and oil prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable natural gas and oil reserves will most likely vary from those estimated. Such variances may be material. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves set forth in this Form 10 K. Our properties may also be susceptible to hydrocarbon drainage from production by other operators on adjacent properties. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing natural gas and oil prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. At December 31, 2006, approximately 35% of our estimated proved reserves were proved undeveloped and 5% were proved developed non producing. Proved undeveloped reserves and proved developed non producing reserves, by their nature, are less certain than proved developed producing reserves. Estimates of reserves in the non producing categories are nearly always based on volumetric calculations rather than the performance data used to estimate producing reserves. Recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital investments and successful drilling operations. Recovery of proved developed non producing reserves requires capital investments to recomplete into the zones behind pipe and is subject to the risk of a successful recompletion. Production revenues from proved undeveloped and proved developed non producing reserves will not be realized, if at all, until sometime in the future. The reserve data assumes that we will make significant capital investments to develop our reserves. Although we have prepared estimates of our natural gas and oil reserves and the costs associated with these reserves in accordance with industry standards, we cannot assure you that the estimated costs are accurate, that development will occur as scheduled or that the actual results will be as estimated. You should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows referred to in this Form 10 K is the current fair value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. Any changes in consumption by gas purchasers or in governmental regulations or taxation could also affect actual future net cash flows. The timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of natural gas and oil properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves and their present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor, which is required by the SEC to be used in calculating discounted fut ure net cash flows for reporting purposes, is not necessarily the most accurate discount factor for our company. Should one or more of the risks or uncertainties described above or elsewhere in this Form 10 K occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements. We specifically disclaim all responsibility to publicly update any information contained in a forward looking statement or any forward looking statement in its entirety and therefore disclaim any resulting liability for potentially related damages. All forward looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. 55 SWN Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from the volatility in commodity prices, basis differentials and interest rates, as well as credit risk concentrations. We use natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options and interest rate swaps to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil and in interest rates. Our Board of Directors has approved risk management policies and procedures to utilize financial products for the reduction of defined commodity price and interest rate risks. These policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings. Credit Risk Our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables and derivative contracts associated with commodities hedging. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of our customers and their dispersion across geographic areas. No single customer accounted for greater than 4% of accounts receivable at December 31, 2006. In addition, please see the discussion of credit risk associated with commodities hedging below. Interest Rate Risk The following table provides information on our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The table presents the principal cash payments for our debt obligations and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. At December 31, 2006, we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Our policy is to manage interest rates through use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. Interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate. Expected Maturity Date Fair Value 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total 12/31/06 ($ in millions) Fixed Rate $ 1.2 $ 1.2 $ 61.2 $ 1.2 $ 1.2 $ 71.8 $ 137.8 $ 141.7 Average Interest Rate 7.15% 7.15% 7.62% 7.15% 7.15% 7.18% 7.37% Commodities Risk We use over the counter natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options to hedge sales of our production, to hedge activity in our marketing segment and to hedge the purchase of gas in our utility segment against the inherent price risks of adverse price fluctuations or locational pricing differences between a published index and the NYMEX futures market. These swaps and options include (1) transactions in which one party will pay a fixed price (or variable price) for a notional quantity in exchange for receiving a variable price (or fixed price) based on a published index (referred to as price swaps), (2) transactions in which parties agree to pay a price based on two different indices (referred to as basis swaps), and (3) the purchase and sale of index related puts and calls (collars) that provide a floor price below which the counterparty pays (production hedge) or receives (gas purchase hedge) funds equal to the amount by which the p rice of the commodity is below the contracted floor, and a ceiling price above which we pay to (production hedge) or receive from (gas purchase hedge) the counterparty the amount by which the price of the commodity is above the contracted ceiling. The primary market risks relating to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for natural gas and crude oil. However, the market price risk is offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related sale or purchase of the natural gas or sale of the oil that is hedged. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss as a result of non performance by our counterparties. The counterparties are primarily major investment and commercial banks which management believes present minimal credit risks. The credit quality of each counterparty and the level of financial exposure we have to each counterparty are periodically reviewed to ensure limited credit risk exposure. The following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in commodity prices and that are used to hedge prices for gas and oil production, gas purchases and marketing volumes. The table presents the notional amount in Bcf and MBbls, the weighted average contract prices and the fair value by expected maturity dates. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of these financial instruments was a $58.1 million asset. 56 SWN Table of Contents Production and Marketing Volume Weighted Average Price to be Swapped ($) Weighted Average Floor Price ($) Weighted Average Ceiling Price ($) Weighted Average Basis Differential ($) Fair Value at Dec 31, 2006 ($ in millions) Natural Gas (Bcf): Fixed Price Swaps: 2007 32.5 7.83 27.3 2008 13.0 8.78 8.2 Floating Price Swaps: 2007 0.2 (7.61) (0.4) 2008 Costless Collars: 2007 34.0 6.93 12.34 26.0 2008 22.0 7.92 13.15 14.0 Basis Swaps: 2007 31.9 (0.53) (4.1) 2008 30.1 (0.48) (2.6) Matched Basis Swaps: 2007 32.4 (0.47) (0.9) 2008 8.0 (0.73) (1.3) Regulatory Swaps: 2007 3.1 (8.83) (8.1) 2008 At December 31, 2006, we had outstanding fixed price basis differential swaps on 32.4 Bcf of 2007, and 8.0 Bcf of 2008 gas production that qualified for hedge accounting treatment. At December 31, 2006, we also had outstanding fixed price basis differential swaps on 31.9 Bcf of 2007 and 30.1 Bcf of 2008 gas production that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded a loss of $25.8 million related to the differential swaps that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment which was partially offset by a $20.2 million gain related to the change in estimated ineffectiveness of our cash flow hedges. At December 31, 2005, we had outstanding fixed price basis differential swaps on 13.0 Bcf of 2006, 29.9 Bcf of 2007 and 2.0 Bcf of 2008 gas production that qualified for hedge accounting treatment. At December 31, 2005, we had outstanding fixed price basis differential swaps on 25.3 Bcf of 2006 and 10.0 Bcf of 2007 gas production that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded a gain of $19.1 million related to the differential swaps that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment which was partially offset by a $9.4 million loss related to the change in estimated ineffectiveness of our cash flow hedges. At December 31, 2005, we had outstanding natural gas price swaps on total notional volumes of 7.9 Bcf at a weighted average price of $6.64 per Mcf of 2006 gas production and 12.0 Bcf at a weighted average price of $6.66 per Mcf of 2007 gas production. Outstanding oil price swaps at December 31, 2005 on 120 MBbls were yielding us an average price of $37.30 per barrel during 2006. At December 31, 2005, we also had outstanding natural gas price swaps on total notional gas purchase volumes of 0.7 Bcf in 2006 for which we paid an average fixed price of $13.03 per Mcf. At December 31, 2005, we had collars in place on 43.0 Bcf in 2006, 28.0 Bcf in 2007 and 2.0 in 2008 of gas production. The collars relating to 2006 production had a weighted average floor and ceiling price of $5.47 and $10.13 per Mcf, respectively. The collars relating to 2007 production have a weighted average floor and ceiling price of $6.64 and $11.19 per Mcf, respectively. The collars relating to 2008 production have a weighted average floor and ceiling price of $8.00 and $19.40 per Mcf, respectively. Subsequent to December 31, 2006 and prior to February 23, 2007, we hedged 12.5 Bcf of 2007, 11.0 Bcf of 2008 and 4.0 Bcf of 2009 gas production under fixed price swaps with a sales price ranging from $7.29 to $8.62. Additionally, we hedged 2.0 Bcf of 2007, 11.0 Bcf of 2008 and 4.0 Bcf of 2009 gas production under costless collars with floor prices ranging from $7.25 to $8.50 per Mcf and ceiling prices ranging from $9.07 to $10.95 per Mcf. 57 SWN Table of Contents
