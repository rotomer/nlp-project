ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This Form 10 K contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements for many reasons, including the risks described in Cautionary Statement about Forward Looking Statements below, in Item 1A, Risk Factors in Part I and elsewhere in this annual report. You should read the following discussion with the Selected Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. OVERVIEW Southwestern Energy Company is an independent energy company primarily focused on the exploration and production of natural gas within the United States. Our operations principally are located in Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas. We are also focused on creating and capturing additional value at and beyond the wellhead through our established natural gas gathering and marketing businesses, which we refer to collectively as our Midstream Services. We operate principally in three segments: Exploration and Production (E&P), Midstream Services and Natural Gas Distribution. Upon the consummation of the pending sale of our utility subsidiary, Arkansas Western Gas Company, we will cease to have any natural gas distribution operations. We refer you to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The transaction is subject to certain closing conditions and regulatory approvals and is expected to close approximately mid year 2008. Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" (FAS 144), the assets and liabilities of Arkansas Western Gas Company (AWG) have been reclassified as held for sale in our December 31, 2007 and 2006 balance sheets. However, the results of operations for AWG continue to be consolidated in the statements of operations and are not presented as discontinued operations. We refer you to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. We are focused on providing long term growth in the net asset value of our business, which we achieve in our E&P business through the drillbit. We prepare economic analyses for each of the investment opportunities in our E&P business and rank them based upon the expected present value added for each dollar invested, which we refer to as PVI. The PVI of the future expected cash flows for each project is determined using a 10% discount rate. Our actual PVI results are utilized to help determine the allocation of our future capital investments. We derive the vast majority of our operating income and cash flow from the natural gas production of our E&P business and expect this to continue in the future. We expect that growth in our operating income and revenues will primarily depend on natural gas prices and our ability to increase our natural gas production. In recent years, there has been significant price volatility in natural gas and crude oil prices due to a variety of factors we cannot control or predict. These factors, which include weather conditions, political and economic events, and competition from other energy sources, impact supply and demand for natural gas, which determines the pricing. In addition, the price we realize for our gas production is affected by our hedging activities as well as locational differences in market prices. Our ability to increase our natural gas production is dependent upon our ability to economically find and produce natu ral gas, our ability to control costs and our ability to market natural gas on economically attractive terms to our customers. In 2007, our gas and oil production increased 57% to 113.6 Bcfe, and in 2006 our production increased 19% to 72.3 Bcfe. The increases in production in both 2007 and 2006 primarily resulted from increases in production from our Fayetteville Shale play in Arkansas. We are targeting 2008 gas and oil production of 148 to 152 Bcfe, an increase of 30% to 35% over our 2007 production. Our year end reserves grew 41% in 2007 to 1,450.3 Bcfe, up from 1,026.3 Bcfe at the end of 2006. These increases were also primarily fueled by the continued development of our Fayetteville Shale play. We reported net income of $221.2 million in 2007, or $1.27 per share on a fully diluted basis, up 36% from the prior year. Net income in 2006 increased approximately 10% to $162.6 million, or $0.95 per share, compared to 2005. The increase in net income in 2007 was a result of increased production volumes in our E&P segment, partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses and increased interest expense. The increase in net income in 2006 was a result of increased production volumes in our E&P segment, a gain on the sale of our NOARK investment and decreased interest expense, partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses. Our cash flow from operating activities increased 45% to $622.7 million in 2007 and 41% to $429.9 million in 2006, primarily due to increases in net income and adjustments to net income for non cash expenses. Operating income for our E&P segment was $358.1 million in 2007, $237.3 million in 2006 and $234.8 million in 2005. Operating income for our E&P segment increased in 2007 due to increased production volumes, partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses. Operating income for our Midstream Services segment was $13.2 million in 2007, 38 SWN Table of Contents compared to $4.1 million in 2006 and $5.7 million in 2005. Operating income for our Midstream Services segment increased in 2007 due to an increase in gathering revenues related to our Fayetteville Shale play and an increase in the margin generated from marketing of natural gas, partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses. Operating income for our Midstream Services segment decreased in 2006 as increased gathering revenues were more than offset by increased operating costs and expenses and a decrease in the margin generated by our marketing activities. Operating income for our Natural Gas Distribution segment was $10.0 million in 2007, compared to $4.5 million in 2006 and $4.9 million in 2005. The increase in operating income for our Natural Gas Distribution segment in 2007 resulted from a rate increase implemented in August 2007, from colder weather and a decrease in operating costs and expenses. The decrease in operating income for our Natural Gas Distribu tion segment in 2006 resulted primarily from warmer weather and increased operating costs and expenses. Our capital investments totaled approximately $1.5 billion in 2007, up from $942.4 million in the prior year. We invested $1.38 billion in our E&P segment in 2007, compared to $861.0 million in 2006 (including $93.6 million invested in drilling rigs) and $451.3 million in 2005 (including $35.1 million invested in drilling rigs). Funds for our 2007 capital investments were provided by borrowings under our revolving credit facility, cash flow from operations and cash proceeds from a December 2006 drilling rig sale and leaseback transaction. As a result of our increased borrowings, our total debt to capitalization ratio increased to 37% at December 31, 2007, up from 9% at December 31, 2006. For 2008, our planned capital investments are $1.46 billion, approximately equal to the level of our 2007 capital investments, and include $1.33 billion for our E&P segment, $101 million for our Midstream Services segment and $25 million for other corporate purposes (including improvements to the utility system in advance of the pending sale). The $1.33 billion of E&P investments includes approximately $1.0 billion for the development of our Fayetteville Shale play and approximately 82% of our 2008 E&P capital is allocated to drilling. In addition to the planned investments in the Fayetteville Shale play, our E&P investments in 2008 will also focus on our active drilling programs in East Texas and other conventional drilling in the Arkoma Basin. We expect our capital investments in 2008 to be funded from internally generated cash flow, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, funds raised in the debt mark ets and proceeds from the sale of our utility and the anticipated divestiture of certain E&P assets. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Exploration and Production Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Revenues (in thousands) $ 795,944 $ 491,545 $ 403,234 Operating income (in thousands) $ 358,079 $ 237,307 $ 234,759 Gas production (Bcf) 109.9 68.1 56.8 Oil production (MBbls) 614 698 705 Total production (Bcfe) 113.6 72.3 61.0 Average gas price per Mcf, including hedges $ 6.80 $ 6.55 $ 6.51 Average gas price per Mcf, excluding hedges $ 6.16 $ 6.37 $ 7.73 Average oil price per Bbl, including hedges $ 69.12 $ 58.36 $ 42.62 Average oil price per Bbl, excluding hedges $ 69.12 $ 63.17 $ 54.37 Average unit costs per Mcfe: Lease operating expenses $ 0.73 $ 0.66 $ 0.48 General & administrative expenses $ 0.48 $ 0.58 $ 0.46 Taxes other than income taxes $ 0.16 $ 0.30 $ 0.37 Full cost pool amortization $ 2.41 $ 1.90 $ 1.42 Revenues, Operating Income and Production Revenues. Revenues for our E&P segment increased 62% in 2007 to $795.9 million primarily due to a 57% increase in total gas and oil production. Revenues increased 22% in 2006 to $491.5 million, primarily due to a 19% increase in our production volumes. We expect our production volumes to continue to increase primarily due to the development of our Fayetteville Shale play in Arkansas. Gas and oil prices are difficult to predict and are subject to wide price fluctuations. As of February 22, 2008, we have hedged 118.0 Bcf, 104.0 Bcf and 18.0 Bcf of our 2008, 2009 and 2010 gas production, respectively, in order to limit our exposure to price fluctuations. Revenues for 2007, 2006 and 2005 also include pre tax gains of $6.4 million, $4.0 million and $3.1 million, respectively, related to the sale of gas in storage inventory. 39 SWN Table of Contents Operating Income. Operating income from our E&P segment was $358.1 million in 2007, an increase of 51% from $237.3 million in 2006, as the increase in our revenues was partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses. Operating income was up 1% in 2006 compared to 2005 as the increase in revenues was largely offset by increased operating costs and expenses. Production. Gas and oil production was up approximately 57% to 113.6 Bcfe in 2007 and up 19% to 72.3 Bcfe in 2006, compared to prior periods. The increase in 2007 was primarily the result of a 41.7 Bcf increase in production from our Fayetteville Shale play. The increase in 2006 was the result of a 10.0 Bcf increase in production from our Fayetteville Shale play and a 4.0 Bcf increase in our East Texas production, partially offset by declines in production from our Permian and Gulf Coast properties. Our net production from the Fayetteville Shale play was 53.5 Bcf in 2007, up from 11.8 Bcf in 2006 and 1.8 Bcf in 2005. Gas sales to unaffiliated purchasers were up 66% to 105.1 Bcf in 2007 and up 23% to 63.4 Bcf in 2006, compared to the prior years. Sales to unaffiliated purchasers are primarily made under contracts that reflect current short term prices and are subject to seasonal price swings. Intersegment sales to AWG increased slightly to 4.8 Bcf in 2007 and decreased 7% to 4.7 Bcf in 2006. Future increases in demand for our gas production are expected to come from sales to unaffiliated purchasers. We are unable to predict changes in the market demand and price for natural gas, including weather related changes affecting demand of both affiliated and unaffiliated customers for our production. We are targeting 2008 gas and oil production of 148.0 to 152.0 Bcfe, an increase of 30% to 35% over our 2007 production. Our 2008 production volumes could also be impacted by the anticipated sale of certain E&P assets. Based on early production histories and modeling and assuming continued positive results, approximately 90.0 to 95.0 Bcf of our 2008 targeted gas production is projected to come from our activities in the Fayetteville Shale play. Although we expect production volumes in 2008 to increase, we cannot guarantee our success in discovering, developing, and producing reserves, including with respect to our Fayetteville Shale play. Our ability to discover, develop and produce reserves is dependent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the availability of capital, the timing and extent of changes in natural gas and oil prices and competition. There are also many risks inherent to the discovery, development and production of natural gas and oil. We refer you to Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10 K for a discussion of these risks and the impact they could have on our financial condition and results of operations. Commodity Prices We periodically enter into various hedging and other financial arrangements with respect to a portion of our projected natural gas and crude oil production in order to ensure certain desired levels of cash flow and to minimize the impact of price fluctuations, including fluctuations in locational market differentials (we refer you to Item 7A of this Form 10 K and Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion). The average price realized for our gas production, including the effects of hedges, increased to $6.80 per Mcf in 2007 and increased slightly to $6.55 per Mcf in 2006. The changes in the average price realized primarily reflect changes in average annual spot market prices and the effects of our price hedging activities. Our hedging activities increased the average gas price $0.64 per Mcf in 2007, compared to an increase of $0.18 per Mcf in 2006 and a reduction of $1.22 per Mcf in 2005. In recent years, locational differen ces in market prices for natural gas have been wider than historically experienced. Disregarding the impact of hedges, historically the average price received for our gas production was approximately $0.30 to $0.50 per Mcf lower than average NYMEX spot market prices due to the locational market differentials. However, during 2007, 2006 and 2005, widening market differentials caused the difference in our average price received for our gas production to be approximately $0.70 to $0.90 per Mcf lower than spot market prices. Assuming a NYMEX commodity price for 2008 of $7.00 per Mcf of gas, our differential for the average price received for our gas production is expected to be approximately $0.60 to $0.70 per Mcf below the NYMEX Henry Hub index price, including the impact of our basis hedges. As of December 31, 2007, we have financially protected future gas production volumes of 91.3 Bcf in 2008 and 3.6 Bcf in 2009 from the impact of widening basis differentials through our hedging activities and sales ar rangements. In addition to the basis hedges discussed above, at December 31, 2007, we had NYMEX commodity price hedges in place on 102.0 Bcf of 2008 and 79.0 Bcf of 2009 expected future gas production. Subsequent to December 31, 2007 and prior to February 22, 2008, we hedged 16.0 Bcf of 2008, 17.0 Bcf of 2009 and 16.0 Bcf of 2010 gas production under fixed price swaps with average prices of $8.99, $8.53 and $8.55 per Mcf, respectively. In addition, we hedged 8.0 Bcf of 2009 and 2.0 Bcf of 2010 gas production using costless collars. The collars relating to 2009 production have a weighted average floor and ceiling price of $8.00 and $10.05 per Mcf, respectively; and the collars relating to 2010 production have a weighted average floor and ceiling price of $8.50 and $10.20 per Mcf, respectively. We have also basis protected an additional 2.1 Bcf of 2008 gas production with an average differential price of $0.26 below NYMEX spot rates. As of February 22, 2008 , we have hedged approximately 80% of our 2008 anticipated gas production. 40 SWN Table of Contents We realized an average price of $69.12 per barrel for our oil production for the year ended December 31, 2007, up approximately 18% from the prior year. We did not hedge any of our 2007 oil production. The 2006 realized average price of $58.36 per barrel, including the effects of hedges, was up 37% from 2005. The average prices we received for our oil production in 2006 and 2005 were reduced by $4.81 and $11.75 per barrel, respectively, due to the effects of our hedging activities. Assuming a NYMEX commodity price of $70.00 per barrel of oil for 2008, we expect the average price received for our oil production during 2008 to be approximately $1.50 per barrel lower than average spot market prices as market differentials reduce the average prices received. Operating Costs and Expenses Lease operating expenses per Mcfe for the E&P segment were $0.73 in 2007, compared to $0.66 in 2006 and $0.48 in 2005. Lease operating expenses per unit of production increased in 2007 and 2006 due primarily to increases in our gathering and compression costs related to our operations in the Fayetteville Shale play. We expect our per unit operating cost for this segment to range between $0.85 and $0.90 per Mcfe in 2008 primarily due to increased production volumes from the Fayetteville Shale play. General and administrative expenses for the E&P segment were $0.48 per Mcfe in 2007, down from $0.58 per Mcfe in 2006 and up from $0.46 per Mcfe in 2005. The decrease in general and administrative costs per Mcfe in 2007 as compared to 2006 was due to the effects of our increased production volumes. In total, general and administrative expenses for the E&P segment were $54.8 million in 2007, $41.9 million in 2006 and $28.2 million in 2005. The increases in total general and administrative costs since 2005 were due primarily to increased payroll and related costs associated with the expansion of our E&P operations due to the Fayetteville Shale play and to increased incentive compensation costs. We added 243 new employees during 2007, most of which were hired in our E&P segment, compared to 494 employees added in 2006. We expect our cost per unit for general and administrative expenses to continue to decline in 200 8 and range between $0.42 and $0.47 per Mcfe. The expected decrease in per unit costs in 2008 is due to increased production volumes from our Fayetteville Shale play and a reduced rate of expansion in our E&P workforce. Future changes in our general and administrative expenses for this segment are primarily dependent upon our salary costs, level of pension expense, stock based compensation expensing under Statement on Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R Share Based Payment (FAS 123R) and the amount of incentive compensation paid to our employees. For eligible employees, a portion of incentive compensation is based on the achievement of certain operating and performance results, including production, proved reserve additions, present value added for each dollar of capital invested, and lease operating expenses and general and administrative expenses per unit of production, while another portion is discretionary based upon an employees performance. Additional discretionary awards may also be awarded under the incentive compensation plan. See Critical Accounting Policies below for further discussion of pension expense. Our full cost pool amortization rate averaged $2.41 per Mcfe for 2007, $1.90 per Mcfe for 2006 and $1.42 per Mcfe for 2005. The amortization rate is impacted by timing and amount of reserve additions and the costs associated with those additions, revisions of previous reserve estimates due to both price and well performance, write downs that result from full cost ceiling tests, proceeds from the sale of properties that reduce the full cost pool and the levels of costs subject to amortization. We cannot predict our future full cost pool amortization rate with accuracy due to the variability of each of the factors discussed above, as well as other factors, including but not limited to the uncertainty of the amount of future reserves attributed to our Fayetteville Shale play. Unevaluated costs excluded from amortization were $372.4 million at the end of 2007, compared to $166.8 million at the end of 2006 and $122.3 million at the end of 2005. The increase in unevaluated costs since December 31, 2005, resulted primarily from an increase in our undeveloped leasehold acreage and seismic costs for our Fayetteville Shale play and the related increased drilling activity. Taxes other than income taxes per Mcfe were $0.16 in 2007, $0.30 in 2006 and $0.37 in 2005, and vary from year to year due to changes in severance and ad valorem taxes that primarily result from the mix of our production volumes and fluctuations in commodity prices. Additionally, we accrued $4.9 million in 2007 for severance tax refunds related to our East Texas production. The timing and amount of production and reserve additions attributed to our Fayetteville Shale play could have a material impact on our per unit costs; if production or reserves additions are lower than projected, our per unit costs would increase. We utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to the exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and oil reserves. Under this method, all such costs (productive and nonproductive), including salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method. These capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test 41 SWN Table of Contents that limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved natural gas and oil reserves discounted at 10 percent (standardized measure) plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties. Any costs in excess of the ceiling are written off as a non cash expense. The expense may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling. Full cost companies must use the prices in effect at the end of each accounting quarter, including the impact of derivatives qualifying as hedges, to calculate the ceiling value of their reserves. However, commodity price increases subsequent to the end of a reporting period but prior to the release of periodic reports may be utilized to calculate the ceiling value of reserves. At December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, our unamortized costs of natural gas and oil properties did not exceed this ceiling amount. At Dece mber 31, 2007, the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon quoted market prices of $6.80 per Mcf for Henry Hub gas and $92.50 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil, adjusted for market differentials. Cash flow hedges of gas production in place at December 31, 2007 increased the calculated ceiling value by approximately $163 million (net of tax). We had approximately 181.0 Bcf of future gas production hedged at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2006, the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon quoted market prices of $5.64 per Mcf for Henry Hub gas and $57.25 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil, and at December 31, 2005, the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon quoted market prices of $10.08 per Mcf for Henry Hub gas and $61.04 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil. Decreases in market prices from December 31, 2007 levels, as well as changes in production rates, levels of reserves, the evaluation of costs excluded from amortization, future d evelopment costs, and service costs could result in future ceiling test impairments. Inflation impacts our E&P operations by generally increasing our operating costs and the costs of our capital additions. The effects of inflation on our operations prior to 2000 were minimal due to low inflation rates. However, since 2001, as commodity prices have increased, the impact of inflation has intensified in our E&P segment as shortages in drilling rigs, third party services and qualified labor have risen due to increased activity levels in the natural gas and oil industry. We have endeavored to mitigate rising costs by obtaining vendor pricing commitments for multiple projects and by offering performance bonuses related to increased economic efficiencies. During 2007, our E&P operations experienced decreases in certain costs and third party services primarily due to increased vendor competition in our Fayetteville Shale operating area. Midstream Services Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 ($ in millions, except volumes) Revenues marketing $ 924.3 $ 467.3 $ 458.9 Revenues gathering $ 37.7 $ 7.9 $ 1.0 Gas purchases marketing $ 915.1 $ 458.9 $ 451.1 Operating costs and expenses $ 33.7 $ 12.2 $ 3.1 Operating income $ 13.2 $ 4.1 $ 5.7 Gas volumes marketed (Bcf) 145.7 72.7 61.9 Gas volumes gathered (Bcf) 78.7 14.6 2.3 Revenues from our Midstream Services segment were up 102% in 2007 and up 3% in 2006, as compared to prior years. The increases in revenues in 2007 and 2006 resulted from increases in volumes marketed and increased gathering revenues, primarily relating to the Fayetteville Shale play. Increases and decreases in marketing revenues due to changes in commodity prices are largely offset by corresponding changes in gas purchase expenses. Midstream Services had gathering revenues of $37.7 million in 2007 related to its gathering systems in Arkansas, compared to $7.9 million in 2006. Gathering volumes, revenues and expenses for this segment are expected to continue to grow at a fast pace as reserves related to our Fayetteville Shale play are developed and production increases. Operating income from our Midstream Services segment increased 222% in 2007 as a result of the increases in gathering revenues and marketing margins, partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses. Operating income from our Midstream Services segment decreased 28% in 2006 due to increased operating costs and expenses that resulted from increased staffing and other costs associated with our growing gathering activities. The margin generated from natural gas marketing activities was up 10% in 2007 and up 8% in 2006 from the prior years. Margins fluctuate depending on the prices paid for commodities and the ultimate disposition of those commodities. The increase in volumes marketed in 2007 and 2006 resulted from marketing our increased production volumes, primarily related to our Fayetteville Shale play, and volumes for third parties in areas where we have production. Of the total volumes marketed, production from our E&P subsidiaries accounted for 91% in 2007, 86% in 2006 and 78% in 2005. We enter into hedging activities from time to time with respect to our gas marketing activities to provide margin protection. We refer you to Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk and Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 42 SWN Table of Contents In 2006, our Midstream Services unit entered into a three year firm transportation agreement with Ozark Gas Transmission System to transport volumes increasing to 220,000 MMBtu per day in the later stages of the contract. Additionally, in January 2007 we entered into a separate two year firm transportation agreement with Ozark Gas Transmission System to transport volumes of 50,000 MMBtu per day. In 2006, one of our Midstream Services subsidiaries entered into a precedent agreement pursuant to which it will contract for firm gas transportation services on two newly proposed pipeline laterals and related facilities of Texas Gas Transmission, LLC (Texas Gas), a subsidiary of Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP. Depending on regulatory approvals, the expected in service date for both laterals is January 1, 2009. See Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments below for further discussion. Natural Gas Distribution Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 ($ in thousands except for per Mcf amounts) Revenues $ 174,466 $ 172,207 $ 178,482 Gas purchases $ 111,338 $ 112,922 $ 120,852 Operating costs and expenses $ 53,168 $ 54,811 $ 52,719 Operating income $ 9,960 $ 4,474 $ 4,911 Sales and end use transportation deliveries (Bcf) 23.6 21.8 23.2 Sales customers at year end 151,988 151,003 147,820 Average sales rate per Mcf $ 11.07 $ 12.30 $ 11.85 Heating weather degree days 3,699 3,413 3,744 Percent of normal 91% 83% 91% On November 9, 2007, we entered a definitive agreement for the sale of all capital stock of our utility subsidiary, AWG, to SourceGas LLC for $224 million plus working capital. The transaction is subject to certain closing conditions and regulatory approvals and is expected to close by mid year 2008. The assets and liabilities associated with AWG have been reclassified as held for sale as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. Upon the consummation of the sale, we will cease to have any natural gas distribution operations. Revenues and Operating Income Gas distribution revenues fluctuate due to the effects of weather on demand for natural gas and the pass through of gas supply cost changes. Because of the corresponding changes in purchased gas costs, the revenue effect of the pass through of gas cost changes has not materially affected operating income. Revenues for 2007 increased 1% to $174.5 million compared to the prior year and revenues for 2006 decreased 4% to $172.2 million compared to the prior year. The increase in 2007 gas distribution revenues was due to an increase in volumes delivered and a rate increase implemented in August 2007. The decrease in 2006 gas distribution revenues was primarily due to lower sales volumes as a result of warmer weather, partially offset by a rate increase implemented in October 2005. Operating income for our Natural Gas Distribution segment increased 123% in 2007 compared to the prior year and decreased 9% in 2006 compared to the prior year. The increase in 2007 operating income resulted primarily from the increase in revenues and decreased operating costs and expenses. The decrease in 2006 operating income resulted primarily from the decrease in revenues and increased operating costs and expenses. Weather during 2007 in the utilitys service territory was 9% warmer than normal and 8% colder than the prior year. Weather during 2006 in the utilitys service territory was 17% warmer than normal and 8% warmer than the prior year. Deliveries and Rates In 2007, AWG sold 15.0 Bcf to its customers at an average rate of $11.07 per Mcf, compared to 13.4 Bcf at $12.30 per Mcf in 2006 and 14.4 Bcf at $11.85 per Mcf in 2005. Additionally, AWG transported 8.6 Bcf in 2007, compared to 8.4 Bcf in 2006 and 8.8 Bcf in 2005 for its end use customers. The increase in deliveries in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to colder weather. The decrease in volumes sold in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily resulted from warmer than normal weather. The average sales rate per Mcf decreased in 2007 due to changes in natural gas prices and the impact of incremental volumes delivered. Deliveries in recent years have also been impacted by customer conservation brought about by higher gas prices. Our utility segment hedged 4.0 Bcf of derivative gas purchases during 2007 which had the effect of increasing its total gas supply cost by $7.5 million. Our utility hedged 3.1 Bcf and 4.2 Bcf of its 2006 and 2005 gas purchases, 43 SWN Table of Contents respectively, which had the effect of increasing its total gas supply costs by $7.7 million and $2.4 million, respectively. Additionally, our utility segment has hedges in place on 2.0 Bcf of gas purchases at an average purchase price of $8.61 per Mcf for the 2007 2008 winter season. We refer you to Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk and Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. AWG has a transportation contract with Ozark Gas Transmission System for approximately 66,900 MMBtu per day of firm capacity that expires in 2014. Deliveries are made by the pipeline to portions of AWGs distribution systems and to the interstate pipelines with which it interconnects. Operating Costs and Expenses The changes in purchased gas costs for the Natural Gas Distribution segment reflect volumes purchased, prices paid for supplies and the mix of purchases from various gas supply contracts (base load, swing and no notice). Operating costs and expenses, net of purchased gas costs, decreased in 2007 to $53.2 million from $54.8 million in 2006. The decrease was primarily due to lower general and administrative expenses that resulted from a decrease in corporate expenses allocated to the Natural Gas Distribution segment. Operating costs and expenses for 2006 increased to $54.8 million from $52.7 million in 2005 primarily due to an increase in general and administrative expenses that resulted from increased salaries and incentive compensation costs. Inflation impacts our Natural Gas Distribution segment by generally increasing our operating costs and the costs of our capital additions. Additionally, delays inherent in the rate making process prevent us from obtaining immediate recovery of increased operating costs of our Natural Gas Distribution segment. Although general rates of inflation have been relatively low in recent years, the effects of inflation on the utilitys operations may be intensified by higher inflation rates related to certain items such as steel, fuel, right of way acquisition costs and qualified labor. Regulatory Matters AWGs rates and operations are regulated by the APSC and it operates through municipal franchises that are perpetual by virtue of state law. These franchises, however, may not be exclusive within a geographic area. Although its rates for gas delivered to its retail customers are not regulated by the FERC, its transmission and gathering pipeline systems are subject to the FERCs regulations concerning open access transportation. On January 12, 2006, the APSC initiated a notice of inquiry regarding a rulemaking for developing and implementing energy efficiency programs. Following a collaborative process, the APSC issued energy efficiency rules on January 11, 2007. These rules require all gas and electric utilities, excluding electric cooperatives, to file energy efficiency plans and programs with the APSC. AWG has filed and received approval for its initial energy efficiency plan, and is in the process of implementing Quick Start programs. Comprehensive programs are to be implemented in 2009. AWG will recover the costs of these programs from its customers. In AWGs most recent rate case, the APSC approved a Billing Determinant Adjustment Mechanism to mitigate the effects of lost revenues associated with energy efficiency programs. On December 19, 2006, the APSC issued affiliate transactions rules. In January 2007, AWG and other utilities requested a rehearing of these rules. On February 16, 2007, the APSC issued an order granting rehearing and staying the implementation of the affiliate transaction rules pending further review. The APSC subsequently revised the rules to address concerns expressed by the parties to the rulemaking proceeding. AWG has filed Affiliate Transactions Compliance Procedures required by the rules, and we do not expect the final rules to have a material effect on its operations. In July 2007, the APSC approved a rate increase for our utility segment totaling $5.8 million annually, exclusive of costs to be recovered through the utilitys purchase gas adjustment clause. The rate increase became effective for billings rendered on or after August 1, 2007. The APSC order provided for an allowed return on equity of 9.5% and an assumed capital structure of 55% debt and 45% equity. Transportation In 2006, we sold our 25% partnership interest in NOARK Pipeline System, Limited Partnership (NOARK) to Atlas Pipeline Partners, L.P. for $69.0 million and recognized a pre tax gain of approximately $10.9 million ($6.7 million after tax) relating to the transaction. We recorded pre tax income from operations related to our investment in NOARK of $0.9 million in 2006 and $1.6 million in 2005. Income from operations and the gain on the sale in the second quarter of 2006 were recorded in other income in our statements of operations. 44 SWN Table of Contents Other Revenues In 2007, 2006 and 2005, other revenues included pre tax gains of $6.4 million, $4.0 million and $3.1 million, respectively, related to the sale of gas in storage inventory. Interest Expense and Interest Income Interest costs, net of capitalization, increased to $23.9 million in 2007 due primarily to increased debt levels resulting from our increased level of capital investments. Interest expense decreased 95% to $0.7 million in 2006, as compared to the prior year, due to decreased debt levels resulting from our equity offering in September 2005 and increased capitalized interest. We refer you to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Requirements and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt. Interest capitalized increased to $13.8 million in 2007, up from $11.8 million in 2006 and $6.0 million in 2005. Changes in capitalized interest are primarily due to the level of investment in unevaluated properties in our E&P segment and the capitalization of interest during the con struction phase of our drilling rigs in 2006 and 2005. Costs excluded from amortization in the E&P segment increased to $372.4 million at December 31, 2007, compared to $166.8 million at December 31, 2006. Total capital investments for our E&P segment were $1.38 billion in 2007, up from $861.0 million in 2006. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we earned interest income of $0.1 million, $6.3 million and $3.4 million, respectively, related to our cash investments. These amounts are recorded in other income. Income Taxes Our provision for deferred income taxes was an effective rate of 38.1% for 2007, compared to 37.9% in 2006 and 36.9% in 2005. Any changes in the provision for deferred income taxes recorded each period result primarily from the level of income before income taxes, adjusted for permanent differences. Pension Expense We incurred pension costs of $5.3 million in 2007 for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans, compared to $4.0 million in 2006 and $2.7 million in 2005. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in our number of employees. The amount of pension expense recorded is determined by actuarial calculations and is also impacted by the funded status of our plans. During 2007, we contributed $6.5 million to our pension plans and $0.4 million to our other postretirement plans, compared to $3.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively, in 2006. For further discussion of our pension plans, we refer you to Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements and Critical Accounting Policies below. Stock Based Compensation Expense We recognized expense of $5.4 million and capitalized $2.6 million to the full cost pool for stock based compensation in 2007, compared to $5.2 million expensed and $1.7 million capitalized to the full cost pool for 2006 and $1.8 million expensed and $0.8 million capitalized to the full cost pool for 2005. We refer you to Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our equity based compensation plans. Additionally in 2007, we recorded expense of $0.9 million and capitalized $0.6 million to the full cost pool related to the valuation of company shares held in our non qualified deferred compensation plan. Adoption of Accounting Principles During the first quarter of 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 provides guidance for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions, as defined in FAS 109. FIN 48 prescribes a threshold condition that a tax position must meet to be recognized in the financial statements. Guidance is also provided regarding de recognition, classification and disclosure of these uncertain tax positions. FIN 48 was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The adoption of FIN 48 had no material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. The income tax years 2004 2007 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject. In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157). FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Prior to this statement, there were different definitions of fair value and limited guidance for 45 SWN Table of Contents applying those definitions in GAAP. In developing FAS 157, FASB considered the need for increased consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and for expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. FAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We will adopt FAS 157 in the first quarter of 2008 and will make additional required disclosures for financial instruments that are currently measured at fair value. In addition to required disclosures, FAS 157 also requires companies to evaluate current measurement techniques. We have not yet determined if any of its current fair value measurement methodology will change and, therefore, have not yet determined the impact FAS 157 may have on our results of operations or financial condition. In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (FAS 159). FAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. FAS 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We have not yet determined the impact FAS 159 may have on our results of operations or financial condition. In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51 (FAS 160). FAS 160 will change the financial accounting and reporting of noncontrolling (or minority) interests in consolidated financial statements, and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. FAS 160 could impact the presentation of our balance sheet line item Minority Interest related to our Overton partnership (see Note 1 for discussion), but is expected to have no impact on the results of operations. In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations (FAS 141R). FAS 141R provides greater consistency in the accounting and financial reporting of business combinations. It requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction, establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and requires the acquirer to disclose the nature and financial effect of the business combination. FAS 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. We have not yet determined the impact FAS 141R may have on our results of operations or financial condition. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We depend primarily on internally generated funds, our unsecured revolving credit facility (discussed below under Financing Requirements) and funds accessed through debt and equity markets as our primary sources of liquidity. We may borrow up to $1.0 billion under our revolving credit facility from time to time. The amount available under our revolving credit facility may be increased up to $1.25 billion at any time upon our agreement with our existing or additional lenders. As of December 31, 2007, we had $842.2 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2006, we had no indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility. During 2008, we expect to draw on a portion of the funds available under our credit facility to fund our planned capital investments (discussed below under Capital Investments), which are expected to exceed the net cash generated by our operations. On January 16, 2008, we consummated a private placement offering of $600 million of 7.5% Senior Notes due 2018 (discussed below under Financing Requirements). Net proceeds of approximately $591 million from the offering were used to pay down outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility. On January 2, 2008, we entered into a $200 million short term line of credit which was cancelled subsequent to the $600 million private placement offering. As of February 22, 2008, we had $328.2 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Net cash provided by operating activities increased 45% to $622.7 million in 2007, compared to a 41% increase in 2006 to $429.9 million. The primary components of cash generated from operations are net income, depreciation, depletion and amortization, the provision for deferred income taxes and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash from operating activities increased in 2007 and 2006 due mainly to increased net income, adjusted for non cash expenses. For 2007, requirements for our capital investments were met primarily by our revolving credit facility and cash provided by operating activities. Net cash from operating activities provided 41% of our cash requirements for capital investments in 2007, 46% in 2006 and 63% in 2005. At December 31, 2007, our capital structure consisted of 37% debt and 63% equity. We believe that our operating cash flow, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the expected proceeds from the sale of AWG and certain E&P asset divestitures will be adequate to meet our capital and operating requirements for 2008. 46 SWN Table of Contents Our cash flow from operating activities is highly dependent upon the market prices that we receive for our gas and oil production. The price received for our production is also influenced by our commodity hedging activities, as more fully discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K and Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Natural gas and oil prices are subject to wide fluctuations. As a result, we are unable to forecast with certainty our future level of cash flow from operations. We adjust our discretionary uses of cash dependent upon available cash flow. Capital Investments Our capital investments increased 59% to $1.5 billion in 2007 and increased 95% in 2006 to $942.4 million. Capital investments include a reduction of $20.6 million in 2007 and increases of $88.9 million and $28.1 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively, related to the change in accrued expenditures between years. Our E&P segment investments in 2007 were $1.38 billion, up from $861.0 million in 2006. Capital investments for 2006 and 2005 included $93.6 million and $35.1 million, respectively, for drilling rigs and related equipment which were subsequently sold and leased back in December 2006. 2007 2006 2005 (in thousands) Exploration and production Exploration and development $1,375,204 $ 767,400 $ 416,161 Drilling rigs and related equipment 4,453 93,641 35,128 1,379,657 861,041 451,289 Midstream services 107,363 48,660 15,840 Natural gas distribution 11,375 11,232 10,908 Other 4,743 21,474 5,014 $1,503,138 $ 942,407 $ 483,051 Our capital investments for 2008 are planned to be $1.46 billion, consisting of $1.33 billion for E&P, $101 million for Midstream Services and $25 million for Natural Gas Distribution improvements and general purposes. We expect to allocate approximately $1.0 billion of our 2008 E&P capital to our Fayetteville Shale play, up from approximately $960 million in 2007. Our planned level of capital investments in 2008 will allow us to accelerate our drilling activity in the Fayetteville Shale, continue the development of our properties in East Texas, continue our conventional drilling in the Arkoma Basin, maintain our present markets, explore and develop other existing gas and oil properties, generate new drilling prospects, and provide for improvements necessary due to normal customer growth in our Natural Gas Distribution segment through the closing date of the pending sale. As discussed above, our 2008 capital investment program is expected to be funded through cash flow from operations, borrowings under our credit facility and the expected proceeds from the sale of AWG and certain E&P assets. We may adjust the level of 2008 capital investments dependent upon our level of cash flow generated from operations and our ability to borrow under our credit facility. Financing Requirements Our total debt outstanding was $978.8 million at December 31, 2007, and $137.8 million at December 31, 2006. On October 12, 2007, we amended our unsecured revolving credit facility to, among other things, increase the current borrowing capacity to $1 billion. Pursuant to the amendment, the amount available under the revolving credit facility may be increased to $1.25 billion at any time upon our agreement with our existing or additional lenders. At December 31, 2007, we had $842.2 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility. As discussed more fully below, in January 2008, we issued $600 million of 7.5% Senior Notes due 2018, the net proceeds of which were used to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility. There were no borrowings under our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2006. The interest rate on the credit facility is calculated based upon our public debt rating and is currently 87.5 basis points over LIBOR. The revolving credit facility is currently guaranteed by our subsidiaries, Southwestern Energy Production Company, SEECO, Inc. and Southwestern Energy Services Company and requires additional subsidiary guarantors if certain guaranty coverage levels are not satisfied. Our publicly traded notes were downgraded on August 1, 2006 by Standard and Poors to BB+ with a stable outlook from BBB with a negative outlook. We have a Corporate Family Rating of Ba2 by Moodys. Our 7.5% Senior Notes were rated BB+ by Standard and Poors and Ba2 by Moodys. Any future downgrades in our public debt ratings could increase our cost of funds under the credit facility. 47 SWN Table of Contents Our revolving credit facility contains covenants which impose certain restrictions on us. Under the credit agreement, we may not issue total debt in excess of 60% of our total capital, must maintain a certain level of stockholders equity and must maintain a ratio of EBITDA to interest expense of 3.5 or above. Additionally, there are certain limitations on the amount of indebtedness that may be incurred by our subsidiaries. We were in compliance with all of the covenants of our credit agreement at December 31, 2007. Although we do not anticipate any violations of our financial covenants, our ability to comply with those covenants is dependent upon the success of our exploration and development program and upon factors beyond our control, such as the market prices for natural gas and oil. If we are unable to borrow under our credit facility, we would have to decrease our capital investment plans. On January 16, 2008, we issued $600 million of 7.5% Senior Notes due 2018 in a private placement. The 7.5% notes are redeemable at our election, in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of: (i) 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed then outstanding; and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the notes to be redeemed as determined in accordance with the indenture, plus 50 basis points. Any redemption is also subject to payment of accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. In addition, if we undergo a change of control as defined in the indenture, holders of the 7.5% Senior Notes will have the option to require us to purchase all or any portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the change of control d ate. The 7.5% Senior Notes are currently guaranteed by our subsidiaries, SEECO, Inc., Southwestern Energy Production Company and Southwestern Energy Services Company, which guarantees may be unconditionally released in certain circumstances. The indentures governing the 7.5% Senior Notes and our other existing notes contain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of us and or our subsidiaries to incur liens, to engage in sale and leaseback transactions and to merge, consolidate or sell assets. At December 31, 2007, our capital structure consisted of 37% debt and 63% equity. Stockholders equity in the December 31, 2007 balance sheet includes an accumulated other comprehensive gain of $24.6 million related to our hedging activities that is required to be recorded under the provisions of Statement on Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (FAS 133), and a loss of $11.3 million related to changes in our pension liability and the adoption of Statement on Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (FAS 158). The amount recorded for FAS 133 is based on current market values of our hedges at December 31, 2007, and does not necessarily reflect the value that we will receive or pay when the hedges ultimately are settled, nor does it take into account revenues to be received associat ed with the physical delivery of sales volumes hedged. Our credit facilitys financial covenants with respect to capitalization percentages exclude the effects of non cash entries that result from FAS 133 and FAS 158 and the non cash impact of any full cost ceiling write downs. Our capital structure at December 31, 2007, would remain at 37% debt and 63% equity without consideration of the accumulated other comprehensive gains and losses related to FAS 133 and FAS 158. As part of our strategy to ensure a certain level of cash flow to fund our operations, we have hedged approximately 70% of our expected 2008 gas production. The amount of long term debt we incur will be dependent upon commodity prices, our capital investment plans and the actual proceeds from the sale of our utility or any E&P asset divestitures. If commodity prices remain at or near their current levels throughout 2008, assuming that we do not complete the sale of AWG or the divestitures of any E&P assets, our long term debt would significantly increase in 2008. If commodity prices significantly decrease, we may decrease and or reallocate our planned capital investments. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In December 2006, we entered into a sale and leaseback transaction pursuant to which we sold 13 operating drilling rigs, two rigs yet to be delivered and related equipment and then leased such drilling rigs and equipment for an initial term of eight years commencing January 1, 2007, with aggregate annual rental payments of approximately $19.6 million. Subject to certain conditions, we have options to purchase the rigs and related equipment from the lessors at the end of the 84th month of the lease term at an agreed upon price or at the end of the lease term for the then fair market value. Additionally, we have the option to renew each lease for a negotiated renewal term at a periodic rental equal to the fair market rental value of the rigs as determined at the time of renewal. In 2007, we sold and leased back additional drilling rig equipment receiving proceeds of $3.1 million, and leased an additional $5.9 million of drilling rig equipme nt, under similar terms as the 2006 transaction. We will incur additional annual rental payments of $1.4 million related to the 2007 transactions. 48 SWN Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments We have various contractual obligations in the normal course of our operations and financing activities. Significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2007, were as follows: Contractual Obligations: Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years More than 5 Years (in thousands) Long term debt (1) $ 978,800 $ 1,200 $ 62,400 $ 844,600 $ 70,600 Interest on senior notes (2) 57,213 10,054 12,240 10,358 24,561 Operating leases (3) 62,795 10,801 19,667 16,118 16,209 Compression services (4) 47,205 13,146 21,886 12,173 Unconditional purchase obligations (5) Operating agreements (6) 52,354 37,345 15,009 Demand charges (7) 101,251 32,146 25,983 21,960 21,162 Rig leases (8) 146,678 20,954 41,908 41,908 41,908 Other obligations (9) 29,053 28,693 360 $1,475,349 $ 154,339 $ 199,453 $ 947,117 $ 174,440 (1) Debt includes $842.2 million borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility with a floating interest rate (5.87% at December 31, 2007) and $36.6 million of 7.15% Notes due 2018 which requires semi annual principal payments of $0.6 million. On January 16, 2008, we issued $600 million of 7.5% Senior Notes, the proceeds of which were utilized to reduce the outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility. (2) Interest on the senior notes includes interest through 2009 on the $60 million notes that are due in 2027 and putable at the holders option in 2009. (3) Operating leases include costs for compressors, aircraft, office space and equipment under non cancelable operating leases expiring through 2018. (4) Our Midstream Services segment has commitments for approximately $39.3 million and our E&P segment has commitments for approximately $7.9 million for compression services associated primarily with our Fayetteville Shale play and our Overton operations. (5) Our Natural Gas Distribution segment has volumetric commitments for the purchase of gas under non cancelable competitive bid packages and non cancelable wellhead contracts. Volumetric purchase commitments at December 31, 2007, totaled 0.9 Bcf, comprised of 0.8 Bcf in less than one year, 0.1 Bcf in one to three years and less than 0.1 Bcf in three to five years. Our volumetric purchase commitments are priced primarily at regional gas indices set at the first of each future month. These costs are recoverable from the utilitys end use customers. Upon the consummation of the sale of AWG, we will cease to have these volumetric commitments. (6) Our E&P segment has commitments for up to $41.1 million in termination fees related to rig operator agreements. Additionally, our E&P segment has secured rig moving services by committing monthly take or pay amounts of $938,000, expiring in December 2008. (7) Our Midstream Services segment has commitments for demand transportation charges of approximately $22.9 million related to the Fayetteville Shale play and approximately $5.2 million related to Angelina. Our Natural Gas Distribution segment has commitments for approximately $71.4 million of demand charges on non cancelable firm gas purchase and firm transportation agreements. These costs are recoverable from the utilitys end use customers. Our E&P segment has commitments for approximately $1.8 million of demand transportation charges. (8) Our E&P segment has commitments related to the leasing of 15 drilling rigs and related equipment through 2014. (9) Our other significant contractual obligations include approximately $14.4 million related to seismic services, approximately $7.9 million for funding of benefit plans and approximately $1.9 million for various information technology support and data subscription agreements. Additionally, our E&P segment has committed up to $3.9 million in termination fees to a gravel company. We refer you to Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of our long term debt. Contingent Liabilities and Commitments We have the following commitments and contingencies that could create liabilities for us or increase or accelerate our contingent liabilities. Substantially all of our employees are covered by defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans. Our return on the assets of these plans, when combined with other factors including an increase in employees, resulted in an increase in pension expense and our required funding of the plans for 2007, 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2007, we recognized a liability of $14.6 million as a result of the underfunded status of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans, compared to a liability of $13.8 million at December 31, 2006. As a result of actuarial data, and assuming the closing of the sale of AWG by mid year, we expect to record expenses of $4.8 million for these plans in 2008. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements and Critical Accounting Policies below for additional information. 49 SWN Table of Contents In 2006, our Midstream Services segment entered into a three year firm transportation agreement with Ozark Gas Transmission System to transport volumes increasing to 220,000 MMBtu per day in the latter stage of the contract. Additionally, in January 2007, our Midstream Services segment entered into a separate two year firm transportation agreement with Ozark Gas Transmission System to transport volumes of 50,000 MMBtu per day. In December 2006, one of our Midstream Services subsidiaries entered into a precedent agreement pursuant to which we will contract for firm gas transportation services on two newly proposed pipeline laterals and related facilities of Texas Gas Transmission, LLC (Texas Gas), a subsidiary of Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP. We will be a Foundation Shipper for the project and will use the proposed laterals and related facilities primarily to deliver gas volumes produced from Southwesterns operations in its Fayetteville Shale play in central Arkansas. Depending on regulatory approvals, the expected in service date for both laterals is January 1, 2009. The first lateral line (Fayetteville Lateral) will originate in Conway County, Arkansas, and connect to Texas Gas mainline system in Coahoma County, Mississippi. The Fayetteville Lateral will be a minimum of 36 in diameter and would have an estimated ultimate capacity of up to 1.1 B cf per day. The second lateral (Greenville Lateral) will originate at the Texas Gas mainline system near Greenville, Mississippi, and extend eastward to interconnect with various interstate pipelines. The firm transportation agreements entered into by us pursuant to the precedent agreement will have an initial term of ten years and, over time, will enable us to transport up to 500,000 MMBtu per day on the Fayetteville Lateral and up to 400,000 MMBtu per day on the Greenville Lateral. We will also have the option to acquire up to 300,000 MMBtu per day of additional capacity on the Fayetteville Lateral and up to 240,000 MMBtu per day of additional capacity on the Greenville Lateral. Upon execution and delivery of the firm transportation agreements contemplated by the precedent agreement, our Midstream Services segment would have additional demand charges of $503.5 million that would be payable over the ten year term of the agreements. We are subject to litigation and claims (including with respect to environmental matters) that arise in the ordinary course of business. Management believes, individually or in aggregate, such litigation and claims will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or our results of operations, but these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and managements view may change in the future. If an unfavorable final outcome were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material impact on our financial position and the results of operations for the period in which the effect becomes reasonably estimable. Working Capital We maintain access to funds that may be needed to meet capital requirements through our revolving credit facility described above. We had negative working capital of $67.6 million at the end of 2007 and negative working capital of $55.0 million at the end of 2006. Current assets at December 31, 2007, increased $49.3 million, compared to current assets at December 31, 2006, due to increases in accounts receivable related to gas marketing sales and sales of oil and gas production, partially offset by a $42.0 million decrease in cash equivalents. Current liabilities increased $52.0 million at December 31, 2007, due primarily to an increase in accounts payable related to our level of drilling activity, partially offset by a decrease in our current hedging liability. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Natural Gas and Oil Properties We utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to the exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and oil reserves. Under this method, all such costs (productive and nonproductive), including salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method. These capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test that limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved natural gas and oil reserves discounted at 10 percent (standardized measure) plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties. Any costs in excess of the ceiling are written off as a non cash expense. The expense may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling. Full cost c ompanies must use the prices in effect at the end of each accounting quarter, including the impact of derivatives qualifying as hedges, to calculate the ceiling value of their reserves. However, commodity price increases subsequent to the end of a reporting period but prior to the release of periodic reports may be utilized to calculate the ceiling value of reserves. At December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, our unamortized costs of natural gas and oil properties did not exceed this ceiling amount. At December 31, 2007, the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon quoted market prices of $6.80 per Mcf for Henry Hub gas and $92.50 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil, adjusted for market differentials. Cash flow hedges of gas production in place at December 31, 2007, increased the calculated ceiling value by approximately $163 million (net of tax). We had approximately 181.0 Bcf of future gas production hedged at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2006, 50 SWN Table of Contents the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon quoted market prices of $5.64 per Mcf for Henry Hub gas and $57.25 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil, and at December 31, 2005, the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon quoted market prices of $10.08 per Mcf for Henry Hub gas and $61.04 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil. Decreases in market prices from December 31, 2007 levels, as well as changes in production rates, levels of reserves, the evaluation of costs excluded from amortization, future development costs, and service costs could result in future ceiling test impairments. The risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties increases when natural gas and oil prices are depressed or if there are substantial downward revisions in estimated proved reserves. Under the SECs full cost accounting rules, our reserves are required to be priced using prices in effect at the end of the reporting period. Application of these rules during periods of relatively low natural gas or oil prices due to seasonality or other reasons, even if temporary, increases the probability of a ceiling test write down. Natural gas pricing has historically been unpredictable and any declines could result in a ceiling test write down in subsequent quarterly or annual reporting periods. Natural gas and oil reserves used in the full cost method of accounting cannot be measured exactly. Our estimate of natural gas and oil reserves requires extensive judgments of reservoir engineering data and is generally less precise than other estimates made in connection with financial disclosures. Our reservoir engineers prepare our reserve estimates under the supervision of our management. Reserve estimates are prepared for each of our properties annually by the reservoir engineers assigned to the asset management team in the geographic locations in which the property is located. These estimates are reviewed by senior engineers who are not part of the asset management teams and the president of our E&P subsidiaries. Final authority over the estimates of our proved reserves rests with our Board of Directors. In each of the past three years, performance revisions to our proved reserve estimates rep resented no greater than 8% of our total proved reserve estimates, which we believe is indicative of the effectiveness of our internal controls. Proved developed reserves generally have a higher degree of accuracy in this estimation process, when compared to proved undeveloped and proved non producing reserves, as production history and pressure data over time is available for the majority of our proved developed properties. Proved developed reserves account for 64% of our total reserve base at December 31, 2007. Assigning monetary values to such estimates does not reduce the subjectivity and changing nature of such reserve estimates. The uncertainties inherent in the reserve estimates are compounded by applying additional estimates of the rates and timing of production and the costs that will be incurred in developing and producing the reserves. We cannot assure you that our internal controls sufficiently address the numerous uncertainties and risks that are inherent in estimating quantities of natura l gas and oil reserves and projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures as many factors are beyond our control. We refer you to Although our estimated natural gas and oil reserve data is independently audited, our estimates may still prove to be inaccurate. in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of Part I of this Form 10 K for a more detailed discussion of these uncertainties, risks and other factors. We engage the services of Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., an independent petroleum engineering firm, or NSA, to audit our reserves as estimated by our reservoir engineers. Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. reports the results of the reserves audit to our Board of Directors. In conducting its audit, the engineers and geologists of Netherland, Sewell & Associates study our major properties in detail and independently develop reserve estimates. NSAs audit consists primarily of substantive testing, which includes a detailed review of major properties that account for approximately 81% of present worth of the companys total proved reserves. NSAs audit process consists of sorting all fields by descending present value order and selecting the fields from highest value to descending value until the selected fields account for more than 80% of the present worth of our reserves. The properties in the botto m 20% of the total present worth are the lowest value properties and are not reviewed in the audit. The fields included in approximately the top 81% present value as of December 31, 2007, accounted for approximately 85% of our total proved reserves and approximately 90% of our proved undeveloped reserves. In the conduct of its audit, NSA did not independently verify the data we provided to them with respect to ownership interests, oil and gas production, well test data, historical costs of operation and development, product prices, or any agreements relating to current and future operations of the properties and sales of production. NSA has advised us that if, in the course of its audit, something came to its attention that brought into question the validity or sufficiency of any such information or data, NSA did not rely on such information or data until it had satisfactorily resolved any questions relating thereto or had independently verified such information or data. For the year ended December 31, 2007, Netherland, Sewell & Associates issued its audit opinion as to the reasonableness of our reserve estimates, stating that our estimated proved oil and gas reserves are, in the aggregate, reasonable and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles. A decline in gas and oil prices used to calculate the discounted future net revenues of our reserves affects both the present value of cash flows and the quantity of reserves reported. Our reserve base is 96% natural gas, therefore changes in oil prices used do not have as significant an impact as gas prices on cash flows and reported reserve quantities. Reported discounted cash flows and reserve quantities at December 31, 2007, were $2,015.2 million and 1,450.3 Bcfe. An assumed 51 SWN Table of Contents decrease of $1.00 per Mcf in the December 31, 2007 gas price used to price our reserves would have resulted in an approximate $350 million decline in our future cash flows discounted at 10%, adjusted for the effects of commodity hedges, and an approximate decrease of 14 Bcfe of our reported reserves. The decline in reserve quantities, assuming this decrease in gas price, would have the impact of increasing our unit of production amortization of the full cost pool. The unit of production rate for amortization is adjusted quarterly based on changes in reserve estimates and capitalized costs. Hedging We use natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options and interest rate swaps to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil and in interest rates. Our policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings to minimize the risk of uncollectability. In recent years, we have hedged 70% to 80% of our annual production. The primary market risks related to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for natural gas and crude oil. However, the market price risk is offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related sale or purchase of the natural gas or sale of the oil that is hedged. Our derivative instruments are accounted for under FAS 133, as amended by FAS 138 and FAS 149, and are recorded at fair value in our financial statements. We have established the fair value of derivative instruments using data provided by our counterparties in conjunction with assumptions evaluated internally using established index prices and other sources. These valuations are recognized as assets or liabilities in our balance sheet and, to the extent an open position is an effective cash flow hedge on equity production or interest rates, the offset is recorded in other comprehensive income. Results of settled commodity hedging transactions are reflected in natural gas and oil sales or in gas purchases. Results of settled interest rate hedges are reflected in interest expense. Any derivative not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment or any ineffective portion of a properly designated hedge is recognized immediately in ear nings. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded an unrealized gain of $6.0 million related to basis differential swaps that did not qualify for hedge accounting in addition to a $1.0 million gain related to the change in estimated ineffectiveness of our commodity cash flow hedges. Future market price volatility could create significant changes to the hedge positions recorded in our financial statements. We did not enter into any interest rate swaps in 2007, 2006 or 2005. We refer you to Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Item 7A of Part II of this Form 10 K for additional information regarding our hedging activities. Regulated Utility Operations Our utility operations are subject to the rate regulation and accounting requirements of the APSC. Allocations of costs and revenues to accounting periods for ratemaking and regulatory purposes may differ from those generally applied by non regulated operations. Such allocations to meet regulatory accounting requirements are considered generally accepted accounting principles for regulated utilities provided that there is a demonstrated ability to recover any deferred costs in future rates. During the ratemaking process, the APSC may require a utility to defer recognition of certain costs to be recovered through rates over time as opposed to expensing such costs as incurred. This allows the utility to stabilize rates over time rather than passing such costs on to the customer for immediate recovery. This causes certain expenses to be deferred as a regulatory asset and amortized to expense as they are recovered through rates. The APSC has not required any unbundling of services, although large industrials are free to contract for their own gas supply. There are no pending regulations relating to unbundling of services; however, should such regulation be proposed and adopted, certain of these assets may no longer meet the criteria for deferred recognition and, accordingly, a write off of regulatory assets and stranded costs could be required. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We record our prepaid or accrued benefit cost, as well as our periodic benefit cost, for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans using measurement assumptions that we consider reasonable at the time of calculation (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion and disclosures regarding these benefit plans). Two of the assumptions that affect the amounts recorded are the discount rate, which estimates the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled, and the expected return on plan assets, which reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested. For the December 31, 2007, benefit obligation and the periodic benefit cost to be recorded in 2008, the discount rate assumed is 6.0%. For the 2008 periodic benefit cost, the expected return assumed is 7.75%. This compares to a discount rate of 6.0% and an expected return of 8.0% used in 2007. 52 SWN Table of Contents Using the assumed rates discussed above, we recorded pension expense of $5.3 million in 2007, $4.0 million in 2006 and $2.7 million in 2005 related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. At December 31, 2007, we recognized a liability of $14.6 million, compared to $13.8 million at December 31, 2006, related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. During 2007, we also funded $6.9 million to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. In 2008, we expect to fund $7.9 million to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans and recognize pension expense of $4.2 million and a postretirement benefit expense of $0.6 million, assuming the sale of the Natural Gas Distribution segment closes mid year. Assuming a 1% change in the 2007 rates (lower discount rate and lower rate of return), we would have recorded pension expense of $5.9 million in 2007. Gas in Underground Storage We record our gas stored in inventory that is owned by the E&P segment at the lower of weighted average cost or market. Gas expected to be cycled within the next 12 months is recorded in current assets with the remaining stored gas reflected as a long term asset. The quantity and average cost of gas in storage was 10.1 Bcf at $4.05 per Mcf at December 31, 2007, compared to 9.6 Bcf at $3.89 per Mcf at December 31, 2006. The gas in inventory for the E&P segment is used primarily to supplement production in meeting the segments contractual commitments, including delivery to customers of AWG, especially during periods of colder weather. As a result, demand fees paid by AWG to our E&P subsidiaries, which are passed through to the utilitys customers, are a part of the realized price of the gas in storage. In determining the lower of cost or market for storage gas, we utilize the gas futures market in assessing the price we expect to be able to realize for our gas in inventory. A significant decline in the future market price of natural gas could result in a write down of our gas in storage carrying cost. See further discussion of our significant accounting policies in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ABOUT FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS All statements, other than historical fact or present financial information, may be deemed to be forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements that address activities, outcomes and other matters that should or may occur in the future, including, without limitation, statements regarding the financial position, business strategy, production and reserve growth and other plans and objectives for our future operations, are forward looking statements. Although we believe the expectations expressed in such forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements are not guarantees of future performance. We have no obligation and make no undertaking to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements, except as may be required by law. Forward looking statements include the items identified in the preceding paragraph, information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations and other statements in this Form 10 K identified by words such as anticipate, project, intend, estimate, expect, believe, predict, budget, projection, goal, plan, forecast, target or similar expressions. You should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements. They are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may affect our operations, markets, products, services and prices and cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. In addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with forward looking statements, risks, uncertainties and factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward looking statement include, but are not limited to: the timing and extent of changes in market conditions and prices for natural gas and oil (including regional basis differentials); the timing and extent of our success in discovering, developing, producing and estimating reserves; the economic viability of, and our success in drilling, our large acreage position in the Fayetteville Shale play, overall as well as relative to other productive shale gas plays; our ability to fund our planned capital investments; our ability to determine the most effective and economic fracture stimulation for the Fayetteville Shale formation; the impact of federal, state and local government regulation, including any increase in severance taxes; 53 SWN Table of Contents the costs and availability of oilfield personnel services and drilling supplies, raw materials, and equipment and services, including pressure pumping equipment and crews in the Arkoma basin; our future property acquisition or divestiture activities; the effects of weather; increased competition; the financial impact of accounting regulations and critical accounting policies; the comparative cost of alternative fuels; conditions in capital markets and changes in interest rates, and; any other factors listed in the reports we have filed and may file with the SEC. We caution you that forward looking statements contained in this Form 10 K are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, incident to the exploration for and development, production and sale of natural gas and oil. These risks include, but are not limited to, commodity price volatility, third party interruption of sales to market, inflation, lack of availability of goods and services, environmental risks, drilling and other operating risks, regulatory changes, the uncertainty inherent in estimating proved natural gas and oil reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures and the other risks described in Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10 K. Estimates of our proved natural gas and oil reserves and the estimated future net revenues from such reserves in this Form 10 K are based upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC relating to natural gas and oil prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital investments, taxes and availability of funds. The process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is complex. This process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. Therefore, those estimates are inherently imprecise. Actual future production, natural gas and oil prices, revenues, taxes, development investments, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable natural gas and oil reserves will most likely vary from those estimated. Such variances may be material. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves set forth in this Form 10 K. Our properties may also be susceptible to hydrocarbon drainage from production by other operators on adjacent properties. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing natural gas and oil prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. At December 31, 2007, approximately 36% of our estimated proved reserves were proved undeveloped and 4% were proved developed non producing. Proved undeveloped reserves and proved developed non producing reserves, by their nature, are less certain than proved developed producing reserves. Estimates of reserves in the non producing categories are nearly always based on volumetric calculations rather than the performance data used to estimate producing reserves. Recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. Recovery of proved developed non producing reserves requires capital expenditures to recomplete into the zones behind pipe and is subject to the risk of a successful recompletion. Production revenues from proved undeveloped and proved developed non producing reserves will not be realized, if at all, until sometime in the future. The reserve data assumes that we will make significant capital investments to develop our reserves. Although we have prepared estimates of our natural gas and oil reserves and the costs associated with these reserves in accordance with industry standards, we cannot assure you that the estimated costs are accurate, that development will occur as scheduled or that the actual results will be as estimated. You should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows referred to in this Form 10 K is the current fair value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. Any changes in consumption by gas purchasers or in governmental regulations or taxation could also affect actual future net cash flows. The timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of natural gas and oil properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves and their present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor, which is required by the SEC to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes, is not necessarily the most accurate disco unt factor for our company. 54 SWN Table of Contents Should one or more of the risks or uncertainties described above or elsewhere in this Form 10 K occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements. We specifically disclaim all responsibility to publicly update any information contained in a forward looking statement or any forward looking statement in its entirety and therefore disclaim any resulting liability for potentially related damages. All forward looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from the volatility in commodity prices, basis differentials and interest rates, as well as credit risk concentrations. We use natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options and interest rate swaps to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil and in interest rates. Our Board of Directors has approved risk management policies and procedures to utilize financial products for the reduction of defined commodity price and interest rate risks. These policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings. Credit Risk Our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables and derivative contracts associated with commodities trading. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of our customers and their dispersion across geographic areas. No single customer accounted for greater than 5% of accounts receivable at December 31, 2007. In addition, please see the discussion of credit risk associated with commodities trading below. Interest Rate Risk The following table provides information on our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The table presents the principal cash payments for our debt obligations and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. At December 31, 2007, we had $842.2 million borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility with a floating interest rate (5.87% at December 31, 2007). Our policy is to manage interest rates through use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. Interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate. We do not have any interest rate swaps in effect currently. Fair Expected Maturity Date Value 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total 12/31/07 ($ in millions) Fixed Rate $ 1.2 $ 61.2 $ 1.2 $ 1.2 $ 1.2 $ 70.6 $ 136.6 $ 134.2 Average Interest Rate 7.15% 7.62% 7.15% 7.15% 7.15% 7.18% 7.38% Variable Rate $ $ $ $ $ 842.2 $ $ 842.2 $ 842.2 Average Interest Rate 5.87% 5.87% Commodities Risk We use over the counter natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options to hedge sales of our production, to hedge activity in our Midstream Services segment and to hedge the purchase of gas in our Natural Gas Distribution segment against the inherent price risks of adverse price fluctuations or locational pricing differences between a published index and the NYMEX futures market. These swaps and options include (1) transactions in which one party will pay a fixed price (or variable price) for a notional quantity in exchange for receiving a variable price (or fixed price) based on a published index (referred to as price swaps), (2) transactions in which parties agree to pay a price based on two different indices (referred to as basis swaps), and (3) the purchase and sale of index related puts and calls (collars) that provide a floor price below which the counterparty pays (production hedge) or receives (gas purchase hedge) funds equal to the amount by which the price of the commodity is below the contracted floor, and a ceiling price above which we pay to (production hedge) or receive from (gas purchase hedge) the counterparty the amount by which the price of the commodity is above the contracted ceiling. 55 SWN Table of Contents The primary market risks relating to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for natural gas and crude oil. However, the market price risk is offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related sale or purchase of the natural gas or sale of the oil that is hedged. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss as a result of non performance by our counterparties. The counterparties are primarily major investment and commercial banks which management believes present minimal credit risks. The credit quality of each counterparty and the level of financial exposure we have to each counterparty are periodically reviewed to limit our credit risk exposure. Exploration and Production The following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in commodity prices and that are used to hedge prices for gas production. The table presents the notional amount in Bcf, the weighted average contract prices and the fair value by expected maturity dates. At December 31, 2007, the fair value of our financial instruments related to natural gas production and underground storage sales was a $47.6 million asset. Volume Weighted Average Price to be Swapped ($) Weighted Average Floor Price ($) Weighted Average Ceiling Price ($) Weighted Average Basis Differential ($) Fair Value at Dec 31, 2007 ($ in millions) Natural Gas (Bcf): Fixed Price Swaps: 2008 (1) 55.7 8.27 25.6 2009 56.0 8.20 (10.8) Costless Collars: 2008 48.0 7.92 11.60 30.5 2009 23.0 8.09 10.91 2.9 Basis Swaps: 2008 63.2 (0.45) (0.5) 2009 3.6 (0.44) (0.2) Matched Basis Swaps: 2008 8.0 (0.73) 0.1 (1) Includes fixed price swaps for 1.7 Bcf relating to future sales from our underground storage facility that have a fair value asset of $2.3 million. At December 31, 2007, we had outstanding fixed price basis differential swaps on 8.0 Bcf of 2008 gas production that qualified for hedge treatment. At December 31, 2007, we also had outstanding fixed price basis differential swaps on 63.2 Bcf of 2008 and 3.6 Bcf of 2009 gas production that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in gas and oil sales. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded an unrealized gain of $6.0 million related to the differential swaps that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and a $1.0 million gain related to the change in estimated ineffectiveness of our cash flow hedges. Typically, our ineffectiveness results from changes at the end of a reporting period in the price differentials between the index price of the derivative contract, which is primarily a NYMEX price, and the index price for the point of sale for the cash flow that is being hedged. At December 31, 2006, we had outstanding natural gas price swaps on total notional volumes of 32.5 Bcf in 2007 and 13.0 Bcf in 2008 for which we will receive fixed prices ranging from $6.20 to $12.06 per MMBtu. At December 31, 2006, we had outstanding fixed price basis differential swaps on 40.4 Bcf of 2007 and 2008 gas production that qualified for hedge treatment and outstanding fixed price basis differential swaps on 62.0 Bcf of 2007 and 2008 gas production that did not qualify for hedge treatment. At December 31, 2006, we had collars in place on notional volumes of 34.0 Bcf in 2007 and 22.0 Bcf in 2008. The 34.0 Bcf in 2007 had an average floor and ceiling price of $6.93 and $12.34 per MMBtu, respectively. The 22.0 Bcf in 2008 had an average floor and ceiling price of $7.92 and $13.15 per MMBtu, respectively. Subsequent to December 31, 2007 and prior to February 22, 2008, we hedged 16.0 Bcf of 2008, 17.0 Bcf of 2009 and 16.0 Bcf of 2010 gas production under fixed price swaps with average prices of $8.99, $8.53 and $8.55 per Mcf, respectively. In addition, we hedged 8.0 Bcf of 2009 and 2.0 Bcf of 2010 gas production using costless collars. The collars relating to 2009 production have a weighted average floor and ceiling price of $8.00 and $10.05 per Mcf, respectively; and 56 SWN Table of Contents the collars relating to 2010 production have a weighted average floor and ceiling price of $8.50 and $10.20 per Mcf, respectively. We have also basis protected an additional 2.1 Bcf of 2008 gas production with an average differential price of $0.26 below NYMEX spot rates for our respective basis locations. Midstream Services At December 31, 2007, our Midstream Services segment had outstanding fair value hedges in place on 1.0 Bcf of gas. These hedges are a mixture of fixed price swap purchases and sales relating to our gas marketing activities. These hedges have contract months from January 2008 through December 2008 and have fair value asset of $0.8 million as of December 31, 2007. A liability of $0.7 million was recognized at December 31, 2007, as an offset to these hedges for physical gas purchases and sales commitments relating specifically to the hedged transactions. Natural Gas Distribution At December 31, 2007, our Natural Gas Distribution segment had outstanding hedges in place on 2.0 Bcf of gas. These hedges are fixed price swap purchases that relate to the utilitys planned and discretionary hedging program for the winter heating season. These hedges have contract months from January 2008 through March 2008, and have a fair value liability of $2.4 million as of December 31, 2007. Hedging gains and losses for our Natural Gas Distribution segment are a component of the overall gas cost paid by the utilitys customers.
