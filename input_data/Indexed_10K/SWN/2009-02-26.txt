ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This Form 10 K contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements for many reasons, including the risks described in the Cautionary Statement About Forward Looking Statements below, in Item 1A, Risk Factors in Part I and elsewhere in this annual report. You should read the following discussion with the Selected Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this Form 10 K. OVERVIEW Southwestern Energy Company is an independent energy company primarily focused on the exploration and production of natural gas within the United States. Our operations primarily are located in Arkansas, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Texas. We are also focused on creating and capturing additional value at and beyond the wellhead through our established natural gas gathering and marketing businesses, which we refer to collectively as our Midstream Services. We have historically operated principally in three segments: Exploration and Production (E&P), Midstream Services and Natural Gas Distribution. Effective July 1, 2008, we sold our utility subsidiary, Arkansas Western Gas Company (AWG) and, as a result, we no longer have any natural gas distribution operations. The assets and liabilities of AWG were classified as held for sale in our December 31, 2007 balance sheet, however, the results of operations for AWG are appropriately consolidated in the statements of operations and are not presented as discontinued operations. We refer you to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. We are focused on providing long term growth in the net asset value of our business, which we achieve in our E&P business through the drillbit. We prepare economic analyses for each of the investment opportunities in our E&P business and rank them based upon the expected present value added for each dollar invested, which we refer to as PVI. The PVI of the future expected cash flows for each project is determined using a 10% discount rate. Our actual PVI results are utilized to help determine the allocation of our future capital investments. We derive the vast majority of our operating income and cash flow from the natural gas production of our E&P business and expect this to continue in the future. We expect that growth in our operating income and revenues will primarily depend on natural gas prices and our ability to increase our natural gas production. Our ability to increase our natural gas production is dependent upon our ability to economically find and produce natural gas, our ability to control costs and our ability to market natural gas on economically attractive terms to our customers. In recent years, there has been significant price volatility in natural gas and crude oil prices due to a variety of factors we cannot control or predict. These factors, which include weather conditions, political and economic events, and competition from other energy sources, impact supply and demand for natural gas, which in turn determines the sale prices for our production. In addition, the prices we realize for our production are affected by our hedging activities as well as locational differences in market prices. We are subject to credit risk relating to the risk of loss as a result of non performance by counterparties in our hedging activities. The counterparties are primarily major investment and commercial banks which management believes minimizes credit risks. The credit quality of each counterparty and the level of financial exposure we have to each counterparty are closely monitored to limit our credit risk exposure. We have not incurred any counterparty losses in 2006, 2007 and 2008 related to non performance and do not anticipate any losses given the information we have currently. However, given the current volatility in the financial markets, we cannot be certain that we will not experience such losses in the future. In 2008, our gas and oil production increased 71% to 194.6 Bcfe from 113.6 Bcfe in 2007. The 81.0 Bcfe increase in 2008 production was due to an 81.0 Bcf increase in net production from our Fayetteville Shale play. Increases in our East Texas and Arkoma net production were offset by decreases resulting from sales of oil and gas properties that occurred during 2008. In 2007, our production increased 57% to 113.6 Bcfe. The 41.2 Bcfe increase in 2007 production was due to a 41.7 Bcf increase in net production from our Fayetteville Shale play which was slightly offset by a net decrease in our other operating areas. We are targeting 2009 gas and oil production of 280.0 to 284.0 Bcfe, an increase of approximately 45% over our 2008 production. Our year end reserves grew 51% in 2008 to 2,184.6 Bcfe, up from 1,450.3 Bcfe at the end of 2007. These increases were also primarily fueled by the continued development of our Fayetteville Shale play. 36 SWN Table of Contents We reported net income of $567.9 million in 2008, or $1.64 per share on a fully diluted basis, up 157% from the prior year. Net income in 2008 included a $35.4 million net of tax gain, or $0.10 per diluted share, related to the sale of our utility subsidiary that closed July 1, 2008. Excluding the $35.4 million gain on the sale of the utility, the increase in net income in 2008 was a result of increased revenues of $1.1 billion, partially offset by an increase in operating costs and expenses of $551.1 million and an increase in interest expense of $5.0 million. Net income in 2007 increased approximately 36% to $221.2 million, or $0.64 per share, compared to 2006. The increase in net income in 2007 was a result of increased revenues of $492.0 million, partially offset by an increase in operating costs and expenses of $356.8 million and an increase in interest expense of $23.2 million. Our cash flow from operating activities increased 86% to $1,160.8 million in 2008 and 45% to $622.7 million in 2007, due to increases in net income and adjustments for non cash expenses. Operating income for our E&P segment was $813.5 million in 2008, $358.1 million in 2007 and $237.3 million in 2006. Operating income for our E&P segment increased in 2008 due to an increase in revenues of $695.4 million from an 82.4 Bcf increase in gas production volumes and a $0.72 increase in product prices, partially offset by an increase in operating costs and expenses of $239.9 million. Operating income for our E&P segment increased in 2007 due to an increase in revenues of $304.4 million from higher gas production volumes and increased product prices, partially offset by an increase in operating costs and expenses of $183.6 million. Operating income for our Midstream Services segment was $62.3 million in 2008, compared to $13.2 million in 2007 and $4.1 million in 2006. Operating income for our Midstream Services segment increased in 2008 due to an increase of $77.2 million in gathering revenues and an increase of $6.4 million in the margin generated from our natural gas marketing activities, which were partially offset by a $34.5 million increase in operating costs and expenses, exclusive of purchased gas costs. Operating income for our Midstream Services segment increased in 2007 due to an increase of $29.7 million in gathering revenues and an increase of $0.9 million in the margin generated from our natural gas marketing activities, which were partially offset by a $21.6 million increase in operating costs and expenses, exclusive of purchased gas costs. Operating income for our Natural Gas Distribution segment was $10.7 million for the six months in 2008 prior to the utility sale, compared to $10.0 million in 2007 and $4.5 million in 2006. The increase in operating income for our Natural Gas Distribution segment in 2007 resulted from a rate increase implemented in August, from colder weather and a decrease in operating costs and expenses. Our capital investments totaled approximately $1.8 billion in 2008, up 19% from $1.5 billion in the prior year. We invested $1.6 billion in our E&P segment in 2008, compared to $1.4 billion in 2007 and $861.0 million in 2006 (including $93.6 million invested in drilling rigs). Funds for our 2008 capital investments were provided by cash flow from operations and net proceeds of $964.0 million from our sales of E&P assets and our utility segment. As a result of our increased cash flow from operations and the proceeds received from asset sales, we were able to lower our total debt to capitalization ratio to 23% at December 31, 2008, down from 37% at December 31, 2007. For 2009, our planned capital investments are $1.9 billion, compared to our 2008 capital investments of approximately $1.8 billion, and include approximately $1.6 billion for our E&P segment, $220 million for our Midstream Services segment and $40 million for other corporate purposes. The $1.6 billion of E&P investments includes approximately $1.3 billion for the development of our Fayetteville Shale play and approximately 80% of our 2009 E&P capital is allocated to drilling. In addition to the planned investments in the Fayetteville Shale play, our E&P investments in 2009 will also focus on our active drilling programs in East Texas and other conventional drilling in the Arkoma Basin. We expect our capital investments in 2009 to be funded from operating cash flow, cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. The planned capital program for 2009 is flexible and can be modified, including downward, if the low natural gas price environment persists for an extended period of time. We will reevaluate our proposed investments as needed to take into account prevailing market conditions. 37 SWN Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Exploration and Production Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Revenues (in thousands) $ 1,491,302 $ 795,944 $ 491,545 Operating income (in thousands) $ 813,504 $ 358,079 $ 237,307 Gas production (Bcf) 192.3 109.9 68.1 Oil production (MBbls) 385 614 698 Total production (Bcfe) 194.6 113.6 72.3 Average gas price per Mcf, including hedges $ 7.52 $ 6.80 $ 6.55 Average gas price per Mcf, excluding hedges $ 7.73 $ 6.16 $ 6.37 Average oil price per Bbl, including hedges $ 107.18 $ 69.12 $ 58.36 Average oil price per Bbl, excluding hedges $ 107.18 $ 69.12 $ 63.17 Average unit costs per Mcfe: Lease operating expenses $ 0.89 $ 0.73 $ 0.66 General and administrative expenses $ 0.41 $ 0.48 $ 0.58 Taxes, other than income taxes $ 0.13 $ 0.16 $ 0.30 Full cost pool amortization $ 1.99 $ 2.41 $ 1.90 Revenues, Operating Income and Production Revenues. Revenues for our E&P segment were up $695.4 million, or 87%, in 2008, compared to the prior year. Approximately $544.3 million, or 78%, of the increase was attributable to an increase in production volumes and $152.4 million, or 22%, was attributable to higher gas and oil prices realized. E&P revenues were up $304.4 million, or 62%, in 2007, compared to 2006, of which approximately $268.7 million, or 88%, of the increase, was attributable to an increase in production volumes and $33.6 million, or 11%, was attributable to higher gas and oil prices realized. We expect our production volumes to continue to increase due to the development of our Fayetteville Shale play in Arkansas. We are unable to predict gas and oil prices which are subject to wide price fluctuations. As of February 23, 2009, we had hedged 135.0 Bcf of 2009 gas production and 50.0 Bcf of 2010 gas production to limit our exposure to price fluctuations. We refer you to Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K and to Commodity Prices below for additional information. Revenues for 2008, 2007 and 2006 also include pre tax gains of $4.8 million, $6.4 million and $4.0 million, respectively, related to the sale of gas in storage inventory. Operating Income. Operating income from our E&P segment was $813.5 million in 2008, an increase of 127% from 2007, as the 87% increase in revenues was partially offset by a 55% increase in operating costs and expenses. In 2007, operating income increased 51% to $358.1 million from $237.3 million in 2006, as the 62% increase in revenues was partially offset by a 72% increase in operating costs and expenses. Production. Gas and oil production was up approximately 71% to 194.6 Bcfe in 2008, as compared to the prior year, due to an 81.0 Bcf increase in net production from our Fayetteville Shale play, as a result of our ongoing development program and increases in our East Texas and Arkoma net production which were offset by decreases in net production resulting from the sale of all of our producing properties in the Permian and Gulf Coast. Gas and oil production in 2007 was up approximately 57% to 113.6 Bcfe, due to a 41.7 Bcf increase in net production from our Fayetteville Shale play and a 0.4 Bcfe decrease in our other operating areas. Our net production from the Fayetteville Shale play was 134.5 Bcf in 2008, up from 53.5 Bcf in 2007 and 11.8 Bcf in 2006. In the second quarter of 2008, we completed the sale of 55,631 net acres, or approximately 6% of our December 31, 2007 total net acres in the Fayetteville Shale play, and related facilities for $518.3 million. Production from the acreage sold was approximately 10.5 MMcf per day at the time of the sale. Additionally, we sold our Gulf Coast and Permian Basin properties in the second and third quarters of 2008. Production from these properties contributed approximately 3.1 Bcfe, 6.1 Bcfe and 8.4 Bcfe to total production in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Gas sales to unaffiliated purchasers were up 79% to 188.0 Bcf in 2008 and up 66% to 105.1 Bcf in 2007, compared to the prior years. Sales to unaffiliated purchasers are primarily made under contracts that reflect current short term prices and are subject to seasonal price swings. Intersegment sales to AWG for the six month period prior to the sale of the utility were 4.3 Bcf compared to 4.8 Bcf for the full year of 2007. We expect to continue to sell natural gas to the utility through an annual competitive bidding process. Future increases in demand for our gas production are expected to 38 SWN Table of Contents come from sales to unaffiliated purchasers. We are unable to predict changes in the market demand and price for natural gas, including weather related changes affecting demand for our production. We are targeting 2009 gas and oil production of 280.0 to 284.0 Bcfe, an increase of approximately 45% over our 2008 production. Based on early production histories and modeling, and assuming continued positive exploration and development results, approximately 229.0 to 232.0 Bcf of our 2009 targeted gas production is projected to come from our activities in the Fayetteville Shale play. Although we expect production volumes in 2009 to increase, we cannot guarantee our success in discovering, developing, and producing reserves, including with respect to our Fayetteville Shale play. Our ability to discover, develop and produce reserves is dependent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the availability of capital, the timing and extent of changes in natural gas and oil prices and competition. There are also many risks inherent to the discovery, development and production of natural gas and oil. We refer you to Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10 K for a discussion of these risks and the impact they could have on our financial condition and results of operations. Commodity Prices We periodically enter into various hedging and other financial arrangements with respect to a portion of our projected natural gas and crude oil production in order to ensure certain desired levels of cash flow and to minimize the impact of price fluctuations, including fluctuations in locational market differentials (we refer you to Item 7A of this Form 10 K and Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion). The average price realized for our gas production, including the effects of hedges, increased 11% to $7.52 per Mcf in 2008 and increased 4% to $6.80 per Mcf in 2007. The change in the average price realized reflects changes in average spot market prices and the effects of our price hedging activities. Our hedging activities decreased the average gas price $0.21 per Mcf in 2008, compared to increases of $0.64 per Mcf in 2007 and $0.18 per Mcf in 2006. In recent years, locational differences in market prices for natural gas have been wider than historically experienced. Disregarding the impact of hedges, historically the average price received for our gas production was approximately $0.30 to $0.50 per Mcf lower than average NYMEX spot market prices due to the locational market differentials. However, during 2008, 2007 and 2006, widening market differentials caused the difference in our average price received for our gas production to be approximately $0.70 to $1.30 per Mcf lower than spot market prices. The discount was at its widest point in late 2008 due to the impact that the delay in the completion of Boardwalk Pipeline had upon the Centerpoint East differential. Assuming a NYMEX commodity price for 2009 of $6.00 per Mcf of gas, the average price received for our gas production is expected to be approximately $0.75 per Mcf below the NYMEX Henry Hub index price, including the impact of our basis hedges. We hedged approximately 73% of our production in 2008 from the impact of widening basis differentials through our hedging activities and sales arrangements. Additionally, at December 31, 2008, we had basis protected on approximately 132.6 Bcf of our 2009 expected gas production through financial hedging activities and physical sales arrangements at a differential to NYMEX gas prices of approximately $0.30 per Mcf. In addition to the basis hedges discussed above, at December 31, 2008, we had NYMEX commodity price hedges in place on 135.0 Bcf of our 2009 expected future gas production and 50.0 Bcf of our 2010 expected future gas production. We realized an average price of $107.18 per barrel for our oil production for the year ended December 31, 2008, up approximately 55% from the prior year. The 2007 realized average price of $69.12 per barrel was up 18% from 2006. We did not hedge any of our 2008 or 2007 oil production. The average price we received for our oil production in 2006 was reduced by $4.81 per barrel due to the effects of our hedging activities. Assuming a NYMEX commodity price of $50.00 per barrel of oil for 2009, we expect the average price received for our oil production during 2009 to be approximately $1.50 per barrel lower than average spot market prices as market differentials reduce the average prices received. Operating Costs and Expenses Lease operating expenses per Mcfe for the E&P segment were $0.89 in 2008, compared to $0.73 in 2007 and $0.66 in 2006. Lease operating expenses per unit of production increased in 2008 and 2007 due primarily to higher per unit operating costs associated with our Fayetteville Shale operations, including the impact that higher natural gas prices had on the cost of compressor fuel in 2008. Our Fayetteville Shale production is growing rapidly and is expected to continue to provide upward pressure on our per unit operating costs. We expect our per unit operating cost for this segment to range between $0.87 and $0.92 per Mcfe in 2009. General and administrative expenses for the E&P segment were $0.41 per Mcfe in 2008, down from $0.48 per Mcfe in 2007 and $0.58 per Mcfe in 2006. The decreases in general and administrative costs per Mcfe in 2008 and 2007 were due to the effects of our increased production volumes. In total, general and administrative expenses for the E&P 39 SWN Table of Contents segment were $80.2 million in 2008, $54.8 million in 2007 and $41.9 million in 2006. The increases in general and administrative expenses since 2006 were primarily due to increases in payroll, incentive compensation and employee related costs associated with the expansion of our E&P operations due to the continued development of the Fayetteville Shale play. These increases accounted for $19.7 million, or 78%, of the 2008 increase and $9.4 million, or 73%, of the 2007 increase. We added 145 new E&P employees during 2008, compared to 176 employees added in 2007. In 2008 and 2007, increased expenses associated with leased aircraft and increases in information technology related expenses accounted for most of the remaining increases in general and administrative expenses. We expect our cost per unit for general and administrative expenses in 2009 to range between $0.32 and $0.37 per Mcfe. The expected decrease in per unit costs in 2009 is due to anticipated increased production volumes from our Fayetteville Shale play. Future changes in our general and administrative expenses for this segment are primarily dependent upon our salary costs, level of pension expense, stock based compensation expensing under Statement on Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R Share Based Payment (FAS 123R) and the amount of incentive compensation paid to our employees. For eligible employees, a portion of incentive compensation is based on the achievement of certain operating and performance results, including production, proved reserve additions, present value added for each dollar of capital invested, and lease operating expenses and general and administrative expenses per unit of production, while another portion is discretionary based upon an employees performance. Additional discretionary awards may also be awarded under the incentive compensation plan. See Critical Accounting Policies below for further discussion of pension expense. Our full cost pool amortization rate averaged $1.99 per Mcfe for 2008, $2.41 per Mcfe for 2007 and $1.90 per Mcfe for 2006. The decline in the average amortization rate for 2008 was primarily the result of the sales of oil and gas properties in 2008, the proceeds of which were credited to the full cost pool. The amortization rate is impacted by the timing and amount of reserve additions and the costs associated with those additions, revisions of previous reserve estimates due to both price and well performance, write downs that result from full cost ceiling tests, proceeds from the sale of properties that reduce the full cost pool and the levels of costs subject to amortization. We cannot predict our future full cost pool amortization rate with accuracy due to the variability of each of the factors discussed above, as well as other factors, including but not limited to the uncertainty of the amount of future reserves attributed to our Fayetteville Shale play. Based on recent well performance in the Fayetteville Shale play, we expect the amount of reserves from future wells to continue to increase which would, if all other factors remained constant, decrease our full cost pool amortization rate going forward. Unevaluated costs excluded from amortization were $540.6 million at the end of 2008, compared to $372.4 million at the end of 2007 and $166.8 million at the end of 2006. The increases in unevaluated costs during these periods resulted primarily from the increased activity in our Fayetteville Shale play. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our unevaluated costs excluded from amortization. Taxes other than income taxes per Mcfe were $0.13 in 2008, $0.16 in 2007 and $0.30 in 2006, and vary from year to year due to changes in severance and ad valorem taxes that result from the mix of our production volumes and fluctuations in commodity prices. Additionally, we accrued $5.0 million, or $0.03 per Mcfe, in 2008 for severance tax refunds related to our East Texas production, compared to $4.9 million, or $0.04 per Mcfe, in 2007. In April 2008, the State of Arkansas enacted legislation that will increase the severance tax on natural gas produced within the state to a base rate of 5%, effective January 1, 2009, subject to certain periods of reduced rates for high cost gas wells, new discovery gas wells and gas wells that produce below a specified level. We have evaluated the impact of the increase in the severance taxes with respect to all of our production within the State of Arkansas, including our Fayetteville Shale operations, and expect that our wells will qualify for the reduced rate exceptions noted above. We do not expect it to materially affect our results of operations in 2009 or beyond. The timing and amount of production and reserve additions attributed to our Fayetteville Shale play could have a material impact on our per unit costs; if production or reserves additions are lower than projected, our per unit costs could increase. We utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to the exploration, development, and acquisition of natural gas and oil reserves. Under this method, all such costs (productive and nonproductive) including salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method. These capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test that limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved natural gas and oil reserves discounted at 10 percent (standardized measure) plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties. Any costs in excess of the ceiling are written off as a non cash expense. The expense may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling. Full cost companies must use the prices in effect at the end of each accounting quarter, including the impact of derivatives qualifying as hedges, to calculate the ceiling value of their reserves. However, commodity price increases subsequent to the end of a reporting 40 SWN Table of Contents period but prior to the release of periodic reports may be utilized to calculate the ceiling value of reserves. At December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, our unamortized costs of natural gas and oil properties did not exceed this ceiling amount. At December 31, 2008, the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon quoted market prices of $5.71 per Mcf for Henry Hub gas and $41.00 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil, adjusted for market differentials. Cash flow hedges of gas production in place at December 31, 2008 increased the calculated ceiling value by approximately $338.7 million (net of tax). Excluding the benefit of the cash flow hedges at December 31, 2008, unamortized costs still did not exceed the ceiling value. At December 31, 2007, the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon quoted market prices of $6.80 per Mcf for Henry Hub gas and $92.50 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil, and at December 31, 2006, the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon quoted market prices of $5.64 per Mcf for Henry Hub gas and $57.25 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil. Decreases in market prices from December 31, 2008 levels, as well as changes in production rates, levels of reserves, the evaluation of costs excluded from amortization, future development costs, and service costs could result in future ceiling test impairments. Inflation impacts our E&P operations by generally increasing our operating costs and the costs of our capital additions. The effects of inflation on our operations prior to 2000 were minimal. However, since 2001, as commodity prices have generally increased, the impact of inflation has intensified in our E&P segment as shortages in drilling rigs, third party services and qualified labor have risen due to increased activity levels in the natural gas and oil industry. We have endeavored to mitigate rising costs by obtaining vendor pricing commitments for multiple projects and by offering performance bonuses related to increased economic efficiencies. During 2007, our E&P operations began experiencing decreases in certain costs for third party services primarily due to increased vendor competition in our Fayetteville Shale operating area. In late 2008, costs for third party services further declined as competition increased due to decreased activity levels in the natural gas and oil industry as a result of the economic turmoil in the United States and abroad. Midstream Services Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in millions, except volumes) Revenues marketing $ 2,059.1 $ 924.3 $ 467.3 Revenues gathering $ 114.9 $ 37.7 $ 7.9 Gas purchases marketing $ 2,043.5 $ 915.1 $ 458.9 Operating costs and expenses $ 68.2 $ 33.7 $ 12.2 Operating income $ 62.3 $ 13.2 $ 4.1 Gas volumes marketed (Bcf) 258.0 145.7 72.7 Gas volumes gathered (Bcf) 224.1 78.7 14.6 Revenues and Operating Income Revenues. Revenues from our Midstream Services segment were up 126% to $2.2 billion in 2008 and up 102% to $962.0 million in 2007, as compared to prior years. The increase in marketing revenues for 2008 resulted from a 112.3 Bcf increase in volumes marketed and a 26% increase in the price received for volumes marketed. Approximately 92% of the increase in gathering revenues for 2008 resulted from increases in volumes gathered related to the Fayetteville Shale play. The increase in marketing revenues for 2007 resulted from a 73.0 Bcf increase in volumes marketed largely resulting from increased production from the Fayetteville Shale play, partially offset by a 1% decrease in the price received for volumes marketed. Of the total volumes marketed, production from our E&P operated wells accounted for 96% in 2008, 89% in 2007 and 85% in 2006. Increases and decreases in marketing revenues due to changes in commodity prices are largely offset by corresponding changes in gas purchase expenses. Gathering volumes, revenues and expenses for this segment are expected to continue to grow as reserves related to our Fayetteville Shale play are developed and production increases. Operating Income. Operating income from our Midstream Services segment increased 371% to $62.3 million in 2008 and 222% to $13.2 million in 2007 as a result of the increases in gathering revenues from the Fayetteville Shale play and increases in the margin generated by gas marketing activities, partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses. The margin generated from natural gas marketing activities was $15.6 million for 2008, compared to $9.2 million for 2007 and $8.4 million for 2006. Margins may fluctuate depending on the prices paid for commodities and the ultimate disposition of those commodities. The increases in volumes marketed in 2008 and 2007, as compared to prior years, resulted from marketing our increased E&P production volumes. We enter into hedging activities from time to time with respect to our gas marketing activities to provide margin protection. We refer you to Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk and Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. As noted above, gathering revenues and expenses are expected to continue to grow as a result of our Fayetteville Shale activities. 41 SWN Table of Contents Our Midstream Services segment has significant commitments for transportation services related to its marketing activities and compression for its gathering activities. See Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments below for further discussion. Natural Gas Distribution Year Ended December 31, 2008(1) 2007 2006 ($ in thousands, except for per Mcf amounts) Revenues $ 117,710 $ 174,466 $ 172,207 Gas purchases $ 79,120 $ 111,338 $ 112,922 Operating costs and expenses $ 27,857 $ 53,168 $ 54,811 Operating income $ 10,733 $ 9,960 $ 4,474 Sales and end use transportation deliveries (Bcf) 14.5 23.6 21.8 Sales customers at year end n/a 151,988 151,003 Average sales rate per Mcf $ 11.61 $ 11.07 $ 12.30 Annual heating weather degree days n/a 3,699 3,413 Percent of normal n/a 91% 83% (1) The 2008 column reflects results for the first six months of 2008 prior to the sale of the utility. Effective July 1, 2008, we sold all of the capital stock of AWG for $223.5 million (net of expenses related to the sale). In order to receive regulatory approval for the sale and certain related transactions, we paid $9.8 million to AWG for the benefit of its customers. A gain on the sale of $57.3 million ($35.4 million after tax) was recorded in the third quarter of 2008. As a result of the sale of AWG, we no longer have any natural gas distribution operations. The 2008 column in the table above reflects results for the first six months of 2008, which represents the period of our ownership of AWG in 2008. Transportation In 2006, we sold our 25% partnership interest in NOARK Pipeline System, Limited Partnership (NOARK) to Atlas Pipeline Partners, L.P. for $69.0 million and recognized a pre tax gain of approximately $10.9 million ($6.7 million after tax) relating to the transaction. We recorded pre tax income from operations related to our investment in NOARK of $0.9 million in 2006. Income from operations and the gain on the sale in the second quarter of 2006 were recorded in other income in our statements of operations. Other Revenues In 2008, 2007 and 2006, other revenues included pre tax gains of $4.8 million, $6.4 million and $4.0 million, respectively, related to the sale of gas in storage inventory. Interest Expense and Interest Income Interest costs, net of capitalization, increased to $28.9 million in 2008 and to $23.9 million in 2007 due to our increased average levels of borrowings outstanding that resulted from our increased level of capital investments. Our debt level had decreased $243.4 million to $735.4 million by year end 2008 due to cash flow in excess of capital investments generated by the $964.0 million of proceeds received for our asset sales. We refer you to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Requirements and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt. Interest capitalized increased to $34.5 million in 2008, up from $13.8 million in 2007 and $11.8 million in 2006, as our costs excluded from amortization in the E&P segment have continued to increase along with the overall increased level of our capital investments. Costs excluded from amortization in the E&P segment increased to $540.6 million at December 31, 2008, compared to $372.4 million at December 31, 2007. Total capital investments for our E&P segment were $1.6 billion in 2008, up from $1.4 billion in 2007. 42 SWN Table of Contents During 2008, 2007 and 2006, we earned interest income of $4.4 million, $0.1 million and $6.3 million, respectively, related to our cash investments. These amounts are recorded in other income on the Statements of Operations. Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes was an effective rate of 38.2% for 2008, compared to 38.1% in 2007 and 37.9% in 2006. Any changes in the provision for income taxes recorded each period result primarily from the level of income before income taxes, adjusted for permanent differences. As a result of the gains from the E&P asset sales and the sale of the utility, we used all of our net operating loss carryforward in 2008 and were subject to current taxes of $122.0 million, of which $107.5 million was paid in 2008. We also generated an alternative minimum tax credit in 2008 of $121.5 million which will be utilized to reduce future taxes. We do not expect to be subject to current taxes in 2009. Pension Expense We incurred pension costs of $6.5 million in 2008 for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans, compared to $5.3 million in 2007 and $4.0 million in 2006. As a result of the sale of AWG, we transferred pension and other postretirement plan assets and liabilities related to the employees of AWG to the purchaser. Although our net periodic benefit costs for our pension and other postretirement plans were approximately 30% lower in the second half of 2008 compared to the first half of 2008, our pension costs for the year were higher due to the deterioration of the markets in the second half of 2008. The amount of pension expense recorded is determined by actuarial calculations and is also impacted by the funded status of our plans. During 2008, we contributed $9.8 million to our pension plans and $0.3 million to our other postretirement plans, compared to $6.5 million and $0.4 million, respectively, in 2007. The recent decline in the financial markets may require changes in managements assumptions relative to expected return on plan assets which could, in turn, adversely impact the funded status of our pension plans and increase the amount of future contribution requirements. For further discussion of our pension plans, we refer you to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements and Critical Accounting Policies below. Stock Based Compensation Expense We recognized expense of $7.6 million and capitalized $3.9 million to gas and oil properties for stock based compensation in 2008, compared to $5.4 million expensed and $2.6 million capitalized to gas and oil properties in 2007 and $5.2 million expensed and $1.7 million capitalized to gas and oil properties in 2006. We refer you to Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our equity based compensation plans. Additionally in 2008, we recorded expense of $0.3 million related to the valuation of company shares held in our non qualified deferred compensation plan, compared to $0.9 million expensed and $0.6 million capitalized to gas and oil properties in 2007. Adoption of Accounting Principles During the first quarter of 2008, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157). FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. In addition to required disclosures, FAS 157 also requires companies to evaluate current measurement techniques. The adoption of FAS 157 had no material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. During the first quarter of 2008, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (FAS 159). FAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. FAS 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The adoption of FAS 159 had no impact on our results of operations and financial condition. 43 SWN Table of Contents In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51 (FAS 160). FAS 160 will change the financial accounting and reporting of noncontrolling (or minority) interests in consolidated financial statements, and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. FAS 160 will impact the presentation of our balance sheet line item Minority Interest related to our Overton partnership, a partnership formed by SEPCO with an investor to drill and complete 14 wells in the Overton Field in East Texas, but is expected to have no material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS 157 2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157 (FSP FAS 157 2). FSP FAS 157 2 delays the effective date of FAS 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). FSP FAS 157 2 is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009. The adoption of FSP FAS 157 2 is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (FAS 161). FAS 161 requires enhanced disclosures for derivative instruments and hedging activities that include explanations of how and why an entity uses derivatives, how instruments and the related hedged items are accounted for under FAS 133 and related interpretations, and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect the entitys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. FAS 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. The adoption of FAS 161 is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS 157 3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active (FSP FAS 157 3). FSP FAS 157 3 clarifies the application of FAS 157, Fair Value Measurements, when a market for that financial asset is inactive. FSP FAS 157 3 became effective for financial statements upon issuance and its adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Late in 2008, the SEC adopted major revisions to its required oil and gas reporting disclosures which become effective as of January 1, 2010. Among other things, the amendments provide for the use of the 12 month average price, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month within the 12 month period prior to the end of the reporting period for purposes of both the disclosure and full cost accounting rules. With respect to accounting pronouncements that currently make reference to a single day pricing regime with respect to oil and gas reserves, the SEC indicated that it was communicating with the FASB staff to align the standards used in the FASBs pronouncements with the new 12 month average price and that it will consider whether to delay the compliance date based on its discussions with the FASB. The SEC expressed the view that the change from using single day year end price to an average price should be treated as a change in accounting principle, or a change in the method of applying an accounting principle, that is inseparable from a change in accounting estimate and that the change would be considered a change in accounting estimate pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 154 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections (SFAS 154) and accounted for prospectively. The SEC further expressed that the view that any accounting change resulting from the changes in definitions and required pricing assumptions in Rule 4 10 of Regulation S X should be treated as a change in accounting principle that is inseparable from a change in accounting estimate, not requiring retroactive revision but requiring recognition in the independent auditors report through the addition of an explanatory paragraph. We will not be able to determine the impact of these amendments on our results of operation or financial condition until the FASB issues its pronouncements. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We depend primarily on internally generated funds, our unsecured revolving credit facility, funds accessed through debt and equity markets and periodic asset sales as our primary sources of liquidity. We may borrow up to $1.0 billion under our revolving credit facility from time to time. The amount available under our revolving credit facility may be increased up to $1.25 billion at any time upon our agreement with our existing or additional lenders. As of December 31, 2008, we had no indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility and at December 31, 2007, we had $842.2 million outstanding under the facility. During 2009, we expect to draw on a portion of the funds available under the facility to fund our planned capital investments (discussed below under Capital Investments), which are expected to exceed the net cash generated by our operations and the remaining net proceeds from our asset sales in 2008. 44 SWN Table of Contents On January 16, 2008, we completed a private placement of $600 million of 7.5% Senior Notes due 2018 (discussed below under Financing Requirements). Net proceeds of approximately $591 million from the offering were used to pay outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility. In the second quarter of 2008, we completed the sale of 55,631 net acres, or approximately 6% of our total net acres in the Fayetteville Shale play, for approximately $518.3 million. Additionally in 2008, we sold various oil and gas properties in the Gulf Coast and the Permian Basin for approximately $240.0 million in the aggregate. Effective July 1, 2008, we closed the previously announced sale of our utility, AWG, to SourceGas, LLC. We received $223.5 million (net of expenses related to the sale) and, in order to receive regulatory approval for the sale and certain related transactions, paid $9.8 million to AWG for the benefit of its customers. We recorded a pre tax gain on the sale of AWG of $57.3 million in the third quarter of 2008. In total, we received $964.0 million in proceeds from asset sales during 2008 which were utilized to pay down borrowings under our revolving credit facility and fund a portion of our 2008 capital investment program. The remaining proceeds were invested in cash equivalents and will be used to help fund our 2009 capital investments program. Net cash provided by operating activities increased 86% to $1.2 billion in 2008, due to a $516.3 million increase in net income and adjustments for non cash expenses. Net cash provided by operating activities increased 45% to $622.7 million in 2007, due to a $237.7 million increase in net income and adjustments for non cash expenses. For 2008, requirements for our capital investments were funded from our revolving credit facility, cash generated by operating activities and the net proceeds from our asset sales. Net cash from operating activities provided 65% of our cash requirements for capital investments in 2008, 41% in 2007 and 46% in 2006. At December 31, 2008, our capital structure consisted of 23% debt and 77% equity, and we had $196.3 million in cash and cash equivalents. We believe that our operating cash flow, the remaining proceeds from our asset sales and available funds under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our capital and operating requirements for 2009. The credit status of the financial institutions participating in our revolving credit facility could adversely impact our ability to borrow funds under the facility. While we believe all of the lenders under the facility have the ability to provide funds, we cannot predict whether each will be able to meet its obligation under the facility. Current economic conditions make it difficult to access debt and equity markets for funding. Given the unused capacity on our revolving credit facility and our expectations of cash flow from our future operations, we do not plan on accessing those markets in the near term. Our cash flow from operating activities is highly dependent upon the market prices that we receive for our gas and oil production. Natural gas and oil prices are subject to wide fluctuations and are driven by market supply and demand factors which are impacted by the overall state of the economy. The price received for our production is also influenced by our commodity hedging activities, as more fully discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K and Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Our commodity hedging activities are subject to the credit risk of our counterparties being financially unable to complete the transaction. We actively monitor the credit status of our counterparties, performing both quantitative and qualitative assessments based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable, and to date have not had any credit defaults associated with our transactions. However, any future failures by one or more counterparties could negatively impact our cash flow from operating activities. Additionally, our short term cash flows are dependent on the timely collection of receivables from our customers and partners. We actively manage this risk through credit management activities and, through the date of this filing, have not experienced any significant write offs for non collectible amounts. However, any sustained inaccessibility of credit by our customers and partners could adversely impact our cash flows. Due to the above factors, we are unable to forecast with certainty our future level of cash flow from operations. Accordingly, we will adjust our discretionary uses of cash dependent upon available cash flow. 45 SWN Table of Contents Capital Investments Our capital investments increased 19% to approximately $1.8 billion in 2008 and increased 59% in 2007 to approximately $1.5 billion. Capital investments include an increase of $36.2 million in 2008, a reduction of $20.6 million in 2007 and an increase of $88.9 million for 2006 related to the change in accrued expenditures between years. Our E&P segment investments in 2008 were $1.6 billion, up from $1.4 billion in 2007 and $861.0 million in 2006. Capital investments for 2006 included $93.6 million for drilling rigs and related equipment which were subsequently sold and leased back in December 2006. 2008 2007 2006 (in thousands) Exploration and production Exploration and development $ 1,569,089 $ 1,375,204 $ 767,400 Drilling rigs and related equipment 26,739 4,453 93,641 1,595,828 1,379,657 861,041 Midstream services 183,021 107,363 48,660 Natural gas distribution 3,574 (1) 11,375 11,232 Other 13,745 4,743 21,474 $ 1,796,168 $ 1,503,138 $ 942,407 (1) Natural gas distribution capital investments are through June 30, 2008, prior to the sale of this segment. Our capital investments for 2009 are planned to be $1.9 billion, consisting of $1.6 billion for E&P, $220 million for Midstream Services and $40 million for other corporate purposes. We expect to allocate approximately $1.3 billion of our 2009 E&P capital to our Fayetteville Shale play, up from approximately $1.2 billion in 2008. Our planned level of capital investments in 2009 is expected to allow us to accelerate our drilling activity in the Fayetteville Shale, continue the development of our properties in East Texas, continue our conventional drilling in the Arkoma Basin, maintain our present markets, explore and develop other existing gas and oil properties and generate new drilling prospects. As discussed above, our 2009 capital investment program is expected to be funded through cash flow from operations, borrowings under our credit facility and the remaining net proceeds from our 2008 asset sales. The planned capital program for 2009 is flexible and can be modified, including downward, if the low natural gas price environment persists for an extended period of time. We will reevaluate our proposed investments as needed to take into account prevailing market conditions. Financing Requirements Our total debt outstanding was $735.4 million at December 31, 2008, including $61.2 million classified as short term debt on our balance sheet, compared to $978.8 million at December 31, 2007. Our 7.625% Senior Notes due 2027 are putable by the note holders on May 1, 2009, and as a result, the $60 million principal balance of these notes has been reclassified to short term debt in our balance sheet. If the put option is exercised in 2009, we would use cash available to pay the notes, or alternatively, we would borrow the required funds under our revolving credit facility. Our unsecured revolving credit facility has a borrowing capacity of $1.0 billion, which may be increased to $1.25 billion at any time upon our agreement with our existing or additional lenders. As of December 31, 2008, we had no indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility compared to $842.2 million outstanding as of December 31, 2007. As discussed more fully below, in January 2008, we issued $600 million of 7.5% Senior Notes due 2018, the net proceeds of which were used to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility. The interest rate on the credit facility is calculated based upon our public debt rating and is currently 87.5 basis points over LIBOR. The revolving credit facility is currently guaranteed by our subsidiaries, SEECO, Inc. (SEECO), Southwestern Energy Production Company (SEPCO) and Southwestern Energy Services Company (SES) and requires additional subsidiary guarantors if certain guaranty coverage levels are not satisfied. Our publicly traded notes are rated BB+ by Standard and Poors and we have a Corporate Family Rating of Ba2 by Moodys. Any downgrades in our public debt ratings could increase our cost of funds under the credit facility. Our revolving credit facility contains covenants which impose certain restrictions on us. Under the credit agreement, we may not issue total debt in excess of 60% of our total capital, must maintain a certain level of stockholders equity and must maintain a ratio of EBITDA to interest expense of 3.5 or above. Additionally, there are certain limitations on the amount of indebtedness that may be incurred by our subsidiaries. We were in compliance with all of the covenants of our credit agreement at December 31, 2008. Although we do not anticipate any violations of our financial covenants, our ability to comply with those covenants is dependent upon the success of our exploration and development program and upon factors beyond our control, such as the market prices for natural gas and oil. If we are unable to borrow under our credit facility, we would have to decrease our capital investment plans. 46 SWN Table of Contents On January 16, 2008, we issued $600 million of 7.5% Senior Notes due 2018 in a private placement, which are rated BB+ by Standard and Poors and Ba2 by Moodys. If we undergo a change of control, as defined in the indenture, holders of the 7.5% Senior Notes will have the option to require us to purchase all or any portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the change of control date. Payment obligations with respect to the 7.5% Senior Notes are currently guaranteed by SEECO, SEPCO and SES, which guarantees may be unconditionally released in certain circumstances. As a result of the issuance of the guarantees of the 7.5% Senior Notes, and in order for all of our senior notes to rank equally, on May 2, 2008, we and our subsidiaries, SEECO, SEPCO and SES, entered into supplemental indenture agreements with the trustees under the indentures relating to our 7.625% Medium Term Notes due 2027, 7.125% Fixed Rate Notes due October 10, 2017, 7.35% Fixed Rate Notes due October 2, 2017 and 7.15% Notes due 2018, pursuant to which SEECO, SEPCO and SES became guarantors of such notes to the same extent to which such subsidiaries have guaranteed our 7.5% Senior Notes. We refer you to Note 4, "Condensed Consolidating Financial Information" in this Form 10 K for additional information. The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability and or our subsidiaries ability to incur liens, to engage in sale and leaseback transactions and to merge, consolidate or sell assets. At December 31, 2008, our capital structure consisted of 23% debt and 77% equity, and we had available $196.3 million in cash and cash equivalents. Our debt as a percentage of total capital declined throughout 2008, primarily due to our operating results and the use of a portion of the proceeds received from our asset sales to reduce debt. Stockholders equity at December 31, 2008, includes a net gain of $258.9 million in accumulated other comprehensive income related to our hedging activities that is required to be recorded under the provisions of Statement on Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (FAS 133), and a loss of $10.9 million related to changes in our pension and other postretirement liabilities recorded under the provisions of Statement on Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (FAS 158). The amount recorded for FAS 133 is based on current fair values of our hedges at December 31, 2008, and does not necessarily reflect the value that we will receive or pay when the hedges are ultimately settled, nor does it take into account revenues to be received associated with the physical delivery of sales volumes hedged. Our credit facilitys financial covenants with respect to capitalization percentages exclude the effects of non cash entries that result from FAS 133 and FAS 158 and the non cash impact of any full cost ceiling write downs. Our capital structure at December 31, 2008 would have been 25% debt and 75% equity without consideration of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity related to our commodity hedge position and our pension and other postretirement liabilities. As part of our strategy to ensure a certain level of cash flow to fund our operations, we have hedged 135.0 Bcf of our expected 2009 gas production and 50.0 Bcf of our expected 2010 gas production. The amount of long term debt we incur will be dependent upon commodity prices and our capital investment plans. If commodity prices significantly decrease, we may decrease and or reallocate our planned capital investments. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In December 2006, we entered into a sale and leaseback transaction pursuant to which we sold 13 operating drilling rigs, 2 rigs yet to be delivered and related equipment and then leased such drilling rigs and equipment under leases that expire on January 1, 2015. Subject to certain conditions, we have options to purchase the rigs and related equipment from the lessors at the end of the 84th month of the lease term at an agreed upon price or at the end of the lease term for the then fair market value. Additionally, we have the option to renew each lease for a negotiated renewal term at a periodic rental equal to the fair market rental value of the rigs as determined at the time of renewal. In 2007, we sold and leased back additional drilling rig equipment receiving proceeds of $3.1 million, and leased an additional $5.9 million of drilling rig equipment, under similar terms as the 2006 transaction. In December 2008, pursuant to the terms of the lease, one of the lessors required us to pay $10.5 million, the stipulated loss value, for a rig that suffered a casualty. The payment of the stipulated loss value is treated as a purchase of the rig and is reflected in capital investments within the statement of cash flows. Our current aggregate annual rental payment for drilling rigs and related equipment under the leases is approximately $19.4 million. 47 SWN Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments We have various contractual obligations in the normal course of our operations and financing activities. Significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2008, were as follows: Contractual Obligations: Payments Due by Period Less than More than Total 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years 5 Years (in thousands) Demand charges(1) $ 892,429 $ 72,878 $ 192,557 $ 168,338 $ 458,656 Debt(2) 735,400 61,200 2,400 2,400 669,400 Interest on senior notes(3) 455,908 51,931 100,530 100,187 203,260 Rig leases(4) 116,261 19,377 38,754 38,754 19,376 Purchase obligations(5) 101,443 101,443 Compression services(6) 92,075 26,413 46,272 19,390 Operating leases(7) 71,642 15,398 24,286 17,356 14,602 Operating agreements(8) 41,968 38,716 3,252 Other obligations(9) 31,817 27,037 4,780 $2,538,943 $ 414,393 $ 412,831 $ 346,425 $ 1,365,294 (1) Our Midstream Services segment has commitments for demand transportation charges of approximately $888.1 million related to the Fayetteville Shale play and approximately $3.0 million related to East Texas. Our E&P segment has commitments for approximately $1.3 million of demand transportation charges. (2) Debt includes $60.0 million of our 7.625% Senior Notes that are putable at the holders option in May 2009 and $35.4 million of our 7.15% Notes due 2018 which requires semi annual principal payments of $0.6 million. (3) Interest on the senior notes includes interest through May 2009 on the $60 million notes that are due in 2027 and putable at the holders option. (4) We have commitments related to the leasing of 14 drilling rigs and related equipment through 2014. (5) Purchase obligations consist of outstanding purchase orders under existing agreements. Our Midstream Services segment has outstanding purchase obligations of $81.5 million relating to compression units, $61.7 million of which have been assigned to financial institutions in connection with anticipated lease arrangements. At December 31, 2008, the financial institutions had advanced approximately $20.7 million for payments of these purchase obligations and we pay interest on the advanced amounts. (6) Our Midstream Services segment has commitments of approximately $84.6 million and our E&P segment has commitments of approximately $7.4 million for compression services associated primarily with our Fayetteville Shale play and our Overton operations. (7) Operating leases include costs for compressors, aircraft, office space and equipment under non cancelable operating leases expiring through 2018. (8) Our E&P segment has commitments for up to $36.3 million in termination fees related to rig operator agreements. Additionally, our E&P segment has secured rig moving services by committing monthly take or pay amounts of $469,000, expiring in December 2009. (9) Our other significant contractual obligations include approximately $16.0 million related to seismic services, approximately $6.1 million for funding of benefit plans and approximately $2.8 million for various information technology support and data subscription agreements. Additionally, our E&P segment has committed up to $3.0 million in termination fees to a gravel company. We refer you to Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of our debt. Contingent Liabilities and Commitments Substantially all of our employees are covered by defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans. Based on actuarial data and taking into account the transfer of pension assets and obligations related to the sale of AWG, we recorded expenses of approximately $6.5 million in 2008 for these plans. At December 31, 2008, we recognized a liability of $15.4 million as a result of the underfunded status of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans, compared to a liability of $14.6 million at December 31, 2007. As a result of actuarial data, we expect to record expenses of $7.1 million for these plans in 2009. For further information regarding our pension and other postretirement benefit plans, we refer you to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements and Critical Accounting Policies below for additional information. Pursuant to the precedent agreement with Texas Gas Transmission, LLC (Texas Gas), a subsidiary of Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP, in the third quarter of 2008, SES entered into firm transportation agreements with Texas Gas relating to its commitments for the Fayetteville and Greenville Laterals. SES options to increase the volumes to be transported on 48 SWN Table of Contents each of the laterals were fully exercised in 2008 and SES has maximum aggregate commitments of 800,000 MMBtu per day on the Fayetteville Lateral and 640,000 MMBtu per day on the Greenville Lateral. SES obligations under these agreements are reflected in the Contractual Obligations table above. In addition, we have guaranteed a portion of SES obligations under the firm transportation agreements with Texas Gas. Our payment obligations under the guaranty are limited to the lesser of (i) 25% of SES negotiated demand charges for the full term of the agreement(s), less any payments made by us pursuant to the guaranty, or (ii) 25% of SES negotiated demand charges for the remaining initial terms of the agreement(s) as of the first day of the month of services under the agreements for which payment is claimed, which amount shall reflect any reductions in SES obligations under the agreements. In September 2008, SES entered into a precedent agreement pursuant to which it will contract for firm gas transportation services on a proposed new pipeline of Fayetteville Express Pipeline LLC (FEP), which is jointly owned by Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. and Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. SES will be a foundation shipper for the project and will use the new pipeline primarily to deliver gas volumes produced from our operations in the Fayetteville Shale play in central Arkansas to eastern markets. Pending regulatory approvals, the pipeline is expected to have an estimated ultimate capacity of up to 2.0 Bcf per day and to be in service by late 2010 or early 2011. Following the approval of the pipeline by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and subject to certain conditions, pursuant to the precedent agreement, SES will enter into a firm transportation agreement to transport up to 1,200,000 Dekatherms per day for an initial term of ten years. In connection with the precedent agreement, we delivered to FEP a guaranty of SES obligations under the precedent agreement and the firm transportation agreements to be entered into thereunder. Initially, and during any period in which SES meets the creditworthiness requirements of the precedent agreement, our payment obligations under the guaranty are zero but will increase upon the occurrence of certain events. In the fourth quarter of 2008, one of our gathering subsidiaries, DeSoto Gathering Company, L.L.C. (DGC), entered into agreements with financial institutions in contemplation of leasing up to 50 compression units pursuant to which those institutions were assigned $61.7 million of our purchase obligations for the units and provided advances for payment of those obligations. At December 31, 2008, the financial institutions had advanced $20.7 million with respect to the purchase obligations and we will pay interest on the advanced amounts until the leases commence. The commencement of the leases is contingent upon certain criteria including, but not limited to, the delivery of the compressors. If the leases do not commence, we must repay all advances and the purchase obligations for the compression units revert back to us. Purchase obligations and interim interest obligations relating to compression units are reflected in the Contractual Obligations table above. We expect to begin receiving the units in the first quarter of 2009, with all of the units expected to be delivered by the end of 2009. Aggregate rental payments, including interim interest, are expected to total approximately $60.1 million over the terms of the leases, which will vary between seven and eight years. In addition, we have guaranteed DGCs obligations under the advances and the anticipated leases subject to an aggregate cap of $100 million. We are subject to litigation and claims (including with respect to environmental matters) that arise in the ordinary course of business. Management believes, individually or in aggregate, such litigation and claims will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or our results of operations, but these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and managements view may change in the future, at which time management may reserve amounts that are reasonably estimable. Working Capital We maintain access to funds that may be needed to meet capital requirements through our revolving credit facility described above. We had positive working capital of $96.4 million at December 31, 2008, and negative working capital of $67.6 million at December 31, 2007. Current assets increased $525.9 million at December 31, 2008, compared to current assets at December 31, 2007, due to a $278.8 million increase in our current hedging asset, a $195.6 million increase in cash and cash equivalents from proceeds remaining from the sale of our utility segment and certain oil and gas assets, and a $76.9 million increase in accounts receivable, which were partially offset by a decrease of $58.9 million in current assets held for sale related to our utility segment. Current liabilities increased $362.0 million as a result of an increase of $151.1 million in accounts payable, an increase of $101.5 million in our current deferred income taxes related to our hedging activities, a $60.0 million increase due to the reclassification of our 7.625% Senior Notes to short term, a $38.6 million increase in advances from partners, a $26.9 million increase in current taxes payable and an increase of $18.6 million in interest payable. 49 SWN Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Natural Gas and Oil Properties We utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to the exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and oil reserves. Under this method, all such costs (productive and nonproductive), including salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method. These capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test that limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved natural gas and oil reserves discounted at 10 percent (standardized measure) plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties. Any costs in excess of the ceiling are written off as a non cash expense. The expense may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling. Full cost companies must use the prices in effect at the end of each accounting quarter, including the impact of derivatives qualifying as hedges, to calculate the ceiling value of their reserves. However, commodity price increases subsequent to the end of a reporting period but prior to the release of periodic reports may be utilized to calculate the ceiling value of reserves. At December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, our unamortized costs of natural gas and oil properties did not exceed this ceiling amount. At December 31, 2008, the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon quoted market prices of $5.71 per Mcf for Henry Hub gas and $41.00 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil, adjusted for market differentials. Cash flow hedges of gas production in place at December 31, 2008, increased the calculated ceiling value by approximately $338.7 million (net of tax). Excluding the benefit of the cash flow hedges at December 31, 2008, unamortized costs still did not exceed the ceiling value. We had approximately 185.0 Bcf of future gas production hedged at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2007, the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon quoted market prices of $6.80 per Mcf for Henry Hub gas and $92.50 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil, and at December 31, 2006, the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon quoted market prices of $5.64 per Mcf for Henry Hub gas and $57.25 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil. Decreases in market prices from December 31, 2008 levels, as well as changes in production rates, levels of reserves, the evaluation of costs excluded from amortization, future development costs, and service costs could result in future ceiling test impairments. The risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties increases when natural gas and oil prices are depressed or if there are substantial downward revisions in estimated proved reserves. Under the SECs current full cost accounting rules, our reserves are required to be priced using prices in effect at the end of the reporting period. Application of these rules during periods of relatively low natural gas or oil prices due to seasonality or other reasons, even if temporary, increases the probability of a ceiling test write down. Natural gas pricing has historically been unpredictable and any declines could result in a ceiling test write down in subsequent quarterly or annual reporting periods. Under new rules recently issued by the SEC that will be effective January 1, 2010, reserves will be priced using the 12 month average price, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month within the 12 month period prior to the end of the reporting period. Natural gas and oil reserves used in the full cost method of accounting cannot be measured exactly. Our estimate of natural gas and oil reserves requires extensive judgments of reservoir engineering data and is generally less precise than other estimates made in connection with financial disclosures. Our reservoir engineers prepare our reserve estimates under the supervision of our management. Reserve estimates are prepared for each of our properties annually by the reservoir engineers assigned to the asset management team to which the property is assigned. These estimates are reviewed by senior engineers who are not part of the asset management teams and our President and Chief Operating Officer. Final authority over the estimates of our proved reserves rests with our Board of Directors. In each of the past three years, performance revisions to our proved reserve estimates represented no greater than 8% of our total proved reserve estimates, which we believe is indicative of the effectiveness of our internal controls. Proved developed reserves generally have a higher degree of accuracy in this estimation process, when compared to proved undeveloped and proved non producing reserves, as production history and pressure data over time is available for the majority of our proved developed properties. Proved developed reserves account for 62% of our total reserve base at December 31, 2008. Assigning monetary values to such estimates does not reduce the subjectivity and changing nature of such reserve estimates. The uncertainties inherent in the reserve estimates are compounded by applying additional estimates of the rates and timing of production and the costs that will be incurred in developing and producing the reserves. We cannot assure you that our internal controls sufficiently address the numerous uncertainties and risks that are inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas and oil reserves and projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures as many factors are beyond our control. We refer you to Although our estimated natural gas and oil reserve data is independently audited, our estimates may still prove to be inaccurate in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of Part I of this Form 10 K for a more detailed discussion of these uncertainties, risks and other factors. 50 SWN Table of Contents We engage the services of Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., an independent petroleum engineering firm, or NSA, to audit our reserves as estimated by our reservoir engineers. NSA reports the results of the reserves audit to our Board of Directors. In conducting its audit, the engineers and geologists of NSA study our major properties in detail and independently develop reserve estimates. NSAs audit consists primarily of substantive testing, which includes a detailed review of major properties that account for approximately 83% of present worth of the companys total proved reserves. NSAs audit process consists of sorting all fields by descending present value order and selecting the fields from highest value to descending value until the selected fields account for more than 80% of the present worth of our reserves. The properties in the bottom 20% of the total present worth are not reviewed in the audit. The fields included in approximately the top 83% present value as of December 31, 2008, accounted for approximately 83% of our total proved reserves and approximately 92% of our proved undeveloped reserves. In the conduct of its audit, NSA did not independently verify the data we provided to them with respect to ownership interests, oil and gas production, well test data, historical costs of operation and development, product prices, or any agreements relating to current and future operations of the properties and sales of production. NSA has advised us that if, in the course of its audit, something came to its attention that brought into question the validity or sufficiency of any such information or data, NSA did not rely on such information or data until it had satisfactorily resolved any questions relating thereto or had independently verified such information or data. For the year ended December 31, 2008, NSA issued its audit opinion as to the reasonableness of our reserve estimates, stating that our estimated proved oil and gas reserves are, in the aggregate, reasonable and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles. A decline in gas and oil prices used to calculate the discounted future net revenues of our reserves affects both the present value of cash flows and the quantity of reserves reported. Our reserve base is nearly 100% natural gas, therefore changes in oil prices used do not have as significant an impact as gas prices on cash flows and reported reserve quantities. Reported discounted cash flows and reserve quantities at December 31, 2008, were $2,109.3 million and 2,184.6 Bcfe, respectively. An assumed decrease of $1.00 per Mcf in the December 31, 2008 gas price used to price our reserves would have resulted in an approximate $503.1 million decline in our future net cash flows discounted at 10%, adjusted for the effects of commodity hedges, and an approximate decrease of 23 Bcfe of our reported reserves. The decline in reserve quantities, assuming this decrease in gas price, would have the impact of increasing our unit of production amortization of the full cost pool. The unit of production rate for amortization is adjusted quarterly based on changes in reserve estimates and capitalized costs. Hedging We use natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil. Our policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings to minimize the risk of uncollectability. We actively monitor the credit status of our counterparties, performing both quantitative and qualitative assessments based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable, and to date have not had any credit defaults associated with our transactions. In recent years, we have hedged 60% to 80% of our annual production. The primary market risks related to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for natural gas and crude oil. However, the market price risk is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related gas or oil transaction that is hedged. Our derivative instruments are accounted for under FAS 133, as amended, and are recorded at fair value in our financial statements. We have established the fair value of derivative instruments using data provided by our counterparties in conjunction with assumptions evaluated internally using established index prices and other sources. These valuations are recognized as assets or liabilities in our balance sheet and, to the extent an open position is an effective cash flow hedge on equity production, the offset is recorded in other comprehensive income. Results of settled commodity hedging transactions are reflected in natural gas and oil sales or in gas purchases. Any derivative not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment or any ineffective portion of a properly designated hedge is recognized immediately in earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded an unrealized gain of $2.5 million related to basis differential swaps that did not qualify for hedge accounting in addition to a $7.0 million loss related to the change in estimated ineffectiveness of our commodity cash flow hedges. Future market price volatility could create significant changes to the hedge positions recorded in our financial statements. We did not enter into any interest rate swaps in 2008, 2007 or 2006. We refer you to Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Item 7A of Part II of this Form 10 K for additional information regarding our hedging activities. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We record our prepaid or accrued benefit cost, as well as our periodic benefit cost, for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans using measurement assumptions that we consider reasonable at the time of calculation (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion and disclosures regarding these benefit plans). Two of 51 SWN Table of Contents the assumptions that affect the amounts recorded are the discount rate, which estimates the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled, and the expected return on plan assets, which reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested. For the December 31, 2008, benefit obligation and the periodic benefit cost to be recorded in 2009, the discount rate assumed is 6.0%. For the 2009 periodic benefit cost, the expected return assumed is 7.50%. This compares to a discount rate of 6.0% and an expected return of 7.75% used in 2008. Using the assumed rates discussed above, we recorded pension expense of $6.5 million in 2008, $5.3 million in 2007 and $4.0 million in 2006 related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. As a result of the sale of AWG on July 1, 2008, we transferred pension and other postretirement assets and liabilities related to the employees of AWG to the purchaser. At December 31, 2008 we recognized a liability of $15.4 million, compared to $14.6 million at December 31, 2007, related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. During 2008, we also funded $10.1 million to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. In 2009, we expect to fund $6.1 million to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans and recognize pension expense of $6.2 million and a postretirement benefit expense of $0.9 million. Assuming a 1% change in the 2008 rates (lower discount rate and lower rate of return), we would have recorded pension and other postretirement benefit expense of $7.9 million in 2008. Gas in Underground Storage We currently have one facility owned by our E&P segment that contains gas in underground storage. Gas in storage that is expected to be cycled within the next 12 months is recorded in current assets. This current portion of gas in storage is classified as inventory and is carried at the lower of cost or market. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the current portion of gas in storage was $24.1 million and $25.0 million, respectively. The non current portion of gas in storage is classified in property, plant and equipment and carried at cost. The carrying value of the non current gas is evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may not be recoverable. The gas in inventory for the E&P segment is used primarily to supplement production in meeting the segments contractual commitments, including delivery to customers of AWG, especially during periods of colder weather. As a result, demand fees paid by AWG to our E&P subsidiaries are a part of the realized price of the gas in storage. In determining the lower of cost or market for storage gas, we utilize the gas futures market in assessing the price we expect to be able to realize for our gas in inventory. A significant decline in the future market price of natural gas could result in a write down of our gas in storage carrying cost. See further discussion of our significant accounting policies in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ABOUT FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS All statements, other than historical fact or present financial information, may be deemed to be forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements that address activities, outcomes and other matters that should or may occur in the future, including, without limitation, statements regarding the financial position, business strategy, production and reserve growth and other plans and objectives for our future operations, are forward looking statements. Although we believe the expectations expressed in such forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements are not guarantees of future performance. We have no obligation and make no undertaking to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements, except as may be required by law. Forward looking statements include the items identified in the preceding paragraph, information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations and other statements in this Form 10 K identified by words such as anticipate, project, intend, estimate, expect, believe, predict, budget, projection, goal, plan, forecast, target or similar expressions. You should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements. They are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may affect our operations, markets, products, services and prices and cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. In addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with forward looking statements, risks, uncertainties and factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward looking statement include, but are not limited to:  the timing and extent of changes in market conditions and prices for natural gas and oil (including regional basis differentials);  our ability to transport our production to the most favorable markets or at all; 52 SWN Table of Contents  the timing and extent of our success in discovering, developing, producing and estimating reserves;  the economic viability of, and our success in drilling, our large acreage position in the Fayetteville Shale play overall as well as relative to other productive shale gas plays;  our ability to fund our planned capital investments;  our ability to determine the most effective and economic fracture stimulation for the Fayetteville Shale formation;  the impact of federal, state and local government regulation, including any increase in severance taxes;  the costs and availability of oilfield personnel services and drilling supplies, raw materials, and equipment and services, including pressure pumping equipment and crews in the Arkoma basin;  our future property acquisition or divestiture activities;  the effects of weather;  increased competition;  the financial impact of accounting regulations and critical accounting policies;  the comparative cost of alternative fuels;  conditions in capital markets, changes in interest rates and the ability of our lenders to provide us with funds as agreed;  credit risk relating to the risk of loss as a result of non performance by our counterparties, and;  any other factors listed in the reports we have filed and may file with the SEC. We caution you that forward looking statements contained in this Form 10 K are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, incident to the exploration for and development, production and sale of natural gas and oil. These risks include, but are not limited to, commodity price volatility, third party interruption of sales to market, inflation, lack of availability of goods and services, environmental risks, drilling and other operating risks, regulatory changes, the uncertainty inherent in estimating proved natural gas and oil reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures and the other risks described in Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10 K. Estimates of our proved natural gas and oil reserves and the estimated future net revenues from such reserves in this Form 10 K are based upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC relating to natural gas and oil prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital investments, taxes and availability of funds. The process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is complex. This process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. Therefore, those estimates are inherently imprecise. Actual future production, natural gas and oil prices, revenues, taxes, development investments, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable natural gas and oil reserves will most likely vary from those estimated. Such variances may be material. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves set forth in this Form 10 K. Our properties may also be susceptible to hydrocarbon drainage from production by other operators on adjacent properties. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing natural gas and oil prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. At December 31, 2008, approximately 38% of our estimated proved reserves were proved undeveloped and 3% were proved developed non producing. Proved undeveloped reserves and proved developed non producing reserves, by their nature, are less certain than proved developed producing reserves. Estimates of reserves in the non producing categories are nearly always based on volumetric calculations rather than the performance data used to estimate producing reserves. Recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. Recovery of proved developed non producing reserves requires capital expenditures to recomplete into the zones behind pipe and is subject to the risk of a successful recompletion. Production revenues from proved undeveloped and proved developed non producing reserves will not be realized, if at all, until sometime in the future. 53 SWN Table of Contents The reserve data assumes that we will make significant capital investments to develop our reserves. Although we have prepared estimates of our natural gas and oil reserves and the costs associated with these reserves in accordance with industry standards, we cannot assure you that the estimated costs are accurate, that development will occur as scheduled or that the actual results will be as estimated. You should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows referred to in this Form 10 K is the current fair value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. Any changes in consumption by gas purchasers or in governmental regulations or taxation could also affect actual future net cash flows. The timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of natural gas and oil properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves and their present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor, which is required by the SEC to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes, is not necessarily the most accurate discount factor for our company. Should one or more of the risks or uncertainties described above or elsewhere in this Form 10 K occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements. We specifically disclaim all responsibility to publicly update any information contained in a forward looking statement or any forward looking statement in its entirety and therefore disclaim any resulting liability for potentially related damages. All forward looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from the volatility in commodity prices, basis differentials and interest rates, as well as credit risk concentrations. We use natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options and interest rate swaps to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil and in interest rates. Our Board of Directors has approved risk management policies and procedures to utilize financial products for the reduction of defined commodity price risk. Utilization of financial products for the reduction of interest rate risks is subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. These policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings. Credit Risk Our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables and derivative contracts associated with commodities trading. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of our customers and their dispersion across geographic areas. No single customer accounted for greater than 6% of accounts receivable at December 31, 2008. See Commodities Risk below for discussion of credit risk associated with commodities trading. Interest Rate Risk The following table presents the principal cash payments for our debt obligations and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. At December 31, 2008, we had $735.4 million of total debt with a weighted average interest rate of 7.48% and we had no indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when deemed appropriate. We do not have any interest rate swaps in effect currently. Our 7.625% Senior Notes due 2027 are putable by the note holders on May 1, 2009, and as a result, the $60 million principal balance of these notes is included in the 2009 expected maturity below. Fair Expected Maturity Date Value 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total 12/31/08 ($ in millions) Fixed Rate $ 61.2 $ 1.2 $ 1.2 $ 1.2 $ 1.2 $ 669.4 $ 735.4 $ 648.6 Average Interest Rate 7.62% 7.15% 7.15% 7.15% 7.15% 7.47% 7.48% 54 SWN Table of Contents Commodities Risk We use over the counter natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options to hedge sales of our production and to hedge activity in our Midstream Services segment against the inherent price risks of adverse price fluctuations or locational pricing differences between a published index and the NYMEX futures market. These swaps and options include (1) transactions in which one party will pay a fixed price (or variable price) for a notional quantity in exchange for receiving a variable price (or fixed price) based on a published index (referred to as price swaps), (2) transactions in which parties agree to pay a price based on two different indices (referred to as basis swaps), and (3) the purchase and sale of index related puts and calls (collars) that provide a "floor" price below which the counterparty pays funds equal to the amount by which the price of the commodity is below the contracted floor, and a "ceiling" price above which we pay to the counterparty the amount by which the price of the commodity is above the contracted ceiling. The primary market risks relating to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for natural gas and crude oil. However, the market price risk is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related gas or oil transaction that is hedged. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss as a result of non performance by our counterparties. The counterparties are primarily major investment and commercial banks which management believes present minimal credit risks. The credit quality of each counterparty and the level of financial exposure we have to each counterparty are closely monitored to limit our credit risk exposure. Additionally, we perform both quantitative and qualitative assessments of these counterparties based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable. We did not incur any losses in 2008 related to non performance of these counterparties and do not anticipate any losses given the information we have currently. However, given the current volatility in the financial markets, we cannot be certain that we will not experience such losses in the future. Exploration and Production The following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in commodity prices and that are used to hedge prices for gas production. The table presents the notional amount in Bcf, the weighted average contract prices and the fair value by expected maturity dates. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of our financial instruments related to natural gas production and gas in storage was a $415.3 million asset and a $5.6 million asset, respectively. Weighted Weighted Weighted Weighted Average Average Average Average Fair value at Price to be Floor Ceiling Basis December 31, Swapped Price Price Differential 2008 Volume ($/MMBtu) ($/MMBtu) ($/MMBtu) ($/MMBtu) ($ in millions) Natural Gas (Bcf): Fixed Price Swaps: 2009(1) 77.3 8.33 172.3 2010 36.0 9.04 65.8 Costless Collars: 2009 59.0 8.71 11.69 160.0 2010 14.0 8.29 10.57 21.1 Basis Swaps: 2009 50.0 (0.51) 0.1 2010 32.0 (0.30) 1.4 2011 7.2 (0.28) 0.2 (1) Includes fixed price swaps for 1.3 Bcf relating to future sales from our underground storage facility that have a fair value asset of $5.6 million. At December 31, 2008, we had outstanding fixed price basis differential swaps on 50.0 Bcf of 2009, 32.0 Bcf of 2010 and 7.2 Bcf of 2011 gas production that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in gas and oil sales. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded an unrealized gain of $2.5 million related to the differential swaps that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and a loss of $7.0 million gain related to the change in estimated ineffectiveness of our cash flow hedges. Typically, our hedge ineffectiveness results from changes at the end of a reporting period in the price differentials between the index price of the derivative contract, which is primarily a NYMEX price, and the index price for the point of sale for the cash flow that is being hedged. 55 SWN Table of Contents At December 31, 2007, we had outstanding natural gas price swaps on total notional volumes of 55.7 Bcf in 2008 and 56.0 Bcf in 2009 for which we will receive fixed prices ranging from $7.29 to $9.98 per MMBtu.
