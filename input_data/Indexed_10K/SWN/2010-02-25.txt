ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This Form 10 K contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements for many reasons, including the risks described in the Cautionary Statement About Forward Looking Statements below, in Item 1A, Risk Factors in Part I and elsewhere in this annual report. You should read the following discussion with the Item 6. Selected Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this Form 10 K. OVERVIEW Background Southwestern Energy Company is an independent energy company primarily engaged in natural gas and crude oil exploration, development and production, or E&P, within the United States. We are also focused on creating and capturing additional value through our natural gas gathering and marketing businesses, or Midstream Services. We have historically operated principally in three segments: E&P, Midstream Services and Natural Gas Distribution. On July 1, 2008, we closed the sale of our utility subsidiary, Arkansas Western Gas Company, or Arkansas Western Gas, and as a result, no longer have any natural gas distribution operations. The operating results and cash flows from Arkansas Western Gas through June 30, 2008 are included in the consolidated statements of operations and statements of cash flows, as applicable, and are not presented as discontinued operations. We refer you to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K for additional information. We are focused on providing long term growth in the net asset value of our business, which we achieve in our E&P business through the drillbit. We derive the vast majority of our operating income and cash flow from the natural gas production of our E&P business and expect this to continue in the future. We expect that growth in our operating income and revenues will primarily depend on natural gas prices and our ability to increase our natural gas production. Our ability to increase our natural gas production is dependent upon our ability to economically find and produce natural gas, our ability to control costs and our ability to market natural gas on economically attractive terms to our customers. In recent years, there has been significant price volatility in natural gas as evidenced by New York Mercantile Exchange natural gas prices ranging from highs of $13.58 per Mcf in 2008 to lows of $2.51 per Mcf in 2009. Natural gas prices fluctuate due to a variety of factors we cannot control or predict. These factors, which include weather conditions, political and economic events, and competition from other energy sources, impact supply and demand for natural gas, which in turn determines the sale prices for our production. In addition to the factors identified above, the prices we realize for our production are affected by our hedging activities as well as locational differences in market prices. Recent Financial and Operating Results We reported a net loss attributable to Southwestern Energy of $35.7 million in 2009, or $0.10 per diluted share, down from net income attributable to Southwestern Energy of $567.9 million, or $1.64 per diluted share, in 2008. The loss in 2009 resulted from the recognition of a $907.8 million, or $558.3 million net of taxes, non cash ceiling test impairment of our natural gas and oil properties recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2009. The ceiling test impairment was recognized as a result of a significant decline in natural gas prices. We reported net income attributable to Southwestern Energy of $567.9 million in 2008, or $1.64 per diluted share, up 157% from 2007. Net income attributable to Southwestern Energy in 2008 included a $35.4 million net of tax gain, or $0.10 per diluted share, related to the sale of our utility subsidiary that closed on July 1, 2008. Excluding the $35.4 million gain on the sale of the utility, the increase in net income attributable to Southwestern Energy in 2008 was the result of a $1,056.4 million increase in revenues, partially offset by an increase in operating costs and expenses of $551.1 million and an increase in interest expense of $5.0 million. Our cash flow from operating activities increased 17% to $1,359.4 million in 2009 and increased 86% to $1,160.8 million in 2008, due to increases in net income adjusted for non cash expenses. In 2009, our gas and oil production increased 54% to 300.4 Bcfe, up from 194.6 Bcfe in 2008. The 105.8 Bcfe increase in our 2009 production resulted from a 109.0 Bcf increase in net production from our Fayetteville Shale play and a 3.3 Bcfe increase in net production from our East Texas properties, which more than offset a combined 6.5 Bcfe decrease in net production arising from decreased production from our Arkoma and other properties and the sale of our Permian Basin and Gulf Coast properties in 2008. In 2008, our gas and oil production increased to 194.6 Bcfe, up from 113.6 Bcfe in 2007. We are targeting 2010 gas and oil production of 400.0 to 410.0 Bcfe, an increase of approximately 35% over our 2009 production. Our year end reserves grew 67% in 2009 to 3,657 Bcfe, up from 2,185 Bcfe at the end of 2008, primarily as a result of the continued development of our Fayetteville Shale play. 44 SWN Table of Contents Our E&P segment reported an operating loss of $157.7 million in 2009, down from operating income of $813.5 million in 2008 and $358.1 million in 2007. The operating loss for our E&P segment was primarily the result of the $907.8 million non cash ceiling test impairment of our natural gas and oil properties. Operating income for our E&P segment increased in 2008 due to an increase in revenues of $695.4 million resulting from higher gas production volumes and increased product prices, partially offset by an increase in operating costs and expenses of $239.9 million. Operating income for our Midstream Services segment was $122.6 million in 2009, compared to $62.3 million in 2008 and $13.2 million in 2007. Operating income for our Midstream Services segment increased in 2009 due to an increase of $90.7 million in gathering revenues and an increase of $6.3 million in the margin generated from our natural gas marketing activities, which were partially offset by a $36.7 million increase in operating costs and expenses, exclusive of purchased gas costs. Operating income for our Midstream Services segment increased in 2008 due to an increase of $77.2 million in gathering revenues and an increase of $6.4 million in the margin generated from our natural gas marketing activities, which were partially offset by a $34.5 million increase in operating costs and expenses, exclusive of purchased gas costs. Operating income for our Natural Gas Distribution segment was $10.7 million for the first six months in 2008, prior to the sale of Arkansas Western Gas, compared to $10.0 million in 2007. Outlook We believe the outlook for our business is favorable despite the uncertainties of natural gas prices in the United States and the overall economic recovery. Our resource base, financial strength and disciplined investment of capital provide us with an opportunity to exploit and develop our position in the Fayetteville Shale play, maximize efficiency through economies of scale in our key operating areas, enhance our overall returns through expansion of our Midstream Services operations and grow through new exploration and development activities. Our capital investment plan for 2010 is based on our expectation that natural gas prices will remain near or above 2009 price levels and the realized sales price for our production continues to meet our targeted return of $1.30 of discounted pre tax PVI for each dollar we invest in our E&P projects. 45 SWN Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of our results of operations for our segments is presented before intersegment eliminations. We evaluate our segments as if they were stand alone operations and accordingly discuss their results prior to any intersegment eliminations. Interest expense, interest income, income tax expense, pension expense and stock based compensation are discussed on a consolidated basis. Exploration and Production Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Revenues (in thousands) $ 1,593,231 $ 1,491,302 $ 795,944 Impairment of natural gas and oil properties (in thousands) $ 907,812 $ $ Operating costs and expenses(in thousands) $ 843,144 $ 677,798 $ 437,865 Operating income (loss) (in thousands) $ (157,725) $ 813,504 $ 358,079 Gas production (Bcf) 299.7 192.3 109.9 Oil production (MBbls) 124 385 614 Total production (Bcfe) 300.4 194.6 113.6 Average gas price per Mcf, including hedges $ 5.30 $ 7.52 $ 6.80 Average gas price per Mcf, excluding hedges $ 3.34 $ 7.73 $ 6.16 Average oil price per Bbl $ 54.99 $ 107.18 $ 69.12 Average unit costs per Mcfe: Lease operating expenses $ 0.77 $ 0.89 $ 0.73 General and administrative expenses $ 0.35 $ 0.41 $ 0.48 Taxes, other than income taxes $ 0.11 $ 0.13 $ 0.16 Full cost pool amortization $ 1.51 $ 1.99 $ 2.41 Revenues Revenues for our E&P segment were up $101.9 million, or 7%, in 2009, compared to the prior year. Higher production volumes in 2009 increased revenues by approximately $779.5 million, which were partially offset by a $669.9 million decrease in revenue attributable to lower realized gas and oil prices. E&P revenues were up $695.4 million, or 87%, in 2008, compared to 2007, of which approximately $544.3 million was attributable to an increase in production volumes and $152.4 million was attributable to higher gas and oil prices realized. We expect our production volumes to continue to increase due to the development of our Fayetteville Shale play in Arkansas. We are unable to predict gas and oil prices which widely fluctuate. As of February 25, 2010, we had hedged 66.0 Bcf of 2010 gas production and 37.3 Bcf of 2011 gas production to limit our exposure to price fluctuations. For more information about our derivatives and risk management activities, we refer you to Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K and to Commodity Prices below for additional information. Production In 2009, our gas and oil production increased 54% to 300.4 Bcfe, up from 194.6 Bcfe in 2008. The 105.8 Bcfe increase in our 2009 production resulted from a 109.0 Bcf increase in net production from our Fayetteville Shale play and a 3.3 Bcfe increase in net production from our East Texas properties, which more than offset a combined 6.5 Bcfe decrease in net production from our Arkoma Basin and other properties and the sale of our Permian Basin and Gulf Coast properties. Gas and oil production was up approximately 71% to 194.6 Bcfe in 2008, as compared to 2007, due to an 81.0 Bcf increase in net production from our Fayetteville Shale play as a result of our ongoing development program and increases in our East Texas and Arkoma net production of 2.3 Bcfe, which more than offset decreases in net production due to the sale of our Permian Basin and Gulf Coast properties. Our net production from the Fayetteville Shale play was 243.5 Bcf in 2009, up from 134.5 Bcf in 2008 and 53.5 Bcf in 2007. Prior to our July 1, 2008 sale of Arkansas Western Gas, intersegment gas sales to Arkansas Western Gas totaled 4.3 Bcf for the first six months of 2008 and 4.8 Bcf for the year ended December 31, 2007. Future increases in demand for our gas production are expected to come from sales to major and small energy companies, utilities and industrial consumers of natural gas. 46 SWN Table of Contents We are targeting 2010 gas and oil production of 400.0 to 410.0 Bcfe, an increase of approximately 35% over our 2009 production using the midpoint of the 2010 target range. Approximately 344.0 to 352.0 Bcf of our 2010 targeted gas production is projected to come from our activities in the Fayetteville Shale play. Although we expect production volumes in 2010 to increase, we cannot guarantee our success in discovering, developing and producing reserves, including with respect to our Fayetteville Shale play. Our ability to discover, develop and produce reserves is dependent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the availability of capital, the timing and extent of changes in natural gas and oil prices and competition. There are also many risks inherent to the discovery, development and production of natural gas and oil. We refer you to Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10 K for a discussion of these risks and the impact they could have on our financial condition and results of operations. Commodity Prices The average price realized for our gas production, including the effects of hedges, decreased 30% to $5.30 per Mcf in 2009 and increased 11% to $7.52 per Mcf in 2008. The change in the average price realized reflects changes in average market prices and the effects of our price hedging activities. We periodically enter into various hedging and other financial arrangements with respect to a portion of our projected natural gas and crude oil production in order to ensure certain desired levels of cash flow and to minimize the impact of price fluctuations, including fluctuations in locational market differentials (we refer you to Item 7A of this Form 10 K and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion about our derivatives and risk management activities). Our hedging activities increased the average gas price $1.96 per Mcf in 2009, compared to a decrease of $0.21 per Mcf in 2008 and an increase $0.64 per Mcf in 2007. In recent years, locational differences in market prices for natural gas have been wider than historically experienced. Disregarding the impact of hedges, from 2005 through 2007, the average price received for our gas production was approximately $0.50 to $1.00 per Mcf lower than average NYMEX spot market prices primarily due to the locational market differentials. However, during 2009 and 2008, widening market differentials caused the difference in our annual average price received for our gas production to range from approximately $0.65 to $1.30 per Mcf lower than market prices. The discount was at its highest in late 2008, due to increased production in the Fayetteville Shale for which there was not sufficient transportation to other markets as a result of the delay in the completion of the Boardwalk Pipeline. Since the completion of the Boardwalk Pipeline, the locational differences in the market prices for our gas production has narrowed. Assuming a NYMEX commodity price for 2010 of $5.00 per Mcf of gas, the average price received for our gas production is expected to be approximately $0.10 to $0.20 per Mcf below the NYMEX Henry Hub index price, including the impact of our basis hedges. At December 31, 2009, we had basis protected on approximately 140 Bcf of our 2010 expected gas production through financial hedging activities and physical sales arrangements at a differential to NYMEX gas prices of approximately $0.15 per Mcf. Our E&P segment receives a sales price for our natural gas at a discount to NYMEX spot prices due to locational basis differentials, while transportation charges and fuel charges also reduce the price received. In 2010, we expect to pay average third party transportation charges in the range of $0.25 to $0.32 per Mcf and average fuel charges in the range of 0.25% to 1.00% of our sales price for natural gas. In addition to the basis hedges discussed above, at December 31, 2009, we had NYMEX commodity price hedges in place on 66.0 Bcf of our 2010 expected future gas production and 30.0 Bcf of our 2011 expected future gas production. We realized an average price of $54.99 per barrel for our oil production for the year ended December 31, 2009, down approximately 49% from the prior year. The 2008 average realized price of $107.18 per barrel was up 55% from 2007. We did not hedge any of our 2009, 2008 or 2007 oil production. Operating Income We recorded an operating loss from our E&P segment of $157.7 million for 2009, which represents a decline of $971.2 million, or 119%, from 2008. The $971.2 million decrease in operating income was the result of a $907.8 million non cash ceiling test impairment recorded in the first quarter resulting from lower natural gas prices, an increase in other operating costs and expenses of $165.3 million, or 24%, resulting from our significant production growth, which were partially offset by a net increase in revenue of $101.9 million, or 7%, as increased gas production volumes more than offset the decline in gas prices from the prior year. In 2008, operating income increased 127% to $813.5 million from $358.1 million in 2007, as revenues increased $695.4 million, or 87%, due to higher gas production and higher gas prices which were partially offset by an increase in operating costs and expenses of $239.9 million, or 55%. 47 SWN Table of Contents Operating Costs and Expenses Lease operating expenses per Mcfe for the E&P segment were $0.77 in 2009, compared to $0.89 in 2008 and $0.73 in 2007. Lease operating expenses per unit of production decreased in 2009 primarily due to the impact that lower natural gas prices had on the cost of compressor fuel in 2009. Lease operating expenses per unit of production increased in 2008, as compared to 2007, primarily due to higher per unit operating costs associated with our Fayetteville Shale operations, including the impact of higher natural gas prices on the cost of compressor fuel in 2008. We expect our per unit operating cost for this segment to range between $0.87 and $0.92 per Mcfe in 2010. General and administrative expenses for the E&P segment were $0.35 per Mcfe in 2009, down from $0.41 per Mcfe in 2008 and $0.48 per Mcfe in 2007. The decreases in general and administrative costs per Mcfe in 2009 and 2008 were due to the effects of our increased production volumes. In total, general and administrative expenses for the E&P segment were $105.0 million in 2009, $80.2 million in 2008 and $54.8 million in 2007. The increases in general and administrative expenses since 2007 were primarily due to increases in payroll, incentive compensation and employee related costs associated with the expansion of our E&P operations due to the continued development of the Fayetteville Shale play. These increases accounted for $19.7 million, or 79%, of the 2009 increase and $19.7 million, or 78%, of the 2008 increase. We added 261 new E&P employees during 2009, compared to 145 employees added in 2008. We expect our per unit cost for general and administrative expenses in 2010 to range between $0.32 and $0.37 per Mcfe. The expected decrease in per unit costs in 2010 is due to an anticipated increase in production volumes from our Fayetteville Shale play. Future changes in our general and administrative expenses for this segment are primarily dependent upon our salary costs, level of pension expense, amount of stock based compensation expense and the amount of incentive compensation paid to our employees. For eligible employees, a portion of incentive compensation is based on the achievement of certain operating and performance results, including production, proved reserve additions, present value added for each dollar of capital invested, and lease operating expenses and general and administrative expenses per unit of production, while another portion is discretionary based upon an employees performance. Additional discretionary awards may also be awarded under the incentive compensation plan. Taxes other than income taxes per Mcfe were $0.11 in 2009, $0.13 in 2008 and $0.16 in 2007, and vary from period to period due to changes in severance and ad valorem taxes that result from the mix of our production volumes and fluctuations in commodity prices. Effective January 1, 2009, the State of Arkansas increased the severance tax on natural gas wells, new discovery gas wells and gas wells that produce below a specified level. The new severance tax rates increased the severance taxes we pay with respect to all of our production within the State of Arkansas, including our Fayetteville Shale operations, and impacted our results of operations by increasing taxes other than income by $11.1 million, or $0.04 per Mcfe, in 2009 compared to 2008. Additionally, we recognized $3.3 million, or $0.01 per Mcfe, in 2009 for severance tax refunds related to our East Texas production, compared to $5.0 million, or $0.03 per Mcfe, in 2008. Our full cost pool amortization rate averaged $1.51 per Mcfe for 2009, $1.99 per Mcfe for 2008 and $2.41 per Mcfe for 2007. The decline in the average amortization rate for 2009 was primarily the result of the $907.8 million non cash ceiling test impairment recorded in the first quarter of 2009 as well as sales of natural gas and oil properties in 2008, the proceeds of which were credited to the full cost pool. The decline in the average amortization rate for 2008 was primarily the result of the sales of oil and gas properties in 2008. The amortization rate is impacted by the timing and amount of reserve additions and the costs associated with those additions, revisions of previous reserve estimates due to both price and well performance, write downs that result from full cost ceiling tests, proceeds from the sale of properties that reduce the full cost pool and the levels of costs subject to amortization. We cannot predict our future full cost pool amortization rate with accuracy due to the variability of each of the factors discussed above, as well as other factors, including but not limited to the uncertainty of the amount of future reserves attributed to our Fayetteville Shale play. Unevaluated costs excluded from amortization were $595.4 million at the end of 2009, compared to $540.6 million at the end of 2008 and $372.4 million at the end of 2007. In 2009, the increase in unevaluated costs primarily resulted from a $61.8 million increase in our acquisition of properties and seismic costs (with $28.3 million of the increase related to our Fayetteville Shale play) offset by a $10.4 million decrease in our drilling activity. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our unevaluated costs excluded from amortization. The timing and amount of production and reserve additions attributed to our Fayetteville Shale play could have a material impact on our per unit costs; if production or reserves additions are lower than projected, our per unit costs could increase. 48 SWN Table of Contents Midstream Services Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (in millions, except volumes) Revenues marketing $ 1,397.7 $ 2,059.1 $ 924.3 Revenues gathering $ 205.6 $ 114.9 $ 37.7 Gas purchases marketing $ 1,375.8 $ 2,043.5 $ 915.1 Operating costs and expenses $ 104.9 $ 68.2 $ 33.7 Operating income $ 122.6 $ 62.3 $ 13.2 Gas volumes marketed (Bcf) 382.5 258.0 145.7 Gas volumes gathered (Bcf) 387.1 224.1 78.7 Revenues Revenues from our marketing activities were down 32% to $1,397.7 million for 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease in marketing revenues for 2009 resulted from a decrease in the prices received for volumes marketed and was partially offset by an increase in gas volumes marketed. Revenues from our marketing activities were up 123% to $2,059.1 million for 2008 compared to 2007. The increase in marketing revenues for 2008 resulted from increases in both gas volumes marketed and prices received for volumes marketed. The price received for volumes marketed decreased 54% in 2009 compared to 2008, and increased 26% in 2008 compared to 2007. Volumes marketed increased 48% in 2009 compared to 2008, and increased 77% in 2008 compared to 2007. Of the total volumes marketed, production from our E&P operated wells accounted for 92% in 2009, 96% in 2008 and 89% in 2007. Increases and decreases in marketing revenues due to changes in commodity prices are largely offset by corresponding changes in gas purchase expenses. Revenues from our gathering activities were up 79% to $205.6 million for 2009 compared to 2008, and were up 205% to $114.9 million for 2008 compared to 2007. Substantially all of the increases in gathering revenues for 2009 and 2008 resulted from increases in the volumes gathered in our Fayetteville Shale play. Total volumes gathered increased 73% in 2009 compared to 2008 and increased 185% in 2008 compared to 2007. Gathering volumes, revenues and expenses for this segment are expected to continue to grow as production from our Fayetteville Shale play increases. Operating Income Operating income from our Midstream Services segment increased 97% to $122.6 million in 2009 due to an increase of $90.7 million in gathering revenues and an increase of $6.3 million in the margin generated from our natural gas marketing activities, which were partially offset by a $36.7 million increase in operating costs and expenses, exclusive of purchased gas costs. Operating income from our Midstream Services segment increased 371% to $62.3 million in 2008 due to an increase of $77.2 million in gathering revenues and an increase of $6.4 million in the margin generated from our natural gas marketing activities, which were partially offset by a $34.5 million increase in operating costs and expenses, exclusive of purchased gas costs. The margin generated from natural gas marketing activities was $21.9 million for 2009, compared to $15.6 million for 2008 and $9.2 million for 2007. Margins may fluctuate depending on the prices paid for commodities and the ultimate disposition of those commodities. The increases in volumes marketed in 2009 and 2008, as compared to prior years, resulted from marketing our increased E&P production volumes. We enter into hedging activities from time to time with respect to our gas marketing activities to provide margin protection.

Effective July 1, 2008, we sold all of the capital stock of Arkansas Western Gas for $223.5 million (net of expenses related to the sale). In order to receive regulatory approval for the sale and certain related transactions, we paid $9.8 million to Arkansas Western Gas for the benefit of its customers. A gain on the sale of $57.3 million ($35.4 million after tax) was recorded in the third quarter of 2008. As a result of the sale of Arkansas Western Gas, we no longer have any natural gas distribution operations. The 2008 column in the table above reflects results for the first six months of 2008, which represents the period of our ownership of Arkansas Western Gas in 2008. Interest Expense and Interest Income Interest expense, net of capitalization, was $18.6 million in 2009, a decrease of $10.3 million compared to 2008 primarily due to an increase in capitalized interest and a decrease in our weighted average interest rate during 2009. Our weighted average interest rate decreased during 2009 as a result of the redemption of our 7.625% Senior Notes and an increase in our Credit Facility borrowings which had a 2009 weighted average interest rate of 1.16%. Interest capitalized increased to $40.2 million in 2009, up from $34.5 million in 2008, as our costs excluded from amortization in the E&P segment have continued to increase along with the overall increased level of our capital investments. Costs excluded from amortization in the E&P segment increased to $595.4 million at December 31, 2009, compared to $540.6 million at December 31, 2008. In 2008, interest expense, net of capitalization, was $28.9 million, an increase of $5.0 million compared to 2007 amounts primarily due to an increase in our average indebtedness resulting from our increased capital investments in 2008. Interest capitalized increased to $34.5 million in 2008, up from $13.8 million in 2007, as our costs excluded from amortization in the E&P segment increased along with the overall increased level of our capital investments. Costs excluded from amortization in the E&P segment were $540.6 million at December 31, 2008, compared to $372.4 million at December 31, 2007. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we earned interest income of $0.4 million, $4.4 million and $0.1 million, respectively, related to our cash investments. These amounts are recorded in other income on the Statements of Operations. Income Taxes Our effective tax rates were 31.5% in 2009, 38.2% in 2008 and 38.1% in 2007. The decrease in our 2009 effective tax rate resulted from our permanent tax differences comprising a larger percentage of our before tax operating results than in 2008. Our effective tax rate excluding the $907.8 million non cash ceiling test impairment of our natural gas and oil properties would have been 39.0%. In general, differences between our effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate of 35% primarily result from the effect of certain state income taxes and permanent items attributable to book tax differences. 50 SWN Table of Contents Stock Based Compensation Expense We recognized expense of $10.2 million and capitalized $5.9 million for stock based compensation in 2009, compared to $7.6 million expensed and $3.9 million capitalized in 2008 and $5.4 million expensed and $2.6 million capitalized in 2007. We refer you to Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our equity based compensation plans. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We depend primarily on internally generated funds, our Credit Facility and funds accessed through debt and equity markets. We may borrow up to $1.0 billion under our Credit Facility from time to time. The amount available under our Credit Facility may be increased up to $1.25 billion at any time upon our agreement with our existing or additional lenders. As of December 31, 2009, we had $324.5 million in borrowings outstanding under our Credit Facility compared to no indebtedness at December 31, 2008. During 2010, assuming gas prices remain at current levels, we expect to draw on a portion of the funds available under the Credit Facility to fund our planned capital investments (discussed below under Capital Investments), which are expected to exceed the net cash generated by our operations. We refer you to Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K and the section below under Financing Requirements for additional discussion of our Credit Facility. Net cash provided by operating activities increased 17% to $1.4 billion in 2009, due to an increase in net income adjusted for non cash expenses which was partially offset by changes in working capital accounts. Net cash provided by operating activities increased 86% to $1.2 billion in 2008, due to a $516.3 million increase in net income attributable to Southwestern Energy and adjustments for non cash expenses. For 2009, requirements for our capital investments were funded from our cash generated by operating activities, our Credit Facility and our 2009 beginning of the year cash and cash equivalents balance. Net cash from operating activities provided 76% of our cash requirements for capital investments in 2009, 66% in 2008 and 41% in 2007. At December 31, 2009, our capital structure consisted of 30% debt and 70% equity. We believe that our operating cash flow and available funds under our Credit Facility will be adequate to meet our capital and operating requirements for 2010. The credit status of the financial institutions participating in our Credit Facility could adversely impact our ability to borrow funds under the Credit Facility. While we believe all of the lenders under the facility have the ability to provide funds, we cannot predict whether each will be able to meet its obligation. Our cash flow from operating activities is highly dependent upon the market prices that we receive for our gas and oil production. Natural gas and oil prices are subject to wide fluctuations and are driven by market supply and demand factors which are impacted by the overall state of the economy. The price received for our production is also influenced by our commodity hedging activities, as more fully discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K and Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Our commodity hedging activities are subject to the credit risk of our counterparties being financially unable to complete the transaction. We actively monitor the credit status of our counterparties, performing both quantitative and qualitative assessments based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable, and to date have not had any credit defaults associated with our transactions. However, any future failures by one or more counterparties could negatively impact our cash flow from operating activities. Additionally, our short term cash flows are dependent on the timely collection of receivables from our customers and partners. We actively manage this risk through credit management activities and, through the date of this filing, have not experienced any significant write offs for non collectable amounts. However, any sustained inaccessibility of credit by our customers and partners could adversely impact our cash flows. Due to the above factors, we are unable to forecast with certainty our future level of cash flow from operations. Accordingly, we will adjust our discretionary uses of cash dependent upon available cash flow. 51 SWN Table of Contents Capital Investments Our capital investments were approximately $1.8 billion in 2009, approximately flat compared to 2008. Capital investments include an increase of $12.2 million in 2009, an increase of $36.2 million in 2008 and a reduction of $20.6 million in 2007 related to the change in accrued expenditures between years. Our E&P segment investments in 2009 were $1.6 billion, compared to $1.6 billion in 2008 and $1.4 billion in 2007. 2009 2008 2007 (in thousands) Exploration and production Exploration and development $ 1,556,260 $ 1,569,089 $ 1,375,204 Drilling rigs and related equipment 9,190 26,739 4,453 1,565,450 1,595,828 1,379,657 Midstream services 214,208 183,021 107,363 Natural gas distribution 3,574 (1) 11,375 Other 29,459 13,745 4,743 $ 1,809,117 $ 1,796,168 $ 1,503,138 (1) Natural gas distribution capital investments are through June 30, 2008, prior to the sale of this segment. Our capital investments for 2010 are planned to be $2.1 billion, consisting of $1.7 billion for E&P, $270 million for Midstream Services and $95 million for corporate and other purposes. Of the approximate $2.1 billion, we expect to allocate approximately $1.5 billion to our Fayetteville Shale play. Our planned level of capital investments in 2010 is expected to allow us to continue our progress in the Fayetteville Shale and East Texas programs, begin drilling in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania and explore and develop other existing gas and oil properties and generate new drilling prospects. As discussed above, our 2010 capital investment program is expected to be funded through cash flow from operations and borrowings under our Credit Facility. The planned capital program for 2010 is flexible and can be modified, including downward, if the low natural gas price environment persists for an extended period of time. We will reevaluate our proposed investments as needed to take into account prevailing market conditions and if natural gas prices rebound in 2010, we could increase our planned investments and accelerate the development of our Fayetteville Shale play by utilizing additional drilling rigs. Financing Requirements Our total debt outstanding was $998.7 million at December 31, 2009, compared to $735.4 million at December 31, 2008. Our Credit Facility has a borrowing capacity of $1.0 billion, which may be increased up to $1.25 billion at any time upon our agreement with our existing or additional lenders. As of December 31, 2009, we had $324.5 million outstanding under our Credit Facility with a weighted average interest rate of 1.106%, compared to no indebtedness outstanding as of December 31, 2008. The interest rate on our Credit Facility is calculated based upon our public debt rating and is currently 87.5 basis points over LIBOR. Our publicly traded notes are rated BB+ by Standard and Poors and we have a Corporate Family Rating of Ba2 by Moodys. Any downgrades in our public debt ratings could increase our cost of funds under the Credit Facility. Our Credit Facility contains covenants which impose certain restrictions on us. Under the Credit Facility, we must keep our total debt at or below 60% of our total capital, must maintain a certain level of equity and must maintain a ratio of EBITDA to interest expense of 3.5 or above. Our Credit Facilitys financial covenants with respect to capitalization percentages exclude the noncontrolling interest in equity, the effects of non cash entries that result from any full cost ceiling impairments, hedging activities and our pension and other postretirement liabilities. Therefore, under our Credit Facility, our capital structure at December 31, 2009 would have been 26% debt and 74% equity. We were also in compliance with all of the covenants of our Credit Facility at December 31, 2009. Although we do not anticipate any violations of our financial covenants, our ability to comply with those covenants is dependent upon the success of our exploration and development program and upon factors beyond our control, such as the market prices for natural gas and oil. If we are unable to borrow under our Credit Facility, we would have to decrease our capital investment plans. At December 31, 2009, our capital structure consisted of 30% debt and 70% equity. Our debt as a percentage of total capital increased throughout 2009, primarily due to our increased debt levels and our net loss attributable to Southwestern Energy of $35.7 million and other changes in equity for 2009. Equity at December 31, 2009 included an accumulated other comprehensive gain of $95.3 million related to our hedging activities and a loss for $11.0 million related to our pension and other postretirement liabilities. The amount recorded in equity for our hedging activities is based on current market values for our hedges at December 31, 2009 and does not necessarily reflect the value that we will 52 SWN Table of Contents receive or pay when the hedges are ultimately settled, nor does it take into account revenues to be received associated with the physical delivery of sales volumes hedged. Our hedges allow us to ensure a certain level of cash flow to fund our operations. At December 31, 2009, we had NYMEX commodity price hedges in place on 66.0 Bcf of our 2010 expected future gas production and 30.0 Bcf of our 2011 expected future gas production. The amount of long term debt we incur will be dependent upon commodity prices and our capital investment plans. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In December 2006, we entered into a sale and leaseback transaction pursuant to which we sold 13 operating drilling rigs, 2 rigs yet to be delivered and related equipment and then leased such drilling rigs and equipment under leases that expire on January 1, 2015. Subject to certain conditions, we have options to purchase the rigs and related equipment from the lessors either at the end of the 84th month of the lease term at an agreed upon price or at the end of the lease term for the then fair market value. Additionally, we have the option to renew each lease for a negotiated renewal term at a periodic rental equal to the fair market rental value of the rigs as determined at the time of renewal. In 2007, we sold and leased back additional drilling rig equipment receiving proceeds of $3.1 million, and leased an additional $5.9 million of drilling rig equipment, under similar terms as the 2006 transaction. In December 2008, pursuant to the terms of the lease, one of the lessors required us to pay $10.5 million, the stipulated loss value, for a rig that suffered a casualty. The payment of the stipulated loss value is treated as a purchase of the rig and is reflected in capital investments within the statement of cash flows. Our current aggregate annual rental payment for drilling rigs and related equipment under the leases is approximately $19.4 million. Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments We have various contractual obligations in the normal course of our operations and financing activities. Significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2009, were as follows: Contractual Obligations: Payments Due by Period Less than More than Total 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years 5 Years (in thousands) Demand charges(1) $ 1,846,938 $ 106,839 $ 358,715 $ 389,500 $ 991,884 Debt 998,700 1,200 326,900 2,400 668,200 Interest on senior notes 431,215 53,897 104,545 100,015 172,758 Operating leases(2) 263,262 51,338 96,267 83,440 32,217 Purchase obligations(3) 71,493 71,493 Compression services(4) 68,509 25,418 36,728 6,363 Operating agreements(5) 6,482 6,482 Other obligations(6) 26,591 23,451 3,092 48 $ 3,713,190 $ 340,118 $ 926,247 $ 581,766 $ 1,865,059 (1) Our Midstream Services segment has commitments for demand transportation charges, including approximately $1.0 billion related to the FEP pipeline which, although approved, is not expected to be in service until late 2010 or early 2011. For purposes of this table, we have assumed an in service date of October 1, 2010 for the FEP pipeline. (2) Operating leases include costs for compressors, aircraft, office space and equipment under non cancelable operating leases expiring through 2018. Additionally, this includes $96.9 million for leases of 14 drilling rigs and related equipment through 2014. (3) Purchase obligations consist of outstanding purchase orders under existing agreements. Our Midstream Services segment has outstanding purchase obligations of $46.4 million relating to compression units. (4) Our Midstream Services segment has commitments of approximately $61.9 million and our E&P segment has commitments of approximately $6.6 million for compression services associated primarily with our Fayetteville Shale play and our Overton operations. (5) Our E&P segment has commitments for up to $6.0 million in termination fees related to rig operator agreements. (6) Our other significant contractual obligations include approximately $7.8 million for various information technology support and data subscription agreements, approximately $5.3 million for insurance premium financing, approximately $4.8 million related to seismic services and approximately $4.3 million for funding of benefit plans. We refer you to Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of our debt. 53 SWN Table of Contents Commitments and Contingent Liabilities Substantially all of our employees are covered by defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans. We currently expect to contribute approximately $9.6 million to our pension plans and $0.1 million to our postretirement benefit plan in 2010. For 2009, we contributed $9.0 million to our pension plans and contributed less than $0.1 million to our postretirement benefit plan. At December 31, 2009 we recognized a liability of $13.3 million as a result of the underfunded status of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans compared to a liability of $15.4 million at December 31, 2008. For further information regarding our pension and other postretirement benefit plans, we refer you to Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements and Critical Accounting Policies below for additional information. We are subject to litigation and claims (including with respect to environmental matters) that arise in the ordinary course of business. Management believes, individually or in aggregate, such litigation and claims will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or our results of operations, but these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and managements view may change in the future, at which time management may reserve amounts that are reasonably estimable. Working Capital We maintain access to funds that may be needed to meet capital requirements through our Credit Facility described in Financing Requirements above. We had positive working capital of $28.1 million at December 31, 2009 and positive working capital of $102.9 million at December 31, 2008. Current assets decreased $318.8 million during 2009 due to a $183.1 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents and a $180.3 million decrease in our current hedging asset. Current liabilities decreased $244.0 million as a result of a $122.4 million decrease in our current deferred income taxes related to our hedging activities, a $46.9 million decrease in accounts payable and a $60.0 million decrease in short term debt relating to the prepayment of the 7.625% Senior Notes. Gas in Underground Storage We record our gas stored in inventory that is owned by the E&P segment at the lower of weighted average cost or market. We recorded a $4.3 million non cash natural gas inventory impairment charge for the three months ended March 31, 2009 to reduce the current portion of our natural gas inventory to the lower of cost or market. The gas in inventory for the E&P segment is used primarily to supplement production in meeting the segments contractual commitments, especially during periods of colder weather. In determining the lower of cost or market for storage gas, we utilize the gas futures market in assessing the price we expect to be able to realize for our gas in inventory. A significant decline in the future market price of natural gas could result in additional write downs of our gas in underground storage carrying cost. 54 SWN Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an on going basis, based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following describes significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Natural Gas and Oil Properties We utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to the exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and oil reserves. Under this method, all such costs (productive and nonproductive), including salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method. These capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test that limits such pooled costs, net of applicable deferred taxes, to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved natural gas and oil reserves discounted at 10 percent (standardized measure) plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties. Any costs in excess of the ceiling are written off as a non cash expense. The expense may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling. Effective December 31, 2009, companies using the full cost method must use the average quoted price from the first day of each month from the previous 12 months, including the impact of derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges, to calculate the ceiling value of their reserves. For quarter and annual periods ending prior to December 31, 2009, prices in effect at the date of each accounting quarter, including the impact of derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges, were required to be used. At March 31, 2009, the net capitalized costs of our gas and oil properties exceeded the ceiling by approximately $558.3 million (net of tax) and resulted in a non cash ceiling test impairment in the first quarter of 2009. Using the average quoted price from the first day of each month from the previous 12 months for Henry Hub natural gas of $3.87 per MMBtu and $57.65 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil, adjusted for market differentials, the Companys net book value of natural gas and oil properties did not exceed the ceiling amount and did not result in a ceiling test impairment at December 31, 2009. Cash flow hedges of gas production in place increased the ceiling value by approximately $225.9 million at December 31, 2009. Excluding the benefit of those cash flow hedges at December 31, 2009, unamortized costs would have exceeded the ceiling value by $195.7 million. Decreases in average market prices as well as changes in production rates, levels of reserves, evaluation of costs excluded from amortization, future development costs and service costs could result in future ceiling test impairments. Natural gas and oil reserves cannot be measured exactly. Our estimate of natural gas and oil reserves requires extensive judgments of reservoir engineering data and projections of cost that will be incurred in developing and producing reserves and is generally less precise than other estimates made in connection with financial disclosures. Our reservoir engineers prepare our reserve estimates under the supervision of our management. Reserve estimates are prepared for each of our properties annually by the reservoir engineers assigned to the asset management team to which the property is assigned. The reservoir engineering and financial data included in these estimates are reviewed by senior engineers who are not part of the asset management teams and our Vice President EP&A, who was the technical person primarily responsible for the preparation of our reserve estimates, and has over twenty years of experience in petroleum engineering, including over fifteen years in estimating oil and gas reserves. On our behalf, the Vice President EP&A engages Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., or NSAI, a worldwide leader of petroleum property analysis for industry and financial organizations and government agencies, to independently audit our proved reserves estimates as discussed in more detail below. The financial data included in the reserve estimates are also separately reviewed by our accounting staff. Following these reviews and the audit, the reserve estimates are submitted to our Chief Executive Officer for his review and approval prior to the presentation to our Board of Directors. NSAI reports the results of its reserve audit to the Board of Directors and final authority over the estimates of our proved reserves rests with our Board of Directors. In each of the past three years, revisions to our proved reserve estimates represented no greater than 5% of our total proved reserve estimates, which we believe is indicative of the effectiveness of our internal controls. Proved developed reserves generally have a higher degree of accuracy in this estimation process, when compared to proved undeveloped and proved non producing reserves, as production history and pressure data over time is available for the majority of our proved developed properties. Proved developed reserves accounted for 54% of our total reserve base at December 31, 2009. Assigning monetary values to such estimates does not reduce the subjectivity and changing nature of 55 SWN Table of Contents such reserve estimates. The uncertainties inherent in the reserve estimates are compounded by applying additional estimates of the rates and timing of production and the costs that will be incurred in developing and producing the reserves. We cannot assure you that our internal controls sufficiently address the numerous uncertainties and risks that are inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas and oil reserves and projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures as many factors are beyond our control. We refer you to Although our estimated natural gas and oil reserve data is independently audited, our estimates may still prove to be inaccurate in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of Part I of this Form 10 K for a more detailed discussion of these uncertainties, risks and other factors. In conducting its audit, the engineers and geologists of NSAI study our major properties in detail and independently develop reserve estimates. NSAIs audit consists primarily of substantive testing, which includes a detailed review of major properties that account for approximately 88% of present worth of the companys total proved reserves. NSAIs audit process consists of sorting all fields by descending present value order and selecting the fields from highest value to descending value until the selected fields account for more than 80% of the present worth of our reserves. The properties in the bottom 20% of the total present worth are not reviewed in the audit. The fields included in approximately the top 88% present value as of December 31, 2009, accounted for approximately 90% of our total proved reserves and approximately 97% of our proved undeveloped reserves. In the conduct of its audit, NSAI did not independently verify the data we provided to them with respect to ownership interests, oil and gas production, well test data, historical costs of operation and development, product prices, or any agreements relating to current and future operations of the properties and sales of production. NSAI has advised us that if, in the course of its audit, something came to its attention that brought into question the validity or sufficiency of any such information or data, NSAI did not rely on such information or data until it had satisfactorily resolved any questions relating thereto or had independently verified such information or data. For the year ended December 31, 2009, on February 10, 2010, NSAI issued its audit opinion as to the reasonableness of our reserve estimates, stating that our estimated proved oil and gas reserves are, in the aggregate, reasonable and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles. A decline in gas and oil prices used to calculate the discounted future net revenues of our reserves affects both the present value of cash flows and the quantity of reserves reported. Our reserve base is nearly 100% natural gas, therefore changes in oil prices used do not have as significant an impact as gas prices on cash flows and reported reserve quantities. Our standardized measure and reserve quantities at December 31, 2009, were $1,801.8 million and 3,656.7 Bcfe, respectively. An assumed decrease of $1.00 per Mcf in the average 2009 gas price used to price our reserves would have resulted in an approximate $671.9 million decline in our standardized measure, adjusted for the effects of derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges, and an approximate decrease of 1,018 Bcfe of our reported reserves. The decline in reserve quantities, assuming this decrease in gas price, would have the impact of increasing our unit of production amortization of the full cost pool. The unit of production rate for amortization is adjusted quarterly based on changes in reserve estimates, capitalized costs and future development costs. Hedging We use natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil. Our policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings to minimize the risk of uncollectability. We actively monitor the credit status of our counterparties, performing both quantitative and qualitative assessments based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable, and to date have not had any credit defaults associated with our transactions. From 2006 through 2008, we established a portfolio of hedges relating to approximately 60% to 80% of our annual production. However, only 45% of our 2009 production was hedged due to credit and overall market events of late 2008 as well as the low commodity price environment throughout 2009. The primary market risks related to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for natural gas and crude oil. However, the market price risk is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related gas or oil transaction that is hedged. Our derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our financial statements and generally qualify for hedge accounting. We have established the fair value of derivative instruments using data provided by our counterparties in conjunction with assumptions evaluated internally using established index prices and other sources. These valuations are recognized as assets or liabilities in our balance sheet and, to the extent an open position is an effective cash flow hedge on equity production, the offset is recorded in other comprehensive income. Results of settled commodity hedging transactions are reflected in natural gas and oil sales. Any derivative not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment or any ineffective portion of a properly designated hedge is recognized immediately in earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded an unrealized loss of $15.1 million related to basis differential swaps that did not qualify for hedge accounting in addition to a $9.9 million gain related to the change in estimated ineffectiveness of our commodity cash flow 56 SWN Table of Contents hedges. Future market price volatility could create significant changes to the hedge positions recorded in our financial statements. We refer you to Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Item 7A of Part II of this Form 10 K for additional information regarding our hedging activities. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We record our prepaid or accrued benefit cost, as well as our periodic benefit cost, for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans using measurement assumptions that we consider reasonable at the time of calculation (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion and disclosures regarding these benefit plans). Two of the assumptions that affect the amounts recorded are the discount rate, which estimates the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled, and the expected return on plan assets, which reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested. For the December 31, 2009 benefit obligation and the periodic benefit cost to be recorded in 2010, the discount rate assumed is 5.75%. For the 2010 periodic benefit cost, the expected return assumed is 7.50%. This compares to a discount rate of 6.0% and an expected return of 7.50% used in 2009. Using the assumed rates discussed above, we recorded pension expense of $7.3 million in 2009 related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Due to the significance of the discount rate and expected long term rate of return, the following sensitivity analysis demonstrates the effect that a 50 basis point change in those assumptions would have had on our 2009 pension expense: Increase (Decrease) of Annual Pension Expense 50 Basis Point Increase 50 Basis Point Decrease (in thousands) Discount rate ... $ (374) $ 405 Expected long term rate of return . $ (187) $ 187 At December 31, 2009, we recognized a liability of $13.3 million, compared to $15.4 million at December 31, 2008, related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. During 2009, we also made cash payments totaling $9.0 million to fund our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. In 2010, we expect to make cash payments totaling $9.7 million to fund our pension and other postretirement benefit plans and recognize pension expense of $6.1 million and a postretirement benefit expense of $1.1 million. Gas in Underground Storage We currently have one facility owned by our E&P segment that contains gas in underground storage. Gas in storage that is expected to be cycled within the next 12 months is recorded in current assets. This current portion of gas in storage is classified as inventory and is carried at the lower of cost or market. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the current portion of gas in storage was $9.2 million and $24.1 million, respectively. The non current portion of gas in storage is classified in property and equipment and carried at cost. The carrying value of the non current gas is evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may not be recoverable. The gas in inventory for the E&P segment is used primarily to supplement production in meeting the segments contractual commitments, especially during periods of colder weather. In determining the lower of cost or market for storage gas, we utilize the gas futures market in assessing the price we expect to be able to realize for our gas in inventory. A significant decline in the future market price of natural gas could result in a write down of our gas in storage carrying cost. 57 SWN Table of Contents New Accounting Standards Implemented in this Report In June 2009, we implemented the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (FASB ASC). The implementation establishes the FASB ASC as the source of authoritative accounting principles in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP. The FASB ASC does not change GAAP and its implementation did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. On January 1, 2009, we implemented certain provisions of FASB ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, which establish accounting and reporting standards for (1) ownership interests in subsidiaries held by others, (2) the amount of consolidated net income (loss) attributable to the controlling and noncontrolling interests, (3) changes in the controlling ownership interest, (4) the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated and (5) disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the controlling and noncontrolling owners. The implementation was retrospectively applied and resulted in changes to our presentation for noncontrolling interests and did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. On January 1, 2009, we implemented certain provisions of FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, which require enhanced disclosure about (1) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (2) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for and (3) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect our financial position, financial performance and cash flows. The implementation did not have a material impact on our Companys results of operations or financial condition. On January 1, 2009, we implemented certain provisions of FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which require the fair value application for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). Accordingly, we now apply the fair value framework to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities initially measured at fair value, such as asset retirement obligations. The implementation did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. On June 30, 2009, we implemented certain provisions of FASB ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, which require the (1) fair value disclosures required for certain financial instruments be included in interim financial statements and (2) public companies disclose the method and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of those financial instruments and to discuss any changes of method or assumptions, if any, during the reporting period. The implementation did not have a material impact on our Companys results of operations or financial condition. On June 30, 2009, we implemented certain provisions of FASB ASC Topic 855, Subsequent Events, which establish the general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. The implementation did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. On December 31, 2009, we implemented certain provisions of FASB ASC 715, Defined Benefit Plans, which require enhanced disclosures about the fair value measurements of employers plan assets in our year ending 2009 consolidated financial statements. These required disclosures include: (a) investment policies and strategies; (b) major categories of plan assets; (c) information about valuation techniques and inputs to those techniques, including the fair value hierarchy classifications of the major categories of plan assets; (d) the effects of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in plan assets; and (e) significant concentrations of risk within plan assets. The implementation did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. On December 31, 2009, we implemented certain provisions of FASB ASC 932, Extractive Activities Oil and Gas, as updated by Accounting Standards Update No. 2010 03, Extractive Activities Oil and Gas (Topic 932), which (a) expanded the definition of oil and gas producing activities; (b) requires energy companies to value their proved reserves by averaging the price from the first day of each month from the previous 12 months instead of using a year end price; and (c) allows for additional drilling locations to be classified as proved undeveloped reserves assuming such locations are supported by reliable technologies. We accounted for the FASB ASC 932 changes as a change in accounting principle, or a change in the method of applying an accounting principle, that is inseparable from a change in accounting estimate and will account for the change prospectively. See further discussion of our significant accounting policies in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. 58 SWN Table of Contents Accounting Standards Not Yet Implemented On January 1, 2010, we implemented certain provisions of FASB ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, in the first quarter of 2010. The new provisions (a) require a qualitative rather than a quantitative approach to determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (VIE); (b) amend certain guidance pertaining to the determination of the primary beneficiary when related parties are involved; (c) amend certain guidance for determining whether an entity is a VIE; and (d) require continuous assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. We do not expect that this implementation will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. In January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010 06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820) Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements (Update 2010 06). Update 2010 06 requires us to (a) provide information about movements of assets among Levels 1 and 2 of the three tier fair value hierarchy; (b) provide a reconciliation of purchases, sales, issuance, and settlements of financial instruments valued with a Level 3 method; and (c) provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of financial assets and liabilities. We are required to implement the disclosures of Update 2010 06 beginning on January 1, 2011. We do not expect the implementation of Update 2010 06 will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. 59 SWN Table of Contents CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ABOUT FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS All statements, other than historical fact or present financial information, may be deemed to be forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements that address activities, outcomes and other matters that should or may occur in the future, including, without limitation, statements regarding the financial position, business strategy, production and reserve growth and other plans and objectives for our future operations, are forward looking statements.

We caution you that forward looking statements contained in this Form 10 K are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, incident to the exploration for and development, production and sale of natural gas and oil. These risks include, but are not limited to, commodity price volatility, third party interruption of sales to market, inflation, lack of availability of goods and services, environmental risks, drilling and other operating risks, regulatory changes, the uncertainty inherent in estimating proved natural gas and oil reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures and the other risks described in Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10 K. 60 SWN Table of Contents Estimates of our proved natural gas and oil reserves and the estimated future net revenues from such reserves in this Form 10 K are based upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC relating to natural gas and oil prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital investments, taxes and availability of funds. The process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is complex. This process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. Therefore, those estimates are inherently imprecise. Actual future production, natural gas and oil prices, revenues, taxes, development investments, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable natural gas and oil reserves will most likely vary from those estimated. Such variances may be material. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves set forth in this Form 10 K. Our properties may also be susceptible to hydrocarbon drainage from production by other operators on adjacent properties. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing natural gas and oil prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. At December 31, 2009, approximately 46% of our estimated proved reserves were proved undeveloped and 3% were proved developed non producing. Proved undeveloped reserves and proved developed non producing reserves, by their nature, are less certain than proved developed producing reserves. Estimates of reserves in the non producing categories are nearly always based on volumetric calculations rather than the performance data used to estimate producing reserves. Recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. Recovery of proved developed non producing reserves requires capital expenditures to recomplete into the zones behind pipe and is subject to the risk of a successful recompletion. Production revenues from proved undeveloped and proved developed non producing reserves will not be realized, if at all, until sometime in the future. The reserve data assumes that we will make significant capital investments to develop our reserves. Although we have prepared estimates of our natural gas and oil reserves and the costs associated with these reserves in accordance with industry standards, we cannot assure you that the estimated costs are accurate, that development will occur as scheduled or that the actual results will be as estimated. You should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows referred to in this Form 10 K is the current fair value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. Any changes in consumption by gas purchasers or in governmental regulations or taxation could also affect actual future net cash flows. The timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of natural gas and oil properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves and their present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor, which is required by the SEC to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes, is not necessarily the most accurate discount factor for our company. Should one or more of the risks or uncertainties described above or elsewhere in this Form 10 K occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements. We specifically disclaim all responsibility to publicly update any information contained in a forward looking statement or any forward looking statement in its entirety and therefore disclaim any resulting liability for potentially related damages. All forward looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. 61 SWN Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from the volatility in commodity prices, basis differentials and interest rates, as well as credit risk concentrations. We use natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options and interest rate swaps to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil and in interest rates. Our Board of Directors has approved risk management policies and procedures to utilize financial products for the reduction of defined commodity price risk. Utilization of financial products for the reduction of interest rate risks is subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. These policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings. Credit Risk Our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables and derivative contracts associated with commodities trading. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of our customers and their dispersion across geographic areas. No single customer accounted for greater than 5% of accounts receivable at December 31, 2009. See Commodities Risk below for discussion of credit risk associated with commodities trading. Interest Rate Risk The following table presents the principal cash payments for our debt obligations and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates as of December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009, we had $998.7 million of total debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5.40% and we had $324.5 million of indebtedness outstanding under our Credit Facility. Interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when deemed appropriate. We do not have any interest rate swaps in effect currently. Fair Expected Maturity Date Value 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total 12/31/09 ($ in millions) Fixed Rate $ 1.2 $ 1.2 $ 1.2 $ 1.2 $ 1.2 $ 668.2 $ 674.2 $ 707.3 Average Interest Rate 7.15% 7.15% 7.15% 7.15% 7.15% 7.47% 7.47% Variable Rate $ 324.5 $ 324.5 $ 324.5 Average Interest Rate 1.11% 1.11% Commodities Risk We use over the counter natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options to hedge sales of our production and to hedge activity in our Midstream Services segment against the inherent price risks of adverse price fluctuations or locational pricing differences between a published index and the NYMEX futures market. These swaps and options include (1) transactions in which one party will pay a fixed price (or variable price) for a notional quantity in exchange for receiving a variable price (or fixed price) based on a published index (referred to as price swaps), (2) transactions in which parties agree to pay a price based on two different indices (referred to as basis swaps) and (3) the purchase and sale of index related puts and calls (collars) that provide a floor price, below which the counterparty pays funds equal to the amount by which the price of the commodity is below the contracted floor, and a ceiling price above which we pay to the counterparty the amount by which the price of the commodity is above the contracted ceiling. The primary market risks relating to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for natural gas and crude oil. However, the market price risk is offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related sale or purchase of the natural gas or sale of the oil that is hedged. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss as a result of non performance by our counterparties. The counterparties are primarily major investment and commercial banks which management believes present minimal credit risks. The credit quality of each counterparty and the level of financial exposure we have to each counterparty are closely monitored to limit our credit risk exposure. Additionally, we perform both quantitative and qualitative assessments of these counterparties based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable. We have not incurred any counterparty losses related to non performance and do not anticipate any losses given the information we have currently. However, given the current volatility in the financial markets, we cannot be certain that we will not experience such losses in the future. 62 SWN Table of Contents Exploration and Production The following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in commodity prices and that are used to hedge prices for gas production. The table presents the notional amount in Bcf, the weighted average contract prices and the fair value by expected maturity dates. At December 31, 2009, the fair value of our financial instruments related to natural gas production was a $151.8 million asset. Weighted Weighted Weighted Weighted Average Average Average Average Fair value at Price to be Floor Ceiling Basis December 31, Swapped Price Price Differential 2009 Volume ($/MMBtu) ($/MMBtu) ($/MMBtu) ($/MMBtu) ($ in millions) Natural Gas (Bcf): Fixed Price Swaps: 2010 36.0 9.04 116.6 2011 30.0 6.69 10.4 Costless Collars: 2010 30.0 6.80 8.43 38.1 Basis Swaps: 2010 46.5 (0.37) (11.7) 2011 9.0 (0.35) (1.6) At December 31, 2009, our basis swaps did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify as hedges are recorded in gas and oil sales. At December 31, 2009, we had outstanding fixed price basis differential swaps on 46.5 Bcf of 2010 and 9.0 Bcf of 2011 gas production. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded an unrealized loss of $15.1 million related to the differential swaps that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and a gain of $9.9 million gain related to the change in estimated ineffectiveness of our cash flow hedges. Typically, our hedge ineffectiveness results from changes at the end of a reporting period in the price differentials between the index price of the derivative contract, which is primarily a NYMEX price, and the index price for the point of sale for the cash flow that is being hedged. At December 31, 2008, we had outstanding fixed price basis differential swaps on 50.0 Bcf of 2009, 32.0 Bcf of 2010 and 7.2 Bcf of 2011 gas production that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Subsequent to December 31, 2009 and prior to February 25, 2010, we hedged an additional 7.3 Bcf of 2011 gas production using costless collars with an average floor and ceiling price of $5.75 and $7.06 per MMBtu, respectively. We also basis protected an additional 2.8 Bcf of 2010 and 3.0 Bcf of 2011 gas production with an average differential price of $0.08 below NYMEX spot rates for our respective basis locations. Midstream Services At December 31, 2009, our Midstream Services segment had outstanding fair value hedges in place on 0.3 Bcf, 0.1 Bcf and 0.1 Bcf of gas for 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. These hedges are a mixture of fixed price swap purchases and sales relating to our gas marketing activities. These hedges have contract months from January 2010 through March 2012 and have a net fair value liability of $0.8 million as of December 31, 2009. 63 SWN Table of Contents
