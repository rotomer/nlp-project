ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This Form 10 K contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements for many reasons, including the risks described in the Cautionary Statement About Forward Looking Statements below, in Item 1A, Risk Factors in Part I and elsewhere in this annual report. You should read the following discussion with the Item 6. Selected Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this Form 10 K. OVERVIEW Background Southwestern Energy Company is an independent energy company engaged in natural gas and crude oil exploration, development and production (E&P). We are also focused on creating and capturing additional value through our natural gas gathering and marketing businesses, which we refer to as Midstream Services. We operate principally in two segments: E&P and Midstream Services. Our primary business is the exploration for and production of natural gas and oil, with our current operations being principally focused within the United States on development of an unconventional gas reservoir located on the Arkansas side of the Arkoma Basin, which we refer to as the Fayetteville Shale play. We are also actively engaged in exploration and production activities in Pennsylvania, where we are targeting the unconventional gas reservoir known as the Marcellus Shale, and to a lesser extent in Texas and in Arkansas and Oklahoma in the Arkoma Basin. We have recently commenced exploration operations in Arkansas and Louisiana testing an unconventional oil play targeting the Lower Smackover Brown Dense formation. In 2010, we commenced an exploration program in New Brunswick, Canada, which represents our first operations outside of the United States. We are focused on providing long term growth in the net asset value of our business, which we achieve in our E&P business through the drillbit. We derive the vast majority of our operating income and cash flow from the natural gas production of our E&P business and expect this to continue in the future. We expect that growth in our operating income and revenues will primarily depend on natural gas prices and our ability to increase our natural gas production. We expect our natural gas production volumes will continue to increase due to our ongoing development of the Fayetteville Shale play in Arkansas and the Marcellus Shale play in Pennsylvania. The price we expect to receive for our natural gas is a critical factor in the capital investments we make in order to develop our properties and increase our production. In recent years, there has been a significant decline in natural gas prices as evidenced by New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas prices ranging from a high of $13.58 per MMBtu in 2008 to a recent low of $2.32 per MMBtu in January 2012. Natural gas prices fluctuate due to a variety of factors we cannot control or predict. These factors, which include increased supplies of natural gas due to greater exploration and development activities, weather conditions, political and economic events, and competition from other energy sources, impact supply and demand for natural gas, which in turn determines the sale prices for our production. In addition to the factors identified above, the prices we realize for our production are affected by our hedging activities as well as locational differences in market prices. Recent Financial and Operating Results We reported net income attributable to Southwestern Energy of $637.8 million in 2011, or $1.82 per diluted share, up from net income attributable to Southwestern Energy of $604.1 million in 2010, or $1.73 per diluted share. We reported a net loss attributable to Southwestern Energy of $35.7 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, in 2009. The loss in 2009 included a $907.8 million, or $558.3 million net of taxes, non cash ceiling test impairment of our United States natural gas and oil properties that resulted from a significant decline in natural gas prices during the first quarter of 2009. Our cash flow from operating activities increased 6% to $1,739.8 million in 2011 due to an increase in net income adjusted for non cash expenses which was partially offset by changes in working capital accounts, and increased 21% to $1,642.6 million in 2010 due to an increase in net income adjusted for non cash expenses and changes in working capital. In 2011, our natural gas and oil production increased 24% to 500.0 Bcfe, up from 404.7 Bcfe in 2010. The 95.3 Bcfe increase in our 2011 production resulted from a 86.6 Bcf increase in net production from our Fayetteville Shale play and a 22.4 Bcf increase in net production from our Marcellus Shale properties, which more than offset a combined 13.7 Bcfe decrease in net production from our East Texas and Arkoma Basin properties. In 2010, our natural gas and oil production increased to 404.7 Bcfe, up from 300.4 Bcfe in 2009. We are targeting 2012 natural gas and oil production of 560 to 570 Bcfe, an increase of approximately 13% over our 2011 production, using midpoints. Our year end reserves 48 SWN Table of Contents grew 19% in 2011 to 5,893 Bcfe, up from 4,937 Bcfe at the end of 2010 and 3,657 Bcfe at the end of 2009, primarily as a result of the continued development of our Fayetteville Shale play and Marcellus Shale play. Our E&P segment reported operating income of $825.1 million in 2011, down from $829.5 million in 2010. Operating income in 2011 decreased $4.4 million over 2010 as the revenue impact of our 24% increase in production was more than offset by the 10% decline in our average realized gas prices and a $214.4 million increase in operating costs that resulted from our significant production growth. We recorded operating income from our E&P segment of $829.5 million in 2010, up from an operating loss of $157.7 million in 2009. The operating loss in 2009 included a $907.8 million non cash ceiling test impairment of our United States natural gas and oil properties. Excluding the $907.8 million non cash ceiling test impairment, operating income in 2010 increased $79.4 million over 2009 as a result of the revenue impact of our 35% increase in production which was partially offset by the 12% decline in our average realized gas prices and a $217.8 million increase in operating costs and expenses that resulted from our significant production growth. Operating income for our Midstream Services segment was $248.0 million in 2011, up from $191.6 million in 2010 and $122.6 million in 2009. Operating income for our Midstream Services segment increased in 2011 due to an increase of $92.2 million in gathering revenues and an increase of $5.8 million in the margin generated from our natural gas marketing activities, which were partially offset by a $41.6 million increase in operating costs and expenses, exclusive of gas purchase costs, that resulted from our continued significant growth in volumes gathered. Volumes gathered grew to 745.7 Bcf in 2011 compared to 588.3 Bcf in 2010. Operating income for our Midstream Services segment increased in 2010 due to an increase of $110.4 million in gathering revenues and an increase of $5.5 million in the margin generated from our natural gas marketing activities, which were partially offset by a $46.9 million increase in operating costs and expenses, exclusive of gas purchase costs, that resulted from our significant growth in volumes gathered. Volumes gathered grew to 588.3 Bcf in 2010 compared to 387.1 Bcf in 2009. We had total capital investments of $2,207.2 million in 2011, compared to $2,120.1 million in 2010 and $1,809.1 million in 2009. Of our total capital investments, $1,977.5 million was invested in our E&P segment in 2011 compared to $1,775.5 million and $1,565.5 million invested in our E&P segment in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Outlook We believe the outlook for our business is favorable despite the continued uncertainty of natural gas prices in the United States and the legislative and regulatory challenges facing our industry. Our resource base, financial strength and disciplined investment of capital provide us with an opportunity to exploit and develop our position in the Fayetteville Shale play and Marcellus Shale play, maximize efficiency through economies of scale in our key operating areas, enhance our overall returns through expansion of our Midstream Services operations and grow through new exploration and development activities. Our capital investment plan for 2012 is flexible and is based on our expectation that natural gas prices will remain at current price levels. Should prices decline materially from their current levels we will adjust our capital investment plans accordingly. 49 SWN Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of our results of operations for our segments is presented before intersegment eliminations. We evaluate our segments as if they were stand alone operations and accordingly discuss their results prior to any intersegment eliminations. Interest expense, interest income, income tax expense and stock based compensation are discussed on a consolidated basis. Exploration and Production Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Revenues (in thousands) $ 2,100,488 $ 1,890,444 $ 1,593,231 Impairment of natural gas and oil properties (in thousands) $ $ $ 907,812 Operating costs and expenses (in thousands) $ 1,275,350 $ 1,060,982 $ 843,144 Operating income (loss) (in thousands) $ 825,138 $ 829,462 $ (157,725) Natural gas production (Bcf) 499.4 403.6 299.7 Oil production (MBbls) 97 171 124 Total production (Bcfe) 500.0 404.7 300.4 Average gas price per Mcf, including hedges $ 4.19 $ 4.64 $ 5.30 Average gas price per Mcf, excluding hedges $ 3.56 $ 3.93 $ 3.34 Average oil price per Bbl $ 94.08 $ 76.84 $ 54.99 Average unit costs per Mcfe: Lease operating expenses $ 0.84 $ 0.83 $ 0.77 General & administrative expenses $ 0.27 $ 0.30 $ 0.35 Taxes, other than income taxes $ 0.11 $ 0.11 $ 0.11 Full cost pool amortization $ 1.30 $ 1.34 $ 1.51 Revenues Revenues for our E&P segment were up $210.0 million, or 11%, in 2011 compared to 2010. Higher natural gas production volumes in 2011 increased revenues by $445.0 million while lower realized prices for our natural gas production decreased revenue by $227.9 million compared to 2010. E&P revenues were up $297.2 million, or 19%, in 2010 compared to 2009. Higher natural gas production volumes in 2010 increased revenues by $551.0 million while lower realized prices for our natural gas production decreased revenue by $265.1 million. We expect our natural gas production volumes to continue to increase due to our development of the Fayetteville Shale properties in Arkansas and our Marcellus Shale properties in Pennsylvania. Natural gas and oil prices are difficult to predict and subject to wide price fluctuations. As of February 23, 2012, we had hedged 266.4 Bcf of our remaining 2012 natural gas production and 185.2 Bcf of our 2013 natural gas production to help limit our exposure to price fluctuations. For more information about our derivatives and risk management activities, we refer you to Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K and to Commodity Prices below for additional information. Production In 2011, our natural gas and oil production increased 24% to 500.0 Bcfe, up from 404.7 Bcfe in 2010. The 95.3 Bcfe increase in our 2011 production resulted from a 86.6 Bcf increase in net production from our Fayetteville Shale play and a 22.4 Bcf increase in net production from our Marcellus Shale properties, which more than offset a combined 13.7 Bcfe decrease in net production from our East Texas and Arkoma Basin properties. Natural gas and oil production was up approximately 35% to 404.7 Bcfe in 2010, as compared to 2009, due to a 106.7 Bcf increase in net production from our Fayetteville Shale play and a 1.0 Bcf increase in net production from our Marcellus Shale properties, which more than offset a combined 3.4 Bcfe decrease in net production from out East Texas and Arkoma Basin properties. Our net production from the Fayetteville Shale play was 436.8 Bcf in 2011, up from 350.2 Bcf in 2010 and 243.5 Bcf in 2009. We are targeting 2012 natural gas and oil production of 560 to 570 Bcfe, an increase of approximately 13% over our 2011 production, using midpoints. Approximately 465 to 470 Bcf of our 2012 targeted natural gas production is projected to come from our activities in the Fayetteville Shale play. Although we expect production volumes in 2012 to increase, we cannot guarantee our success in discovering, developing and producing reserves, including with respect to our Fayetteville Shale play. Our ability to discover, develop and produce reserves is dependent upon a number of factors, many of which 50 SWN Table of Contents are beyond our control, including the availability of capital, the timing and extent of changes in natural gas and oil prices and competition. There are also many risks inherent in the discovery, development and production of natural gas and oil. We refer you to Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10 K for a discussion of these risks and the impact they could have on our financial condition and results of operations. Commodity Prices The average price realized for our natural gas production, including the effects of hedges, decreased 10% to $4.19 per Mcf in 2011 and decreased 12% to $4.64 per Mcf in 2010. The decrease in the average price realized in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily reflects the decrease in average market prices and to a lesser extent the decreased effect of our natural gas price hedging activities, which had a greater positive impact on our average realized gas price in 2010 (see additional discussion below). The decrease in the average price realized in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily reflected the decrease in average market prices, which was partially offset by the positive effect of our price hedging activities in 2010. We periodically enter into various hedging and other financial arrangements with respect to a portion of our projected natural gas and crude oil production in order to ensure certain desired levels of cash flow and to minimize the impact of price fluctuations, including fluctuations in locational market differentials (we refer you to Item 7A of this Form 10 K, Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, and our hedge risk factor for additional discussion about our derivatives and risk management activities). Our hedging activities increased the average gas price $0.63 per Mcf in 2011, compared to an increase of $0.71 per Mcf in 2010 and an increase of $1.96 per Mcf in 2009. Disregarding the impact of hedges, the average price received for our natural gas production in 2011 was $0.37 per Mcf lower than 2010 and $0.48 lower than the average monthly NYMEX settlement price for 2011. At December 31, 2011, we had basis protected on approximately 269.4 Bcf of our 2012 expected natural gas production through financial hedging activities and physical sales arrangements at a basis differential to NYMEX gas prices of approximately $0.02 per Mcf. In addition to the basis hedges discussed above, at December 31, 2011, we had NYMEX fixed price hedges in place on notional volumes of 185.9 Bcf of our remaining 2012 natural gas production at an average price of $5.02 per MMBtu and collars in place on notional volumes of 80.5 Bcf of our 2012 natural gas production at an average floor and ceiling price of $5.50 and $6.67 per MMBtu, respectively. At December 31, 2011, we had NYMEX fixed price hedges in place on notional volumes of 185.2 Bcf of our 2013 natural gas production. Our E&P segment receives a sales price for our natural gas at a discount to average monthly NYMEX settlement prices due to locational basis differentials, while transportation charges and fuel charges also reduce the price received. Assuming a NYMEX commodity price of $3.00 per Mcf for 2012, and disregarding the impact of hedges, we expect our total gas sales discount to NYMEX to be $0.45 to $0.55 per Mcf. We realized an average price of $94.08 per barrel for our oil production for the year ended December 31, 2011, up approximately 22% from the prior year. The 2010 average realized price of $76.84 per barrel was up 40% from 2009. We did not hedge any of our 2011, 2010 or 2009 oil production. Operating Income Operating income from our E&P segment decreased $4.4 million to $825.1 million in 2011 from $829.5 million in 2010 as the revenue impact of our 24% increase in production was more than offset by the 10% decrease in our average realized gas prices and a $214.4 million increase in operating costs that resulted from our significant production growth. We recorded an operating loss from our E&P segment of $157.7 million in 2009. The operating loss in 2009 includes a $907.8 million non cash ceiling test impairment of our United States natural gas and oil properties that resulted from a significant decline in natural gas prices during the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the $907.8 million non cash ceiling test impairment, operating income in 2010 increased $79.4 million over 2009 as a result of the revenue impact of our 35% increase in production which was partially offset by a 12% decline in our average realized gas prices and a $217.8 million increase in operating costs and expenses that resulted from our significant production growth. Operating Costs and Expenses Lease operating expenses per Mcfe for the E&P segment were $0.84 in 2011, compared to $0.83 in 2010 and $0.77 in 2009. Lease operating expenses per unit of production increased in 2011 primarily due to increased gathering costs associated with our Fayetteville Shale operations. Lease operating expenses per unit of production increased in 2010 51 SWN Table of Contents compared to 2009 primarily due to increased gathering, compression and water disposal costs associated with our Fayetteville Shale operations. We expect our per unit operating cost for this segment to range between $0.86 and $0.90 per Mcfe in 2012. General and administrative expenses for the E&P segment were $0.27 per Mcfe in 2011, down from $0.30 per Mcfe in 2010 and $0.35 per Mcfe in 2009. The decreases in general and administrative costs per Mcfe in 2011 and 2010 were due to the effects of our increased production volumes. In total, general and administrative expenses for the E&P segment were $134.8 million in 2011, $120.3 million in 2010 and $105.0 million in 2009. The increases in general and administrative expenses since 2009 were primarily a result of increased payroll, incentive compensation, employee related costs and professional fees associated with the expansion of our E&P operations due to the continued development of the Fayetteville Shale play and Marcellus Shale play. These increases accounted for $11.1 million, or 76%, of the 2011 increase and $13.6 million, or 89%, of the 2010 increase. We added 106 new E&P employees during 2011 compared to 253 employees added in 2010. We expect our per unit cost for general and administrative expenses in 2012 to range between $0.29 and $0.33 per Mcfe. The expected increase in our per unit general and administrative costs in 2012 is due to general increases in our G&A and increased compensation costs associated with ongoing development of our Fayetteville Shale and Marcellus Shale plays. Future changes in our general and administrative expenses for this segment are primarily dependent upon our salary costs, level of pension expense, amount of stock based compensation expense and the amount of incentive compensation paid to our employees and level and intensity of our operating activities. For eligible employees, a portion of incentive compensation is based on the achievement of certain operating and performance results, including production, proved reserve additions, present value added for each dollar of capital invested, and lease operating expenses and general and administrative expenses per unit of production, while another portion is discretionary based upon an employees performance. Taxes other than income taxes per Mcfe were $0.11 in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Taxes other than income taxes per Mcfe vary from period to period due to changes in severance and ad valorem taxes that result from the mix of our production volumes and fluctuations in commodity prices. Effective January 1, 2009, the State of Arkansas changed the severance tax on natural gas wells to be based on the market value of natural gas produced. Our full cost pool amortization rate averaged $1.30 per Mcfe for 2011, $1.34 per Mcfe for 2010 and $1.51 per Mcfe for 2009. The decline in the average amortization rate for 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily the result of lower acquisition and development costs and sale of certain East Texas properties in 2011 and 2010. The decline in the average amortization rate for 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily the result of lower acquisition and development costs combined with the $907.8 million non cash ceiling test impairment recorded in the first quarter of 2009 and the sale of certain East Texas oil and natural gas leases and wells in the second quarter of 2010 as the proceeds from the sale were appropriately credited to the full cost pool. The amortization rate is impacted by the timing and amount of reserve additions and the costs associated with those additions, revisions of previous reserve estimates due to both price and well performance, write downs that result from full cost ceiling tests, proceeds from the sale of properties that reduce the full cost pool and the levels of costs subject to amortization. We cannot predict our future full cost pool amortization rate with accuracy due to the variability of each of the factors discussed above, as well as other factors, including but not limited to the uncertainty of the amount of future reserves attributed to our Fayetteville Shale play. Unevaluated costs excluded from amortization were $942.9 million at the end of 2011 compared to $712.1 million at the end of 2010 and $595.4 million at the end of 2009. Unevaluated costs excluded from amortization at the end of 2011 included $27.9 million related to our properties in Canada. The increase in unevaluated costs since December 31, 2010 primarily resulted from a $172.9 million increase in our undeveloped leasehold acreage and seismic costs as well as a $103.7 million increase in our drilling activity in our wells in progress. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our unevaluated costs excluded from amortization. The timing and amount of production and reserve additions could have a material impact on our per unit costs; if production or reserves additions are lower than projected, our per unit costs could increase. 52 SWN Table of Contents Midstream Services Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 ($ in millions) Revenues marketing $ 2,451.3 $ 2,137.8 $ 1,397.7 Revenues gathering $ 408.2 $ 316.0 $ 205.6 Gas purchases marketing $ 2,418.1 $ 2,110.4 $ 1,375.8 Operating costs and expenses $ 193.4 $ 151.8 $ 104.9 Operating income $ 248.0 $ 191.6 $ 122.6 Gas volumes marketed (Bcf) 611.4 495.8 382.5 Gas volumes gathered (Bcf) 745.7 588.3 387.1 Revenues Revenues from our marketing activities were up 15% to $2,451.3 million for 2011 compared to 2010. The increase in marketing revenues resulted from increases in the volumes marketed which partially offset a decrease in the prices received for volumes marketed. Revenues from our marketing activities were up 53% to $2,137.8 million for 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in marketing revenues for 2010 resulted from increases in the volumes marketed combined with an increase in the prices received for volumes marketed. The average price received for volumes marketed decreased 7% in 2011 compared to 2010, and increased 18% in 2010 compared to 2009. Volumes marketed increased 23% in 2011 compared to 2010, and increased 30% in 2010 compared to 2009. Of the total volumes marketed, production from our E&P operated wells accounted for 94% in 2011, 95% in 2010 and 92% in 2009. Increases and decreases in marketing revenues due to changes in commodity prices are largely offset by corresponding changes in gas purchase expenses. Revenues from our gathering activities were up 29% to $408.2 million for 2011 compared to 2010, and were up 54% to $316.0 million for 2010 compared to 2009. The increases in gathering revenues primarily resulted from a 27% increase in gas volumes gathered in 2011 compared to 2010 and a 52% increase in gas volumes gathered in 2010 compared to 2009. Substantially all of the increases in gathering revenues for 2011 and 2010 resulted from increases in the volumes gathered from our operated production from the Fayetteville Shale play. Gathering volumes, revenues and expenses for this segment are expected to continue to grow as production from our Fayetteville Shale and Marcellus Shale plays increase. Operating Income Operating income from our Midstream Services segment increased 29% to $248.0 million in 2011 and increased 56% to $191.6 million in 2010. The increases in operating income reflect the substantial increases in gas volumes gathered and marketed which resulted primarily from our increased E&P production volumes. The increase in operating income for 2011 compared to 2010 was due to an increase of $92.2 million in gathering revenues and an increase of $5.8 million in the margin generated from our gas marketing activities, which were partially offset by a $41.6 million increase in operating costs and expenses, exclusive of purchased gas costs. The increase in operating income for 2010 compared to 2009 was due to a $110.4 million increase in gathering revenues and an increase of $5.5 million in the margin generated from our gas marketing activities, which were partially offset by a $46.9 million increase in operating costs and expenses, exclusive of purchased gas costs. The margin generated from gas marketing activities was $33.2 million for 2011, compared to $27.4 million for 2010 and $21.9 million for 2009. Margins are primarily driven by volumes of gas marketed and may fluctuate depending on the prices paid for commodities and the ultimate disposition of those commodities. The increases in margins generated are primarily the result of a 23% increase in volumes marketed in 2011 and a 30% increase in volumes marketed in 2010, as compared to prior years, resulting from marketing our increased E&P production volumes. We enter into hedging activities from time to time with respect to our gas marketing activities to provide margin protection. For more information about our derivatives and risk management activities, we refer you to Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Interest Expense Interest expense, net of capitalization, was $24.1 million in 2011, a decrease of $2.1 million compared to 2010, primarily due to a increase in capitalized interest. Interest capitalized increased to $45.7 million in 2011 from $32.9 million in 2010, primarily due to an increase in our weighted average interest rate and average borrowed balance under our credit facility during 2011, which had a weighted average interest rate of 2.06% for 2011 and an increase in our unevaluated 53 SWN Table of Contents properties. In 2010, interest expense, net of capitalization, was $26.2 million, an increase of $7.5 million compared to 2009 primarily due to a decrease in capitalized interest. Interest capitalized decreased to $32.9 million in 2010 from $40.2 million in 2009, primarily due to a decrease in our weighted average interest rate during 2010 as a result of the increase in our average borrowed balance under our credit facility, which had a weighted average interest rate of 1.06% for 2010. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate was 39.3% in 2011 and 2010 and 31.5% in 2009. Our effective tax rate, excluding the $907.8 million non cash ceiling test impairment of our natural gas and oil properties, would have been 39.0% for 2009. In general, differences between our effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate of 35% primarily result from the effect of certain state income taxes and permanent items attributable to book tax differences. Stock Based Compensation Expense We recognized expense of $10.6 million and capitalized $8.5 million for stock based compensation in 2011, compared to $9.8 million expensed and $6.8 million capitalized in 2010 and $10.2 million expensed and $5.9 million capitalized in 2009. We refer you to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our equity based compensation plans. 54 SWN Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We depend primarily on internally generated funds, our Credit Facility, sales of non core assets and funds accessed through debt and equity markets as our primary sources of liquidity. During 2012, assuming natural gas prices remain at current levels, we expect to draw on a portion of the funds available under the Credit Facility to fund the portion of our planned capital investments (discussed below under Capital Investments), that are expected to exceed the net cash generated by our operations. We refer you to Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K and the section below under Financing Requirements for additional discussion of our Credit Facility. Net cash provided by operating activities increased 6% to $1.7 billion in 2011, due to an increase in net income adjusted for non cash expenses which was partially offset by changes in working capital accounts. Net cash provided by operating activities increased 21% to $1.6 billion in 2010, due to an increase in net income adjusted for non cash expenses and changes in working capital accounts. For 2011, requirements for our capital investments were funded from our cash generated by operating activities, borrowings under our Credit Facility and the proceeds from the sale of certain East Texas oil and natural gas properties. Net cash from operating activities provided 80% of our cash requirements for capital investments in 2011, 79% in 2010 and 76% in 2009. At December 31, 2011, our capital structure consisted of 25% debt and 75% equity. We believe that our operating cash flow and available funds under our Credit Facility will be adequate to meet our capital and operating requirements for 2012. The credit status of the financial institutions participating in our Credit Facility could adversely impact our ability to borrow funds under the Credit Facility. While we believe all of the lenders under the facility have the ability to provide funds, we cannot predict whether each will be able to meet its obligation. Our cash flow from operating activities is highly dependent upon the market prices that we receive for our natural gas and oil production. Natural gas and oil prices are subject to wide fluctuations and are driven by market supply and demand factors which are impacted by the overall state of the economy. The price received for our production is also influenced by our commodity hedging activities, as more fully discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K and Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Our commodity hedging activities are subject to the credit risk of our counterparties being financially unable to complete the transaction. We actively monitor the credit status of our counterparties, performing both quantitative and qualitative assessments based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable, and to date have not had any credit defaults associated with our transactions. However, any future failures by one or more counterparties could negatively impact our cash flow from operating activities. Additionally, our short term cash flows are dependent on the timely collection of receivables from our customers and partners. We actively manage this risk through credit management activities and, through the date of this filing, have not experienced any significant write offs for non collectable amounts. However, any sustained inaccessibility of credit by our customers and partners could adversely impact our cash flows. Due to the above factors, we are unable to forecast with certainty our future level of cash flow from operations. Accordingly, we will adjust our discretionary uses of cash dependent upon available cash flow. Capital Investments Our capital investments were $2.2 billion in 2011, up from $2.1 billion in 2010. Capital investments include an increase of $4.3 million in 2011, an increase of $14.4 million in 2010 and an increase of $12.2 million in 2009 related to the change in accrued expenditures between years. Our E&P segment investments in 2011 were $2.0 billion, compared to $1.8 billion in 2010 and $1.6 billion in 2009. 2011 2010 2009 (in thousands) Exploration and production $ 1,977,493 $ 1,775,518 $ 1,565,450 Midstream services 160,776 271,316 214,208 Other 68,905 73,231 29,459 $ 2,207,174 $ 2,120,065 $ 1,809,117 55 SWN Table of Contents Our capital investments for 2012 are planned to be $2.1 billion, consisting of approximately $1.8 billion for E&P, $190 million for Midstream Services and $90 million for corporate and other purposes. Of the approximate $1.8 billion, we expect to allocate approximately $1.1 billion to our Fayetteville Shale play. Our planned level of capital investments in 2012 is expected to allow us to continue our progress in the Fayetteville Shale and Marcellus Shale programs and explore and develop other existing natural gas and oil properties and generate new drilling prospects. As discussed above, our 2012 capital investment program is expected to be funded through cash flow from operations and borrowings under our Credit Facility. The planned capital program for 2012 is flexible and can be modified, including downward, if the low natural gas price environment persists for an extended period of time. We will reevaluate our proposed investments as needed to take into account prevailing market conditions and, if natural gas prices change significantly in 2012, we could change our planned investments. Financing Requirements Our total debt outstanding was $1,343.3 million at December 31, 2011, compared to $1,094.2 million at December 31, 2010. In February 2011, we amended and restated our unsecured revolving credit facility, increasing the borrowing capacity to $1.5 billion and extending the maturity date to February 2016. The amount available under the revolving credit facility may be increased to $2.0 billion at any time upon the Companys agreement with its existing or additional lenders. We had $671.5 and $421.2 million outstanding under its revolving credit facility at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. The interest rate on our Credit Facility is calculated based upon our public debt rating and is currently 200 basis points over LIBOR. At February 23, 2012, our publicly traded notes are rated BBB by Standard and Poors and we have a Corporate Family Rating of Baa3 by Moodys. Any downgrades in our public debt ratings could increase our cost of funds under the Credit Facility. Our Credit Facility contains covenants which impose certain restrictions on us. Under the Credit Facility, we must keep our total debt at or below 60% of our total capital, and must maintain a ratio of EBITDA to interest expense of 3.5 or above. Our Credit Facilitys financial covenants with respect to capitalization percentages exclude the noncontrolling interest in equity, the effects of non cash entries that result from any full cost ceiling impairments, hedging activities and our pension and other postretirement liabilities. Therefore, under our Credit Facility, our capital structure at December 31, 2011 would have been 27% debt and 73% equity. We were in compliance with all of the covenants of our Credit Facility at December 31, 2011. Although we do not anticipate any violations of our financial covenants, our ability to comply with those covenants is dependent upon the success of our exploration and development program and upon factors beyond our control, such as the market prices for natural gas and oil. If we are unable to borrow under our Credit Facility, we would have to decrease our capital investment plans. At December 31, 2011, our capital structure consisted of 25% debt and 75% equity compared to 27% debt and 73% equity at December 31, 2010. Our debt percentage of total capital at December 31, 2011 decreased in 2011, primarily due to our profitable results and the minimal funding of our capital investments and operational needs through debt. Equity at December 31, 2011 included an accumulated other comprehensive gain of $424.9 million related to our hedging activities and a loss for $15.9 million related to our pension and other postretirement liabilities. The amount recorded in equity for our hedging activities is based on current market values for our hedges at December 31, 2011 and does not necessarily reflect the value that we will receive or pay when the hedges are ultimately settled, nor does it take into account revenues to be received associated with the physical delivery of sales volumes hedged. Our hedges allow us to ensure a certain level of cash flow to fund our operations. At February 23, 2012, we had NYMEX commodity price hedges in place on 266.4 Bcf, or approximately 47% of our targeted 2012 natural gas production and 185.2 Bcf of our expected 2013 natural gas production. The amount of long term debt we incur will be dependent upon commodity prices and our capital investment plans. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We may enter into off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off balance sheet obligations. At December 31, 2011, the Companys material off balance sheet arrangements and transactions include operating lease arrangements. There are no other transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or availability of or capital resources. 56 SWN Table of Contents For more information regarding off balance sheet arrangements, we refer you to Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments below. Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments We have various contractual obligations in the normal course of our operations and financing activities. Significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2011, were as follows: Contractual Obligations: Payments Due by Period Less than More than Total 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years 5 Years (in thousands) Demand charges(1) $ 2,095,722 $ 212,160 $ 453,249 $ 469,850 $ 960,463 Debt 1,343,300 1,200 2,400 673,900 665,800 Interest on senior notes 386,590 64,304 130,105 117,588 74,593 Operating leases(2) 268,088 69,728 122,720 59,426 16,214 Operating agreements(3) 613,622 459,523 145,401 8,698 Compression services(4) 107,130 42,115 45,744 17,563 1,708 Purchase obligations(5) 50,221 50,221 Other obligations(6) 213,697 78,285 14,856 3,154 117,402 $ 5,078,370 $ 977,536 $ 914,475 $ 1,350,179 $ 1,836,180 (1) As of December 31, 2011, our Midstream Services segment had commitments for demand transportation charges on various pipelines, including approximately $1.0 billion related to the FEP pipeline and $0.7 billion related to the Boardwalk Pipeline. (2) Operating leases include costs for compressors, aircraft, vehicles, office space and equipment under non cancelable operating leases expiring through 2019. Additionally, this includes $58.1 million for leases of 14 drilling rigs and related equipment through 2014. (3) As of December 31, 2011, our E&P segment had commitments for approximately $548.3 million to companies for fracture stimulation services, which are cancellable under certain circumstances. (4) As of December 31, 2011, our Midstream Services segment had commitments of approximately $100.6 million and our E&P segment had commitments of approximately $6.5 million for compression services associated primarily with our Fayetteville Shale play operations. (5) Purchase obligations consist of outstanding purchase orders under existing agreements. As of December 31, 2011, our Midstream Services segment had outstanding purchase obligations of $12.7 million relating to compression units. (6) In conjunction with our exploration program in New Brunswick, Canada, we provided promissory notes payable on demand to the Minister of Finance of the Province of New Brunswick with an aggregate principal amount of CAD $44.5 million. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our commitments related to our exploration program in Canada. Our other significant contractual obligations include approximately $127.5 million for asset retirement obligations primarily relating to oil and gas properties, approximately $12.0 million for funding of benefit plans, approximately $9.6 million for various information technology support and data subscription agreements, approximately $7.1 million for insurance premium financing and approximately $7.4 million related to seismic services. We refer you to Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of our debt. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities Substantially all of our employees are covered by defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans. We currently expect to contribute approximately $12.7 million to our pension plans and $0.2 million to our postretirement benefit plan in 2012. For 2011, we contributed $12.5 million to our pension plans and contributed $0.1 million to our postretirement benefit plan. At December 31, 2011 we recognized a liability of $20.5 million as a result of the underfunded status of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans compared to a liability of $15.9 million at December 31, 2010. For further information regarding our pension and other postretirement benefit plans, we refer you to Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements and Critical Accounting Policies below for additional information. Working Capital We maintain access to funds that may be needed to meet capital requirements through our Credit Facility described in Financing Requirements above. We had positive working capital of $93.4 million at December 31, 2011 and negative working capital of $113.1 million at December 31, 2010. Current assets increased $397.4 million during 2011 primarily due to a $384.1 million increase in our current hedging asset which was partially offset by a $9.7 million decrease in 57 SWN Table of Contents accounts receivable. Current liabilities increased $190.9 million primarily due to a $150.1 million increase in our current deferred income taxes related to our hedging activities, a $40.2 million increase in accounts payable, and a $2.4 million increase in advances from partners. Natural Gas in Underground Storage We currently have one facility owned by our E&P segment that contains natural gas in underground storage. Natural gas in storage that is expected to be cycled within the next 12 months is recorded in current assets. This current portion of natural gas in storage is classified as inventory and is carried at the lower of cost or market. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the current portion of natural gas in storage was $7.8 million and $10.0 million, respectively. The non current portion of natural gas in storage is classified in property and equipment and carried at cost. The carrying value of the non current gas is evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may not be recoverable. The natural gas in inventory for the E&P segment is used primarily to supplement production in meeting the segments contractual commitments, especially during periods of colder weather. In determining the lower of cost or market for storage gas, we utilize the natural gas futures market in assessing the price we expect to be able to realize for our natural gas in inventory. A significant decline in the future market price of natural gas could require a write down of our natural gas in underground storage carrying cost. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an on going basis, based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following describes significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Natural Gas and Oil Properties We utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to the exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties. Under this method, all such costs (productive and nonproductive), including salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities are capitalized on a country by country basis and amortized over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method. These capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test that limits such pooled costs, net of applicable deferred taxes, to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved natural gas and oil reserves discounted at 10 percent (standardized measure) plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties. Any costs in excess of the ceiling are written off as a non cash expense. The expense may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling. Effective December 31, 2009, companies using the full cost method were required to use the average quoted price from the first day of each month from the previous 12 months, including the impact of derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges, to calculate the ceiling value of their reserves. For quarter and annual periods ending prior to December 31, 2009, prices in effect at the date of each accounting quarter, including the impact of derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges, were required to be used. Using the average quoted price from the first day of each month from the previous 12 months for Henry Hub natural gas of $4.12 per MMBtu and $92.71 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil, adjusted for market differentials, the Companys net book value of its United States natural gas and oil properties did not exceed the ceiling amount and did not result in a ceiling test impairment at December 31, 2011. Cash flow hedges of natural gas production in place increased this ceiling amount by approximately $262.5 million at December 31, 2011. Decreases in average market prices as well as changes in production rates, levels of reserves, evaluation of costs excluded from amortization, future development costs and service costs could result in future ceiling test impairments. Using the first day of the month prices of natural gas for the first two months of 2012 and NYMEX strip prices for the remainder of 2012, as applicable, the prices required to be used to determine the ceiling limit could result in a ceiling test write down in the first quarter of 2012 and are likely to require ceiling test write downs in each of the remaining quarters in 2012. At December 31, 2010, the ceiling value of the Companys reserves was calculated based upon year end quoted market prices of $4.38 per MMBtu for Henry Hub natural gas and $75.96 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil, and at December 31, 2009, the ceiling value of the Companys 58 SWN Table of Contents reserves was calculated based upon year end quoted market prices of $3.87 per MMBtu for Henry Hub natural gas and $57.65 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil. Decreases in market prices as well as changes in production rates, levels of reserves, evaluation of costs excluded from amortization, future development costs and production costs could result in future ceiling test impairments. At March 31, 2009, the net capitalized costs of our natural gas and oil properties exceeded the ceiling by approximately $558.3 million (net of tax) and resulted in a non cash ceiling test impairment using quarter end market prices of $3.63 per MMBtu for Henry Hub natural gas and $46.00 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil. All of our costs directly associated with the acquisition and evaluation of properties in New Brunswick, Canada relating to our exploration program at December 31, 2011 were unproved and did not exceed the ceiling amount. If our exploration program in Canada is unsuccessful on all or a portion of these properties, a ceiling test impairment may result in the future. Natural gas and oil reserves cannot be measured exactly. Our estimate of natural gas and oil reserves requires extensive judgments of reservoir engineering data and projections of cost that will be incurred in developing and producing reserves and is generally less precise than other estimates made in connection with financial disclosures. Our reservoir engineers prepare our reserve estimates under the supervision of our management. Reserve estimates are prepared for each of our properties annually by the reservoir engineers assigned to the asset management team to which the property is assigned. The reservoir engineering and financial data included in these estimates are reviewed by senior engineers who are not part of the asset management teams and our Manager Capital Budgeting & Reserves, who was the technical person primarily responsible for the preparation of our reserve estimates, and has over eight years of experience in petroleum engineering, including the estimation of oil and natural gas reserves, who reports to our Senior Vice President Corporate Development. Our Senior Vice President Corporate Development has more than 30 years of experience in reservoir engineering, including the estimation of oil and gas reserves in multiple basins both in the United States and internationally. On our behalf, the Senior Vice President Corporate Development engages NSAI, a worldwide leader of petroleum property analysis for industry and financial organizations and government agencies, to independently audit our proved reserves estimates as discussed in more detail below. The financial data included in the reserve estimates are also separately reviewed by our accounting staff. Following these reviews and the audit, the reserve estimates are submitted by our Senior Vice President Corporate Development to our Chief Executive Officer for his review and approval prior to the presentation to our Board of Directors. NSAI reports the results of its reserve audit to the Board of Directors and final authority over the estimates of our proved reserves rests with our Board of Directors. In each of the past three years, revisions to our proved reserve estimates represented no greater than 7% of our total proved reserve estimates, which we believe is indicative of the effectiveness of our internal controls. Proved developed reserves generally have a higher degree of accuracy in this estimation process, when compared to proved undeveloped and proved non producing reserves, as production history and pressure data over time is available for the majority of our proved developed properties. Proved developed reserves accounted for 55% of our total reserve base at December 31, 2011. Assigning monetary values to such estimates does not reduce the subjectivity and changing nature of such reserve estimates. The uncertainties inherent in the reserve estimates are compounded by applying additional estimates of the rates and timing of production and the costs that will be incurred in developing and producing the reserves. We cannot assure you that our internal controls sufficiently address the numerous uncertainties and risks that are inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas and oil reserves and projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures as many factors are beyond our control. We refer you to Although our estimated natural gas and oil reserve data is independently audited, our estimates may still prove to be inaccurate in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of Part I of this Form 10 K for a more detailed discussion of these uncertainties, risks and other factors. In conducting its audit, the engineers and geologists of NSAI study our major properties in detail and independently develop reserve estimates. NSAIs audit consists primarily of substantive testing, which includes a detailed review of major properties that account for approximately 90% of present worth of the companys total proved reserves. NSAIs audit process consists of sorting all fields by descending present value order and selecting the fields from highest value to descending value until the selected fields account for more than 80% of the present worth of our reserves. The properties in the bottom 20% of the total present worth are not reviewed in the audit. The fields included in approximately the top 90% present value as of December 31, 2011, accounted for approximately 92% of our total proved reserves and approximately 98% of our proved undeveloped reserves. In the conduct of its audit, NSAI did not independently verify the data we provided to them with respect to ownership interests, oil and natural gas production, well test data, historical costs of operation and development, product prices, or any agreements relating to current and future operations of the properties and sales of production. NSAI has advised us that if, in the course of its audit, something came to its attention that brought into question the validity or sufficiency of any such information or data, NSAI did not rely on such information or data until it had satisfactorily resolved any questions relating thereto or had independently verified such information or data. For the year ended December 31, 2011, on January 30, 2012, NSAI issued its audit opinion as to the reasonableness of our reserve estimates, stating that our estimated proved oil and gas reserves are, in the aggregate, reasonable and have been 59 SWN Table of Contents prepared in accordance with Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. A decline in natural gas and oil prices used to calculate the discounted future net revenues of our reserves affects both the present value of cash flows and the quantity of reserves reported. Our reserve base is nearly 100% natural gas, therefore changes in oil prices used do not have as significant an impact as natural gas prices on cash flows and reported reserve quantities. Our standardized measure and reserve quantities at December 31, 2011, were $3,450.8 million and 5,893.2 Bcfe, respectively. An assumed decrease of $1.00 per Mcf in the average 2011 natural gas price used to price our reserves would have resulted in an approximate $1,472.6 million decline in our standardized measure and an approximate decrease of 947 Bcfe of our reported reserves. The decline in reserve quantities, assuming this decrease in natural gas price, would have the impact of increasing our unit of production amortization of the full cost pool. The unit of production rate for amortization is adjusted quarterly based on changes in reserve estimates, capitalized costs and future development costs. Hedging We use natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil. Our policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings to minimize the risk of uncollectability. We actively monitor the credit status of our counterparties, performing both quantitative and qualitative assessments based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable, and to date have not had any credit defaults associated with our transactions. From 2006 through 2008, we established a portfolio of hedges relating to approximately 60% to 80% of our annual production. However, only 45%, 30% and 52% of our 2009, 2010, and 2011 production, respectively, was hedged due to credit and overall market events of 2008 and 2009 as well as the low commodity price environment throughout 2010 and 2011. The primary market risks related to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for natural gas and crude oil. However, the market price risk is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related natural gas or oil transaction that is hedged. Our derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our financial statements and generally qualify for hedge accounting. We have established the fair value of derivative instruments using data provided by our counterparties in conjunction with assumptions evaluated internally using established index prices and other sources. These valuations are recognized as assets or liabilities in our balance sheet and, to the extent an open position is an effective cash flow hedge on equity production, the offset is recorded in other comprehensive income. Results of settled commodity hedging transactions are reflected in natural gas and oil sales. Any derivative not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment or any ineffective portion of a properly designated hedge is recognized immediately in earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded an unrealized gain of $5.2 million related to basis differential swaps that did not qualify for hedge accounting in addition to a $4.2 million loss related to the change in estimated ineffectiveness of our commodity cash flow hedges. Future market price volatility could create significant changes to the hedge positions recorded in our financial statements. We refer you to Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Item 7A of Part II of this Form 10 K for additional information regarding our hedging activities. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We record our prepaid or accrued benefit cost, as well as our periodic benefit cost, for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans using measurement assumptions that we consider reasonable at the time of calculation (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion and disclosures regarding these benefit plans). Two of the assumptions that affect the amounts recorded are the discount rate, which estimates the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled, and the expected return on plan assets, which reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested. For the December 31, 2011 benefit obligation and the periodic benefit cost to be recorded in 2012, the discount rate assumed is 5.00%. For the 2012 periodic benefit cost, the expected return assumed is 7.50%. This compares to a discount rate of 5.50% and an expected return of 7.50% used in 2011. Using the assumed rates discussed above, we recorded total benefit cost of $11.5 million in 2011 related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Due to the significance of the discount rate and expected long term rate of return, the following sensitivity analysis demonstrates the effect that a 50 basis point change in those assumptions would have had on our 2011 pension expense: 60 SWN Table of Contents Increase (Decrease) of Annual Pension Expense 50 Basis Point Increase 50 Basis Point Decrease (in thousands) Discount rate $ (623) $ 682 Expected long term rate of return $ (293) $ 293 At December 31, 2011, we recognized a liability of $20.5 million, compared to $15.9 million at December 31, 2010, related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. During 2011, we also made cash payments totaling $12.6 million to fund our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. In 2012, we expect to make cash payments totaling $12.9 million to fund our pension and other postretirement benefit plans and recognize pension expense of $12.0 million and a postretirement benefit expense of $2.2 million. New Accounting Standards Implemented in this Report In January 2011, we implemented certain provisions of Accounting Standards Update No. 2010 06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820) Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements (Update 2010 06). Update 2010 06 requires entities to provide a reconciliation of purchases, sales, issuance and settlements of anything valued with a Level 3 method, which is used to price the hardest to value instruments. The implementation did not have an impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In July 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011 05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income (Update 2011 05), which amends Topic 200, Comprehensive Income. Update 2011 05 eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income (OCI) in the statement of changes in stockholders equity, and requires presentation of total comprehensive income and components of net income in a single statement of comprehensive income, or in two separate, consecutive statements. Update 2011 05 requires presentation of reclassification adjustments for items transferred from OCI to net income on the face of the financial statements where the components of net income and the components of OCI are presented. The amendments do not change current treatment of items in OCI, transfer of items from OCI, or reporting items in OCI net of the related tax impact. Update 2011 05 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The implementation of these changes did not have an impact on the Companys results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Accounting Standards Not Yet Implemented In May 2011, the FASB issued guidance on fair value measurement and disclosure requirements outlined in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011 04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820)Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS (Update 2011 04). Update 2011 04 expands existing fair value disclosure requirements, particularly for Level 3 inputs, including: quantitative disclosure of the unobservable inputs and assumptions used in the measurement; description of the valuation processes in place and sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs and interrelationships between those inputs; the level of items (in the fair value hierarchy) that are not measured at fair value in the balance sheet but whose fair value must be disclosed; and the use of a nonfinancial asset if it differs from the highest and best use assumed in the fair value measurement. The amendments in Update 2011 04 must be applied prospectively and are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The implementation of the disclosure requirement is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance on offsetting assets and liabilities and disclosure requirements in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011 11, Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities (Update 2011 11). Update 2011 11 requires that entities disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position as well as instruments and transaction s subject to an agreement similar to a master netting agreement. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of collateral received and posted in connection with master netting agreements or similar arrangements. Update 2011 11 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods. The implementation of the disclosure requirement is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance on accumulated other comprehensive income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011 12, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards 61 SWN Table of Contents Update No. 2011 05 (Update 2011 12). Update 2011 12 defers the specific requirement to present items that are classified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income separately with their respective components of net income and other comprehensive income, as promulgated under Update 2011 05. Update 2011 12 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the implementation of the disclosure requirement is expected to have on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. See further discussion of our significant accounting policies in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. 62 SWN Table of Contents CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ABOUT FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS All statements, other than historical fact or present financial information, may be deemed to be forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

They are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may affect our operations, markets, products, services and prices and cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. In addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with forward looking statements, risks, uncertainties and factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward looking statement include, but are not limited to:  the timing and extent of changes in market conditions and prices for natural gas and oil (including regional basis differentials);  our ability to fund our planned capital investments;  our ability to transport our production to the most favorable markets or at all;  the timing and extent of our success in discovering, developing, producing and estimating reserves;  the economic viability of, and our success in drilling, our large acreage position in the Fayetteville Shale play overall as well as relative to other productive shale gas plays;  the impact of government regulation, including any increase in severance or similar taxes, legislation relating to hydraulic fracturing, the climate and over the counter derivatives;  the costs and availability of oilfield personnel, services and drilling supplies, raw materials, and equipment, including pressure pumping equipment and crews;  our ability to determine the most effective and economic fracture stimulation for the Fayetteville Shale play and Marcellus Shale play;  our future property acquisition or divestiture activities;  the impact of the adverse outcome of any material litigation against us;  the effects of weather;  increased competition and regulation;  the financial impact of accounting regulations and critical accounting policies;  the comparative cost of alternative fuels;  conditions in capital markets, changes in interest rates and the ability of our lenders to provide us with funds as agreed;  credit risk relating to the risk of loss as a result of non performance by our counterparties; and  any other factors listed in the reports we have filed and may file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). We caution you that forward looking statements contained in this Form 10 K are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, incident to the exploration for and development, production and sale of natural gas and oil. These risks include, but are not limited to, commodity price volatility, third party interruption of 63 SWN Table of Contents sales to market, inflation, lack of availability of goods and services, environmental risks, drilling and other operating risks, regulatory changes, the uncertainty inherent in estimating proved natural gas and oil reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures and the other risks described in Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10 K. Estimates of our proved natural gas and oil reserves and the estimated future net revenues from such reserves in this Form 10 K are based upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC relating to natural gas and oil prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital investments, taxes and availability of funds. The process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is complex. This process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. Therefore, those estimates are inherently imprecise. Actual future production, natural gas and oil prices, revenues, taxes, development costs, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable natural gas and oil reserves will most likely vary from those estimated. Such variances may be material. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves set forth in this Form 10 K. Our properties may also be susceptible to hydrocarbon drainage from production by other operators on adjacent properties. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing natural gas and oil prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. At December 31, 2011, approximately 45% of our estimated proved reserves were proved undeveloped and 1% were proved developed non producing. Proved undeveloped reserves and proved developed non producing reserves, by their nature, are less certain than proved developed producing reserves. Estimates of reserves in the non producing categories are nearly always based on volumetric calculations rather than the performance data used to estimate producing reserves. Recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. Recovery of proved developed non producing reserves requires capital expenditures to recomplete into the zones behind pipe and is subject to the risk of a successful recompletion. Production revenues from proved undeveloped and proved developed non producing reserves will not be realized, if at all, until sometime in the future. The reserve data assumes that we will make significant capital investments to develop our reserves. Although we have prepared estimates of our natural gas and oil reserves and the costs associated with these reserves in accordance with industry standards, we cannot assure you that the estimated costs are accurate, that development will occur as scheduled or that the actual results will be as estimated. You should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows referred to in this Form 10 K is the current fair value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on average prices over the preceding twelve months and costs as of the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the average prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. Any changes in consumption by gas purchasers or in governmental regulations or taxation could also affect actual future net cash flows. The timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of natural gas and oil properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves and their present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor, which is required by the SEC to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes, is not necessarily the most accurate discount factor for our company. Should one or more of the risks or uncertainties described above or elsewhere in this Form 10 K occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements. We specifically disclaim all responsibility to publicly update any information contained in a forward looking statement or any forward looking statement in its entirety and therefore disclaim any resulting liability for potentially related damages. All forward looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. 64 SWN Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from the volatility in commodity prices, basis differentials and interest rates, as well as credit risk concentrations. We use natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options and interest rate swaps to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil and in interest rates. Our Board of Directors has approved risk management policies and procedures to utilize financial products for the reduction of defined commodity price risk. Utilization of financial products for the reduction of interest rate risks is subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. These policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings. Credit Risk Our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables and derivative contracts associated with commodities trading. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of our customers and their dispersion across geographic areas. No single customer accounted for greater than 10% of revenues at December 31, 2011. See Commodities Risk below for discussion of credit risk associated with commodities trading. Interest Rate Risk The following table presents the principal cash payments for our debt obligations and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates as of December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, we had $1,343.3 million of total debt with a weighted average interest rate of 4.87% and we had $671.5 million of indebtedness outstanding under our Credit Facility. Interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when deemed appropriate. We do not have any interest rate swaps in effect currently. Fair Expected Maturity Date Value 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total 12/31/11 ($ in millions) Fixed Rate $ 1.2 $ 1.2 $ 1.2 $ 1.2 $ 1.2 $ 665.8 $ 671.8 $ 773.6 Average Interest Rate 7.15% 7.15% 7.15% 7.15% 7.15% 7.47% 7.47% Variable Rate $ 671.5 $ 671.5 $ 671.5 Average Interest Rate 2.28% 2.28% Commodities Risk We use over the counter natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options to hedge sales of our production and to hedge activity in our Midstream Services segment against the inherent price risks of adverse price fluctuations or locational pricing differences between a published index and the NYMEX futures market. These swaps and options include (1) transactions in which one party will pay a fixed price (or variable price) for a notional quantity in exchange for receiving a variable price (or fixed price) based on a published index (referred to as price swaps), (2) transactions in which parties agree to pay a price based on two different indices (referred to as basis swaps) and (3) the purchase and sale of index related puts and calls (collars) that provide a floor price, below which the counterparty pays funds equal to the amount by which the price of the commodity is below the contracted floor, and a ceiling price above which we pay to the counterparty the amount by which the price of the commodity is above the contracted ceiling. The primary market risks relating to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for natural gas and crude oil. However, the market price risk is offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related sale or purchase of the natural gas or sale of the oil that is hedged. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss as a result of non performance by our counterparties. The counterparties are primarily major commercial banks, investment banks, and integrated energy companies which management believes present minimal credit risks. The credit quality of each counterparty and the level of financial exposure we have to each counterparty are closely monitored to limit our credit risk exposure. Additionally, we perform both quantitative and qualitative assessments of these counterparties based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable. We have not incurred any counterparty losses related to non performance and do not anticipate any losses given the information we have currently. However, we cannot be certain that we will not experience such losses in the future. 65 SWN Table of Contents Exploration and Production The following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in commodity prices and that are used to hedge prices for natural gas production. The table presents the notional amount in Bcf, the weighted average contract prices and the fair value by expected maturity dates. At December 31, 2011, the fair value of our financial instruments related to natural gas production and gas in storage was a $704.8 million asset.

Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in natural gas and oil sales. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded an unrealized gain of $5.2 million related to the basis swaps that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and an unrealized loss of $4.2 million related to the change in estimated ineffectiveness of our cash flow hedges. Typically, our hedge ineffectiveness results from changes at the end of a reporting period in the price differentials between the index price of the derivative contract, which is primarily a NYMEX price, and the index price for the point of sale for the cash flow that is being hedged. Additionally, at December 31, 2010, we had outstanding fixed price basis differential swaps on 12.0 Bcf of 2011 natural gas production that did not qualify for hedge treatment. Midstream Services At December 31, 2011, our Midstream Services segment had outstanding fair value hedges in place on 0.1 Bcf of natural gas for 2012. These hedges are a mixture of floating price swap purchases and sales relating to our natural gas marketing activities. These hedges have contract months from January 2012 to March 2012 and have a net fair value liability of less than $0.1 million as of December 31, 2011. 66 SWN Table of Contents
