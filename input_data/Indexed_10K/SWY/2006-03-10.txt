Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Safeway reported net income of $561.1 million ($1.25 per diluted share) in 2005, net income of $560.2 million ($1.25 per diluted share) in 2004 and a net loss of $169.8 million ($0.38 per diluted share) in 2003. These results were significantly affected by a strike in Southern California, goodwill and asset impairments at Dominicks and Randalls and other unusual charges described below. Strike Impact On October 11, 2003, seven UFCW local unions struck the Companys 289 stores in Southern California. As a result, pursuant to the terms of a multi employer bargaining arrangement, Kroger and Albertsons locked out certain of their retail union employees in Southern California food stores. An agreement ending the strike was ratified by the union on February 28, 2004. Employees returned to work beginning March 5, 2004. Safeway estimates the overall cost of the strike and its residual effects reduced 2004 earnings by $412.2 million before taxes ($0.57 per diluted share) and 2003 earnings by $167.5 million before taxes ($0.23 per diluted share). Safeway estimated the impact of the strike by comparing internal forecasts immediately before the strike with actual results during and after the strike, at strike affected stores. The estimate also includes the Companys benefit under an agreement with Kroger and Albertsons that arises out of the multi employer bargaining process in Southern California. Dominicks Pre tax charges for goodwill impairment, long lived asset impairment and store exit activities since 2003 at Dominicks are summarized below (in millions): 2005 2004 2003 Goodwill impairment $ 281.4 Impairment of long lived assets (included in operating and administrative expense) 311.4 Store exit activities (included in operating and administrative expense) $ 45.7 In November 2002, Safeway attempted to sell Dominicks and exit the Chicago market due to labor issues. In the first 36 weeks of 2003, Safeway reduced the carrying value of Dominicks by writing down $256.5 million ($0.56 per diluted share) of goodwill and $120.7 million ($0.17 per diluted share) of long lived assets, based on indications of value received during the sale process. In November 2003, Safeway announced that it was taking Dominicks off the market after the winning bidder and the unions representing Dominicks could not reach an agreement on a labor contract. Safeway reclassified Dominicks from an asset held for sale to assets held and used and adjusted Dominicks individual long lived assets to the lower of cost or fair value. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2003, Safeway incurred a pre tax, long lived asset impairment charge of $190.7 million ($0.26 per diluted share) and a goodwill impairment charge of $24.9 million ($0.06 per diluted share). As of year end 2003, there was no goodwill remaining on Safeways consolidated balance sheet related to Dominicks. In the first quarter of 2004, Safeway closed 12 under performing Dominicks stores, which resulted in a store lease exit charge of $45.7 million ($0.06 per diluted share). Dominicks incurred operating losses and declining sales in each of the last three fiscal years. The Company has negotiated a new labor contract at Dominicks and has begun to remodel a few stores into the Lifestyle format. While management believes these transactions will improve sales and profitability, there can be no assurance that Dominicks will achieve satisfactory operating results in the future. 18 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Randalls Pre tax charges for goodwill impairment, long lived asset impairment and store exit activities since 2003 at Randalls are summarized below (in millions): 2005 2004 2003 Goodwill impairment $ 447.7 Impairment of long lived assets (included in operating and administrative expense) $ 54.7 Store exit activities (included in operating and administrative expense) 55.5 In the third quarter of 2005, the Company announced a plan to revitalize the Texas market which included the closure of 26 under performing stores, a focused Lifestyle remodel program and the introduction of proprietary products. This resulted in a pre tax, long lived asset impairment charge of $54.7 million ($0.08 per diluted share). In the fourth quarter of 2005, Safeway recorded $55.5 million pre tax ($0.07 per diluted share) in store exit activities for these stores. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Safeway performed its annual review of goodwill and wrote off $447.7 million ($1.00 per diluted share) of goodwill at Randalls. As a result of an improving competitive environment, the closing of 26 under performing stores and improved marketing efforts, Randalls identical store sales grew in 2005 and, although profitability improved, Randalls incurred an operating loss in 2005. As previously mentioned, Safeway has announced a plan to revitalize Randalls; however, there can be no assurance that Randalls will achieve satisfactory operating results in the future. Other Charges Other significant pre tax charges consist of the following (in millions): 2005 2004 2003 Northern California health and welfare contribution $ 31.1 Accrual for rent holidays 10.6 Inventory loss accrual $ 48.9 Inventory markdown change in estimate 22.1 Impairment of miscellaneous equity investments 10.6 Employee buyouts, severance costs and other related costs $ 59.4 25.5 In 2005, the Company incurred $59.4 million before tax ($0.08 per diluted share) in employee buyout charges, severance and related costs, relating primarily to Dominicks and Northern California. In 2004, Safeway was notified that it was required to contribute an additional $31.1 million before tax ($0.04 per diluted share) during the year to two Northern California multi employer health and welfare plans for its share of funding deficits. On February 7, 2005, the Office of the Chief Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a letter to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants expressing its view regarding certain lease related accounting issues and their application under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In light of this letter, Safeway determined that its then current method of accounting for rent holidays was not in accordance with GAAP. Historically, the Company recognized rent expense on a straight line basis beginning at the first rent payment. The Company now recognizes rent expense on a straight line basis when it takes possession and control of the property. Safeway recorded a $10.6 million before tax charge ($0.01 per diluted share) in 2004 to correct this error. However, most of the adjustment was accumulated over many years. In 2003, Safeway changed its accounting policy to accrue estimated physical inventory losses that occur between the last physical inventory count and the quarterly or year end balance sheet date. Previously, Safeway recorded inventory losses only in the period the physical count was performed. Safeway takes a physical count of perishable inventory in stores every four weeks and nonperishable inventory in stores twice a year on a cycle basis. Distribution centers are counted twice a year on a cycle 19 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations basis. Safeway historically recorded inventory losses only in the period the physical count was performed. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, Safeway determined that its then current method of accounting for estimated physical inventory losses was not in accordance with GAAP. In order to reflect inventory more accurately on the balance sheet, Safeway began to accrue an estimated physical inventory loss for the period between the last physical inventory count and the quarterly or year end balance sheet date. Safeway recorded a charge of $48.9 million before tax ($0.07 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 to correct this error. However, most of the adjustment accumulated over many prior years. In addition, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, Safeway revised its physical inventory calculation methodology to reflect more precise data on inventory markdowns from newly installed financial software. Safeway recorded a charge of $22.1 million before tax ($0.03 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 as a result of this change in accounting estimate. Safeway wrote off miscellaneous equity investments in 2003 totaling $10.6 million ($0.01 per diluted share), after determining they were impaired. Safeway also incurred pre tax charges totaling $25.5 million ($0.04 per diluted share) for employee buyouts, severance costs and other costs related to the restructuring of the Companys administrative offices. Sales Total sales increased 7.2% to $38.4 billion in 2005 from $35.8 billion in 2004, primarily because of Safeways marketing strategy, Lifestyle store execution and increased fuel sales. Same store sales increases for 2005 were as follows: Comparable storesales (includesreplacement stores) Identical store sales (excludesreplacement stores) Including fuel: Excluding strike affected stores 4.6% 4.4% Including strike affected stores 5.9% 5.8% Excluding fuel: Excluding strike affected stores 3.0% 2.9% Including strike affected stores 4.4% 4.3% In 2004, total sales increased only slightly to $35.8 billion from $35.7 billion in 2003, primarily because of the Southern California strike and because fiscal 2004 had one fewer week than fiscal 2003. 20 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Same store sales increases (decreases) for 2004 were as follows: Comparable storesales (includesreplacement stores) Identical store sales (excludesreplacement stores) Including fuel: Excluding strike affected stores 1.5% 0.9% Including strike affected stores 0.9% 0.3% Excluding fuel: Excluding strike affected stores (0.2)% (0.8)% Including strike affected stores (0.7)% (1.3)% In 2003, total sales increased 2.3% to $35.7 billion from $34.9 billion in 2002 primarily due to fiscal 2003 consisting of 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in 2002, new store openings and additional fuel sales, partially offset by the estimated impact of the strike in Southern California. Excluding the estimated effects of the strike in Southern California, comparable store sales were flat, while identical store sales declined 0.4%. Further excluding the effects of fuel sales, 2003 comparable store sales decreased 1.6% and identical store sales decreased 2.0%. Gross Profit Gross profit represents the portion of sales revenue remaining after deducting the costs of goods sold during the period, including purchase and distribution costs. These costs include inbound freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs, warehouse inspection costs, warehousing costs, and other costs of Safeways distribution network. Advertising and promotional expenses are also a component of cost of goods sold. Additionally, all vendor allowances are classified as an element of cost of goods sold. Gross profit margin was 28.93% of sales in 2005, 29.58% in 2004, and 30.02% in 2003. The gross profit margin decreased 65 basis points to 28.93% of sales in 2005 from 29.58% in 2004. Higher fuel sales reduced gross profit by 39 basis points. The remaining decline is due to grand openings of Lifestyle stores, investment in price, increased advertising expense and higher energy costs. Gross profit declined 44 basis points in 2004. The strike in Southern California reduced gross profit by an estimated 41 basis points, and higher fuel sales (which have a lower gross margin) reduced gross profit by 40 basis points. Gross profit in 2003 was reduced by 20 basis points due to the $71.0 million charge to accrue estimated inventory losses and a change in estimate for inventory markdowns. The remaining 17 basis point increase was primarily the result of targeted pricing and promotion. Gross profit declined 147 basis points in 2003. Higher fuel sales reduced gross profit by 38 basis points. The $71.0 million in inventory charges reduced gross profit 20 basis points. The strike in Southern California reduced gross profit by an estimated five basis points. The remaining 84 basis point decline was primarily the result of targeted pricing and promotion. Vendor allowances totaled $2.4 billion in 2005 and $2.2 billion each in 2004 and 2003. Vendor allowances can be grouped into the following broad categories: promotional allowances, slotting allowances and contract allowances. All vendor allowances are classified as an element of cost of goods sold. Promotional allowances make up nearly three quarters of all allowances. With promotional allowances, vendors pay Safeway to promote their product. The promotion may be any combination of a temporary price reduction, a feature in print ads, a feature in a Safeway circular, or a preferred location in the store. The promotions are typically one to two weeks long. Slotting allowances are a small portion of total allowances (typically less than 5% of all allowances). With slotting allowances, the vendor reimburses Safeway for the cost of placing new product on the shelf. Safeway has no obligation or commitment to keep the product on the shelf for a minimum period. Contract allowances make up the remainder of all allowances. Under the typical contract allowance, a vendor pays Safeway to keep product on the shelf for a minimum period of time or when volume thresholds are achieved. 21 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Operating and Administrative Expense Operating and administrative expense consists primarily of store occupancy costs and backstage expenses, which, in turn, consist primarily of wages, employee benefits, rent, depreciation and utilities. Operating and administrative expense was 25.77% of sales in 2005 compared to 26.30% in 2004 and 26.37% in 2003. Operating and administrative expense decreased 53 basis points in 2005 to 25.77% of sales from 26.30% in 2004. The significant pre tax charges discussed above (impairment of long lived assets, store exit activities and employee buyouts in 2005 combined with store exit activities, health and welfare contributions and the accrual for rent holidays in 2004) increased operating and administrative expense, as a percentage of sales, by 20 basis points. Stock option expense, labor costs associated with the grand opening of Lifestyle stores and higher energy costs also increased operating and administrative expense, as a percentage of sales. These items were more than offset by the restructured labor agreements, increased fuel sales and reduced workers compensation costs. Operating and administrative expense decreased seven basis points in 2004. Lower impairment charges reduced operating and administrative expense as a percentage of sales by 77 basis points and higher fuel sales reduced operating and administrative expense by 39 basis points. These improvements were offset by a 22 basis point increase from the strike in Southern California and 87 basis points due to higher wages, benefits and occupancy expense. Operating and administrative expense increased 128 basis points in 2003. Higher Dominicks impairment charges increased operating and administrative expense 30 basis points. Reduced sales from the Southern California strike increased operating and administrative expense by an estimated 29 basis points. Higher pension expense added 28 basis points, and higher workers compensation expense added 15 basis points. The remaining 26 basis point increase was primarily due to higher employee benefit costs, soft sales and settlement income from the termination of an in store banking agreement recorded in 2002 operating and administrative expense. Interest Expense Interest expense was $402.6 million in 2005, compared to $411.2 million in 2004 and $442.4 million in 2003. Interest expense decreased in 2005 primarily due to lower average borrowings in 2005 compared to 2004, partially offset by a higher average interest rate. Interest expense also decreased in 2004, primarily due to lower average borrowings in 2004 compared to 2003. Interest expense increased in 2003, primarily due to higher average borrowings in 2003 compared to 2002. Other Income (Loss) Other income consists of interest income, minority interest in a consolidated affiliate and equity in earnings from Safeways unconsolidated affiliates. Interest income was $12.7 million in 2005, $9.7 million in 2004 and $5.4 million in 2003. Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates was income of $15.8 million in 2005, income of $12.6 million in 2004 and a loss of $7.1 million in 2003. Income Taxes The Companys effective tax rates for 2005, 2004 and 2003 were 33.9%, 29.4% and 220.3%, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2005 includes a tax benefit from the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and a benefit from the favorable resolution of certain tax issues. In 2004, the effective tax rate included benefits related to tax law changes and the resolution of certain tax issues. The higher effective tax rate in 2003 reflects the tax effect of a charge for nondeductible goodwill impairment. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are important to the portrayal of Safeways financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. 22 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Workers Compensation The Company is primarily self insured for workers compensation, automobile and general liability costs. It is the Companys policy to record its self insurance liability, as determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported, discounted at a risk free interest rate. Any actuarial projection of losses concerning workers compensation and general liability is subject to a high degree of variability. Among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates, discount rates, litigation trends, legal interpretations, benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns. A 25 basis point increase in the Companys discount rate would reduce its liability by approximately $4.7 million. The majority of the Companys workers compensation liability is from claims occurring in California. California workers compensation has received intense scrutiny from the states politicians, insurers, employers and providers, as well as the public in general. Recent years have seen escalation in the number of legislative reforms, judicial rulings and social phenomena affecting this business. Some of the many sources of uncertainty in the Companys reserve estimates include changes in benefit levels, medical fee schedules, medical utilization guidelines, vocation rehabilitation and apportionment. Store Closures Safeways policy is to recognize losses relating to the impairment of long lived assets when expected net future cash flows are less than the assets carrying values. When stores that are under long term leases close, Safeway records a liability for the future minimum lease payments and related ancillary costs, net of estimated cost recoveries. In both cases, fair value is determined by estimating net future cash flows and discounting them using a risk adjusted rate of interest. The Company estimates future cash flows based on its experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located and, when necessary, uses real estate brokers. However, these estimates project future cash flows several years into the future and are affected by factors such as inflation, real estate markets and economic conditions. Employee Benefit Plans The determination of Safeways obligation and expense for pension benefits is dependent, in part, on the Companys selection of certain assumptions used by its actuaries in calculating these amounts. These assumptions are disclosed in Note I to the consolidated financial statements and include, among other things, the discount rate, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rate of compensation increases. Actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors. In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, affect recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. While Safeway believes its assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in actual results or significant changes in the Companys assumptions may materially affect Safeways pension and other post retirement obligations and its future expense. Safeway bases the discount rate on current investment yields on high quality fixed income investments. The discount rate used to determine 2005 pension expense was 5.8%. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. Expected return on pension plan assets is based on historical experience of the Companys portfolio and the review of projected returns by asset class on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed income indices, as well as target asset allocation. Safeways target asset allocation mix is designed to meet the Companys long term pension requirements. For 2005, the Companys assumed rate of return was 8.5% on U.S. pension assets and 7.0% on Canadian pension assets. Over the 10 year period ended December 31, 2005, the average rate of return was approximately 10% for U.S. and Canadian pension assets. 23 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions for Safeways pension plans are as follows (dollars in millions): United States Canada Percentagepointchange Projected benefitobligation decrease(increase) Expense decrease(increase) Projected benefitobligation decrease(increase) Expense decrease(increase) Expected return on assets +/ 1.0 pt $16.3/(16.3) $2.3/(2.3) Discount rate +/ 1.0 pt $188.5/(216.2) $40.2/(26.6) $47.3/(55.8) $4.5/(5.3) Cash contributions, primarily in Canada, to the Companys pension plans are expected to total approximately $27.0 million in 2006 and totaled $22.4 million in 2005, $19.0 million in 2004 and $16.0 million in 2003. Safeway expects to fund future contributions to the Companys pension plans with cash flow from operations. Stock Based Employee Compensation Safeway elected to early adopt SFAS No. 123R in the first quarter of 2005 using the modified prospective method. SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements as compensation cost based on the fair value on the date of grant. The Company determines fair value of such awards using the Black Scholes option pricing model. The Black Scholes option pricing model incorporates certain assumptions, such as risk free interest rate, expected volatility, expected dividend yield and expected life of options, in order to arrive at a fair value estimate. Goodwill Safeway accounts for goodwill in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. As required by SFAS No. 142, Safeway tests for goodwill annually using a two step approach with extensive use of accounting judgments and estimates of future operating results. Changes in estimates or application of alternative assumptions and definitions could produce significantly different results. The factors that most significantly affect the fair value calculation are market multiples and estimates of future cash flows. Fair value is determined by an independent third party appraiser who primarily used the discounted cash flow method and the guideline company method. Income Tax Contingencies The Company is subject to periodic audits by the Internal Revenue Service and other foreign, state and local taxing authorities. These audits may challenge certain of the Companys tax positions such as the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of taxable income to the various tax jurisdictions. Loss and gain contingencies are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, and may require significant management judgment in estimating final outcomes. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates and could significantly affect the effective tax rate and cash flows in future years. Liquidity and Financial Resources Net cash flow from operating activities was $1,881.0 million in 2005, $2,226.4 million in 2004 and $1,609.6 million in 2003. Working capital contributed to cash flow in 2005, but at a lower level than in 2004. Net cash flow from operating activities increased in 2004 largely due to increased net income and changes in working capital. Net cash flow from operating activities decreased in 2003 primarily due to lower operating results and changes in working capital. Cash flow used by investing activities was $1,313.5 million in 2005, $1,070.3 million in 2004 and $795.0 million in 2003. Cash flow used by investing activities increased in 2005 compared to 2004 because of higher capital expenditures and lower proceeds from the sale of property. Cash flow used by investing activities increased in 2004 compared to 2003 because of higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were gradually scaled back in 2003 as the economy softened and as the Company was developing and testing what is now the Lifestyle store concept. Capital expenditures increased in 2004 and 2005 as the Company focused on remodeling its existing stores under its Lifestyle store format. In 2005, the Company opened 21 new Lifestyle stores and completed 293 Lifestyle store remodels. The Company also completed 22 other remodels. In 2004, Safeway opened 32 new Lifestyle stores, completed 92 Lifestyle remodels and also completed another 23 remodels. In 2003, Safeway opened 40 new stores, one in the Lifestyle store format, and remodeled 75 stores, 19 in the Lifestyle store format. In 2006, Safeway expects to spend approximately $1.6 billion in cash capital expenditures, open approximately 20 to 25 new Lifestyle stores and complete approximately 280 Lifestyle remodels. 24 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Cash used by financing activities, which consisted principally of cash used to pay down debt, was $466.9 million in 2005, $1,077.6 million in 2004 and $724.0 million in 2003. The Company has income tax related contingencies that may result in significant cash inflows or outflows. Management is uncertain as to when or in what amounts these matters may be resolved. The Company currently anticipates that it will use excess cash flows, if any, to repay debt and or repurchase common stock. On June 1, 2005, the Company entered into a $1,600.0 million credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks. The Credit Agreement provides (1) to Safeway a $1,350.0 million, five year, revolving credit facility (the Domestic Facility), (2) to Safeway and Canada Safeway Limited (CSL) a Canadian facility of up to $250.0 million for U.S. Dollar and Canadian Dollar advances and (3) to Safeway a $400.0 million sub facility of the Domestic Facility for issuance of standby and commercial letters of credit. The Credit Agreement also provides for an increase in the credit facility commitments up to an additional $500.0 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The restrictive covenants of the Credit Agreement limit Safeway with respect to, among other things, creating liens upon its assets and disposing of material amounts of assets other than in the ordinary course of business. The Credit Agreement is scheduled to expire on June 1, 2010; it replaced the former credit agreement that was scheduled to expire in 2006. As of December 31, 2005, outstanding borrowings and letters of credit were $47.5 million and $38.4 million, respectively, under this agreement. Total unused borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement was $1,514.1 million as of December 31, 2005. Additionally, the Company is required to maintain a minimum Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Agreement, to interest expense ratio of 2.0 to 1 and not exceed an Adjusted Debt (total consolidated debt less cash and cash equivalents in excess of $75.0 million) to Adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.5 to 1. As of December 31, 2005, the Company was in compliance with the covenant requirements. The computation of Adjusted EBITDA, as defined by the Credit Agreement, is provided below solely to provide an understanding of the impact that Adjusted EBITDA has on Safeways ability to borrow under the bank credit agreement. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities (which are determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of operating performance or a measure of liquidity. Other companies may define Adjusted EBITDA differently and, as a result, such measures may not be comparable to Safeways Adjusted EBITDA (dollars in millions). 25 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 52 weeks2005 Adjusted EBITDA: Net income $ 561.1 Add (subtract): Income taxes 287.9 LIFO income (0.2 ) Interest expense 402.6 Depreciation 932.7 Stock option expense 59.7 Property impairment charges 78.9 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates (15.8 ) Total Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,306.9 Adjusted EBITDA as a multiple of interest expense 5.73x Total debt at year end 2005 $ 6,358.6 Less cash and equivalents in excess of $75.0 at December 31, 2005 (298.3 ) Adjusted Debt $ 6,060.3 Adjusted Debt to Adjusted EBITDA 2.63x In 2004, the Company filed a shelf registration statement covering the issuance from time to time of up to $2.3 billion of debt securities and or common stock. The Company may issue debt or common stock in the future depending on market conditions, the need to refinance existing debt and capital expenditure plans. At December 31, 2005, $1.6 billion of securities were available for issuance under the shelf registration. Safeway paid a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per common share on July 7, 2005, September 28, 2005 and January 20, 2006 to stockholders of record as of June 16, 2005, September 7, 2005 and December 30, 2005, respectively. The payouts totaled $67.4 million, of which $44.9 million occurred in 2005. Assuming the Company continues to pay the same per share quarterly dividends, annual dividends on common stock would approximate $90 million in 2006. Based upon the current level of operations, Safeway believes that net cash flow from operating activities and other sources of liquidity, including borrowing capability under the Companys commercial paper program and bank credit agreement, will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, interest payments, dividend payments and scheduled principal payments for the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance, however, that Safeways business will continue to generate cash flow at or above current levels or that the Company will be able to maintain its ability to borrow under the commercial paper program and bank credit agreement. On June 29, 2005, Standard & Poors (S&P) lowered its long term credit rating on the Company to BBB (with a stable outlook) from BBB. Moodys and Fitch ratings remained unchanged at Baa2 and BBB, respectively (both with a negative outlook). Safeways ability to borrow under the Credit Agreement is unaffected by Safeways credit ratings. Also, the Company maintains no debt which requires accelerated repayment based on the lowering of credit ratings. Pricing under the Credit Agreement is generally determined by the better of Safeways interest coverage ratio or credit ratings. Safeways pricing was unaffected by S&Ps lowered rating. However, changes in the Companys credit ratings may have an adverse impact on financing costs and structure in future periods, such as the ability to participate in the commercial paper market and higher interest costs on future financings. Additionally, if Safeway does not maintain the financial covenants in its Credit Agreement, its ability to borrow under the Credit Agreement would be impaired. Investors should note that a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to withdrawal by the rating agency. Each credit rating should be evaluated independently. 26 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The Companys total outstanding debt, including capital leases, was $6.4 billion, $6.8 billion and $7.8 billion at fiscal year end 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Total debt declined in 2005, 2004 and 2003 as Safeway used cash flow from operations to pay down debt. As of year end 2005, annual debt maturities are set forth in the contractual obligation table below. The table below presents significant contractual obligations of the Company at year end 2005 (in millions): 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total Long term debt (1) $ 714.2 $ 785.4 $ 813.5 $ 502.4 $ 549.2 $ 2,310.7 $ 5,675.4 Estimated interest on long term debt (2) 319.0 294.5 251.1 210.9 173.2 1,251.3 2,500.0 Capital lease obligations (1) 39.1 41.7 45.2 40.1 35.2 481.9 683.2 Interest on capital leases 66.6 62.6 58.7 54.6 50.9 393.1 686.5 Self insurance liability 144.2 103.2 71.9 50.3 36.9 125.9 532.4 Interest on self insurance liability 3.5 6.8 8.1 8.2 7.9 67.4 101.9 Operating leases 426.1 410.6 397.3 359.9 330.2 2,645.9 4,570.0 Contracts for purchase of property, equipment and construction of buildings 201.0 201.0 Contracts for purchase of inventory 116.2 116.2 Fixed price energy contracts 82.3 57.0 24.8 12.4 176.5 (1) Required principal payments only.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Guarantees The Company is party to a variety of contractual agreements under which it may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters. These contracts primarily relate to the Companys commercial contracts, operating leases and other real estate contracts, trademarks, intellectual property, financial agreements and various other agreements. Under these agreements, the Company may provide certain routine indemnifications relating to representations and warranties (for example, ownership of assets, environmental or tax indemnifications) or personal injury matters. The terms of these indemnifications range in duration and may not be explicitly defined. Historically, Safeway has not made significant payments for these indemnifications. The Company believes that if it were to incur a loss in any of these matters, the loss would not have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. Letters of Credit The Company had letters of credit of $69.2 million outstanding at year end 2005. The letters of credit are maintained primarily to support performance, payment, deposit or surety obligations of the Company. The Company pays commissions ranging from 0.15% to 1.00% on the face amount of the letters of credit. Interest Rate Swap Agreements The Company has, from time to time, entered into interest rate swap agreements to change its portfolio mix of fixed and floating rate debt to more desirable levels. Interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange with a counterparty of fixed and floating rate interest payments periodically over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional principal amounts. The differential to be paid or received is recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense. The Companys counterparties have been major financial institutions. As of year end 2005, the Company effectively converted $500 million of its 4.95% fixed rate debt and $300 million of its 4.125% fixed rate debt to floating rate debt through interest rate swap agreements. 27 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations New Accounting Standards In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. SFAS No. 154 requires restatement of prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. Also, SFAS No. 154 requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs. SFAS No. 151 clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage) and requires that these items be recognized as current period charges. In addition, SFAS No. 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to conversion costs be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No. 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. SFAS No. 151 is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. 28 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Safeway manages interest rate risk through the strategic use of fixed and variable interest rate debt and, from time to time, interest rate swaps. As of year end 2005, the Company effectively converted $500 million of its 4.95% fixed rate debt and $300 million of its 4.125% fixed rate debt to floating rate debt through interest rate swap agreements. During 2005, the weighted average pay rate on the $500 million debt was 3.99%, and the weighted average pay rate on the $300 million debt was 3.87%. The Company does not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes, nor does it utilize leveraged financial instruments. The Company does not consider the potential declines in future earnings, fair values and cash flows from reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates and exchange rates to be material. The table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average rates by year of maturity for the Companys debt obligations at year end 2005 (dollars in millions): 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total Fair value Long term debt:(1) Principal $714.2 $785.4 $813.5 $502.4 $549.2 $2,310.7 $5,675.4 $5,786.5 Weighted average interest rate 6.15% 5.79% 4.97% 7.50% 4.82% 6.40% 5.99% (1) Primarily fixed rate debt 29 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC.
