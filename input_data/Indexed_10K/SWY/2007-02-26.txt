Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Safeway reported net income of $870.6 million ($1.94 per diluted share) in 2006, net income of $561.1 million ($1.25 per diluted share) in 2005 and net income of $560.2 million ($1.25 per diluted share) in 2004. Results in fiscal 2006 were affected by a $62.6 million reduction of income tax expense which is described in this report under the caption Income Taxes. Results in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 were significantly affected by a strike in Southern California, asset impairments, store exit activities and other unusual charges described below. (pre tax, in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Strike impact $ 412.2 Dominicks store exit activities (1) 45.7 Randalls (1): Store exit activities $ 55.5 Impairment of long lived assets 54.7 Other charges (1): Employee buyouts, severance costs and other related costs 59.4 Northern California health and welfare contribution 31.1 Accrual for rent holidays 10.6 (1) Included in operating and administrative expense. Strike Impact On October 11, 2003, seven UFCW union locals struck the Companys 289 stores in Southern California. As a result, pursuant to the terms of a multi employer bargaining arrangement, Kroger and Albertsons locked out certain of their retail union employees in Southern California food stores. An agreement ending the strike was ratified by the union on February 28, 2004. Employees returned to work beginning March 5, 2004. Safeway estimates the overall cost of the strike and its residual effects reduced 2004 earnings by $412.2 million before taxes ($0.57 per diluted share). Safeway estimated the impact of the strike by comparing internal forecasts immediately before the strike with actual results during and after the strike, at strike affected stores. The estimate also includes the Companys benefit under an agreement with Kroger and Albertsons that arises out of the multi employer bargaining process in Southern California. Dominicks In the first quarter of 2004, Safeway closed 12 under performing Dominicks stores, which resulted in a store lease exit charge of $45.7 million ($0.06 per diluted share). Dominicks incurred operating losses and declining sales in each of the last three fiscal years. In February 2007, the Company announced a strategic plan to revitalize its operations at Dominicks. This plan includes remodeling 20 stores to the Lifestyle format, new store development and closing 14 under performing stores in 2007. While management believes this strategy will improve sales and profitability, there can be no assurance that Dominicks will achieve satisfactory operating results in the future. Randalls In the third quarter of 2005, the Company announced a plan to revitalize the Texas market which included the closure of 26 under performing stores, a focused Lifestyle remodel program and the introduction of proprietary products. This resulted in a pre tax, long lived asset impairment charge of $54.7 million ($0.08 per diluted share). In the fourth quarter of 2005, Safeway recorded $55.5 million pre tax ($0.07 per diluted share) in store exit activities for these stores. Other Charges In 2005 the Company incurred $59.4 million before tax ($0.08 per diluted share) in employee buyout charges, severance and related costs, relating primarily to Dominicks and Northern California. 21 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES In 2004 Safeway was notified that it was required to contribute an additional $31.1 million before tax ($0.04 per diluted share) during the year to two Northern California multi employer health and welfare plans for its share of funding deficits. On February 7, 2005, the Office of the Chief Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a letter to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants expressing its view regarding certain lease related accounting issues and their application under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In light of this letter, Safeway determined that its then current method of accounting for rent holidays was not in accordance with GAAP. Historically, the Company recognized rent expense on a straight line basis beginning at the first rent payment. The Company now recognizes rent expense on a straight line basis when it takes possession and control of the property. Safeway recorded a $10.6 million before tax charge ($0.01 per diluted share) in 2004 to correct this error. However, most of the adjustment was accumulated over many years. Sales Total sales increased 4.6% to $40.2 billion in 2006 from $38.4 billion in 2005 primarily because of Safeways marketing strategy, Lifestyle store execution and increased fuel sales. Same store sales increases for 2006 were as follows: Comparable storesales (includesreplacement stores) Identical store sales(excludesreplacement stores) Including fuel 4.4% 4.1% Excluding fuel 3.5% 3.3% Total sales increased 7.2% to $38.4 billion in 2005 from $35.8 billion in 2004, primarily because of Safeways marketing strategy, Lifestyle store execution and increased fuel sales. Same store sales increases for 2005 were as follows: Comparable storesales (includesreplacement stores) Identical store sales(excludesreplacement stores) Including fuel: Excluding strike affected stores 4.6% 4.4% Including strike affected stores 5.9% 5.8% Excluding fuel: Excluding strike affected stores 3.0% 2.9% Including strike affected stores 4.4% 4.3% In 2004 total sales increased only slightly to $35.8 billion from $35.7 billion in 2003, primarily because of the Southern California strike and because fiscal 2004 had one fewer week than fiscal 2003. Same store sales increases (decreases) for 2004 were as follows: Comparable storesales (includesreplacement stores) Identical store sales(excludesreplacement stores) Including fuel: Excluding strike affected stores 1.5% 0.9% Including strike affected stores 0.9% 0.3% Excluding fuel: Excluding strike affected stores (0.2%) (0.8%) Including strike affected stores (0.7%) (1.3%) 22 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Gross Profit Gross profit represents the portion of sales revenue remaining after deducting the cost of goods sold during the period, including purchase and distribution costs. These costs include inbound freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs, warehouse inspection costs, warehousing costs, and other costs associated with Safeways distribution network. Advertising and promotional expenses are also a component of cost of goods sold. Additionally, all vendor allowances are classified as an element of cost of goods sold. Gross profit margin was 28.82% of sales in 2006, 28.93% in 2005, and 29.58% in 2004. Gross profit decreased 11 basis points to 28.82% of sales in 2006 from 28.93% of sales in 2005. Higher fuel sales reduced gross profit by 28 basis points. Excluding fuel, gross profit increased 17 basis points primarily because of improved shrink, benefits from product sourcing initiatives and improved product mix, partly offset by investments in price and increased advertising expense. The gross profit margin decreased 65 basis points to 28.93% of sales in 2005 from 29.58% in 2004. Higher fuel sales reduced gross profit by 39 basis points. The remaining decline is due to grand openings of Lifestyle stores, investment in price, increased advertising expense and higher energy costs. Gross profit declined 44 basis points in 2004. The strike in Southern California reduced gross profit by an estimated 41 basis points, and higher fuel sales reduced gross profit by 40 basis points. These decreases were offset somewhat by a 17 basis point increase, primarily the result of targeted pricing and promotion. Vendor allowances totaled $2.5 billion in 2006, $2.4 billion in 2005 and $2.2 billion in 2004. Vendor allowances can be grouped into the following broad categories: promotional allowances, slotting allowances and contract allowances. All vendor allowances are classified as an element of cost of goods sold. Promotional allowances make up approximately three quarters of all allowances. With promotional allowances, vendors pay Safeway to promote their product. The promotion may be any combination of a temporary price reduction, a feature in print ads, a feature in a Safeway circular, or a preferred location in the store. The promotions are typically one to two weeks long. Slotting allowances are a small portion of total allowances (typically less than 5% of all allowances). With slotting allowances, the vendor reimburses Safeway for the cost of placing new product on the shelf. Safeway has no obligation or commitment to keep the product on the shelf for a minimum period. Contract allowances make up the remainder of all allowances. Under the typical contract allowance, a vendor pays Safeway to keep product on the shelf for a minimum period of time or when volume thresholds are achieved. Operating and Administrative Expense Operating and administrative expense consists primarily of store occupancy costs and backstage expenses, which, in turn, consist primarily of wages, employee benefits, rent, depreciation and utilities. Operating and administrative expense was 24.84% of sales in 2006 compared to 25.77% in 2005 and 26.30% in 2004. Operating and administrative expense decreased 93 basis points to 24.84% of sales in 2006 from 25.77% of sales in 2005. The store exit activities and employee buyouts in 2005 reduced operating and administrative expense by 44 basis points. Higher fuel sales in 2006 reduced operating and administrative expense by 13 basis points. The remaining decline is primarily the result of increased sales and reduced costs as a percentage of sales from store labor, workers compensation and pension expense. Operating and administrative expense decreased 53 basis points in 2005 to 25.77% of sales from 26.30% in 2004. The significant pre tax charges discussed above (impairment of long lived assets, store exit activities and employee buyouts in 2005 combined with store exit activities, health and welfare contributions and the accrual for rent holidays in 2004) increased operating and administrative expense, as a percentage of sales, by 20 basis points. Stock option 23 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES expense, labor costs associated with the grand opening of Lifestyle stores and higher energy costs also increased operating and administrative expense, as a percentage of sales. These items were more than offset by restructured labor agreements, increased fuel sales and reduced workers compensation costs. Operating and administrative expense decreased seven basis points in 2004. Lower impairment charges reduced operating and administrative expense as a percentage of sales by 77 basis points, and higher fuel sales reduced operating and administrative expense by 39 basis points. These improvements were offset by a 22 basis point increase from the strike in Southern California and 87 basis points due to higher wages, benefits and occupancy expense. Interest Expense Interest expense was $396.1 million in 2006, compared to $402.6 million in 2005 and $411.2 million in 2004. Interest expense decreased in 2006 and 2005 primarily due to lower average borrowings, partially offset by a higher average interest rate. Interest expense also decreased in 2004, primarily due to lower average borrowings in 2004 compared to 2003. Other Income Other income consists of interest income, minority interest in a consolidated affiliate and equity in earnings from Safeways unconsolidated affiliates. Interest income was $11.1 million in 2006, $12.7 million in 2005 and $9.7 million in 2004. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates was income of $21.1 million in 2006, $15.8 million in 2005 and $12.6 million in 2004. Income Taxes The Companys effective tax rates for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were 29.8%, 33.9% and 29.4%, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2006 includes a benefit of $62.6 million related to interest, net of income tax, on federal and state income tax refunds, and various other favorable items. Further description of the federal and state refunds is provided below. The effective tax rate for 2005 included a tax benefit from the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and a tax benefit from the favorable resolution of certain tax issues. In 2004 the effective tax rate included benefits related to tax law changes and the resolution of certain tax issues. On April 10, 2006, Safeway announced that it had settled federal income tax refund claims for the years 1992 through 1999 for costs associated with debt financing. The federal refund consisted of a tax refund of $259.2 million and interest, net of income tax, of $60.8 million. The state income tax refunds received in 2006 consisted of $3.1 million of state tax and $1.8 million of state interest, net of income tax. The federal and state tax refunds of $259.2 million and $3.1 million were recorded in 2006 as an increase to additional paid in capital since the tax deductions associated with the debt financing exceeded the previously recognized book expense. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are important to the portrayal of Safeways financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Workers Compensation The Company is primarily self insured for workers compensation, automobile and general liability costs. It is the Companys policy to record its self insurance liability, as determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported, discounted at a risk free interest rate. Any actuarial projection of losses concerning workers compensation and general liability is subject to a high degree of variability. Among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates, discount rates, litigation trends, legal interpretations, benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns. A 25 basis point increase in the Companys discount rate would reduce its liability by approximately $4.5 million. The majority of the Companys workers compensation liability is from claims occurring in California. California workers compensation has received intense scrutiny from the states politicians, insurers, employers and providers, as well as the public in general. Recent years have seen escalation in the number of legislative reforms, judicial rulings and social phenomena affecting this business. Some of the many sources of uncertainty in the Companys reserve estimates include changes in benefit levels, medical fee schedules, medical utilization guidelines, vocation rehabilitation and apportionment. 24 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Store Closures Safeways policy is to recognize losses relating to the impairment of long lived assets when expected net future cash flows are less than the assets carrying values. When stores that are under long term leases close, Safeway records a liability for the future minimum lease payments and related ancillary costs, net of estimated cost recoveries. In both cases, fair value is determined by estimating net future cash flows and discounting them using a risk adjusted rate of interest. The Company estimates future cash flows based on its experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located and, when necessary, uses real estate brokers. However, these estimates project future cash flows several years into the future and are affected by factors such as inflation, real estate markets and economic conditions. Employee Benefit Plans In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). SFAS No. 158 requires an employer to recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plans overfunded status or a liability for a plans underfunded status, measure a plans assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employers fiscal year, and recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur. Additional disclosures are also required. Safeway adopted SFAS No. 158 as of December 30, 2006, as required. The determination of Safeways obligation and expense for pension benefits is dependent, in part, on the Companys selection of certain assumptions used by its actuaries in calculating these amounts. These assumptions are disclosed in Note I to the consolidated financial statements and include, among other things, the discount rate, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rate of compensation increases. Actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors. In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, affect recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. While Safeway believes its assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in actual results or significant changes in the Companys assumptions may materially affect Safeways pension and other postretirement obligations and its future expense. Safeway bases the discount rate on current investment yields on high quality fixed income investments. The discount rate used to determine 2006 pension expense was 5.7%. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. Expected return on pension plan assets is based on historical experience of the Companys portfolio and the review of projected returns by asset class on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed income indices, as well as target asset allocation. Safeways target asset allocation mix is designed to meet the Companys long term pension requirements. For 2006 the Companys assumed rate of return was 8.5% on U.S. pension assets and 7.0% on Canadian pension assets. Over the 10 year period ended December 30, 2006, the average rate of return was approximately 10% for U.S. and 9% for Canadian pension assets. Sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions for Safeways pension plans are as follows (dollars in millions): United States Canada Percentagepointchange Projected benefitobligationdecrease(increase) Expensedecrease(increase) Projected benefitobligationdecrease(increase) Expensedecrease(increase) Expected return on assets +/ 1.0 pt $ 16.6/(16.6) $ 2.7/(2.7) Discount rate +/ 1.0 pt $ 122.4/(133.0) $ (3.3)/(24.8) $ 51.8/(60.0) $ 6.5/(7.3) Cash contributions, primarily in Canada, to the Companys pension plans are expected to total approximately $31.8 million in 2007 and totaled $33.1 million in 2006, $22.4 million in 2005 and $19.0 million in 2004. Safeway expects to fund future contributions to the Companys pension plans with cash flow from operations. Stock Based Employee Compensation Safeway elected to early adopt SFAS No. 123R in the first quarter of 2005 using the modified prospective method. SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements as compensation cost based on the fair 25 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES value on the date of grant. The Company determines fair value of such awards using the Black Scholes option pricing model. The Black Scholes option pricing model incorporates certain assumptions, such as a risk free interest rate, expected volatility, expected dividend yield and expected life of options, in order to arrive at a fair value estimate. Goodwill Safeway accounts for goodwill in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. As required by SFAS No. 142, Safeway tests for goodwill annually using a two step approach with extensive use of accounting judgments and estimates of future operating results. Changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions and definitions could produce significantly different results. The factors that most significantly affect the fair value calculation are market multiples and estimates of future cash flows. Fair value is determined by an independent third party appraiser who primarily used the discounted cash flow method and the guideline company method. Income Tax Contingencies The Company is subject to periodic audits by the Internal Revenue Service and other foreign, state and local taxing authorities. These audits may challenge certain of the Companys tax positions such as the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of taxable income to the various tax jurisdictions. Loss and gain contingencies are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, and may require significant management judgment in estimating final outcomes. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates and could significantly affect the effective tax rate and cash flows in future years. Liquidity and Financial Resources Net cash flow from operating activities was $2,175.0 million in 2006, $1,881.0 million in 2005 and $2,226.4 million in 2004. Net cash flow from operating activities increased to $2,175.0 million in 2006 compared to $1,881.0 million in 2005 primarily because of higher net income. Net cash flow from operating activities decreased in 2005 primarily because working capital contributed to cash flow at a lower level than in 2004. Net cash flow from operating activities increased in 2004 largely due to increased net income and contributions from working capital. Blackhawk receives a significant portion of the cash inflow from the sale of third party gift cards late in the fourth quarter of the year and remits the majority of the cash, less commissions, to the card partners early in the first quarter of the following year. The sale of gift cards increased cash flow from operating activities by $71.1 million in 2006 and $48.2 million in 2005. Net cash flow used by investing activities, which consists principally of cash paid for property additions, increased to $1,734.7 million in 2006 from $1,313.5 million in 2005 and $1,070.3 million in 2004. Capital expenditures increased in 2006, 2005 and 2004 as the Company focused on remodeling its existing stores under its Lifestyle store format. In 2006 Safeway opened 17 new Lifestyle stores and completed 276 Lifestyle store remodels. Safeway also completed eight other remodels. In 2005 the Company opened 21 new Lifestyle stores and completed 293 Lifestyle store remodels. The Company also completed 22 other remodels. In 2004 Safeway opened 32 new Lifestyle stores, completed 92 Lifestyle remodels and also completed another 23 remodels. In 2007 Safeway expects to spend approximately $1.7 billion in cash capital expenditures, open approximately 25 new Lifestyle stores and complete approximately 275 Lifestyle remodels. Net cash flow used by financing activities was $596.3 million in 2006, $466.9 million in 2005 and $1,077.6 million in 2004. Safeway paid down $493.1 million of debt in 2006 compared to $444.9 million in 2005 and paid $96.0 million of dividends in 2006 compared to $44.9 million in 2005. The repurchase of $318.0 million of common stock in 2006 was offset by the $262.3 million income tax refund related to prior years debt financing and $45.4 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Cash used by financing activities in 2004 consisted principally of cash used to pay down debt. Based upon the current level of operations, Safeway believes that net cash flow from operating activities and other sources of liquidity, including potential borrowing under Safeways commercial paper program and its credit agreement, referred to below, will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, interest payments, dividend payments, stock repurchases, if any, and scheduled principal payments for 26 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance, however, that Safeways business will continue to generate cash flow at or above current levels or that the Company will maintain its ability to borrow under its commercial paper program and credit agreement. Bank Credit Agreement On June 1, 2005, the Company entered into a $1,600.0 million credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks. On June 15, 2006, the Company amended the Credit Agreement to extend the termination date for an additional year to June 1, 2011. The Credit Agreement, as amended, provides (1) to Safeway a $1,350.0 million, five year, revolving credit facility (the Domestic Facility), (2) to Safeway and Canada Safeway Limited, a Canadian facility of up to $250.0 million for U.S. Dollar and Canadian Dollar advances and (3) to Safeway a $400.0 million sub facility of the Domestic Facility for issuance of standby and commercial letters of credit. The Credit Agreement also provides for an increase in the credit facility commitments up to an additional $500.0 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The restrictive covenants of the Credit Agreement limit Safeway with respect to, among other things, creating liens upon its assets and disposing of material amounts of assets other than in the ordinary course of business. As of December 30, 2006, outstanding borrowings and letters of credit were $52.3 million and $44.7 million, respectively, under this agreement. Total unused borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement was $1,502.9 million as of December 30, 2006. Additionally, the Company is required to maintain a minimum Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Agreement, to interest expense ratio of 2.0 to 1 and not exceed an Adjusted Debt (total consolidated debt less cash and cash equivalents in excess of $75.0 million) to Adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.5 to 1. As of December 30, 2006, the Company was in compliance with the covenant requirements. The computation of Adjusted EBITDA, as defined by the Credit Agreement, is provided below solely to provide an understanding of the impact that Adjusted EBITDA has on Safeways ability to borrow under the Credit Agreement. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities (which are determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of operating performance or a measure of liquidity. Other companies may define Adjusted EBITDA differently and, as a result, such measures may not be comparable to Safeways Adjusted EBITDA (dollars in millions). 52 weeks2006 Adjusted EBITDA: Net income $ 870.6 Add (subtract): Income taxes 369.4 LIFO expense 1.2 Interest expense 396.1 Depreciation 991.4 Stock option expense 51.2 Property impairment charges 39.2 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates (21.1 ) Total Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,698.0 Adjusted EBITDA as a multiple of interest expense 6.81x Total debt at year end 2006 $ 5,868.1 Less cash and equivalents in excess of $75.0 at December 30, 2006 (141.6 ) Adjusted Debt $ 5,726.5 Adjusted Debt to Adjusted EBITDA 2.12x Shelf Registration In 2004 the Company filed a shelf registration statement covering the issuance from time to time of up to $2.3 billion of debt securities and or common stock. As of December 30, 2006, $1.3 billion of securities were available for issuance under the shelf registration. The Company may issue debt or common stock in the future depending on market conditions, the need to refinance existing debt and capital expenditure plans or other investing activities. 27 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Dividends on Common Stock Safeway paid a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per common share on January 20, 2006 and April 21, 2006 to stockholders of record as of December 30, 2005 and March 31, 2006, respectively. In May 2006, the Companys Board of Directors approved a 15% increase in the quarterly dividend from $0.05 to $0.0575 per common share. A cash dividend of $0.0575 per common share was paid on July 7, 2006, October 5, 2006 and January 19, 2007 to stockholders of record as of June 16, 2006, September 13, 2006 and December 29, 2006, respectively. The dividend payments totaled $121.3 million, of which $96.0 million occurred in 2006. Safeway paid a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per common share on July 7, 2005 and September 28, 2005 to stockholders of record as of June 16, 2005 and September 7, 2005, respectively. The dividend payments totaled $44.9 million. Stock Repurchase Program In July 2002, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had increased the authorized level of its stock repurchase program to $3.5 billion from the previously announced level of $2.5 billion. In December 2006, the Board of Directors increased the total authorized level of the stock repurchase program to $4.0 billion. From the initiation of the repurchase program in 1999 through the end of fiscal 2006, the aggregate cost of shares of common stock repurchased by the Company, including commissions, was approximately $3.3 billion, leaving an authorized amount for repurchases of $747.2 million. During fiscal 2006, the Company repurchased 12.0 million shares of its common stock under the repurchase program at an aggregate price, including commissions, of $318.0 million. The average price per share, excluding commissions, was $26.53. The timing and volume of future repurchases will depend on market conditions. The repurchase program has no expiration date but may be terminated by the Board of Directors. Tax Settlements As announced on April 10, 2006, Safeway settled a federal income tax refund claim for the years 1992 through 1999 for costs associated with debt financing. The federal refund received in 2006 consisted of a tax refund of $259.2 million and interest, net of tax, earned on that refund of $60.8 million. Safeway received state income tax refunds in 2006 of $3.1 million and state interest refunds of $1.8 million, net of tax. Safeway has outstanding claims for refunds of income tax and interest related to this same matter in several states. As of December 30, 2006, the Company expects these state income tax and interest refunds will be approximately $27 million and $10 million, respectively, net of tax. Collection of these funds may take several years. Credit Ratings On June 29, 2005, S&P lowered its long term credit rating on the Company to BBB (with a stable outlook) from BBB. Moodys Investors Service and Fitch ratings remained unchanged at Baa2 and BBB, respectively (both with a negative outlook). On October 24, 2006, Fitch affirmed Safeways BBB rating and revised its outlook to stable from negative. Safeways ability to borrow under the Credit Agreement is unaffected by Safeways credit ratings. Also, the Company maintains no debt which requires accelerated repayment based on the lowering of credit ratings. Pricing under the Credit Agreement is generally determined by the better of Safeways interest coverage ratio or credit ratings. Safeways pricing was unaffected by S&Ps lowered rating. However, changes in the Companys credit ratings may have an adverse impact on financing costs and structure in future periods, such as the ability to participate in the commercial paper market and higher interest costs on future financings. Additionally, if Safeway does not maintain the financial covenants in its Credit Agreement, its ability to borrow under the Credit Agreement would be impaired. Investors should note that a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to withdrawal by the rating agency. Each credit rating should be evaluated independently. 28 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Contractual Obligations The Companys total outstanding debt, including capital leases, was $5.9 billion, $6.4 billion and $6.8 billion at fiscal year end 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Total debt declined in 2006, 2005 and 2004 as Safeway used cash flow from operations to pay down debt. As of year end 2006, annual debt maturities are set forth in the contractual obligation table below. The table below presents significant contractual obligations of the Company at year end 2006 (in millions)(1): 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Long term debt (2) $ 790.7 $ 811.6 $ 752.4 $ 501.7 $ 554.5 $ 1,808.5 $ 5,219.4 Estimated interest on long term debt (3) 309.9 265.6 214.5 173.3 127.4 1,119.2 2,209.9 Capital lease obligations (2),(4) 40.8 43.0 43.1 37.0 32.0 452.8 648.7 Interest on capital leases 63.0 59.9 54.7 50.7 47.2 332.5 608.0 Self insurance liability 138.7 102.4 68.0 47.4 33.1 123.1 512.7 Interest on self insurance liability 3.3 7.0 7.9 7.8 7.3 72.5 105.8 Operating leases (4) 425.3 417.4 373.9 345.7 312.3 2,773.8 4,648.4 Contracts for purchase of property, equipment and construction of buildings 254.0 254.0 Contracts for purchase of inventory 98.1 98.1 Fixed price energy contracts 63.7 24.8 12.4 100.9 (1) Excludes funding of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, which totaled approximately $40.7 million in 2006. (2) Required principal payments only. (3) Excludes payments received or made relating to interest rate swap as discussed below. (4) Operating and capital lease obligations do not include common area maintenance, insurance or tax payments for which the Company is also obligated. In fiscal 2006, these charges totaled approximately $205.4 million. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Guarantees The Company is party to a variety of contractual agreements under which it may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters. These contracts primarily relate to the Companys commercial contracts, operating leases and other real estate contracts, trademarks, intellectual property, financial agreements and various other agreements. Under these agreements, the Company may provide certain routine indemnifications relating to representations and warranties (for example, ownership of assets, environmental or tax indemnifications) or personal injury matters. The terms of these indemnifications range in duration and may not be explicitly defined. Historically, Safeway has not made significant payments for these indemnifications. The Company believes that if it were to incur a loss in any of these matters, the loss would not have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. Letters of Credit The Company had letters of credit of $63.1 million outstanding at year end 2006. The letters of credit are maintained primarily to support performance, payment, deposit or surety obligations of the Company. The Company pays commissions ranging from 0.15% to 1.00% on the face amount of the letters of credit. Interest Rate Swap Agreements The Company has, from time to time, entered into interest rate swap agreements to change its portfolio mix of fixed and floating rate debt to more desirable levels. Interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange with a counterparty of fixed and floating rate interest payments periodically over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional principal amounts. The differential to be paid or received is recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense. The Companys counterparties have been major financial institutions. As of year end 2006, the Company effectively converted $500 million of its 4.95% fixed rate debt and $300 million of its 4.125% fixed rate debt to floating rate debt through interest rate swap agreements. Energy Contracts The Company has entered into contracts to purchase electricity and natural gas at fixed prices for a portion of its energy needs. Safeway expects to take delivery of the electricity and natural gas in the normal course of business, and these contracts are not net settled. Since these contracts qualify for the normal purchase exception of 29 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, they are not marked to market. Energy purchased under these contracts is expensed as delivered. New Accounting Standards In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48) which will be effective for Safeway in the first quarter of 2007. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns. For benefits to be realized a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. Safeway is currently assessing the impact of FIN 48 on its financial statements. Safeway estimates the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 will increase stockholders equity by approximately $120 million to $150 million as of the beginning of fiscal 2007. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurement. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Safeway is currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 157 on its financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial LiabilitiesIncluding an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. SFAS No. 159 permits companies to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates. Unrealized gains and losses on these items will be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The fair value option may be applied instrument by instrument (with a few exceptions), is irrevocable and is applied only to entire instruments and not to portions of instruments. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Safeway is currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 159 on its financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Safeway manages interest rate risk through the strategic use of fixed and variable interest rate debt and, from time to time, interest rate swaps. As of year end 2006, the Company effectively converted $500 million of its 4.95% fixed rate debt and $300 million of its 4.125% fixed rate debt to floating rate debt through interest rate swap agreements. During 2006 the weighted average pay rate on the $500 million debt was 5.68%, and the weighted average pay rate on the $300 million debt was 5.77%. The fair value of these interest rate swaps at year end 2006 was a liability of $25.9 million. The Company does not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes, nor does it utilize leveraged financial instruments. The Company does not consider the potential declines in future earnings, fair values and cash flows from reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates and exchange rates to be material. The table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average rates by year of maturity for the Companys debt obligations at year end 2006 (dollars in millions): 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Fair value Long term debt:(1) Principal $ 790.7 $ 811.6 $ 752.4 $ 501.7 $ 554.5 $ 1,808.5 $ 5,219.4 $ 5,318.6 Weighted average interest rate 5.80% 4.98% 6.90% 4.96% 6.31% 6.40% 6.01% (1) Primarily fixed rate debt 30 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC.
