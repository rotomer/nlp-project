Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Safeway reported net income of $888.4 million ($1.99 per diluted share) in 2007, $870.6 million ($1.94 per diluted share) in 2006 and net income of $561.1 million ($1.25 per diluted share) in 2005. Results in fiscal 2006 were affected by a $62.6 million reduction of income tax expense which is described in this report under the caption Income Taxes. Sales Sales increased 5.2% to $42.3 billion in 2007 from $40.2 billion in 2006 primarily because of Safeways marketing strategy, Lifestyle store execution, increased fuel sales and an increase in the Canadian dollar exchange rate. Same store sales increases for 2007 were as follows: Comparable store sales (includesreplacement stores) Identical store sales(excludes replacement stores) Including fuel 4.4 % 4.1 % Excluding fuel 3.6 % 3.4 % Total sales increased 4.6% to $40.2 billion in 2006 from $38.4 billion in 2005 primarily because of Safeways marketing strategy, Lifestyle store execution and increased fuel sales. Same store sales increases for 2006 were as follows: Comparable store sales (includesreplacement stores) Identical store sales(excludes replacement stores) Including fuel 4.4 % 4.1 % Excluding fuel 3.5 % 3.3 % Total sales increased 7.2% to $38.4 billion in 2005 from $35.8 billion in 2004, primarily because of Safeways marketing strategy, Lifestyle store execution and increased fuel sales. Same store sales increases for 2005 were as follows: Comparable store sales (includesreplacement stores) Identical store sales(excludes replacement stores) Including fuel: Excluding strike affected stores 4.6 % 4.4 % Including strike affected stores 5.9 % 5.8 % Excluding fuel: Excluding strike affected stores 3.0 % 2.9 % Including strike affected stores 4.4 % 4.3 % Gross Profit Gross profit represents the portion of sales revenue remaining after deducting the cost of goods sold during the period, including purchase and distribution costs. These costs include inbound freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs, warehouse inspection costs, warehousing costs, and other costs associated with Safeways distribution network. Advertising and promotional expenses are also a component of cost of goods sold. Additionally, all vendor allowances are classified as an element of cost of goods sold. Gross profit margin was 28.74% of sales in 2007, 28.82% in 2006, and 28.93% in 2005. 21 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Gross profit decreased 8 basis points to 28.74% of sales in 2007 from 28.82% of sales in 2006. Higher fuel sales reduced gross profit by 20 basis points. Excluding fuel, gross profit increased 12 basis points primarily because of lower advertising expense, improved shrink, and benefits from supply chain initiatives, partly offset by investments in price and higher LIFO expense. LIFO expense was $13.9 million in 2007 compared to $1.2 million in 2006. Gross profit decreased 11 basis points to 28.82% of sales in 2006 from 28.93% of sales in 2005. Higher fuel sales reduced gross profit by 28 basis points. Excluding fuel, gross profit increased 17 basis points, primarily because of improved shrink, benefits from product sourcing initiatives and improved product mix, partly offset by investments in price and increased advertising expense. The gross profit margin decreased 65 basis points to 28.93% of sales in 2005 from 29.58% in 2004. Higher fuel sales reduced gross profit by 39 basis points. The remaining decline is due to grand openings of Lifestyle stores, investment in price, increased advertising expense and higher energy costs. Vendor allowances totaled $2.5 billion in both 2007 and 2006 and $2.4 billion in 2005. Vendor allowances can be grouped into the following broad categories: promotional allowances, slotting allowances and contract allowances. All vendor allowances are classified as an element of cost of goods sold. Promotional allowances make up approximately three quarters of all allowances. With promotional allowances, vendors pay Safeway to promote their product. The promotion may be any combination of a temporary price reduction, a feature in print ads, a feature in a Safeway circular, or a preferred location in the store. The promotions are typically one to two weeks long. Slotting allowances are a small portion of total allowances (typically less than 5% of all allowances). With slotting allowances, the vendor reimburses Safeway for the cost of placing new product on the shelf. Safeway has no obligation or commitment to keep the product on the shelf for a minimum period. Contract allowances make up the remainder of all allowances. Under the typical contract allowance, a vendor pays Safeway to keep product on the shelf for a minimum period of time or when volume thresholds are achieved. Operating and Administrative Expense Operating and administrative expense consists primarily of store occupancy costs and backstage expenses, which, in turn, consist primarily of wages, employee benefits, rent, depreciation and utilities. Dominicks. In February 2007, the Company announced a strategic plan to revitalize its operations at Dominicks. This plan included remodeling 20 stores to the Lifestyle format, new store development and closing 14 under performing stores in 2007. In the second quarter of 2007, Safeway incurred a store lease exit charge of $30.3 million ($0.04 per diluted share) as a result of these closures. While management believes this strategy will improve sales and profitability, there can be no assurance that Dominicks will achieve satisfactory operating results in the future. Randalls. In the third quarter of 2005, the Company announced a plan to revitalize the Texas market which included the closure of 26 under performing stores, a focused Lifestyle remodel program and the introduction of proprietary products. This resulted in a pre tax, long lived asset impairment charge of $54.7 million ($0.08 per diluted share). In the fourth quarter of 2005, Safeway recorded $55.5 million pre tax ($0.07 per diluted share) in store exit activities for these stores. Gain (Loss) on Property Retirements. Operating and administrative expense included a $42.3 million net gain on property retirements in 2007, a $17.8 million net gain on property retirements in 2006 and a $13.6 million net loss on property retirements in 2005. In 2007 the Company sold a Bellevue, Washington distribution center at a gain of $46.6 million and a warehouse in Chicago, Illinois at a gain of $11.2 million. These gains were partly offset by net losses on other property retirements. Other Charges. In 2005 the Company incurred $59.4 million before tax ($0.08 per diluted share) in employee buyout charges, severance and related costs, relating primarily to Dominicks and Northern California. Operating and administrative expense was 24.55% of sales in 2007 compared to 24.84% in 2006 and 25.77% in 2005. 22 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Operating and administrative expense decreased 29 basis points to 24.55% of sales in 2007 from 24.84% of sales in 2006. Higher fuel sales in 2007 reduced operating and administrative expense by 16 basis points. The remaining 13 basis point decline is primarily the result of reduced employee costs as a percentage of sales and higher gains on disposal of property, partly offset by higher depreciation expense. Operating and administrative expense decreased 93 basis points to 24.84% of sales in 2006 from 25.77% of sales in 2005. The store exit activities and employee buyouts in 2005 reduced operating and administrative expense by 44 basis points. Higher fuel sales in 2006 reduced operating and administrative expense by 13 basis points. The remaining decline is primarily the result of increased sales and reduced costs as a percentage of sales from store labor, workers compensation and pension expense. Operating and administrative expense decreased 53 basis points in 2005 to 25.77% of sales from 26.30% in 2004. The significant pre tax charges previously discussed (impairment of long lived assets, store exit activities and employee buyouts in 2005) combined with store exit activities, health and welfare contributions and an accrual for rent holidays in 2004 increased operating and administrative expense, as a percentage of sales, by 20 basis points. Stock option expense, labor costs associated with the grand opening of Lifestyle stores and higher energy costs also increased operating and administrative expense, as a percentage of sales. These items were more than offset by restructured labor agreements, increased fuel sales and reduced workers compensation costs. Interest Expense Interest expense was $388.9 million in 2007, compared to $396.1 million in 2006 and $402.6 million in 2005. Interest expense decreased in 2007, 2006 and 2005 primarily due to lower average borrowings, partially offset by a higher average interest rate. Other Income Other income consists of interest income, minority interest in a consolidated affiliate and equity in earnings from Safeways unconsolidated affiliates. Interest income was $11.8 million in 2007, $11.1 million in 2006 and $12.7 million in 2005. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates was $8.7 million in 2007, $21.1 million in 2006 and $15.8 million in 2005. Income Taxes The Companys effective tax rates for 2007, 2006 and 2005 were 36.7%, 29.8% and 33.9%, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2006 included a benefit of $62.6 million related to interest, net of income tax, on federal and state income tax refunds, a benefit of $13.6 million from the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and various other favorable items. The effective tax rate for 2005 included a tax benefit from the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and a tax benefit from the favorable resolution of certain tax issues. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are important to the portrayal of Safeways financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Workers Compensation The Company is primarily self insured for workers compensation, automobile and general liability costs. It is the Companys policy to record its self insurance liability, as determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported, discounted at a risk free interest rate. Any actuarial projection of losses concerning workers compensation and general liability is subject to a high degree of variability. Among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates, discount rates, litigation trends, legal interpretations, benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns. For example, a 25 basis point increase in the Companys discount rate would reduce its liability by approximately $5 million. The majority of the Companys workers compensation liability is from claims occurring in California. California workers compensation has received intense scrutiny from the states politicians, insurers, employers and providers, as well as the public in general. Recent years have seen an escalation in the number of legislative reforms, judicial rulings and social phenomena affecting this business. Some of the many sources of uncertainty in the Companys reserve estimates include changes in benefit levels, medical fee schedules, medical utilization guidelines, vocation rehabilitation and apportionment. 23 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Store Closures Safeways policy is to recognize losses relating to the impairment of long lived assets when expected net future cash flows are less than the assets carrying values. When stores that are under long term leases close, Safeway records a liability for the future minimum lease payments and related ancillary costs, net of estimated cost recoveries. In both cases, fair value is determined by estimating net future cash flows and discounting them using a risk adjusted rate of interest. The Company estimates future cash flows based on its experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located and, when necessary, uses real estate brokers. However, these estimates project future cash flows several years into the future and are affected by factors such as inflation, real estate markets and economic conditions. Employee Benefit Plans In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). SFAS No. 158 requires an employer to recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plans overfunded status or a liability for a plans underfunded status, measure a plans assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employers fiscal year, and recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur. Additional disclosures are also required. Safeway adopted SFAS No. 158 as of December 30, 2006, as required. The determination of Safeways obligation and expense for pension benefits is dependent, in part, on the Companys selection of certain assumptions used by its actuaries in calculating these amounts. These assumptions are disclosed in Note I to the consolidated financial statements and include, among other things, the discount rate, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rate of compensation increases. Actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors. In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, affect recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. While Safeway believes its assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in actual results or significant changes in the Companys assumptions may materially affect Safeways pension and other postretirement obligations and its future expense. Safeway bases the discount rate on current investment yields on high quality fixed income investments. The combined weighted average discount rate used to determine 2007 pension expense was 5.9%. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. Expected return on pension plan assets is based on historical experience of the Companys portfolio and the review of projected returns by asset class on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed income indices, as well as target asset allocation. Safeways target asset allocation mix is designed to meet the Companys long term pension requirements. For 2007 the Companys assumed rate of return was 8.5% on U.S. pension assets and 7.0% on Canadian pension assets. Over the 10 year period ended December 29, 2007, the average rate of return was approximately 9% for U.S. and 8% for Canadian pension assets. Sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions for Safeways pension plans are as follows (dollars in millions): United States Canada Percentagepoint change Projected benefitobligationdecrease(increase) Expense decrease(increase) Projected benefitobligationdecrease(increase) Expensedecrease(increase) Expected return on assets +/ 1.0 pt $ 17.3/(17.3) $ 3.2/(3.2) Discount rate +/ 1.0 pt $ 96.3/(138.4) $ (8.9)/(9.6) $ 63.0/(75.3) $ 6.3/(8.2) Cash contributions, primarily in Canada, to the Companys pension plans are expected to total approximately $35.6 million in 2008 and totaled $33.0 million in 2007, $33.1 million in 2006 and $22.4 million in 2005. Safeway expects to fund future contributions to the Companys pension plans with cash flow from operations. 24 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Stock Based Employee Compensation Safeway elected to early adopt SFAS No. 123R in the first quarter of 2005 using the modified prospective method. SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements as compensation cost based on the fair value on the date of grant. The Company determines fair value of such awards using the Black Scholes option pricing model. The Black Scholes option pricing model incorporates certain assumptions, such as a risk free interest rate, expected volatility, expected dividend yield and expected life of options, in order to arrive at a fair value estimate. Goodwill Safeway accounts for goodwill in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. As required by SFAS No. 142, Safeway tests for goodwill annually using a two step approach with extensive use of accounting judgments and estimates of future operating results. Changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions and definitions could produce significantly different results. The factors that most significantly affect the fair value calculation are market multiples and estimates of future cash flows. Fair value is determined primarily by the discounted cash flow method and the guideline company methods. Income Tax Contingencies The Company is subject to periodic audits by the Internal Revenue Service as well as foreign, state and local taxing authorities. These audits may challenge certain of the Companys tax positions such as the timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of taxable income to various tax jurisdictions. Income tax contingencies are accounted for in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), and may require significant management judgment in estimating final outcomes. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates and could significantly affect the Companys effective tax rate and cash flows in future years. Liquidity and Financial Resources Net cash flow from operating activities was $2,190.5 million in 2007, $2,175.0 million in 2006 and $1,881.0 million in 2005. Net cash flow from operating activities increased to $2,175.0 million in 2006 compared to $1,881.0 million in 2005 primarily because of higher net income. Net cash flow from operating activities decreased in 2005 primarily because working capital contributed to cash flow at a lower level than in 2004. Blackhawk receives a significant portion of the cash inflow from the sale of third party gift cards late in the fourth quarter of the year and remits the majority of the cash, less commissions, to the card partners early in the first quarter of the following year. The sale of gift cards increased cash flow from operating activities by $84.1 million in 2007, $71.1 million in 2006 and $48.2 million in 2005. Net cash flow used by investing activities, which consists principally of cash paid for property additions, was $1,686.4 million in 2007, $1,734.7 million in 2006 and $1,313.5 million in 2005. Net cash flow used by investing activities declined slightly to $1,686.4 million in 2007 from $1,734.7 million in 2006. Cash paid for property additions was greater in 2007 than in 2006. However, proceeds from the sale of property were also greater in 2007. In addition Safeway spent $83.8 million to acquire businesses in 2006. Net cash flow used by investing activities increased to $1,734.7 million in 2006 from $1,313.5 million in 2005 primarily as a result of higher cash paid for property additions, lower proceeds from the sale of property and the cash used to acquire businesses in 2006. Capital expenditures increased in 2007, 2006 and 2005 as the Company focused on remodeling its existing stores under its Lifestyle store format. During 2007 Safeway invested $1.77 billion in capital expenditures. The Company opened 20 new Lifestyle stores, completed 253 Lifestyle remodels and closed 38 stores. The Company also completed 15 other remodels. In 2006 Safeway opened 17 new Lifestyle stores and completed 276 Lifestyle store remodels. Safeway also completed eight other remodels. In 2005 the Company opened 21 new Lifestyle stores and completed 293 Lifestyle store remodels. The Company also completed 22 other remodels. In 2008 the Company expects to spend approximately $1.70 to $1.75 billion in cash capital expenditures and to open approximately 20 to 25 new Lifestyle stores and to remodel approximately 250 to 255 stores into the Lifestyle format. Net cash flow used by financing activities was $454.0 million in 2007, $596.3 million in 2006 and $466.9 million in 2005. In 2007 Safeway paid down $261.3 million of debt, repurchased $226.1 million of common stock, and paid $111.5 25 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES million of dividends. In 2006 Safeway paid down $493.1 million of debt, repurchased $318.0 million of common stock and paid dividends of $96.0 million. Also in 2006 Safeway received a $262.3 million tax refund related to prior years financing. In 2005 Safeway paid down $444.9 million of debt and paid $44.9 million of dividends. Based upon the current level of operations, Safeway believes that net cash flow from operating activities and other sources of liquidity, including potential borrowing under Safeways commercial paper program and its credit agreement, referred to below, will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, interest payments, dividend payments, stock repurchases, if any, and scheduled principal payments for the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance, however, that Safeways business will continue to generate cash flow at or above current levels or that the Company will maintain its ability to borrow under its commercial paper program and credit agreement. Bank Credit Agreement On June 1, 2005, the Company entered into a $1,600.0 million credit agreement with a syndicate of banks. On June 15, 2006, the Company amended the credit agreement to extend the termination date for an additional year to June 1, 2011. On June 1, 2007, the Company amended the credit agreement again for purposes of (i) extending the termination date of the credit agreement for an additional year to June 1, 2012, (ii) providing for two additional one year extensions of the termination date on the terms set forth in the amendment, and (iii) amending the pricing levels (which are based on Safeways debt ratings or interest coverage ratio), pricing margins and facility fee percentages for the loans and commitments under the revolving credit facility. The credit agreement, as amended (the Credit Agreement), provides (i) to Safeway a $1,350.0 million, five year, revolving credit facility (the Domestic Facility), (ii) to Safeway and Canada Safeway Limited, a Canadian facility of up to $250.0 million for U.S. Dollar and Canadian Dollar advances and (iii) to Safeway a $400.0 million sub facility of the Domestic Facility for issuance of standby and commercial letters of credit. The Credit Agreement also provides for an increase in the credit facility commitments up to an additional $500.0 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The restrictive covenants of the Credit Agreement limit Safeway and its subsidiaries with respect to, among other things, creating liens upon its assets and disposing of material amounts of assets other than in the ordinary course of business. Additionally, the Company is required to maintain a minimum Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Agreement, to interest expense ratio of 2.0 to 1 and not exceed an Adjusted Debt (total consolidated debt less cash and cash equivalents in excess of $75.0 million) to Adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.5 to 1. As of December 29, 2007, the Company was in compliance with the covenant requirements. As of December 29, 2007, there were no borrowings, and letters of credit totaled $37.1 million under the Credit Agreement. Total unused borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement was $1,562.9 million as of December 29, 2007. The Credit Agreement is scheduled to expire on June 1, 2012. 26 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES The computation of Adjusted EBITDA, as defined by the Credit Agreement, is provided below solely to provide an understanding of the impact that Adjusted EBITDA has on Safeways ability to borrow under the Credit Agreement. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities (which are determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of operating performance or a measure of liquidity. Other companies may define Adjusted EBITDA differently and, as a result, such measures may not be comparable to Safeways Adjusted EBITDA (dollars in millions). 52 weeks 2007 Adjusted EBITDA: Net income $ 888.4 Add (subtract): Income taxes 515.2 Interest expense 388.9 Depreciation 1,071.2 LIFO expense 13.9 Stock option expense 48.4 Property impairment charges 27.1 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates (8.7 ) Dividend received from unconsolidated affiliate 8.9 Total Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,953.3 Adjusted EBITDA as a multiple of interest expense 7.59x Total debt at year end 2007 $ 5,655.1 Less cash and equivalents in excess of $75.0 at December 29, 2007 (202.8 ) Adjusted Debt $ 5,452.3 Adjusted Debt to Adjusted EBITDA 1.85x Shelf Registration In 2004 the Company filed a shelf registration statement covering the issuance from time to time of up to $2.3 billion of debt securities and or common stock. As of December 29, 2007, $825.0 million of securities were available for issuance under the shelf registration. The Company may issue debt or common stock in the future depending on market conditions, the need to refinance existing debt and capital expenditure plans. Pursuant to the shelf registration, Safeway issued $500.0 million of 6.35% Notes (the Notes) on August 17, 2007. The Notes mature on August 15, 2017. The Company will pay interest on the Notes on February 15 and August 15 of each year. Interest payments commenced on February 15, 2008. Safeway used the net proceeds from the Notes to repay borrowings under its U.S. commercial paper program which had been used to repay $480.0 million of Senior Notes which matured in July 2007. At Safeways option, the Notes can be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed. Additionally, Safeway will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon change of control as described in the terms of the Notes. 27 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES Stock Repurchase Program In December 2006, the Board of Directors increased the total authorized level of the Companys stock repurchase program to $4.0 billion from the previously announced level of $3.5 billion. From the initiation of the repurchase program in 1999 through the end of fiscal 2007, the aggregate cost of shares of common stock repurchased by the Company, including commissions, was approximately $3.5 billion, leaving an authorized amount for repurchases of $521.1 million. During 2007, Safeway repurchased approximately 6.7 million shares of its common stock under the repurchase program at an aggregate price, including commissions, of $226.1 million. The average price per share, excluding commissions, was $33.57. The timing and volume of future repurchases will depend on several factors, including market conditions. Credit Ratings On October 24, 2006, Fitch affirmed Safeways BBB rating and revised its outlook to stable from negative. On July 23, 2007, S&P affirmed the Companys BBB credit rating and revised its outlook to positive from stable. On August 1, 2007, Moodys Investors Service affirmed Safeways Baa2 rating and revised its outlook to stable from negative. Safeways ability to borrow under the Credit Agreement is unaffected by Safeways credit ratings. Also, the Company maintains no debt which requires accelerated repayment based on the lowering of credit ratings. Pricing under the Credit Agreement is generally determined by the better of Safeways interest coverage ratio or credit ratings. Safeways pricing was unaffected by S&Ps lowered rating. However, changes in the Companys credit ratings may have an adverse impact on financing costs and structure in future periods, such as the ability to participate in the commercial paper market and higher interest costs on future financings. Additionally, if Safeway does not maintain the financial covenants in its Credit Agreement, its ability to borrow under the Credit Agreement would be impaired. Investors should note that a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to withdrawal by the rating agency. Each credit rating should be evaluated independently.

Also excludes contributions under various multi employer pension plans, which totaled $270.1 million in 2007. (2) Required principal payments only. (3) Excludes payments received or made relating to interest rate swap as discussed below. (4) Operating and capital lease obligations do not include common area maintenance, insurance or tax payments for which the Company is also obligated. In fiscal 2007, these charges totaled approximately $218.4 million. The Company adopted FIN 48 on the first day of its 2007 fiscal year. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 29, 2007 was $123.1 million. This amount has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future tax settlements cannot be determined. 29 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Guarantees The Company is party to a variety of contractual agreements under which it may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters. These contracts primarily relate to the Companys commercial contracts, operating leases and other real estate contracts, trademarks, intellectual property, financial agreements and various other agreements. Under these agreements, the Company may provide certain routine indemnifications relating to representations and warranties (for example, ownership of assets, environmental or tax indemnifications) or personal injury matters. The terms of these indemnifications range in duration and may not be explicitly defined. Historically, Safeway has not made significant payments for these indemnifications. The Company believes that if it were to incur a loss in any of these matters, the loss would not have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. Letters of Credit The Company had letters of credit of $58.9 million outstanding at year end 2007. The letters of credit are maintained primarily to support performance, payment, deposit or surety obligations of the Company. The Company pays commissions ranging from 0.15% to 1.00% on the face amount of the letters of credit. Interest Rate Swap Agreements The Company has, from time to time, entered into interest rate swap agreements to change its portfolio mix of fixed and floating rate debt to more desirable levels. Interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange with a counterparty of fixed and floating rate interest payments periodically over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional principal amounts. The differential to be paid or received is recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense. The Companys counterparties have been major financial institutions. As of year end 2007, the Company effectively converted $500 million of its 4.95% fixed rate debt due in 2010 and $300 million of its 4.125% fixed rate debt due in 2008 to floating rate debt through interest rate swap agreements. In January 2008, Safeway terminated its interest rate swap agreements on its $500 million debt at a gain of approximately $7.5 million. This gain will be included in debt and will be amortized as an offset to interest expense over the remaining term of the debt. Energy Contracts The Company has entered into contracts to purchase electricity and natural gas at fixed prices for a portion of its energy needs. Safeway expects to take delivery of the electricity and natural gas in the normal course of business, and these contracts are not net settled. Since these contracts qualify for the normal purchase exception of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, they are not marked to market. Energy purchased under these contracts is expensed as delivered. New Accounting Standards In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurement. SFAS No. 157 defines and establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands related disclosures. This Statement does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS No. 157 is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial LiabilitiesIncluding an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. SFAS No. 159 permits companies to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates. Unrealized gains and losses on these items will be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The fair value option may be applied instrument by instrument (with a few exceptions), is irrevocable and is applied only to entire instruments and not to portions of instruments. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of SFAS No. 159 on its financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141R). SFAS No. 141R established principles and requirements for how an entity which obtains control of one or more businesses (1) recognizes and measures the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, (2) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination and (3) determines what 30 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES information to disclose regarding business combinations. SFAS No. 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual report period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of SFAS No. 141R on its financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51. SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, SFAS No. 160 requires expanded disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of SFAS No. 160 on its financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Safeway manages interest rate risk through the strategic use of fixed and variable interest rate debt and, from time to time, interest rate swaps. As of year end 2007, the Company effectively converted $500 million of its 4.95% fixed rate debt and $300 million of its 4.125% fixed rate debt to floating rate debt through interest rate swap agreements. During 2007 the weighted average pay rate on the $500 million debt was 6.22%, and the weighted average pay rate on the $300 million debt was 5.97%. At year end 2007, the fair value of the interest rate swap on the $300 million debt was a liability of $2.4 million, and the fair value of the interest rate swap on the $500 million debt was an asset of $3.8 million. As a result of a decline in interest rates in early 2008, the fair value of these swaps increased. In January 2008, Safeway terminated its interest rate swap agreements on its $500 million debt due in 2010 at a gain of approximately $7.5 million. This gain will be included in debt and will be amortized as an offset to interest expense over the remaining term of the debt. The Company does not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes, nor does it utilize leveraged financial instruments. The Company does not consider the potential declines in future earnings, fair values and cash flows from reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates and exchange rates to be material. The table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average rates by year of maturity for the Companys debt obligations at year end 2007 (dollars in millions): 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Fair value Long term debt: (1) Principal $ 954.9 $ 752.5 $ 505.5 $ 502.1 $ 825.6 $ 1,507.8 $ 5,048.4 $ 5,203.3 Weighted average interest rate 4.97% 6.73% 4.98% 6.51% 5.79% 6.70% 6.04% (1) Primarily fixed rate debt 31 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC.
