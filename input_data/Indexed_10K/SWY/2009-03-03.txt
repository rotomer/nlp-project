Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The last three fiscal years consist of the 53 week period ended January 3, 2009 (fiscal 2008 or 2008), the 52 week period ended December 29, 2007 (fiscal 2007 or 2007) and the 52 week period ended December 30, 2006 (fiscal 2006 or 2006). Results of Operations Economic Outlook The current economic environment has made consumers more cautious. This could lead to reduced consumer spending, to consumers trading down to a less expensive mix of products or to consumers trading down to discounters for grocery items, all of which could affect Safeways sales growth. Additionally, in this uncertain economy, it is difficult to forecast whether we are entering a period of inflation or deflation. In 2008, Safeway experienced overall inflation, while early indications suggest that there may be deflation in certain product categories in 2009. Food deflation could reduce sales growth, while food inflation, combined with reduced consumer spending, could reduce gross profit margins. However, in a slowing economy, some customers may trade down from dining out in restaurants to shopping more at grocery stores such as Safeway and from purchasing national brand products to purchasing less expensive Safeway private label brands. Additionally, when fuel prices are high, consumers may switch from shopping at more remote club and discount stores to Safeways more convenient neighborhood locations. Safeway reported net income of $965.3 million ($2.21 per diluted share) in 2008, $888.4 million ($1.99 per diluted share) in 2007 and $870.6 million ($1.94 per diluted share) in 2006. Results in fiscal 2006 were affected by a $62.6 million reduction of income tax expense which is described in this report under the caption Income Taxes. Sales Same store sales increases for the past three fiscal years were as follows: Fiscal 2008 * Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Comparable store sales Identical storesales ** Comparable store sales Identical storesales ** Comparable store sales Identical storesales ** Including fuel 1.5 % 1.4 % 4.4 % 4.1 % 4.4 % 4.1 % Excluding fuel 0.9 % 0.8 % 3.6 % 3.4 % 3.5 % 3.3 % * Based on the same 53 week period in both years. ** Excludes replacement stores. Safeways marketing strategies have evolved in recent years and are based on consumer research and competitive analysis. This helps us carry high quality perishables and the right products (such as organic products and our revitalized corporate brands) at the right prices (including our club card specials), increasingly merchandised in a warm and inviting shopping environment (our Lifestyle stores). We have communicated this message through our Ingredients for life advertising campaign. We believe all of these elements have contributed to our sales growth. Through past experience, we have further improved our Lifestyle store execution by refining the layout and d&eacute;cor of the Lifestyle store and improving our store opening promotions. We believe this has contributed to our sales growth. Sales increased 4.3% to $44.1 billion in 2008 from $42.3 billion in 2007 primarily because the additional week in 2008 contributed $777 million in sales, fuel sales increased $397 million and identical store sales increased. At the end of 2008, Safeway had 1,276 Lifestyle stores compared to 1,024 at the end of 2007. Customer counts decreased, and average transaction size increased during fiscal 2008. Sales increased 5.2% to $42.3 billion in 2007 from $40.2 billion in 2006 primarily because of Safeways marketing strategy, Lifestyle store execution, an increase in fuel sales of $486 million and a favorable change in the Canadian 22 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES dollar exchange rate of $351 million (in U.S. dollars). At the end of 2007, Safeway had 1,024 Lifestyle stores compared to 751 at the end of 2006. Customer counts decreased, and average transaction size increased during fiscal 2007. Total sales increased 4.6% to $40.2 billion in 2006 from $38.4 billion in 2005 primarily because of Safeways marketing strategy, Lifestyle store execution and an increase in fuel sales of $385 million. At the end of 2006, Safeway had 751 Lifestyle stores compared to 458 at the end of 2005. Customer counts and average transaction size increased during fiscal 2006. Gross Profit Gross profit represents the portion of sales revenue remaining after deducting the cost of goods sold during the period, including purchase and distribution costs. These costs include inbound freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs, warehouse inspection costs, warehousing costs and other costs associated with Safeways distribution network. Advertising and promotional expenses are also a component of cost of goods sold. Additionally, all vendor allowances are classified as an element of cost of goods sold. Gross profit margin was 28.38% of sales in 2008, 28.74% in 2007 and 28.82% in 2006. The gross profit margin declined 36 basis points to 28.38% of sales in 2008 from 28.74% of sales in 2007. Excluding fuel, gross profit declined 25 basis points primarily because of investments in price and higher LIFO expense, partly offset by lower advertising expense and improved inventory shrink. LIFO expense was $34.9 million in 2008 compared to $13.9 million in 2007. The decline in advertising expense was primarily the result of a more efficient mix of advertising media and may not necessarily continue in the future. Improved inventory shrink is the result of long term efforts which we do expect to continue into the future. Gross profit decreased eight basis points to 28.74% of sales in 2007 from 28.82% of sales in 2006. Higher fuel sales reduced gross profit by 20 basis points. Excluding fuel, gross profit increased 12 basis points primarily because of lower advertising expense, improved shrink and benefits from supply chain initiatives, partly offset by investments in price and higher LIFO expense. LIFO expense was $13.9 million in 2007 compared to $1.2 million in 2006. The decline in advertising expense was primarily the result of a different mix of advertising media. Improved inventory shrink and supply chain initiatives are the result of long term efforts. Supply chain initiatives consist primarily of Company programs to reduce cost of goods, transportation and warehouse expenses. Gross profit decreased 11 basis points to 28.82% of sales in 2006 from 28.93% of sales in 2005. Higher fuel sales reduced gross profit by 28 basis points. Excluding fuel, gross profit increased 17 basis points, primarily because of improved shrink, benefits from product sourcing initiatives and improved product mix, partly offset by investments in price and increased advertising expense. Vendor allowances totaled $2.6 billion in 2008 and $2.5 billion in both 2007 and 2006. Vendor allowances can be grouped into the following broad categories: promotional allowances, slotting allowances and contract allowances. All vendor allowances are classified as an element of cost of goods sold. Promotional allowances make up approximately three quarters of all allowances. With promotional allowances, vendors pay Safeway to promote their product. The promotion may be any combination of a temporary price reduction, a feature in print ads, a feature in a Safeway circular or a preferred location in the store. The promotions are typically one to two weeks long. Slotting allowances are a small portion of total allowances (typically less than 5% of all allowances). With slotting allowances, the vendor reimburses Safeway for the cost of placing new product on the shelf. Safeway has no obligation or commitment to keep the product on the shelf for a minimum period. Contract allowances make up the remainder of all allowances. Under the typical contract allowance, a vendor pays 23 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Safeway to keep product on the shelf for a minimum period of time or when volume thresholds are achieved. Operating and Administrative Expense Operating and administrative expense consists primarily of store occupancy costs and backstage expenses, which, in turn, consist primarily of wages, employee benefits, rent, depreciation and utilities. Operating and administrative expense was 24.17% of sales in 2008 compared to 24.55% in 2007 and 24.84% in 2006. Operating and administrative expense improved 38 basis points to 24.17% of sales in 2008 from 24.55% of sales in 2007. Higher fuel sales in 2008 improved operating and administrative expense by 11 basis points. The remaining 27 basis point improvement is primarily due to reduced employee costs as a percentage of sales partly offset by higher energy costs, currency exchange losses and workers compensation costs. Operating and administrative expense decreased 29 basis points to 24.55% of sales in 2007 from 24.84% of sales in 2006. Higher fuel sales in 2007 reduced operating and administrative expense by 16 basis points. The remaining 13 basis point decline is primarily the result of reduced employee costs as a percentage of sales and higher gains on disposal of property, partly offset by higher depreciation expense. Dominicks In February 2007, the Company announced a strategic plan to revitalize its operations at Dominicks. This plan included remodeling 20 stores to Lifestyle stores, new store development and closing 14 under performing stores in 2007. In the second quarter of 2007, Safeway incurred a store lease exit charge of $30.3 million ($0.04 per diluted share) as a result of these closures. Operating and administrative expense decreased 93 basis points to 24.84% of sales in 2006 from 25.77% of sales in 2005. The store exit activities and employee buyouts in 2005 reduced operating and administrative expense by 44 basis points. Higher fuel sales in 2006 reduced operating and administrative expense by 13 basis points. The remaining decline is primarily the result of increased sales and reduced costs as a percentage of sales from store labor, workers compensation and pension expense. Gains on Property Retirements Operating and administrative expense included net gains on property retirements of $19.0 million in 2008, $42.3 million in 2007 and $17.8 million in 2006. In 2007 the Company sold a Bellevue, Washington distribution center at a gain of $46.6 million and a warehouse in Chicago, Illinois at a gain of $11.2 million. These gains were partly offset by net losses on other property retirements. Interest Expense Interest expense was $358.7 million in 2008, compared to $388.9 million in 2007 and $396.1 million in 2006. Interest expense decreased in 2008 primarily due to a combination of lower average borrowings and a lower average interest rate. Interest expense decreased in 2007 and 2006 primarily due to lower average borrowings, partially offset by a higher average interest rate. Other Income Other income consists of interest income, minority interest in a consolidated affiliate and equity in earnings from Safeways unconsolidated affiliates. Interest income was $12.5 million in 2008, $11.8 million in 2007 and $11.1 million in 2006. Equity in (losses) earnings of unconsolidated affiliates was a loss of $2.5 million in 2008, income of $8.7 million in 2007 and income of $21.1 million in 2006. Income Taxes The Companys effective tax rates for 2008, 2007 and 2006 were 35.8%, 36.7% and 29.8%, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2006 included a benefit of $62.6 million related to interest, net of income tax, on federal and state income tax refunds, and various other favorable items. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are important to the portrayal of Safeways financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. 24 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Workers Compensation The Company is primarily self insured for workers compensation, automobile and general liability costs. It is the Companys policy to record its self insurance liability as determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Self insurance reserves are actuarially determined primarily by applying historical paid loss and incurred loss development trends to current cash and incurred expected losses in order to estimate total losses. We then discount total expected losses to their present value using a risk free rate of return. Any actuarial projection of self insured losses is subject to a high degree of variability. For example, self insurance expense increased to $161.6 million in fiscal 2008 from $117.1 million in 2007 and $133.2 million in 2006. Litigation trends, legal interpretations, benefit level changes, claim settlement patterns and similar factors influenced historical development trends that were used to determine the current year expense and therefore contributed to the variability in annual expense. However, these factors are not direct inputs into the actuarial projection, and thus their individual impact cannot be quantified. We believe that the discount rate is a significant factor that has led to variability in self insured expenses. Since the discount rate is a direct input into the estimation process, we are able to quantify its impact. The discount rate, which is based on the United States Treasury Note rates for the estimated average claim life of five years, was 1.75% in 2008, 3.5% in 2007 and 4.5% in 2006. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate affects the self insured liability by approximately $5.3 million. The majority of the Companys workers compensation liability is from claims occurring in California. California workers compensation has received intense scrutiny from the states politicians, insurers, employers and providers, as well as the public in general. Recent years have seen escalation in the number of legislative reforms, judicial rulings and social phenomena affecting this business. Some of the many sources of uncertainty in the Companys reserve estimates include changes in benefit levels, medical fee schedules, medical utilization guidelines, vocation rehabilitation and apportionment. Store Closures Safeways policy is to recognize losses relating to the impairment of long lived assets when expected net future cash flows are less than the assets carrying values. When stores that are under long term leases close, Safeway records a liability for the future minimum lease payments and related ancillary costs, net of estimated cost recoveries. In both cases, fair value is determined by estimating net future cash flows and discounting them using a risk adjusted rate of interest. The Company estimates future cash flows based on its experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located and, when necessary, uses real estate brokers. However, these estimates project future cash flows several years into the future and are affected by factors such as inflation, real estate markets and economic conditions. At any one time, Safeway has a portfolio of closed stores which is widely dispersed over several markets. While individual closed store reserves are likely to be adjusted up or down in the future to reflect changes in assumptions, the change to the total closed store reserve has not been nor is expected to be material. Employee Benefit Plans SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R), requires an employer to recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plans overfunded status or a liability for a plans underfunded status, measure a plans assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employers fiscal year, and recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur. Additional disclosures are also required. Safeway adopted SFAS No. 158 as of December 30, 2006, as required. The determination of Safeways obligation and expense for pension benefits is dependent, in part, on the Companys selection of certain assumptions used by its actuaries in calculating these amounts. These assumptions are disclosed in Note I to the consolidated financial statements and include, among other things, the discount rate, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rate of compensation increases. Actual results in any given year will often 25 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors. In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, affect recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. While Safeway believes its assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in actual results or significant changes in the Companys assumptions may materially affect Safeways pension and other postretirement obligations and its future expense. Safeway bases the discount rate on current investment yields on high quality fixed income investments. The discount rate assumption used to determine the year end projected benefit obligation is increased or decreased to be consistent with the change in yield rates for high quality fixed income investments for the expected period to maturity of the pension benefits. The discount rate used to determine 2008 pension expense was 5.9%. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. Expected return on pension plan assets is based on historical experience of the Companys portfolio and the review of projected returns by asset class on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed income indices, as well as target asset allocation. Safeways target asset allocation mix is designed to meet the Companys long term pension requirements. For 2008 the Companys assumed rate of return was 8.5% on U.S. pension assets and 7.0% on Canadian pension assets. Over the 10 year period ended January 3, 2009, the average rate of return was approximately 3% for U.S. and 4% for Canadian pension assets. At December 29, 2007, the 10 year average rate of return was approximately 9% for U.S. and 8% for Canadian pension assets. The deteriorating conditions in the global financial markets during 2008 led to a substantial reduction in the 10 year average rate of return on pension assets. We expect that the markets will eventually recover to our assumed long term rate of return. The following table summarizes actual allocations for Safeways plans at year end 2008 and year end 2007: Plan assets Asset category Target 2008 2007 Equity 65 % 60.8 % 67.8 % Fixed income 35 38.0 31.8 Cash and other 1.2 0.4 Total 100 % 100.0 % 100.0 % The investment policy also emphasizes the following key objectives: (1) maintain a diversified portfolio among asset classes and investment styles; (2) maintain an acceptable level of risk in pursuit of long term economic benefit; (3) maximize the opportunity for value added returns from active investment management while establishing investment guidelines and monitoring procedures for each investment manager to ensure the characteristics of the portfolio are consistent with the original investment mandate; and (4) maintain adequate controls over administrative costs. 26 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions for Safeways pension plans are as follows (dollars in millions): United States Canada Percentagepointchange Projected benefitobligationdecrease(increase) Expensedecrease(increase) Projected benefitobligationdecrease(increase) Expensedecrease(increase) Expected return on assets +/ 1.0 pt $ 17.2/(17.2) $ 3.3/(3.3) Discount rate +/ 1.0 pt $ 185.6/(230.5) $ 8.6/(44.3) $ 38.4/(44.3) $ 5.7/(6.2) Cash contributions, primarily in Canada, to the Companys pension plans are expected to total approximately $25.9 million in 2009 and totaled $33.8 million in 2008, $33.0 million in 2007 and $29.2 million in 2006. Stock Based Employee Compensation SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements as compensation cost based on the fair value on the date of grant. The Company determines fair value of such awards using the Black Scholes option pricing model. The Black Scholes option pricing model incorporates certain assumptions, such as a risk free interest rate, expected volatility, expected dividend yield and expected life of options, in order to arrive at a fair value estimate. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is not subject to amortization but must be evaluated for impairment. We test goodwill for impairment annually (on the first day of the fourth quarter), or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount, by initially comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units to their related carrying values. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform an additional step to determine the implied fair value of goodwill associated with that reporting unit. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, such excess represents the amount of goodwill impairment. Our goodwill impairment analysis also includes a comparison of the aggregate estimated fair value of all reporting units to our total market capitalization. Therefore, a significant and sustained decline in our stock price could result in goodwill impairment charges. During times of financial market volatility, significant judgment is given to determine the underlying cause of the decline and whether stock price declines are short term in nature or indicative of an event or change in circumstances. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The estimate of fair value of each of our reporting units is based on our projection of sales, gross profit, operating profit and cash flows considering historical and estimated future results, general economic and market conditions as well as the impact of planned business and operational strategies. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty. Actual results may differ from those estimates. The valuations employ present value techniques to measure fair value and consider market factors. Based upon the results of our September 7, 2008 analysis, no impairment of goodwill was indicated. As of September 7, 2008, if forecasted cash flows had been 10% lower than estimated or if the discount rate applied in our analysis had been 10% higher than estimated, no goodwill impairment would have been indicated. However, changes in the judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment, including expected future cash flows and discount rate, could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units in the future. Income Tax Contingencies The Company is subject to periodic audits by the Internal Revenue Service and other foreign, state and local taxing authorities. These audits may challenge certain of the Companys tax positions such as the timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of taxable income to various tax jurisdictions. Income tax contingencies are accounted for in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), and may require significant management judgment in estimating final outcomes. Actual 27 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES results could materially differ from these estimates and could significantly affect the Companys effective tax rate and cash flows in future years. Note H to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this report provides additional information on income taxes. Liquidity and Financial Resources Net cash flow from operating activities was $2,250.9 million in 2008, $2,190.5 million in 2007 and $2,175.0 million in 2006 primarily due to the increasing amount of net income in such years. Blackhawk receives a significant portion of the cash inflow from the sale of third party gift cards late in the fourth quarter of the year and remits the majority of the cash, less commissions, to the card partners early in the first quarter of the following year. The growth of Blackhawks net payables related to third party gift cards declined to $23.9 million in 2008 from $84.1 million in 2007 as a result of the timing of payments due to the holidays, the 53rd week of fiscal 2008 and a change in the product mix. Historically, cash contributions to the Companys retirement plans have been relatively small. For example, cash contributions were $33.8 million and $33.0 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, and were limited primarily to our Canadian retirement plans. The decline in the financial markets during 2008 resulted in a substantial reduction in the fair value of the retirement plan assets. As a result, at the end of fiscal 2008, pension benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of plans assets for all of the Companys pension plans. In 2009, we expect pension expense to increase significantly, primarily as a result of the decline in the plan assets. The Company currently expects to contribute approximately $25.9 million to its defined benefit pension plan trusts in 2009. If return on plan assets is less than expected or if discounts rates decline, plan contributions could increase significantly in 2010 and beyond. Net cash flow used by investing activities, which consists principally of cash paid for property additions, was $1,546.0 million in 2008, $1,686.4 million in 2007 and $1,734.7 million in 2006. Net cash flow used by investing activities declined in 2008 primarily due to lower cash paid for property additions. Cash paid for property additions was greater in 2007 than in 2006. However, proceeds from the sale of property were also greater in 2007. In addition, Safeway spent $83.8 million to acquire businesses in 2006. Capital expenditures decreased moderately in 2008 and increased in 2007 and 2006 compared to the prior years. During 2008, Safeway invested $1.6 billion in capital expenditures. The Company continued to focus on Lifestyle remodels. In 2008 the Company opened 20 new Lifestyle stores and completed 232 Lifestyle store remodels. The Company also completed 21 other remodels. During 2007, Safeway invested $1.77 billion in capital expenditures. The Company opened 20 new Lifestyle stores, completed 253 Lifestyle remodels and closed 38 stores. In 2006 Safeway opened 17 new Lifestyle stores and completed 276 Lifestyle store remodels. Safeway also completed eight other remodels. In 2009 the Company expects to spend approximately $1.2 billion in cash capital expenditures and to open approximately 10 new Lifestyle stores and to remodel approximately 135 stores into Lifestyle stores. The reduction in cash capital expenditures for fiscal 2009 is expected to increase cash flow available to pay down debt. The Company expects that approximately 82% and 88% of its store base will be Lifestyle stores by the end of 2009 and 2010, respectively. Net cash flow used by financing activities was $594.3 million in 2008, $454.0 million in 2007 and $596.3 million in 2006. In 2008 the Company paid down $130.0 million of debt, repurchased $359.5 million of common stock and paid $132.1 million of dividends. In 2007 Safeway paid down $261.3 million of debt, repurchased $226.1 million of common stock and paid $111.5 million of dividends. In 2006 Safeway paid down $493.1 million of debt, repurchased $318.0 million of common stock and paid dividends of $96.0 million. Also in 2006 Safeway received a $262.3 million tax refund related to prior years financing. The recent economic turmoil in the credit markets may negatively impact the Companys ability to access debt financing in a timely manner and with acceptable terms. In the event the Company is unable to issue sufficient commercial paper or public debt to repay current maturities, we may choose to borrow under the Credit Agreement, described under the caption Bank Credit Agreement in this report. Although there can be no assurance because of these challenging 28 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES times, Safeway expects that the participating banks will loan to Safeway under the Credit Agreement. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, Safeway was able to borrow under the Credit Agreement. Based upon the current level of operations, Safeway believes that net cash flow from operating activities and other sources of liquidity, including potential borrowing under Safeways commercial paper program and its Credit Agreement, will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, interest payments, dividend payments, stock repurchases, if any, and scheduled principal payments for the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance, however, that Safeways business will continue to generate cash flow at or above current levels or that the Company will maintain its ability to borrow under its commercial paper program and credit agreement. Bank Credit Agreement The Company has a $1,600.0 million credit agreement (as amended, the Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks which has a termination date of June 1, 2012 and provides for two additional one year extensions of the termination date. There are approximately 30 banks in the syndicate with individual commitments to lend ranging from approximately $20 million to approximately $115 million. The Credit Agreement provides (i) to Safeway a $1,350.0 million revolving credit facility (the Domestic Facility), (ii) to Safeway and Canada Safeway Limited a Canadian facility of up to $250.0 million for U.S. Dollar and Canadian Dollar advances and (iii) to Safeway a $400.0 million sub facility of the Domestic Facility for issuance of standby and commercial letters of credit. The Credit Agreement also provides for an increase in the credit facility commitments up to an additional $500.0 million, at the option of the lenders and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The restrictive covenants of the Credit Agreement limit Safeway with respect to, among other things, creating liens upon its assets and disposing of material amounts of assets other than in the ordinary course of business. Additionally, the Company is required to maintain a minimum Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Agreement, to interest expense ratio of 2.0 to 1 and is required to not exceed an Adjusted Debt (total consolidated debt less cash and cash equivalents in excess of $75.0 million) to Adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.5 to 1. As of January 3, 2009, the Company was in compliance with these covenant requirements as shown on the following page. As of January 3, 2009, there were no borrowings, and letters of credit totaled $34.5 million under the Credit Agreement. Total unused borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement was $1,565.5 million as of January 3, 2009. 29 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES The computation of Adjusted EBITDA, as defined by the Credit Agreement, is provided below solely to provide an understanding of the impact that Adjusted EBITDA has on Safeways ability to borrow under the Credit Agreement. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities (which are determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of operating performance or a measure of liquidity. Other companies may define Adjusted EBITDA differently and, as a result, such measures may not be comparable to Safeways Adjusted EBITDA (dollars in millions). 53 weeks2008 Adjusted EBITDA: Net income $ 965.3 Add (subtract): Income taxes 539.3 Interest expense 358.7 Depreciation 1,141.1 LIFO expense 34.9 Stock option expense 62.3 Property impairment charges 40.3 Equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates 2.5 Total Adjusted EBITDA $ 3,144.4 Adjusted EBITDA as a multiple of interest expense 8.77x Total debt at year end 2008 $ 5,499.8 Less cash and equivalents in excess of $75.0 at January 3, 2009 (307.8 ) Adjusted Debt $ 5,192.0 Adjusted Debt to Adjusted EBITDA 1.65x Shelf Registration On December 8, 2008, the Company filed a shelf registration statement the (the Shelf) with the SEC which enables Safeway to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities and or common stock. The Shelf expires on December 8, 2011. The Safeway Board of Directors has authorized issuance of up to $2.0 billion of securities under the Shelf. Pursuant to the Shelf, Safeway issued $500.0 million of 6.25% Notes (the Notes) on December 17, 2008. The Notes mature on March 15, 2014. The Company will pay interest on the Notes on March 15 and September 15 of each year commencing on March 15, 2009. Safeway used the net proceeds from the Notes to repay borrowings under its U.S. commercial paper program, revolving credit facility and money market bank credit facilities. At Safeways option, the Notes can be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis at the then current United States Treasury Rate, as defined in the Notes, plus 50 basis points. 30 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES Stock Repurchase Program From the initiation of the Companys stock repurchase program in 1999 through the end of fiscal 2008, the aggregate cost of shares of common stock repurchased by the Company, including commissions, was approximately $3.8 billion, leaving an authorized amount for repurchases of approximately $1.2 billion. This includes an increase in the total authorized level of the repurchase program by $1.0 billion to $5.0 billion approved by the Board of Directors in May 2008. During fiscal 2008, Safeway repurchased approximately 12.6 million shares of its common stock under the repurchase program at an aggregate price, including commissions, of $359.5 million. The average price per share, excluding commissions, was $28.45. The Company will evaluate the timing and volume of future repurchases based on several factors, including market conditions, and may repurchase stock in the near or long term as circumstances warrant. Credit Ratings The senior long term and short term debt ratings and outlooks currently assigned to unsecured Safeway public debt securities by the rating agencies are as follows: SeniorLong Term Short Term Outlook Fitch Ratings BBB F2 Stable Moodys Investors Services Baa2 P 2 Stable Standard & Poors BBB A 2 Stable Safeways ability to borrow under the Credit Agreement is not affected by Safeways credit ratings. Also, the Company maintains no debt which requires accelerated repayment based on the lowering of credit ratings. Pricing under the Credit Agreement is generally determined by the better of Safeways interest coverage ratio or credit ratings. Negative changes in the Companys credit ratings may have an adverse impact on financing costs and structure in future periods, such as the ability to participate in the commercial paper market and higher interest costs on future financings. Additionally, if Safeway does not maintain the financial covenants in its Credit Agreement, its ability to borrow under the Credit Agreement would be impaired. Investors should note that a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to withdrawal by the rating agency. Each credit rating should be evaluated independently. 32 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Contractual Obligations The table below presents significant contractual obligations of the Company at year end 2008 (in millions) (1): 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Long term debt (2) $ 758.4 $ 505.7 $ 502.4 $ 1,163.0 $ 0.8 $ 2,012.3 $ 4,942.6 Estimated interest on long term debt 267.5 236.5 195.1 178.7 132.3 1,076.3 2,086.4 Capital lease obligations (2),(3) 40.6 36.7 32.3 31.3 32.2 384.1 557.2 Interest on capital leases 53.7 50.2 46.8 43.5 40.2 245.7 480.1 Self insurance liability 126.2 92.0 62.9 43.6 30.7 132.4 487.8 Interest on self insurance liability 1.1 2.4 2.8 2.7 2.5 31.7 43.2 Operating leases (3) 469.3 438.4 397.0 365.6 327.8 2,383.4 4,381.5 Contracts for purchase of property, equipment and construction of buildings 245.4 245.4 Contracts for purchase of inventory 394.0 394.0 Fixed price energy contracts 113.1 55.1 34.6 34.6 0.7 8.2 246.3 Total $ 2,469.3 $ 1,417.0 $ 1,273.9 $ 1,863.0 $ 567.2 $ 6,274.1 $ 13,864.5 (1) Excludes funding of pension benefit obligations which were $33.8 million and postretirement benefit obligations which were $8.7 million in 2008. Also excludes contributions under various multi employer pension plans, which totaled $286.9 million in 2008. Additionally, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits ($129.2 million at January 3, 2009) has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future tax settlements cannot be determined. (2) Required principal payments only. (3) Operating and capital lease obligations do not include common area maintenance, insurance or tax payments for which the Company is also obligated. In fiscal 2008, these charges totaled approximately $215.2 million. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Guarantees The Company is party to a variety of contractual agreements under which it may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters. These contracts primarily relate to the Companys commercial contracts, operating leases and other real estate contracts, trademarks, intellectual property, financial agreements and various other agreements. Under these agreements, the Company may provide certain routine indemnifications relating to representations and warranties (for example, ownership of assets, environmental or tax indemnifications) or personal injury matters. The terms of these indemnifications range in duration and may not be explicitly defined. Historically, Safeway has not made significant payments for these indemnifications. The Company believes that if it were to incur a loss in any of these matters, the loss would not have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. Letters of Credit The Company had letters of credit of $49.2 million outstanding at year end 2008. The letters of credit are maintained primarily to support performance, payment, deposit or surety obligations of the Company. The Company pays commissions ranging from 0.15% to 1.00% on the face amount of the letters of credit. Interest Rate Swap Agreements The Company has, from time to time, entered into interest rate swap agreements to change its portfolio mix of fixed and floating rate debt to more desirable levels. Interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange with a counterparty of fixed and floating rate interest payments periodically over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional principal amounts. The differential to be paid or received is recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense. The Companys counterparties have been major financial institutions. In January 2008, Safeway terminated its interest rate swap agreements on its $500 million debt at a gain of approximately $7.5 million. This gain is included in debt and is being amortized as an offset to interest expense through July 2009, the remaining term of the underlying debt. As of year end 2008, the Company had no outstanding interest rate swap agreements. 33 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Energy Contracts The Company has entered into contracts to purchase electricity and natural gas at fixed prices for a portion of its energy needs. Safeway expects to take delivery of the electricity and natural gas in the normal course of business, and these contracts are not net settled. Since these contracts qualify for the normal purchase exception of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, they are not marked to market. Energy purchased under these contracts is expensed as delivered. New Accounting Standards In March 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 161 is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand the effects of the derivative instruments on an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. It is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early application encouraged. Safeway is currently assessing the potential impact of SFAS No. 161 on its financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51. SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, SFAS No. 160 requires expanded disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of SFAS No. 160 on its financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141R). SFAS No. 141R established principles and requirements for how an entity which obtains control of one or more businesses (1) recognizes and measures the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, (2) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination and (3) determines what information to disclose regarding business combinations. SFAS No. 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual report period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. 34 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Safeway manages interest rate risk through the use of fixed and variable interest rate debt and, from time to time, interest rate swaps. As of year end 2008, the Company had no outstanding interest rate swap agreements. The Company does not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes, nor does it utilize leveraged financial instruments. The Company does not consider the potential declines in future earnings, fair values and cash flows from reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates and exchange rates to be material. The table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average rates by year of maturity for the Companys debt obligations at year end 2008 (dollars in millions): 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Fair value Long term debt: (1) Principal $ 758.4 $ 505.7 $ 502.4 $ 1,163.0 $ 0.8 $ 2,012.3 $ 4,942.6 $ 5,090.3 Weighted average interest rate 5.24% 4.98% 6.51% 5.62% 7.42% 6.59% 6.03% (1) Primarily fixed rate debt 35 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC.
