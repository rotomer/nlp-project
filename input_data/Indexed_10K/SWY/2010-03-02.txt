Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The last three fiscal years consist of the 52 week period ended January 2, 2010 (fiscal 2009 or 2009), the 53 week period ended January 3, 2009 (fiscal 2008 or 2008) and the 52 week period ended December 29, 2007 (fiscal 2007 or 2007). Results of Operations Economic Outlook The current economic environment has made consumers more cautious. In 2009, this led to reduced consumer spending, to consumers trading down to a less expensive mix of products and to consumers trading down to discounters for grocery items, all of which have reduced Safeways sales. Additionally, in 2009, the Company experienced deflation in certain product categories. These difficult economic conditions may continue in 2010. Safeway reported a net loss of $1,097.5 million ($2.66 per diluted share) in 2009, net income of $965.3 million ($2.21 per diluted share) in 2008, and net income of $888.4 million ($1.99 per diluted share) in 2007. Fiscal 2009 included a non cash goodwill impairment charge of $1,974.2 million ($1,818.2 million, net of tax). The impairment was due primarily to Safeways reduced market capitalization and a weak economy. The difficult economic environment negatively impacted all of Safeways divisions; however, due to their large goodwill balances, the goodwill impairment resulted primarily from the Vons and Eastern divisions. Sales Same store sales (decreases) increases for the past three fiscal years were as follows: Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 * Fiscal 2007 Comparable store sales Identical storesales ** Comparable store sales Identical storesales ** Comparable store sales Identical storesales ** Including fuel (4.9 )% (5.0 )% 1.5 % 1.4 % 4.4 % 4.1 % Excluding fuel (2.5 )% (2.5 )% 0.9 % 0.8 % 3.6 % 3.4 % * Based on the same 53 week period in both years. ** Excludes replacement stores. Sales decreased 7.4% to $40.9 billion in 2009 from $44.1 billion in 2008. Fuel sales declined $1,197 million. The additional week in 2008 accounted for $777 million of the decline. Additionally, the change in the Canadian dollar exchange rate resulted in a $407 million decrease in sales. Identical store sales, excluding fuel, declined as a result of economic conditions, investments in price and deflation. Customer counts increased slightly, and average transaction size decreased during fiscal 2009. Sales increased 4.3% to $44.1 billion in 2008 from $42.3 billion in 2007 primarily because of the additional week in 2008 contributing $777 million in sales, an increase in fuel sales of $397 million, an increase in identical store sales and Lifestyle store execution. At the end of 2008, Safeway had 1,276 Lifestyle stores compared to 1,024 at the end of 2007. Customer counts decreased, and average transaction size increased during fiscal 2008. Gross Profit Gross profit represents the portion of sales revenue remaining after deducting the cost of goods sold during the period, including purchase and distribution costs. These costs include inbound freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs, warehouse inspection costs, warehousing costs and other costs associated with Safeways distribution network. Advertising and promotional expenses are also a component of cost of goods sold. Additionally, all vendor allowances are classified as an element of cost of goods sold. Gross profit margin was 28.62% of sales in 2009, 28.38% of sales in 2008 and 28.74% in 2007. The gross profit margin increased 24 basis points to 28.62% of sales in 2009 from 28.38% of sales in 2008. The impact from fuel sales increased gross profit margin 59 basis points. The offsetting 35 basis point decline was largely the result of 22 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES investments in everyday prices and higher advertising expense, partly offset by lower LIFO expense, higher gift card revenue and higher energy costs. LIFO income was $35.2 million in 2009 compared to expense of $34.9 million in 2008. The gross profit margin declined 36 basis points to 28.38% of sales in 2008 from 28.74% of sales in 2007. Excluding fuel, gross profit declined 25 basis points primarily because of investments in price and higher LIFO expense, partly offset by lower advertising expense and improved inventory shrink. LIFO expense was $34.9 million in 2008 compared to $13.9 million in 2007. The decline in advertising expense in 2008 was primarily the result of a more efficient mix of advertising media. Improved inventory shrink is the result of long term efforts. Operating and Administrative Expense Operating and administrative expense consists primarily of store occupancy costs and backstage expenses, which, in turn, consist primarily of wages, employee benefits, rent, depreciation and utilities. Operating and administrative expense was 25.33% of sales in 2009 compared to 24.17% of sales in 2008 and 24.55% in 2007. Operating and administrative expense margin increased 116 basis points to 25.33% of sales in 2009 from 24.17% of sales in 2008. Lower fuel sales in 2009 increased operating and administrative expense margin 56 basis points. The remaining 60 basis points was primarily the result of decreased sales leverage, increased charges from property impairments and retirements and increased pension expense, partly offset by lower workers compensation expense and energy costs. Operating and administrative expense improved 38 basis points to 24.17% of sales in 2008 from 24.55% of sales in 2007. Higher fuel sales in 2008 improved operating and administrative expense by 11 basis points. The remaining 27 basis point improvement is primarily due to reduced employee costs as a percentage of sales partly offset by higher energy costs, currency exchange losses and workers compensation costs. (Loss) Gains on Property Retirements Operating and administrative expense included a net loss on property retirements of $12.7 million in 2009, a gain of $19.0 million in 2008 and a gain of $42.3 million in 2007. In 2007, the Company sold a Bellevue, Washington distribution center at a gain of $46.6 million and a warehouse in Chicago, Illinois at a gain of $11.2 million. These gains were partly offset by net losses on other property retirements. Interest Expense Interest expense was $331.7 million in 2009, compared to $358.7 million in 2008 and $388.9 million in 2007. Interest expense decreased in 2009 and 2008 primarily due to a combination of lower average borrowings and a lower average interest rate. Other Income Other income consists of interest income and equity in earnings (losses) from Safeways unconsolidated affiliate. Interest income was $2.3 million in 2009, $12.5 million in 2008 and $11.8 million in 2007. Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliate was income of $8.5 million in 2009, a loss of $2.5 million in 2008 and income of $8.7 million in 2007. Income Taxes In 2009, Safeway had income tax expense of $144.2 million despite having a pre tax loss of $953.3 million. The 2009 tax expense reflects the tax effect of the goodwill impairment charge which is largely nondeductible for income tax purposes and, therefore, increases the Companys effective income tax rate. The impact of the goodwill impairment charge on the tax expense was partly offset by a benefit of $74.9 million from the favorable resolution of various tax matters. The effective tax rates for 2008 and 2007 were 35.8% and 36.7%, respectively. 23 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are important to the portrayal of Safeways financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Workers Compensation The Company is primarily self insured for workers compensation, automobile and general liability costs. It is the Companys policy to record its self insurance liability as determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Self insurance reserves are actuarially determined primarily by applying historical paid loss and incurred loss development trends to current cash and incurred expected losses in order to estimate total losses. We then discount total expected losses to their present value using a risk free rate of return. Any actuarial projection of self insured losses is subject to a high degree of variability. For example, self insurance expense was $128.8 million in fiscal 2009, $161.6 million in fiscal 2008 and $117.1 million in 2007. Litigation trends, legal interpretations, benefit level changes, claim settlement patterns and similar factors influenced historical development trends that were used to determine the current year expense and therefore contributed to the variability in annual expense. However, these factors are not direct inputs into the actuarial projection, and thus their individual impact cannot be quantified. The discount rate is a significant factor that has led to variability in self insured expenses. Since the discount rate is a direct input into the estimation process, we are able to quantify its impact. The discount rate, which is based on the United States Treasury Note rates for the estimated average claim life of five years, was 2.75% in 2009, 1.75% in 2008 and 3.5% in 2007. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate affects the self insured liability by approximately $4.3 million. The majority of the Companys workers compensation liability is from claims occurring in California. California workers compensation has received intense scrutiny from the states politicians, insurers, employers and providers, as well as the public in general. Recent years have seen escalation in the number of legislative reforms, judicial rulings and social phenomena affecting this business. Some of the many sources of uncertainty in the Companys reserve estimates include changes in benefit levels, medical fee schedules, medical utilization guidelines, vocation rehabilitation and apportionment. Store Closures Safeways policy is to recognize losses relating to the impairment of long lived assets when expected net future cash flows are less than the assets carrying values. When stores that are under long term leases close, Safeway records a liability for the future minimum lease payments and related ancillary costs, net of estimated cost recoveries. In both cases, fair value is determined by estimating net future cash flows and discounting them using a risk adjusted rate of interest. The Company estimates future cash flows based on its experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located and, when necessary, uses real estate brokers. However, these estimates project future cash flows several years into the future and are affected by factors such as inflation, real estate markets and economic conditions. At any one time, Safeway has a portfolio of closed stores which is widely dispersed over several markets. While individual closed store reserves are likely to be adjusted up or down in the future to reflect changes in assumptions, the change to the total closed store reserve has not been nor is expected to be material. Employee Benefit Plans The Company recognizes in its statement of financial position an asset for its employee benefit plans overfunded status or a liability for underfunded status. The Company measures plan assets and obligations that determine the funded status as of fiscal year end. Additional disclosures are provided in Note K to the consolidated financial statements, set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this report. The determination of Safeways obligation and expense for pension benefits is dependent, in part, on the Companys selection of certain assumptions used by its actuaries in calculating these amounts. These assumptions are disclosed in 24 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Note K to the consolidated financial statements and include, among other things, the discount rate, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rate of compensation increases. Actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors. In accordance with GAAP, the amount by which actual results differ from the actuarial assumptions is accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, affects recognized expense and the recorded obligation in such future periods. While Safeway believes its assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in actual results or significant changes in the Companys assumptions may materially affect Safeways pension and other postretirement obligations and its future expense. Safeway bases the discount rate on current investment yields on high quality fixed income investments. The discount rate assumption used to determine the year end projected benefit obligation is increased or decreased to be consistent with the change in yield rates for high quality fixed income investments for the expected period to maturity of the pension benefits. The discount rate used to determine 2009 pension expense was 6.3%. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. Expected return on pension plan assets is based on historical experience of the Companys portfolio and the review of projected returns by asset class on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed income indices, as well as target asset allocation. Safeways target asset allocation mix is designed to meet the Companys long term pension requirements. For 2009, the Companys assumed rate of return was 8.5% on U.S. pension assets and 7.0% on Canadian pension assets. Over the 10 year period ended January 2, 2010, the average rate of return was approximately 3% for U.S. and 5% for Canadian pension assets. The deteriorating conditions in the global financial markets during 2008 led to a substantial reduction in the 10 year average rate of return on pension assets. We expect that the markets will eventually recover to our assumed long term rate of return. The following table summarizes actual allocations for Safeways plans at year end: Plan assets Asset category Target 2009 2008 Equity 65 % 68.9 % 60.8 % Fixed income 35 30.3 38.0 Cash and other 0.8 1.2 Total 100 % 100.0 % 100.0 % The investment policy also emphasizes the following key objectives: (1) maintain a diversified portfolio among asset classes and investment styles; (2) maintain an acceptable level of risk in pursuit of long term economic benefit; (3) maximize the opportunity for value added returns from active investment management while establishing investment guidelines and monitoring procedures for each investment manager to ensure the characteristics of the portfolio are consistent with the original investment mandate; and (4) maintain adequate controls over administrative costs. Sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions for Safeways pension plans are as follows (dollars in millions): United States Canada Percentagepointchange Projected benefitobligationdecrease(increase) Expensedecrease(increase) Projected benefitobligationdecrease(increase) Expensedecrease(increase) Expected return on assets +/ 1.0 pt $ 11.0/(11.0) $ 2.4/(2.5) Discount rate +/ 1.0 pt $ 203.8/(254.3) $ 22.0/(27.3) $ 47.8/(55.0) $ 4.0/(4.3) Cash contributions, primarily in Canada, to the Companys pension plans are expected to total approximately $7.8 million in 2010 and totaled $16.7 million in 2009, $33.8 million in 2008 and $33.0 million in 2007. 25 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill is not subject to amortization but must be evaluated for impairment. We test goodwill for impairment annually (on the first day of the fourth quarter), or whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount. The test to evaluate for impairment is a two step process. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each of our reporting units to its carrying value. If the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a second step to determine the implied fair value of goodwill associated with that reporting unit. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, such excess represents the amount of goodwill impairment. Under generally accepted accounting principles, a reporting unit is either the equivalent to, or one level below, an operating segment. Each reporting unit constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results. Our operating segments are our retail divisions. Our reporting units are generally consistent with our operating segments. As a result of the Companys annual impairment test, Safeway recorded a non cash impairment charge in the amount of $1,974.2 million (pre tax) to reduce the carrying value of goodwill. The impairment was due primarily to Safeways reduced market capitalization and a weak economy. The difficult economic environment negatively impacted all of Safeways divisions; however, due to their large goodwill balances, the goodwill impairment resulted primarily from the Vons and Eastern divisions. Based upon the results of our 2008 and 2007 analyses, no impairment of goodwill was indicated in 2008 or 2007. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit is based on an average of the guideline company method and the discounted cash flow method. These methods are based on historical and forecasted amounts specific to each reporting unit and consider, sales, gross profit, operating profit and cash flows and general economic and market conditions, as well as the impact of planned business and operational strategies. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty. Actual results may be substantially different than the results forecasted in our estimate of a reporting units fair value, resulting in additional goodwill impairment in the future. Additionally, the aggregate fair value of all the reporting units is reconciled to Safeways total market capitalization. Therefore, a significant and sustained decline in our stock price could also result in additional impairment charges. However, the majority of the remaining $426.6 million of goodwill is at reporting units that have estimated fair value that is at least 50% greater than book value. Reporting units, whose fair value is less than 50% of book value, have total goodwill of $21 million. Income Tax Contingencies The Company is subject to periodic audits by the Internal Revenue Service and other foreign, state and local taxing authorities. These audits may challenge certain of the Companys tax positions such as the timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of taxable income to various tax jurisdictions. The Company evaluates its tax positions and establishes liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. These tax uncertainties are reviewed as facts and circumstances change and are adjusted accordingly. This requires significant management judgment in estimating final outcomes. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates and could significantly affect the Companys effective tax rate and cash flows in future years. Note J to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this report provides additional information on income taxes. 26 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Liquidity and Financial Resources Net cash flow from operating activities was $2,549.7 million in 2009, $2,250.9 million in 2008 and $2,190.5 million in 2007. Certain tax items increased cash flow from operating activities in 2009 by approximately $396 million. Blackhawk receives a significant portion of the cash inflow from the sale of third party gift cards late in the fourth quarter of the year and remits the majority of the cash, less commissions, to the card partners early in the first quarter of the following year. Blackhawks net payables related to third party gift cards increased to $170.4 million in 2009 from $23.9 million in 2008 primarily as a result of the growth of the business and the change in the timing of holiday sales compared to fiscal year end. Historically, cash contributions to the Companys retirement plans have been relatively small. For example, cash contributions were $16.7 million and $33.8 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, and were limited primarily to our Canadian retirement plans. The decline in the financial markets during 2008 resulted in a substantial reduction in the fair value of the retirement plan assets. As a result, at the end of fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009, pension benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of plans assets for all of the Companys pension plans. The Company currently expects to contribute approximately $7.8 million to its defined benefit pension plan trusts in 2010, primarily in Canada. If return on plan assets is less than expected or if discount rates decline, plan contributions could increase significantly in 2011 and beyond. Net cash flow used by investing activities, which consists principally of cash paid for property additions, was $889.0 million in 2009, $1,546.0 million in 2008 and $1,686.4 million in 2007. Net cash flow used by investing activities declined in 2009 and 2008 because of reduced capital expenditures, partly offset by lower proceeds from the sale of property. Cash paid for property additions declined to $0.9 billion in 2009 from $1.6 billion in 2008 and $1.8 billion in 2007. The decline in capital expenditures was made possible by fewer competitive store openings, the near completion of Safeways Lifestyle rollout, and the condition of Safeways assets. In 2009, the Company opened eight new Lifestyle stores and completed 82 Lifestyle store remodels. The Company also completed ten other remodels. During 2008, Safeway invested $1.6 billion in capital expenditures. In 2008, the Company opened 20 new Lifestyle stores and completed 232 Lifestyle store remodels. The Company also completed 21 other remodels. During 2007, Safeway invested $1.8 billion in capital expenditures. In 2007, the Company opened 20 new Lifestyle stores, completed 253 Lifestyle remodels. In 2010, the Company expects to spend $0.9 billion to $1.0 billion in cash capital expenditures and to open approximately 20 new Lifestyle stores and to remodel approximately 80 stores into Lifestyle stores. Safeway expects to convert most of the remaining stores to Lifestyle stores over the next few years. Net cash flow used by financing activities was $1,600.3 million in 2009, $594.3 million in 2008 and $454.0 million in 2007. In 2009, Safeway paid down $599.5 million of debt, repurchased $884.9 million of common stock and paid $153.1 million of dividends. In 2008, the Company paid down $130.0 million of debt, repurchased $359.5 million of common stock and paid $132.1 million of dividends. In 2007, Safeway paid down $261.3 million of debt, repurchased $226.1 million of common stock and paid $111.5 million of dividends. Based upon the current level of operations, Safeway believes that net cash flow from operating activities and other sources of liquidity, including potential borrowing under Safeways commercial paper program and its credit agreement, will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, interest payments, dividend payments, stock repurchases, if any, and scheduled principal payments for the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance, however, that Safeways business will continue to generate cash flow at or above current levels or that the Company will maintain its ability to borrow under its commercial paper program and credit agreement. 27 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Free cash flow Free cash flow is calculated as net cash flow from operating activities, as adjusted to exclude payables related to third party gift cards, net of receivables, less net cash flow used by investing activities. Cash from the sale of third party gift cards is held for a short period of time and then remitted, less our commission, to card partners. Because this cash flow is temporary, it is not available for other uses, and it is therefore excluded from our calculation of free cash flow. Fiscal Year (in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Net cash flow from operating activities $ 2,549.7 $ 2,250.9 $ 2,190.5 Increase in payables related to third party gift cards, net of receivables (170.4 ) (23.9 ) (84.1 ) Net cash flow from operating activities, as adjusted 2,379.3 2,227.0 2,106.4 Net cash flow used by investing activities (889.0 ) (1,546.0 ) (1,686.4 ) Free cash flow $ 1,490.3 $ 681.0 $ 420.0 Free cash flow provides information regarding the cash that the Companys business generates, which management believes is useful to understanding the Companys business. Free cash flow is also a useful indicator of Safeways ability to service debt and fund share repurchases that management believes will enhance stockholder value. This non GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities or other increases and decreases in cash as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a measure of liquidity. Non GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and they should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of the Companys results as reported under GAAP. Other companies in the Companys industry may calculate free cash flow differently , limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, free cash flow should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Income taxes During 2009, the Company received tax refunds of $413 million as follows: (1) the Company accelerated certain tax deductions for its 2008 income tax returns resulting in approximately $224 million of tax refunds; and (2) the resolution of certain other income tax matters resulted in tax refunds of approximately $189 million. These tax refunds increased cash flow from operating activities by $396 million and reduced cash flow used by financing activities by $17 million. Bank Credit Agreement Information about the Companys bank credit agreement appears in Note D to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this report. 28 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES The computation of Adjusted EBITDA, as defined by the credit agreement, is provided below solely to provide an understanding of the impact that Adjusted EBITDA has on Safeways ability to borrow under the credit agreement. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities (which are determined in accordance with GAAP) and is not being presented as an indicator of operating performance or a measure of liquidity. Other companies may define Adjusted EBITDA differently and, as a result, such measures may not be comparable to Safeways Adjusted EBITDA (dollars in millions). 52 weeks2009 Adjusted EBITDA: Net loss $ (1,097.5 ) Add (subtract): Income taxes 144.2 Interest expense 331.7 Depreciation expense 1,171.2 Goodwill impairment charge 1,974.2 LIFO income (35.2 ) Stock option expense 57.4 Property impairment charges 73.7 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate (8.5 ) Dividend received from unconsolidated affiliate 5.8 Total Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,617.0 Adjusted EBITDA as a multiple of interest expense 7.89x Total debt at year end 2009 $ 4,901.7 Less cash and equivalents in excess of $75.0 at January 2, 2010 (396.5 ) Adjusted Debt $ 4,505.2 Adjusted Debt to Adjusted EBITDA 1.72x Shelf Registration On December 8, 2008, the Company filed a shelf registration statement (the Shelf) with the SEC which enables Safeway to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities and or common stock.

AND SUBSIDIARIES Stock Repurchase Program From the initiation of the Companys stock repurchase program in 1999 through the end of fiscal 2009, the aggregate cost of shares of common stock repurchased by the Company, including commissions, was approximately $4.7 billion, leaving an authorized amount for repurchases of approximately $1.3 billion. This includes an increase in the total authorized level of the repurchase program by $1.0 billion to $6.0 billion approved by the Board of Directors in December 2009. During fiscal 2009, Safeway repurchased approximately 42.5 million shares of its common stock under the repurchase program at an aggregate price, including commissions, of $884.9 million. The average price per share, excluding commissions, was $20.80. The Company will evaluate the timing and volume of future repurchases based on several factors, including market conditions, and may repurchase stock in the near or long term as circumstances warrant. Credit Ratings The senior long term and short term debt ratings and outlooks currently assigned to unsecured Safeway public debt securities by the rating agencies are as follows: Senior Long Term Short Term Outlook Fitch Ratings BBB F2 Stable Moodys Investors Services Baa2 P 2 Stable Standard & Poors BBB A 2 Stable Safeways ability to borrow under the credit agreement is not affected by Safeways credit ratings. Also, the Company maintains no debt which requires accelerated repayment based on the lowering of credit ratings. Pricing under the credit agreement is generally determined by the better of Safeways interest coverage ratio or credit ratings. Negative changes in the Companys credit ratings may have an adverse impact on financing costs and structure in future periods, such as the ability to participate in the commercial paper market and higher interest costs on future financings. Additionally, if Safeway does not maintain the financial covenants in its credit agreement, its ability to borrow under the credit agreement would be impaired. Investors should note that a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to withdrawal by the rating agency. Each credit rating should be evaluated independently. 31 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC.

Also excludes contributions under various multi employer pension plans, which totaled $278.1 million in 2009. Additionally, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits ($151.0 million at January 2, 2010) has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future tax settlements cannot be determined. (2) Required principal payments only. (3) Excludes common area maintenance, insurance or tax payments for which the Company is also obligated. In fiscal 2009, these charges totaled approximately $214.0 million. (4) See Part II, Item 7A to this report under the caption Commodity Price Risk. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Guarantees The Company is party to a variety of contractual agreements under which it may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters. These contracts primarily relate to the Companys commercial contracts, operating leases and other real estate contracts, trademarks, intellectual property, financial agreements and various other agreements. Under these agreements, the Company may provide certain routine indemnifications relating to representations and warranties (for example, ownership of assets, environmental or tax indemnifications) or personal injury matters. The terms of these indemnifications range in duration and may not be explicitly defined. Historically, Safeway has not made significant payments for these indemnifications. The Company believes that if it were to incur a loss in any of these matters, the loss would not have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. Letters of Credit The Company had letters of credit of $54.3 million outstanding at year end 2009. The letters of credit are maintained primarily to support performance, payment, deposit or surety obligations of the Company. The Company pays commissions ranging from 0.15% to 1.00% on the face amount of the letters of credit. New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted See Part II, Item 8, Note A to this report for new accounting pronouncements which have not yet been adopted by the Company. 32 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Safeway is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The Company has, from time to time, selectively used derivative financial instruments to reduce these market risks. The Company does not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes, nor does it utilize leveraged financial instruments. Safeways market risk exposures related to interest rates, foreign currency and commodity prices are discussed below and have not materially changed from the prior fiscal year. Interest Rate Risk Safeway manages interest rate risk through the use of fixed and variable interest rate debt and, from time to time, interest rate swaps. See Note E to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this report. The table below presents information on interest rate swaps at year end 2009 (dollars in millions): 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total Interest rate swaps Fixed to variable (1) $ 800.0 $ 800.0 Average pay rate 4.46% 4.46% Average receive rate 5.80% 5.80% (1) The fair value of the interest rate swaps at year end 2009 was a liability of $6.6 million. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Safeway is exposed to foreign currency risk, primarily through its operations in Canada. Certain transactions and the Companys net equity investment in Canada are exposed to economic losses in the event of adverse changes in the currency exchange rate. Currently, Safeway does not use derivative financial instruments to offset the risk of foreign currency. Commodity Price Risk Safeway has entered into fixed priced contracts to purchase electricity and natural gas for a portion of its energy needs. Safeway expects to take delivery of these commitments in the normal course of business, and as a result, these commitments qualify as normal purchases. See Part II, Item 7, under the caption Contractual Obligations for the Companys obligations related to fixed price energy contracts as of year end 2009. Long Term Debt The table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average rates by year of maturity for the Companys debt obligations at year end 2009 (dollars in millions): 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total Fair value Long term debt: (1) Principal $ 508.2 $ 502.8 $ 851.3 $ 1.4 $ 751.5 $ 1,773.9 $ 4,389.1 $ 4,729.1 Weighted average interest rate 4.96% 6.51% 5.46% 7.34% 6.04% 6.38% 5.99% (1) Primarily fixed rate debt. 33 Table of Contents SAFEWAY INC.
