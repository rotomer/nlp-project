Item 7.Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThe last three fiscal years consist of the 52 week period ended December 31, 2011 (fiscal 2011 or 2011), the 52 week period ended January 1, 2011 (fiscal 2010 or 2010) and the 52 week period ended January 2, 2010 (fiscal 2009 or 2009).Results of OperationsEconomic Outlook The current economic environment has made consumers cautious. This may have led to reduced consumer spending, to some consumers trading down to a less expensive mix of products and to some consumers trading down to discounters for grocery items, all of which impacts Safeways sales. These difficult economic conditions may continue in 2012.Safeway earned net income of $516.7 million ($1.49 per diluted share) in 2011, net income of $589.8 million ($1.55 per diluted share) in 2010 and a net loss of $1,097.5 million ($2.66 per diluted share) in 2009. Fiscal 2011 included a $98.9 million tax charge resulting from the decision to repatriate $1.1 billion from Safeways wholly owned Canadian subsidiary. Fiscal 2009 included a non cash goodwill impairment charge of $1,974.2 million ($1,818.2 million, net of tax). The impairment was due primarily to Safeways reduced market capitalization and a weak economy. The difficult economic environment negatively impacted all of Safeways divisions; however, due to their large goodwill balances, the goodwill impairment resulted primarily from the Vons and Eastern divisions.Sales Identical store sales increases (decreases) for the past three fiscal years were as follows: 201120102009Including fuel4.4%(0.7)%(5.0)%Excluding fuel1.0%(2.0)%(2.5)%Sales increased 6.3% to $43.6 billion in 2011 from $41.1 billion in 2010. Fuel sales increased $1,408.7 million in 2011, as a result of the average retail price per gallon of fuel increasing 23.8% and gallons sold increasing 16.5%. Additionally, the change in the Canadian dollar exchange rate resulted in a $240.0 million increase in sales. Identical store sales, excluding fuel, increased 1.0%, or $375 million, primarily due to inflation. Average transaction size increased during fiscal 2011, and transaction counts decreased slightly.Prior to 2011, Safeway recorded Blackhawk Network distribution commissions on the sale of certain gift cards, net of commissions shared with other retailers. In the first quarter of 2011, Safeway determined that these commissions should be reported on a gross basis. This change increased both revenue and cost of goods sold in fiscal 2011 by $413.5 million but had no impact on identical store sales, gross profit dollars or net income. Previously reported results are not adjusted because the impact is immaterial.From 2009 to 2010, sales increased 0.5% to $41.1 billion from $40.9 billion. The change in the Canadian dollar exchange rate resulted in a $588.1 million increase in sales. Additionally, fuel sales increased $499.2 million. The average retail price per gallon of fuel increased approximately 19% in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the increase in the cost of fuel. Identical store sales, excluding fuel, declined 2%, or $734.8 million, as a result of economic conditions, investments in price and deflation. This decline reflects a slight decrease in transaction counts and a decline in average transaction size during fiscal 2010. Store closures reduced sales by approximately $230 million.Gross Profit Gross profit represents the portion of sales revenue remaining after deducting the cost of goods sold during the period, including purchase and distribution costs. These costs include inbound freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs, warehouse inspection costs, warehousing costs and other costs associated with Safeways distribution network. Advertising and promotional expenses are also a component 21Table of ContentsSAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESof cost of goods sold. Additionally, all vendor allowances are classified as an element of cost of goods sold.Gross profit margin was 27.03% of sales in 2011, 28.28% of sales in 2010 and 28.62% in 2009.The gross profit margin decreased 125 basis points to 27.03% of sales in 2011 from 28.28% of sales in 2010. The impact from fuel sales decreased gross profit margin 80 basis points. The remaining 45 basis point decline was largely the result of a 53 basis point decline due to cost increases and investments in price, a 32 basis point decline from the change in the reporting for gift card commissions, a 16 basis point decline resulting from LIFO expense, partly offset by a 34 basis point improvement in shrink and a 13 basis point improvement from Blackhawk contributions.The gross profit margin decreased 34 basis points to 28.28% of sales in 2010 from 28.62% of sales in 2009. The impact from fuel sales decreased gross profit margin 27 basis points. The remaining seven basis point decline was largely the result of investments in everyday prices, partly offset by improvements in shrink.Vendor allowances totaled $2.9 billion in 2011, $2.9 billion in 2010 and $2.6 billion in 2009. Vendor allowances can be grouped into the following broad categories: promotional allowances, slotting allowances and contract allowances. Promotional allowances make up more than 95% of all allowances. With promotional allowances, vendors pay Safeway to promote their product. The promotion may be any combination of a temporary price reduction, a feature in print ads, a feature in a Safeway circular or a preferred location in the store. The promotions are typically one to two weeks long.Slotting allowances are a small portion of total allowances (approximately 3% of all allowances). With slotting allowances, the vendor reimburses Safeway for the cost of placing new product on the shelf. Safeway has no obligation or commitment to keep the product on the shelf for a minimum period.Contract allowances make up the remainder of all allowances. Under a typical contract allowance, a vendor pays Safeway to keep product on the shelf for a minimum period of time or when volume thresholds are achieved.Promotional and slotting allowances are accounted for as a reduction in the cost of purchased inventory and recognized when the related inventory is sold. Contract allowances are recognized as a reduction in the cost of goods sold as volume thresholds are achieved or through the passage of time.Operating and Administrative Expense Operating and administrative expense consists primarily of store occupancy costs and backstage expenses, which, in turn, consist primarily of wages, employee benefits, rent, depreciation and utilities.Operating and administrative expense was 24.43% of sales in 2011 compared to 25.45% of sales in 2010 and 25.33% in 2009.Operating and administrative expense margin decreased 102 basis points to 24.43% of sales in 2011 from 25.45% of sales in 2010. Higher fuel sales in 2011 decreased operating and administrative expense margin by 69 basis points. The impact from the change related to gift card commissions reduced operating and administrative expense 28 basis points, and net gains on property dispositions reduced operating and administrative expense 17 basis points.Operating and administrative expense margin increased 12 basis points to 25.45% of sales in 2010 from 25.33% of sales in 2009. Higher fuel sales in 2010 decreased operating and administrative expense margin by 31 basis points. The offsetting 43 basis point increase was primarily the result of higher labor costs, partly offset by net gains on property dispositions.Gain (Loss) on Property Dispositions Operating and administrative expense included a net gain on property 22Table of ContentsSAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESdispositions of $65.6 million in 2011, primarily consisting of a gain of $47.1 million on the sale of a distribution center in Burnaby, British Columbia. Operating and administrative expense included a net gain of $27.5 million in 2010 and a net loss of $12.7 million in 2009. Interest Expense Interest expense was $272.2 million in 2011, compared to $298.5 million in 2010 and $331.7 million in 2009. Interest expense decreased in 2011 and 2010 primarily due to a combination of lower average borrowings and a lower average interest rate.Other Income Other income consists primarily of interest income and equity in earnings (losses) from Safeways unconsolidated affiliate. Interest income was $6.7 million in 2011, $4.4 million in 2010 and $2.3 million in 2009. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate was $13.0 million in 2011, $15.3 million in 2010 and $8.5 million in 2009.Income Taxes Income tax expense was $363.9 million, or 41.3% of pre tax income, in 2011. In 2010, Safeway had income tax expense of $290.6 million, or 33.0% of pre tax income. Fiscal 2011 included a $98.9 million tax charge resulting from the decision to repatriate $1.1 billion from Safeways wholly owned Canadian subsidiary. In 2009, Safeway had income tax expense of $144.2 million despite having a pre tax loss of $953.3 million. The 2009 tax expense reflects the tax effect of the goodwill impairment charge which is largely nondeductible for income tax purposes and, therefore, increases the Companys effective income tax rate. The impact of the goodwill impairment charge on the tax expense was partly offset by a benefit of $74.9 million from the favorable resolution of various tax matters. Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesCritical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are important to the portrayal of Safeways financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Workers Compensation The Company is primarily self insured for workers compensation, automobile and general liability costs. It is the Companys policy to record its self insurance liability as determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported.Self insurance reserves are actuarially determined primarily by applying historical paid loss and incurred loss development trends to current cash and incurred expected losses in order to estimate total losses. We then discount total expected losses to their present value using a risk free rate of return.Any actuarial projection of self insured losses is subject to a high degree of variability. For example, self insurance expense was $151.1 million in fiscal 2011, $148.3 million in fiscal 2010 and $128.8 million in 2009. Litigation trends, legal interpretations, benefit level changes, claim settlement patterns and similar factors influenced historical development trends that were used to determine the current year expense and therefore contributed to the variability in annual expense. However, these factors are not direct inputs into the actuarial projection, and thus their individual impact cannot be quantified.The discount rate is a significant factor that has led to variability in self insured expenses. Since the discount rate is a direct input into the estimation process, we are able to quantify its impact. The discount rate, which is based on the United States Treasury Note rates for the estimated average claim life of five years, was 0.75% in 2011, 2.00% in 2010 and 2.75% in 2009. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate affects the self insured liability between $4 million and $5 million.The majority of the Companys workers compensation liability is from claims occurring in California. California workers compensation has received intense scrutiny from the states politicians, insurers, employers and providers, as well as the public in general. Recent years have seen escalation in the number of legislative reforms, judicial rulings and social phenomena affecting this business. Some of the many sources of 23Table of ContentsSAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESuncertainty in the Companys reserve estimates include changes in benefit levels, medical fee schedules, medical utilization guidelines, vocation rehabilitation and apportionment.Store Lease Exit Costs and Impairment Charges Safeway assesses store impairment quarterly. Safeways policy is to recognize losses relating to the impairment of long lived assets when expected net future cash flows are less than the assets carrying values. When stores that are under long term leases close, Safeway records a liability for the future minimum lease payments and related ancillary costs, net of estimated cost recoveries. In both cases, fair value is determined by estimating net future cash flows and discounting them using a risk adjusted rate of interest. The Company estimates future cash flows based on its experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located and, when necessary, uses real estate brokers. However, these estimates project future cash flows several years into the future and are affected by factors such as inflation, real estate markets and economic conditions.At any one time, Safeway has a portfolio of closed stores which is widely dispersed over several markets. While individual closed store reserves are likely to be adjusted up or down in the future to reflect changes in assumptions, the change to the total closed store reserve has not been nor is expected to be material.Employee Benefit Plans The Company recognizes in its balance sheet a liability for the underfunded status of its employee benefit plans. The Company measures plan assets and obligations that determine the funded status as of fiscal year end. Additional disclosures are provided in Note K to the consolidated financial statements, set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this report.The determination of Safeways obligation and expense for pension benefits is dependent, in part, on the Companys selection of certain assumptions used by its actuaries in calculating these amounts. These assumptions are disclosed in Note K to the consolidated financial statements and include, among other things, the discount rate, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rate of compensation increases. Actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the amount by which actual results differ from the actuarial assumptions is accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, affects recognized expense in such future periods. While Safeway believes its assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in actual results or significant changes in the Companys assumptions may materially affect Safeways pension and other postretirement obligations and its future expense.Safeway bases the discount rate on current investment yields on high quality fixed income investments. The discount rate assumption used to determine the year end projected benefit obligation is increased or decreased to be consistent with the change in yield rates for high quality fixed income investments for the expected period to maturity of the pension benefits. The discount rate used to determine 2011 pension expense was 5.6%. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. Expected return on pension plan assets is based on historical experience of the Companys portfolio and the review of projected returns by asset class on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed income indices, as well as target asset allocation. Safeways target asset allocation mix is designed to meet the Companys long term pension requirements. For 2011, the Companys assumed rate of return was 8.5% on U.S. pension assets and 6.8% on Canadian pension assets. For 2012, the Companys assumed rate of return is 7.75% on U.S pension assets and 6.75% on Canadian pension assets. Over the 10 year period ended December 31, 2011, the average rate of return was approximately 4% for U.S. and 5% for Canadian pension assets. The deteriorating conditions in the global financial markets during 2008 led to a substantial reduction in the 10 year average rate of return on pension assets. We expect that the markets will eventually recover to our assumed long term rate of return.24Table of ContentsSAFEWAY INC.

These audits may challenge certain of the Companys tax positions such as the timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of taxable income to various tax jurisdictions. The Company evaluates its tax positions and establishes liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. These tax uncertainties are reviewed as facts and circumstances change and are adjusted accordingly. This requires significant management judgment in estimating final outcomes. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates and could significantly affect the Companys effective tax rate and cash flows in future years. Note J to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this report provides additional information on income taxes.25Table of ContentsSAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESLiquidity and Financial ResourcesNet cash flow from operating activities was $2,023.6 million in 2011, $1,849.7 million in 2010 and $2,549.7 million in 2009. Net cash flow from operating activities increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to greater cash flow from working capital, partly offset by increased contributions to pension plans and lower net income. Blackhawk receives a significant portion of the cash inflow from the sale of third party gift cards late in the fourth quarter of the year and remits the majority of the cash, less commissions, to the card partners early in the first quarter of the following year. Changes in payables related to third party gift cards, net of receivables increased to a source of cash of $293.6 million in 2011 from a use of cash of $6.9 million in 2010, primarily as a result of the timing of certain vendor payments in 2010, higher revenue and a shift in the mix of business with longer payment terms.The decline in the financial markets during 2008 resulted in a substantial reduction in the fair value of the retirement plan assets. Since 2008, the financial markets improved. Despite the improvement, the projected benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of the plan assets in each of the last four years. As a result, cash contributions to pension and post retirement plans were $176.2 million and $17.7 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are expected to be approximately $160 million in 2012. If return on plan assets is less than expected, or if discount rates decline, plan contributions could increase significantly in 2012 and beyond.Net cash flow used by investing activities, which consists principally of cash paid for property additions, was $1,014.5 million in 2011, $798.8 million in 2010 and $889.0 million in 2009. Net cash flow used by investing activities increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily as a result of higher capital expenditures, partly offset by higher proceeds from the sale of property in 2011. Net cash flow used by investing activities declined in 2010 compared to 2009 due to higher proceeds from the sale of property in 2010. Cash paid for property additions increased to $1.1 billion in 2011 from $0.8 billion in 2010 and $0.9 billion in 2009. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to an increase in new store openings and the refurbishment of some in store pharmacies. In 2011, the Company opened 25 new Lifestyle stores and completed 29 Lifestyle store remodels. In 2010, the Company opened 14 new Lifestyle stores and completed 60 Lifestyle store remodels. In 2009, the Company opened eight new Lifestyle stores and completed 82 Lifestyle store remodels. In 2012, the Company expects to spend approximately $0.9 billion in cash capital expenditures.Net cash flow used by financing activities was $1,077.3 million in 2011, $768.1 million in 2010 and $1,600.3 million in 2009. In 2011, Safeway added $609.1 million of debt, repurchased $1,554.0 million of common stock and paid $188.0 million in dividends. In 2010, Safeway paid down $84.8 million of debt, repurchased $621.1 million of common stock and paid $168.1 million in dividends. In 2009, the Company paid down $599.5 million of debt, repurchased $884.9 million of common stock and paid $153.1 million in dividends.Based upon the current level of operations, Safeway believes that net cash flow from operating activities and other sources of liquidity, including potential borrowing under Safeways commercial paper program, its credit agreement, its term loan agreement and debt offerings, will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, interest payments, dividend payments, stock repurchases, if any, and scheduled principal payments for the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance, however, that Safeways business will continue to generate cash flow at or above current levels or that the Company will maintain its ability to borrow under its commercial paper program and credit agreements.26Table of ContentsSAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESFree cash flow Free cash flow is calculated as (1) net cash flow from operating activities adjusted to exclude payables related to third party gift cards, net of receivables, less (2) net cash flow used by investing activities adjusted to exclude cash used by investments and business acquisitions. Cash from the sale of third party gift cards is held for a short period of time and then remitted, less our commission, to card partners. Because this cash flow is temporary, it is not available for other uses, and it is therefore excluded from our calculation of free cash flow. We add back cash used by investments and business acquisitions to our calculation of free cash flow in order to provide a more accurate indication of our capacity to apply our available free cash flow to its intended uses.

Free cash flow is also a useful indicator of Safeways ability to service debt and fund share repurchases that management believes will enhance stockholder value.This non U.S. GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities or other increases and decreases in cash as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a measure of liquidity. Non U.S. GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and they should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of the Companys results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Other companies in the Companys industry may calculate free cash flow differently, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, free cash flow should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business.Income taxes During 2009, the Company received tax refunds of $413 million as follows: (1) the Company accelerated certain tax deductions for its 2008 income tax returns resulting in approximately $224 million of tax refunds; and (2) the resolution of certain other income tax matters resulted in tax refunds of approximately $189 million. These tax refunds increased cash flow from operating activities by $396 million and reduced cash flow used by financing activities by $17 million.27Table of ContentsSAFEWAY INC.

Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities (which are determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP) and is not being presented as an indicator of operating performance or a measure of liquidity.

AND SUBSIDIARIESStock Repurchase Program From the initiation of the Companys stock repurchase program in 1999 through the end of fiscal 2011, the aggregate cost of shares of common stock repurchased by the Company, including commissions, was approximately $6.9 billion, leaving an authorized amount for repurchases of approximately $1.1 billion. During fiscal 2011, Safeway repurchased approximately 76.1 million shares of its common stock under the repurchase program at an aggregate price, including commissions, of $1,588.2 million. This includes $34.2 million of common stock repurchases that were executed in fiscal 2011 but were settled in fiscal 2012. The average price per share, excluding commissions, was $20.85. Taking into consideration stock prices, low interest rates and managements belief regarding our potential to grow operating profit over the next several years, Safeway used the net proceeds from borrowings to repurchase common stock at an increased level during the fourth quarter of 2011. This level of purchases has continued in 2012. From year end 2011 through February 22, 2012, Safeway has purchased 28.7 million shares of its common stock at an average cost of $21.83 per share and a total cost of $626.2 million (including commissions). The timing and volume of future repurchases will depend on factors such as Safeways day to day business needs as well as its stock price and economic and market conditions. Stock repurchases may be affected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5 1 plan. The stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.Contractual Obligations The table below presents significant contractual obligations of the Company at year end 2011 (in millions) (1): 20122013201420152016ThereafterTotalLong term debt (2)$806.9$1.6$1,048.7$41.3$401.9$2,671.5$4,971.9Estimated interest on long term debt264.7218.4198.3164.1164.11,034.92,044.5Capital lease obligations (2),(3)29.229.129.630.930.5284.6433.9Interest on capital leases41.638.435.532.329.4148.0325.2Self insurance liability129.490.360.839.728.7122.0470.9Interest on self insurance liability0.51.01.11.11.010.114.8Operating leases (3)478.9452.2421.5370.8328.72,219.54,271.6Marketing development funds29.720.718.012.77.08.396.4Contracts for purchase of property, equipment and construction of buildings252.6252.6Fixed price energy contracts (4)85.718.418.416.60.76.0145.8Other purchase obligations80.321.97.32.5112.0Total$2,199.5$892.0$1,839.2$712.0$992.0$6,504.9$13,139.6 (1) Excludes funding of pension and post retirement benefit obligations which were $176.2 million in 2011.
