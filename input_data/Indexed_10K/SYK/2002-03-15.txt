ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations The table below outlines the components of the consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of net sales and the year to year percentage change in dollar amounts: Percentage of Net Sales Percentage Change 2001 2000 1999 2001/00 2000/99 Net sales 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 14% 9% Cost of sales: Before inventory step up 37.0 35.6 37.6 18 3 Inventory step up 9.4 Total cost of sales 37.0 35.6 47.0 18 (18) Gross profit 63.0 64.4 53.0 11 32 Research, development and engineering expenses 5.5 5.3 5.0 16 16 Selling, general and administrative expenses 37.9 38.7 38.4 11 10 Acquisition related and restructuring charges (credits) 0.9 Other expense (income) 4.0 5.8 7.2 (21) (13) Earnings before income taxes and extraordinary item 15.6 14.6 1.4 21 Income taxes 5.1 5.0 0.5 18 Earnings before extraordinary item 10.4 9.7 0.9 23 Extraordinary loss, net of income taxes (0.2) Net earnings 10.3% 9.7% 0.9% 21 The table below sets forth domestic/international and product line sales information: Net Sales (in millions) Percentage Change 2001 2000 1999 2001/00 2000/99 Domestic/international sales Domestic $1,688.4 $1,408.2 $1,228.4 20% 15% International 913.9 881.2 875.3 4 1 Total net sales $2,602.3 $2,289.4 $2,103.7 14 9 Product line sales Orthopaedic Implants $1,442.5 $1,313.0 $1,248.2 10 5 MedSurg Equipment 978.9 829.1 733.5 18 13 Physical Therapy Services 180.9 147.3 122.0 23 21 Total net sales $2,602.3 $2,289.4 $2,103.7 14 9 2001 Compared with 2000 Stryker Corporations net sales increased 14% in 2001 to $2,602.3 million from $2,289.4 million in 2000. Net sales grew by 12% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix; 3% related to higher selling prices; 1% as a result of acquired businesses; and 1% related to the inclusion of freight revenue in net sales in 2001. Freight revenue was recorded as an offset to cost of sales during 2000. These increases were partially offset by a 3% decline due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Companys domestic sales increased 20% in 2001 to $1,688.4 million from $1,408.2 million in 2000. The domestic sales gain is a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants, MedSurg Equipment and higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services. International sales increased 4% for the year to $913.9 million from $881.2 million in 2000 as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The impact of foreign currency comparisons on the dollar value of international sales was unfavorable by $62.1 million for the year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, international sales increased 11% in 2001. Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $1,442.5 million for 2001, representing an increase of 10% as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma and spinal implants. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 13% in 2001. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $978.9 million for 2001, representing an increase of 18% based on higher shipments of powered surgical instruments, endoscopic systems, hospital beds and stretchers and Leibinger craniomaxillofacial implants and image guided surgical systems. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 20% in 2001. Physical Therapy Services revenues were $180.9 million for 2001, representing an increase of 23% as a result of new physical therapy centers and higher revenue from existing centers. Cost of sales represented 37.0% of sales compared with 35.6% in 2000. The higher cost of sales percentage in 2001 resulted primarily from the change in recording of freight revenue described above and the classification of certain shipping costs as cost of sales in 2001 that had been reported in selling, general and administrative expenses in the prior year. The cost of sales percentage increased approximately 1.0% in 2001 as a result of the change in classification of freight revenue and shipping costs. Cost of sales for 2001 were also higher by approximately 0.4% due to an increase in unabsorbed manufacturing costs caused by the slowing of production in certain of the Companys manufacturing plants to reduce overall inventory levels. The Company continually assesses the overall capacity provided by its manufacturing plants relative to cost, inventory management and expected sales growth. A slight increase in Orthopaedic Implant margins was more than offset by higher sales and revenues of lower margin MedSurg Equipment products and Physical Therapy Services. Research, development and engineering expenses increased 16% in 2001 and represented 5.5% of sales compared with 5.3% in 2000. The increase in research, development and engineering spending in 2001 resulted from continued Company wide focus on new product development. New product introductions in 2001 included the Accolade Cemented Hip Stem, EIUS knee, T2 Intramedullary Nail System, Reflex Anterior Cervical Plate, Percutaneous Cement Delivery System, Elite Attachments for TPS, Cordless Driver II, Stryker Knee Navigation System, SDC Pro II surgical documentation system, 988 Digital Camera, Go Bed, Trio Mobile Surgery Platform and an enhanced Secure II bed. In the second quarter of 2001, the Company received marketing approval for its OP 1 Implant product in Australia and the European Union. The approved indication in Australia is for the treatment of nonunion of long bone fractures secondary to trauma for the purposes of initiating repair by new bone formation. The approved indication in Europe is for tibial nonunions of nine month duration, secondary to trauma, in skeletally mature patients, in cases where previous treatment with autograft has failed or use of autograft is unfeasible. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company was granted Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) status for OP 1 Implant by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The approved indication in the U.S. is for use as an alternative to autograft in recalcitrant long bone nonunions where use of autograft is unfeasible and alternative treatments have failed. Under the HDE, OP 1 Implant will be made available as a humanitarian device, defined by the FDA as one intended to benefit patients by treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects fewer than 4,000 individuals per year in the U.S. The first commercial sales of OP 1 in Australia began in mid May and the commercial launch of OP 1 in select markets of the European Union began in August. The first sales of OP 1 in the U.S. under the HDE began in November. T he commercial launch of OP 1 did not have a significant impact on sales in 2001 and the Company cannot predict the impact on sales in future years. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 11% in 2001 and represented 37.9% of sales compared with 38.7% in 2000. The classification of certain shipping costs as cost of sales in 2001 reduced selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales by approximately 0.4% in 2001. In addition, discount expense related to the accounts receivable securitization program, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses, declined to $5.8 million in 2001 from $7.1 million in 2000 as a result of lower discount rates. The Company recognized nonrecurring charges of $0.6 million in continuing operations relating to various acquisition related and restructuring events in the fourth quarter of 2001 and recognized nonrecurring acquisition related and restructuring credits of $1.0 million in 2000. The 2001 acquisition related and restructuring charges include $2.4 million of charges, partially offset by the reversal of prior year restructuring accruals totaling $1.8 million. The $2.4 million in 2001 charges includes a $0.9 million acquisition related charge for severance and related costs associated with the reorganization of the Companys sales structure in Italy to accommodate the integration of the business acquired from the Companys independent Italian distributor. The reorganization established a direct sales force in Italy that will distribute the Companys full product portfolio. The $0.9 million charge covers severance costs for three employees in Italy and costs to cancel contracts with discontinued agents. The reorganization of the sales structure in Italy is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2002. The 2001 charge also includes a $0.7 million charge related to the reorganization of the Companys distribution channels in Latin America and $0.8 million for severance costs for 10 employees in Europe. The $0.7 million charge reflects the cost to terminate a distributor and is based on contractual terms. Planned European workforce reductions are expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2002. The $1.8 million in credits includes $1.4 million related to a reduction in the expected costs to complete headcount reductions associated with the 2000 and 1999 reorganizations of the Companys European and Japanese distribution operations. The 2001 credits also include $0.4 million to reverse the remaining loss reserves established in Japan for discontinued ophthalmology inventories sold on a contingent basis in 1999. In 2000, the Company recognized nonrecurring credits of $1.0 million consisting of the reversal of prior year restructuring accruals totaling $7.0 million, partially offset by charges totaling $6.0 million. The $7.0 million in credits included $1.2 million related to the reorganization of Strykers distribution channels associated with the acquisition of Howmedica and $2.7 million to reverse reserves for a distributor reorganization that was charged to operations in 1996. The credits also included $2.7 million related to a reduction in the expected costs to complete headcount reductions in Japan and $0.4 million to reverse a portion of loss reserves established in Japan for discontinued ophthalmology inventories sold on a contingent basis in 1999. The $6.0 million in 2000 restructuring charges included a $4.0 million charge to cover severance costs for 95 employees, primarily in Europe; and $1.4 million for asset write offs, primarily for goodwill and inventory, and lease commitments associated with certain operations, principally in Europe, that were closed in the fourth quarter of 2000. The planned workforce reductions were completed in 2001, and the remaining amount of the reserve was reversed in 2001. The 2000 restructuring charges also included $0.6 million to terminate two small European distributors. Interest expense declined to $67.9 million in 2001 from $96.6 million in 2000, primarily as a result of lower outstanding debt balances. The increase in intangibles amortization to $38.4 million in 2001 from $34.7 million in 2000 relates primarily to business acquisitions during 2001 and the last half of 2000. Other income increased to $1.6 million in 2001 from other expense of $1.2 million in 2000, primarily as a result of foreign currency transaction gains in 2001 versus foreign currency transaction losses in 2000, partially offset by lower interest income. The effective income tax rate for 2001 was 33.0% compared with a 34.0% effective income tax rate in 2000. The decrease in the rate from 2000 to 2001 is attributable to the mix of operating results among the tax jurisdictions. Earnings before extraordinary item increased 23% to $271.8 million from $221.0 million in 2000; basic earnings per share before extraordinary item increased 22% to $1.38 in 2001 from $1.13 in 2000; and diluted earnings per share before extraordinary item increased 22% to $1.34 in 2001 from $1.10 in 2000. In December 2001, the Company refinanced and prepaid the remaining $642.7 million outstanding under the $1,650.0 million Senior Secured Credit Facilities established in 1998 in connection with the Howmedica acquisition. The prepayment of the 1998 Facilities resulted in the write off of related unamortized deferred loan costs of $7.1 million, which has been reflected as an extraordinary loss of $4.8 million (net of income taxes of $2.3 million; $.02 per basic and diluted share). Net earnings were $267.0 million (basic and diluted net earnings per share of $1.36 and $1.32, respectively) compared with $221.0 million (basic and diluted net earnings per share of $1.13 and $1.10, respectively) in 2000. 2000 Compared with 1999 Stryker Corporations net sales increased 9% in 2000 to $2,289.4 million from $2,103.7 million in 1999. Net sales grew by 9% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix; 1% related to higher selling prices; and 1% as a result of acquired businesses. These increases were partially offset by a 2% decline due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Companys domestic sales increased 15% in 2000 compared with 1999. The domestic sales gain is a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants, MedSurg Equipment and higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services. International sales increased 1% for the year as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The impact of foreign currency comparisons on the dollar value of international sales was unfavorable by $43.0 million for the year. Sales of discontinued products in 1999 were $7.7 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and discontinued products, international sales increased 7% in 2000. Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $1,313.0 million for 2000, representing an increase of 5% as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma and spinal implants. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 8% in 2000. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $829.1 million for 2000, representing an increase of 13% based on higher shipments of powered surgical instruments, endoscopic systems, hospital beds and stretchers and Leibinger craniomaxillofacial implants and image guided surgical systems. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and discontinued products, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 14% in 2000. Physical Therapy Services revenues were $147.3 million for 2000, representing an increase of 21% as a result of new physical therapy centers and higher revenues from existing centers. Cost of sales represented 35.6% of sales compared with 47.0% in 1999. The higher cost of sales percentage in 1999 resulted from $198.2 million of additional nonrecurring cost of sales for inventory sold in 1999 that was stepped up to fair value in connection with the acquisition of Howmedica, compared with no inventory step up included in 2000 cost of sales. Excluding the nonrecurring cost of sales charges for inventory step up, cost of sales would have declined from 37.6% of sales in 1999 to 35.6% in 2000. The decline is primarily the result of the realization of cost savings from cost reduction plans implemented at former Howmedica manufacturing plants and of slightly higher selling prices in 2000. Research, development and engineering expenses increased 16% in 2000 and represented 5.3% of sales compared with 5.0% in 1999. The increase in research, development and engineering spending in 2000 resulted from continued Company wide focus on new product development. New product introductions in 2000 included Crossfire Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene for Howmedica implants, the Scorpio TS Revision Knee System, Stryker Instruments TPS U2 drill, the Steri Shield T4 Personal Protection System, the Stryker Navigation System, the Antigrade/Retrograde intramedullary nail, the OPUS spinal system, resorbable craniomaxillofacial plates and screws and, in certain international markets, Simplex P bone cement with Tobramycin. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10% in 2000 and represented 38.7% of sales compared with 38.4% in 1999. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were comparable in both years after considering the inclusion of $7.1 million in 2000 and $0.6 million in 1999 of discount expense related to the accounts receivable securitization program established in November 1999. The Company recognized nonrecurring credits of $1.0 million in continuing operations relating to various acquisition related and restructuring events in the fourth quarter of 2000 and recognized nonrecurring acquisition related charges of $18.9 million in 1999. The 2000 acquisition related and restructuring credits include the reversal of prior year restructuring accruals totaling $7.0 million, partially offset by charges totaling $6.0 million. The $7.0 million in credits includes $1.2 million related to the reorganization of Strykers distribution channels associated with the acquisition of Howmedica and $2.7 million to reverse reserves for a distributor reorganization that was charged to operations in 1996. The credits also include $2.7 million related to a reduction in the expected costs to complete headcount reductions in Japan and $0.4 million to reverse a portion of loss reserves established for discontinued ophthalmology inventories sold on a contingent basis. Both of these credits represent the reversal of charges originally taken in connection with the 1999 reorganization of the Companys Japanese distribution operation and the discontinuance of distribution of ophthalmology products in Japan. The $6.0 million in 2000 restructuring charges includes a $4.0 million charge to cover severance costs for 95 employees, primarily in Europe. Approximately 10% of the planned workforce reductions were completed in December 2000, with the remaining reductions substantially completed in 2001. The 2000 restructuring charges also include $1.4 million for asset write offs, primarily for goodwill and inventory, and lease commitments associated with certain operations, principally in Europe, that were closed in the fourth quarter of 2000. The 2000 restructuring charges also include $0.6 million to terminate two small European distributors. In 1999, the Company recognized nonrecurring acquisition related charges of $18.9 million, consisting of $14.2 million to reorganize Strykers Japanese distribution operation and to discontinue the distribution of ophthalmology products in Japan and $4.7 million to complete the reorganization of Strykers distribution channels to accommodate the Howmedica integration. Interest expense declined to $96.6 million in 2000 from $122.6 million in 1999, primarily as a result of lower outstanding debt balances. The increase in intangibles amortization to $34.7 million in 2000 from $33.9 million in 1999 relates primarily to business acquisitions during 2000. Other income declined from $4.8 million in 1999 to other expense of $1.2 million in 2000 primarily as a result of foreign currency transaction losses. The effective income tax rate for 2000 was 34.0% compared with a 34.9% effective income tax rate in 1999. The decrease in the rate from 1999 to 2000 is attributable to the mix of operating results among the tax jurisdictions. Net earnings were $221.0 million (basic and diluted net earnings per share of $1.13 and $1.10, respectively) compared with $19.4 million (basic and diluted net earnings per share of $.10) in 1999. Excluding nonrecurring items in both years, net earnings in 2000 increased 37% to $220.3 million from $160.5 million in 1999; basic net earnings per share increased 36% to $1.13 in 2000 from $.83 in 1999; and diluted net earnings per share increased 36% to $1.10 in 2000 from $.81 in 1999. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys working capital at December 31, 2001 increased $80.1 million to $459.7 million from $379.6 million at December 31, 2000. The working capital increase is due primarily to the reduction in current maturities of long term debt of $134.3 million, partially offset by increases in income tax liabilities and accrued expenses. The reduction in current maturities of long term debt is due to the establishment of a new revolving credit facility (as described in more detail below) in December 2001, which does not require principal repayments in 2002. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding, excluding the effect of the securitization program, decreased 10 days to 59 days at the end of 2001 from 69 days at December 31, 2000. The lower days sales outstanding at December 31, 2001 is the result of improved collection efforts as well as an increase in the allowance for bad debts to provide for potential exposures in Latin America and Europe. Days sales in inventory decreased to 138 days at December 31, 2001 from 166 days at December 31, 2000. The lower days sales in inventory at December 31, 2001 is primarily the result of improved inventory management. The Company generated cash of $468.3 million from operations in 2001 compared with $331.8 million in 2000. The generation of cash in 2001 is the result of strong cash earnings (net earnings plus noncash adjustments) and increases in accrued expenses, income tax liabilities and accounts payable. These increases were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable, inventories and deferred charges and payments of $11.2 million attributable to acquisition related and restructuring charges and acquisition purchase liabilities. In 2001, the Company used cash of $161.9 million for capital expenditures, $43.0 million for business acquisitions and $15.7 million for the payment of dividends. Capital expenditures included $87.8 million to terminate a synthetic lease and purchase the Companys Mahwah, New Jersey, manufacturing and distribution facility. Business acquisitions include $27.2 million paid to Pfizer Inc., for final settlement of a working capital adjustment relating to the Howmedica purchase price. In December 2001, the Company established $1,000.0 million in Unsecured Credit Facilities. These Facilities replaced the $1,650.0 million Senior Secured Credit Facilities that were established in 1998 in conjunction with the acquisition of Howmedica. The Unsecured Credit Facilities include a $250.0 million 364 day revolving credit agreement and a $750.0 million five year, nonamortizing, revolving credit agreement. A total of $730.5 million was drawn under the new Credit Facilities, of which $642.7 million prepaid the debt outstanding under the 1998 Facilities and $87.8 million was used to terminate the Companys synthetic lease and purchase its Mahwah, New Jersey, manufacturing and distribution facility. In addition to the refinancing, the Company borrowed $205.3 million under credit facilities to fund cash flow needs at various times during 2001 and made repayments of $568.7 million against credit facilities during 2001. Total debt declined by $289.9 million during 2001. In November 1999, the Company established a securitization facility under which certain domestic accounts receivable are sold on an ongoing basis to a special purpose subsidiary that in turn may sell up to a $130.0 million interest in such receivables to a third party. The accounts receivable securitization facility was established to reduce the Companys overall cost of borrowing. The accounts receivable securitization facility provided $2.7 million of proceeds during 2001, with the program to date proceeds totaling $130.0 million as of December 31, 2001. The proceeds have been used to reduce the Companys long term debt. The Company had $50.1 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2001. The Company also had outstanding borrowings totaling $722.6 million at that date. Current maturities of long term debt at December 31, 2001 are $1.7 million and will decrease to $0.2 million in 2003 and $0.1 million in 2004. The Companys $250.0 million 364 day revolving credit agreement expires in December 2002 and is renewable at the Companys and the lenders discretion. The Companys $750.0 million five year, nonamortizing, revolving credit agreement expires in December 2006. The Company believes its cash on hand as well as anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund future operating and capital requirements and required debt repayments. Should additional funds be required, the Company had $346.2 million of additional borrowing capacity available under all of its existing credit facilities at December 31, 2001. Other Matters The Company finalized its plan to integrate Howmedica and Stryker in 1999. As the integration plan evolved and was implemented during 1999, the Company made certain adjustments to the purchase liabilities recorded in the preliminary purchase price allocation. The additional purchase liabilities recorded in connection with the acquisition of Howmedica totaled $126.5 million. At December 31, 2001, there were $4.1 million in additional purchase liabilities remaining to be paid out. Certain obligations, such as those related to lease commitments for facility closures, will result in payments extending to 2008. The Company distributes its products throughout the world. As a result, the Companys financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets. The Companys operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen and European currencies, in particular the euro and the British pound. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the dollar value of foreign currency sales declines. When the U.S. dollar weakens, the opposite situation occurs. The Company manufactures its products in the United States, France, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, Canada and Puerto Rico and incurs the costs to manufacture in the applicable local currencies. This worldwide deployment of factories serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the Companys cost of sales. The Company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk to the Company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products. The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies. At December 31, 2001, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $97.4 million and sell $72.1 million of various currencies (principally U.S. dollars and euros) with maturities principally ranging from 30 to 180 days. At December 31, 2000, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $82.7 million and sell $33.8 million of various currencies (principally U.S. dollars and euros) with maturities ranging from 30 to 180 days. The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month end spot rates as adjusted for amortized forward points. A hypothetical 10% change in exchange rates for these currencies would change the 2001 fair value by approximately $1.4 million and would have changed the 2000 fair value by approximately $1.6 million. The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its borrowings and the accounts receivable securitization facility. The Company manages the interest rate risk on its borrowings through interest rate swap agreements, which have fixed the base rate on a $550.0 million notional amount of the $717.2 million of variable rate borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2001. If market interest rates for similar borrowings had averaged 1% more than they did in 2001, the Companys 2001 interest expense, after considering the effects of its interest rate swaps, would have increased, and earnings before income taxes and extraordinary item would have decreased by $2.8 million. By comparison, if market interest rates had averaged 1% less than they did during 2001, the Companys 2001 interest expense, after considering the effects of its interest rate swaps, would have decreased, and earnings before income taxes and extraordinary item would have increased by $2.8 million. If market in terest rates for the accounts receivable securitization facility had averaged 1% more than they did in 2001, the Companys discount expense would have increased, and earnings before income taxes and extraordinary item would have decreased by $1.3 million. By comparison, if market interest rates had averaged 1% less than they did in 2001, the Companys discount expense would have decreased, and earnings before income taxes and extraordinary item would have increased by $1.3 million. These amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the Companys borrowing cost, interest rate swap agreements and accounts receivable securitization facility without any actions by management to mitigate its exposure to such changes. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on the above instruments, but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties. As of January 1, 2001, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by Statements No. 137 and No. 138. The Statements require the Company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings. If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The Companys interest rate swap agreements effectively convert a portion of its variable rate borrowings to a fixed rate basis through 2003, thus reducing the impact of changes in interest rates on future interest expense. Approximately 77% of the Companys outstanding variable rate borrowings as of December 31, 2001 have been hedged through the designation of interest rate swap agreements classified as cash flow hedges. Upon adoption of the Statements on January 1, 2001, the Company recognized a gain from the cumulative effect of an accounting change of $3.5 million in accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) related to the interest rate swap agreements. A loss of $22.0 million attributable to a decrease in the fair value of interest rate swap agreements was recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) in 2001. If in the future the interest rate swap agreements were determined to be ineffective, or were terminated before the contractual termination dates, or if it be came probable that the hedged variable cash flows associated with the variable rate borrowings would stop, the Company would be required to reclassify into earnings all or a portion of the unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss). Interest rate differentials to be paid or received as a result of interest rate swaps are recognized as an adjustment of interest expense related to the designated borrowings. Based on the maturities of the Companys interest rate swap agreements, interest expense for the year ending December 31, 2002 is expected to increase by $8.2 million through the recognition of amounts included as unrealized losses on cash flow hedges at December 31, 2001. The Company uses yen denominated floating rate borrowings to protect a portion of the value of its investment in its subsidiary in Japan. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from this hedge are not included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, but are recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) in stockholders equity. Net gains (losses) of $5.8 million, $7.7 million and ($7.4) million attributable to the yen denominated floating rate borrowings hedge were recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 141, Business Combinations and Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Statement No. 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. Statement No. 142 prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and requires the Company to evaluate these intangibles for impairment on an annual basis. It is effective for business combinations completed after June 30, 2001. The Company began applying the provisions of Statement No. 142 to acquisitions completed subsequent to June 30, 2001. The goodwill recorded as a result of those acquisitions is not being amortized. For goodwill and intangible assets arising from business combinations completed before July 1, 2001, the Company is required to apply the provisions of Statement No. 142 beginning on January 1, 2002. In accordance with the Statement provisions, an assembled workf orce intangible asset with an unamortized balance of $5.5 million will be reclassified from other intangibles to goodwill at that date. Application of the nonamortization provisions of the Statement in the year ending December 31, 2002 is expected to reduce intangibles amortization by approximately $16 million and increase net earnings by approximately $11 million ($.05 per diluted share). In the first quarter of 2002, the Company will perform the initial impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of January 1, 2002. The Company will test for impairment using the two step process prescribed in Statement No. 142. The first step is a screen for potential impairment. The second step, if necessary, measures the amount of the impairment. Any impairment charge resulting from these initial impairment tests will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of 2002. The Company has not yet determined what effect the tests will have on its consolidated results of operations or financial position. The Company will perform a subsequent impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2002 and then at least annually thereafter. As discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources, the Company established $1,000.0 million in Unsecured Credit Facilities in December 2001. These Facilities replaced the $1,650.0 million Secured Senior Credit Facilities that were established in 1998 in conjunction with the acquisition of Howmedica. Interest expense for 2002 is expected to be reduced by approximately $9 million as a result of the refinancing. As a result of changed conditions in the insurance industry, including less favorable experience factors within the orthopaedic industry, the Companys cost for insurance coverage will increase substantially in 2002. The increase in insurance premiums will offset the $9 million in interest expense savings from the December 2001 debt refinancing. ITEM 7A.
