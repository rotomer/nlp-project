ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations The table below outlines the components of the consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of net sales and the year to year percentage change in dollar amounts: Percentage of Net Sales Percentage Change 2002 2001 2000 2002/01 2001/00 Net sales 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 16% 14% Cost of sales 36.9 37.0 35.6 15 18 Gross profit 63.1 63.0 64.4 16 11 Research, development and engineering expenses 4.7 5.5 5.3 16 Selling, general and administrative expenses 38.7 37.9 38.7 18 11 Restructuring and acquisition related charges 0.6 Other expense (income) 2.3 4.0 5.8 (33) (21) Earnings before income taxes and extraordinary item 16.8 15.6 14.6 25 21 Income taxes 5.3 5.1 5.0 20 18 Earnings before extraordinary item 11.5 10.4 9.7 27 23 Extraordinary loss, net of income taxes (0.2) Net earnings 11.5% 10.3% 9.7% 29 21 The table below sets forth domestic/international and product line sales information: Net Sales (in millions) Percentage Change 2002 2001 2000 2002/01 2001/00 Domestic/international sales Domestic $1,973.7 $1,688.4 $1,408.2 17% 20% International 1,037.9 913.9 881.2 14 4 Total net sales $3,011.6 $2,602.3 $2,289.4 16 14 Product line sales Orthopaedic Implants $1,704.8 $1,447.2 $1,315.6 18 10 MedSurg Equipment 1,105.3 974.2 826.5 13 18 Physical Therapy Services 201.5 180.9 147.3 11 23 Total net sales $3,011.6 $2,602.3 $2,289.4 16 14 2002 Compared with 2001 Stryker Corporations net sales increased 16% in 2002 to $3,011.6 million from $2,602.3 million in 2001. Net sales grew by 11% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix; 3% related to higher selling prices; and 2% as a result of acquired businesses. Domestic sales were $1,973.7 million for 2002, representing an increase of 17% as a result of strong shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment and higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services. The July 1, 2002, acquisition of the Surgical Dynamics Inc. spinal implant business (SDI) from Tyco International Ltd. added $22.8 million to domestic sales for 2002. International sales were $1,037.9 million for 2002, representing an increase of 14% as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The acquisition of SDI added $2.5 million to international sales for 2002. The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $13.7 million for 2002. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, international sales increased 12% in 2002. Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $1,704.8 million for 2002, representing an increase of 18% as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma and spinal implants. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 17% in 2002. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $1,105.3 million for 2002, representing an increase of 13% as a result of higher shipments of powered surgical instruments, endoscopic systems, hospital beds and stretchers and Leibinger craniomaxillofacial implants and image guided surgical systems. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 13% in 2002. Physical Therapy Services revenues were $201.5 million for 2002, representing an increase of 11% as a result of new physical therapy centers and higher revenue from existing centers. Cost of sales represented 36.9% of sales compared with 37.0% in 2001. The slightly lower cost of sales percentage in 2002 is due to an increase in the absorption of fixed manufacturing costs caused by increased production at certain of the Companys manufacturing plants to meet current demand and higher sales growth for the higher margin Orthopaedic Implant products, offset partially by higher product obsolescence resulting from product launches. While research, development and engineering expenses in 2002 were consistent with prior year amounts, they decreased to 4.7% of sales from 5.5% in 2001. Research, development and engineering spending was affected in 2002 by the commercial launch of the osteogenic protein 1 (OP 1) product, which occurred in various markets in the second and fourth quarters of 2001. Following the launch, in 2002 Stryker Biotech recorded a greater proportion of its expenses as cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses, compared with 2001 when this division classified substantially all of its costs as research, development and engineering. Increased spending from the Companys continued focus on new product development partially offset the decreased research, development and engineering expenses related to Stryker Biotech. New product introductions in 2002 included ScorpioFlex knee for the United States market, Super Secur Fit Plus hip for the Japanese market, Trident Ceramic Acetabular Hip System in Canada, Xia II Spinal System, System 5 heavy duty, battery powered system, TPS Saber Drill, SDC Pro 2 surgical DVD documentation system, PainPump2, Precision System for percutaneous cement delivery, fluoroscopic software module for the Stryker Navigation System and Go Bed +. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 18% in 2002 and represented 38.7% of sales compared with 37.9% in 2001. The increase in selling, general and administrative expense is partially due to an increase in sales commission expense as a result of the 16% increase in net sales in 2002. In addition, the Company incurred an $8.9 million increase in insurance costs during 2002. The change in classification of certain Stryker Biotech expenses, as discussed above, also contributed to the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. Discount expense related to the accounts receivable securitization program, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses, declined to $2.7 million in 2002 from $5.8 million in 2001 as a result of lower discount rates. The Company recognized charges of $17.2 million in continuing operations ($11.5 million net of income taxes) relating to restructuring and acquisition related items in the third quarter of 2002 and restructuring and acquisition related charges of $0.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. The 2002 restructuring and acquisition related items include a charge of $21.0 million ($14.1 million net of income taxes) for employment related costs to close the Companys Rutherford, New Jersey manufacturing facility, partially offset by a credit of $3.8 million ($2.6 million net of income taxes) to reverse certain Howmedica restructuring and acquisition related costs to reflect actual final payments required. The $21.0 million restructuring charge relates to the shutdown agreement reached between the Company and the employee bargaining unit to close the Howmedica Osteonics implant manufacturing facility in Rutherford, New Jersey which was ratified by the members of the I.U.E. CWA Local 485 on August 23, 2002. Under the agreement, laid off employees will receive significantly more benefits than they would have under the Collective Bargaining Agreement that was set to expire on August 31, 2002. In addition, at least 80 qualified employees from the Rutherford facility will be offered employment at the new Howmedica Osteonics facility in Mahwah, New Jersey. The charge covers employment related severance costs for approximately 400 employees. The Company expects the Rutherford facility to be closed over the next 12 months with final severance payments to be made in 2004. As Howmedica Osteonics prepares to permanently cease manufacturing in Rutherford, it will transition production to its facilities in Mahwah, New Jersey as well as Cork and Limerick, Ireland. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recognized charges of $0.6 million in continuing operations related to various restructuring and acquisition related events. The 2001 restructuring and acquisition related charges included $2.4 million of charges, partially offset by the reversal of prior year restructuring accruals totaling $1.8 million. See the following comparison of 2001 results to 2000 results for additional information. Interest expense declined to $40.3 million in 2002 from $67.9 million in 2001, primarily as a result of lower outstanding debt balances. The decrease in intangibles amortization to $28.9 million in 2002 from $38.4 million in 2001 is primarily the result of the Companys adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which prohibits the amortization of goodwill. If the nonamortization provisions of Statement No. 142 had been applied in the prior year, amortization expense for 2001 would have been reduced by $18.1 million and net earnings would have increased by $12.1 million ($.06 per diluted share). Other expense was $0.5 million in 2002, compared with $1.6 million of other income in 2001 due to foreign currency transaction losses in the current year versus gains in the prior year, partially offset by higher interest income. The effective income tax rate was 31.8% in 2002 compared with 33.0% in 2001. The Companys effective income tax rate for the year was reduced from 33.0% to 31.8% in the fourth quarter of 2002, thereby reducing income tax expense by $6.1 million, primarily as a result of increased manufacturing in lower tax jurisdictions such as Ireland and Puerto Rico. Earnings before extraordinary item increased 27% to $345.6 million from $271.8 million in 2001; basic earnings per share before extraordinary item increased 27% to $1.75 in 2002 from $1.38 in 2001; and diluted earnings per share before extraordinary item increased 27% to $1.70 in 2002 from $1.34 in 2001. In December 2001, the Company refinanced and prepaid the remaining $642.7 million outstanding under the $1,650.0 million Senior Secured Credit Facilities established in 1998 in connection with the Howmedica acquisition. The prepayment of the 1998 Facilities resulted in the write off in 2001 of related unamortized deferred loan costs of $7.1 million, which was reflected as an extraordinary loss of $4.8 million (net of income taxes of $2.3 million; $.02 per basic and diluted share). Net earnings were $345.6 million (basic and diluted net earnings per share of $1.75 and $1.70, respectively) compared with $267.0 million (basic and diluted net earnings per share of $1.36 and $1.32, respectively) in 2001. Excluding nonrecurring items that include the impact of the restructuring and acquisition related items on 2002 and 2001 and the impact of the change in goodwill amortization and the extraordinary loss on 2001, net earnings in 2002 were $357.1 million, representing a 26% increase over net earnings of $284.3 million in 2001. Diluted net earnings per share increased 25% to $1.75 compared with $1.40 in 2001. The reconciliations, including related earnings per share amounts, of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings before nonrecurring items are as follows: Years ended December 31 (in millions) 2002 2001 % Change Reported net earnings $345.6 $267.0 29 Restructuring and acquisition related items 11.5 0.4 Goodwill and assembled workforce amortization 12.1 Extraordinary loss 4.8 Adjusted net earnings before nonrecurring items $357.1 $284.3 26 Basic net earnings per share: Reported basic net earnings per share $1.75 $1.36 29 Restructuring and acquisition related items $.06 Goodwill and assembled workforce amortization $.06 Extraordinary loss $.02 Adjusted basic net earnings per share before nonrecurring items $1.81 $1.45 25 Diluted net earnings per share: Reported diluted net earnings per share $1.70 $1.32 29 Restructuring and acquisition related items $.06 Goodwill and assembled workforce amortization $.06 Extraordinary loss $.02 Adjusted diluted net earnings per share before nonrecurring items $1.75 $1.40 25 2001 Compared with 2000 Stryker Corporations net sales increased 14% in 2001 to $2,602.3 million from $2,289.4 million in 2000. Net sales grew by 12% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix; 3% related to higher selling prices; 1% as a result of acquired businesses; and 1% related to the inclusion of freight revenue in net sales in 2001. Freight revenue was recorded as an offset to cost of sales during 2000. These increases were partially offset by a 3% decline due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Companys domestic sales increased 20% in 2001 to $1,688.4 million from $1,408.2 million in 2000. The domestic sales gain was the result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants, MedSurg Equipment and higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services. International sales increased 4% for the year to $913.9 million from $881.2 million in 2000 as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The impact of foreign currency comparisons on the dollar value of international sales was unfavorable by $62.1 million for the year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, international sales increased 11% in 2001. Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $1,447.2 million for 2001, representing an increase of 10% as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma and spinal implants. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 13% in 2001. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $974.2 million for 2001, representing an increase of 18% based on higher shipments of powered surgical instruments, endoscopic systems, hospital beds and stretchers and Leibinger craniomaxillofacial implants and image guided surgical systems. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 20% in 2001. Physical Therapy Services revenues were $180.9 million for 2001, representing an increase of 23% as a result of new physical therapy centers and higher revenue from existing centers. Cost of sales represented 37.0% of sales compared with 35.6% in 2000. The higher cost of sales percentage in 2001 resulted primarily from the change in recording of freight revenue described above and the classification of certain shipping costs as cost of sales in 2001 that had been reported in selling, general and administrative expenses in the prior year. The cost of sales percentage increased approximately 1.0% in 2001 as a result of the change in classification of freight revenue and shipping costs. Cost of sales for 2001 was also higher by approximately 0.4% due to an increase in unabsorbed manufacturing costs caused by the slowing of production in certain of the Companys manufacturing plants to reduce overall inventory levels. The Company continually assesses the overall capacity provided by its manufacturing plants relative to cost, inventory management and expected sales growth. A slight increase in Orthopaedic Implant margins was more than offset by higher sales and revenues of lower margin MedSurg Equipment products and Physical Therapy Services. Research, development and engineering expenses increased 16% in 2001 and represented 5.5% of sales compared with 5.3% in 2000. The increase in research, development and engineering spending in 2001 resulted from continued Company wide focus on new product development. New product introductions in 2001 included the Accolade Cemented Hip Stem, EIUS knee, T2 Intramedullary Nail System, Reflex Anterior Cervical Plate, Percutaneous Cement Delivery System, Elite Attachments for TPS, Cordless Driver II, Stryker Knee Navigation System, SDC Pro 2 surgical documentation system, 988 Digital Camera, Go Bed, Trio Mobile Surgery Platform and an enhanced Secure II bed. In the second quarter of 2001, the Company received marketing approval for its OP 1 product in Australia and the European Union. The approved indication in Australia was for the treatment of nonunion of long bone fractures secondary to trauma for the purposes of initiating repair by new bone formation. The approved indication in Europe was for tibial nonunions of nine month duration, secondary to trauma, in skeletally mature patients, in cases where previous treatment with autograft has failed or use of autograft is unfeasible. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company was granted Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) status for OP 1 by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The approved indication in the United States was for use as an alternative to autograft in recalcitrant long bone nonunions where use of autograft is unfeasible and alternative treatments have failed. Under the HDE, OP 1 has been made available as a humanitarian device, defined by the FDA as one intended to benefit patients by treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects fewer than 4,000 individuals per year in the United States The first commercial sales of OP 1 in Australia began in mid May 2001 and the commercial launch of OP 1 in select markets of the European Union began in August. The first sales of OP 1 in the United States under the HDE began in November. The commercial launch of OP 1 did not have a significant impact on sales in 2001. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 11% in 2001 and represented 37.9% of sales compared with 38.7% in 2000. The classification of certain shipping costs as cost of sales in 2001 reduced selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales by approximately 0.4% in 2001. In addition, discount expense related to the accounts receivable securitization program, which was included in selling, general and administrative expenses, declined to $5.8 million in 2001 from $7.1 million in 2000 as a result of lower discount rates. The Company recognized charges of $0.6 million in continuing operations relating to various restructuring and acquisition related events in the fourth quarter of 2001 and recognized restructuring and acquisition related credits of $1.0 million in 2000. The 2001 restructuring and acquisition related charges include $2.4 million of charges, partially offset by the reversal of prior year restructuring accruals totaling $1.8 million. The $2.4 million in 2001 charges included a $0.9 million acquisition related charge for severance and related costs associated with the reorganization of the Companys sales structure in Italy to accommodate the integration of the business acquired from the Companys independent Italian distributor. The reorganization established a direct sales force in Italy that distributes the Companys full product portfolio. The $0.9 million charge covered severance costs for three employees in Italy and costs to cancel contracts with discontinued agents. The reorganization of the sales structure in Italy was completed in the first quarter of 2002. The 2001 charge also included a $0.7 million charge related to the reorganization of the Companys distribution channels in Latin America and $0.8 million for severance costs for 10 employees in Europe. The $0.7 million charge reflected the cost to terminate a distributor and was based on contractual terms. Planned European workforce reductions were completed in the first quarter of 2002. The $1.8 million in credits included $1.4 million related to a reduction in the expected costs to complete headcount reductions associated with the 2000 and 1999 reorganizations of the Companys European and Japanese distribution operations. The 2001 credits also included $0.4 million to reverse the remaining loss reserves established in Japan for discontinued ophthalmology inventories sold on a contingent basis in 1999. In 2000, the Company recognized credits of $1.0 million, consisting of the reversal of prior year restructuring accruals totaling $7.0 million, partially offset by charges totaling $6.0 million. The $7.0 million in credits included $1.2 million related to the reorganization of Strykers distribution channels associated with the acquisition of Howmedica and $2.7 million to reverse reserves for a distributor reorganization that was charged to operations in 1996. The credits also included $2.7 million related to a reduction in the expected costs to complete headcount reductions in Japan and $0.4 million to reverse a portion of loss reserves established in Japan for discontinued ophthalmology inventories sold on a contingent basis in 1999. The $6.0 million in 2000 restructuring charges included a $4.0 million charge to cover severance costs for 95 employees, primarily in Europe; $1.4 million for asset write offs, primarily for goodwill and inventory, and lease commitments associated with certain operations, principally in Europe, that were closed in the fourth quarter of 2000. The planned workforce reductions were completed in 2001, and the remaining amount of the reserve was reversed in 2001. The 2000 restructuring charges also included $0.6 million to terminate two small European distributors. Interest expense declined to $67.9 million in 2001 from $96.6 million in 2000, primarily as a result of lower outstanding debt balances. The increase in intangibles amortization to $38.4 million in 2001 from $34.7 million in 2000 related primarily to business acquisitions during 2001 and the second half of 2000. Other income increased to $1.6 million in 2001 from other expense of $1.2 million in 2000, primarily as a result of foreign currency transaction gains in 2001 versus foreign currency transaction losses in 2000, partially offset by lower interest income. The effective income tax rate for 2001 was 33.0% compared with a 34.0% effective income tax rate in 2000. The decrease in the rate from 2000 to 2001 was attributable to the mix of operating results among the tax jurisdictions. Earnings before extraordinary item increased 23% to $271.8 million in 2001 from $221.0 million in 2000; basic earnings per share before extraordinary item increased 22% to $1.38 in 2001 from $1.13 in 2000; and diluted earnings per share before extraordinary item increased 22% to $1.34 in 2001 from $1.10 in 2000. In December 2001, the Company refinanced and prepaid the remaining $642.7 million outstanding under the $1,650.0 million Senior Secured Credit Facilities established in 1998 in connection with the Howmedica acquisition. The prepayment of the 1998 Facilities resulted in the write off of related unamortized deferred loan costs of $7.1 million, which was reflected as an extraordinary loss of $4.8 million (net of income taxes of $2.3 million; $.02 per basic and diluted share). Net earnings were $267.0 million (basic and diluted net earnings per share of $1.36 and $1.32, respectively) compared with $221.0 million (basic and diluted net earnings per share of $1.13 and $1.10, respectively) in 2000. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys working capital at December 31, 2002 decreased $15.9 million to $443.8 million from $459.7 million at December 31, 2001. The working capital decrease is due primarily to lower cash balances, additional liabilities resulting from restructuring and acquisition related items recorded during 2002 and increases in other accrued liabilities, partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories. The additional liabilities from restructuring and acquisition related items is the result of the aforementioned pending closure of the Companys Rutherford, New Jersey manufacturing facility. Other accrued liabilities increased in 2002 as a result of higher obligations for third party sales agent commissions, third party royalties, non income based taxes and general increases in other accrued liabilities. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding, excluding the effect of the Companys $130.0 million accounts receivable securitization program, decreased 1 day to 58 days at December 31, 2002 from 59 days at December 31, 2001. The lower days sales outstanding at December 31, 2002 is the result of improved collection efforts as well as an increase in the allowance for bad debts to provide for potential exposures in Europe and Latin America. Days sales in inventory decreased 12 days to 126 days at December 31, 2002 from 138 days at December 31, 2001. The lower days sales in inventory is primarily the result of improved inventory management and higher provisions for product obsolescence as a result of product launches. The Company generated cash of $503.9 million from operations in 2002 compared with $468.3 million in 2001. The generation of cash in 2002 is the result of strong cash earnings (net earnings plus noncash adjustments) and increases in accrued expenses and income tax liabilities and decreases in the accounts receivable and inventory days mentioned previously. These items were partially offset by increases in deferred charges and accounts receivable from increased sales and payments of $8.4 million attributable to restructuring and acquisition related liabilities and acquisition purchase liabilities. In 2002, the Company used cash of $173.6 million for business and product line acquisitions, $139.0 million for capital expenditures and $19.7 million for the payment of dividends. Business and product line acquisitions include $135.0 million paid to Tyco International Ltd. in the third quarter to acquire SDI, $14.0 million paid to Curis, Inc. to eliminate all royalties payable on future sales of OP 1 and $10.0 million paid to Pain Concepts, Inc. to acquire the DEKOMPRESSOR product line (as further discussed in Other Matters). In addition to the borrowings used to fund business and product line acquisitions, the Company borrowed an additional $438.0 million under its existing credit facilities to fund cash flow needs during 2002 and made repayments of $836.6 million against the credit facilities. Total borrowings declined by $220.9 million after adjusting for the effect of foreign currency translation. In 2002, the Company used cash of $139.0 million for capital expenditures, including $17.9 million related to the construction of Phase II of the Companys Mahwah, New Jersey manufacturing and distribution facility. In addition, the Company spent $14.3 million for the expansion of the Companys Cork, Ireland manufacturing facility and $8.8 million for improvements to the Companys newly leased Endoscopy manufacturing facility in San Jose, California. The Company had $37.8 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2002. The Company also had outstanding borrowings totaling $501.7 million at that date. Current maturities of long term debt at December 31, 2002 are $10.7 million and will decrease to $0.2 million in 2004 and $0.2 million in 2005. The Companys $250.0 million 364 day revolving credit agreement expires in December 2003 and is renewable at the Companys and the lenders discretion. The Companys $750.0 million five year, nonamortizing, revolving credit agreement expires in December 2006. The Company believes its cash on hand as well as anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund future operating and capital requirements and required debt repayments. Should additional funds be required, the Company had $589.8 million of additional borrowing capacity available under all of its existing credit facilities at December 31, 2002. The Companys future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than one year are summarized as follows: Payment Period 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter Long term debt $10.7 $0.2 $0.2 $487.1 $0.2 $3.3 Operating leases 40.0 31.5 22.7 16.8 13.4 45.3 The Companys additional borrowing capacity, along with the expected expiration period of the commitments, are summarized as follows: Amount of Commitment Total Expiration Per Period Amount Less than In excess of Committed 1 year 1 year Lines of credit $581.6 $326.1 $255.5 Standby letters of credit 8.2 8.2 Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. On an on going basis, management evaluates these estimates. Estimates are based on historical experience, when available, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes that an understanding of the following critical accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Inventory Reserves: The Company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. The markets in which the Company operates are highly competitive, with new products and surgical procedures introduced on an on going basis. Such marketplace changes may cause the Companys products to become obsolete. The Company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. Income Taxes: The Company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States. Accordingly, management must determine the appropriate allocation of income in accordance with local law for each of these jurisdictions. Tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues that may arise require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates. The Company believes its income tax accruals are adequate to cover exposures related to such potential changes in income allocation between tax jurisdictions. To the extent additional information becomes available, such accruals are adjusted to reflect revised probable outcomes. Impairment of Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangibles: The Company follows the provisions of FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in determining the amount, if any, by which the Companys goodwill may be impaired in value. The Company uses the two step process prescribed in Statement No. 142. The first step is a screen for potential impairment. The second step, if necessary, measures the amount of the impairment. Inherent in the two step process are certain assumptions and estimates necessary to determine fair values for reportable units, as defined in Statement No. 142. Should actual results or changes in future expectations differ from those projected by management, goodwill impairment charges may be required which could unfavorably affect future operating results. See Other Matters for further discussion regarding the adoption of Statement No. 142. Other Matters The Company distributes its products throughout the world. As a result, the Companys financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets. The Companys operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the United States dollar and the Japanese yen and European currencies, particularly the euro and the British pound. When the United States dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the dollar value of foreign currency sales declines. When the United States dollar weakens, the opposite situation occurs. The Company manufactures its products in the United States, France, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, Canada and Puerto Rico and incurs the costs to manufacture in the applicable local currencies. This worldwide deployment of factories serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the Companys cost of sales. The Company has certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged that are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currencies. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the strengthening of foreign currencies increased the value of these investments in net assets by $79.4 million. This gain reduced the previously recorded cumulative loss from weakening of foreign currencies that is deferred and recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity. As of January 1, 2001, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by Statements No. 137 and No. 138. The Statements require the Company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings. If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The Company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk to the Company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products. The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies. At December 31, 2002, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $82.0 million and sell $97.7 million of various currencies (principally United States dollars and euros) with maturities ranging principally from 30 to 180 days. At December 31, 2001, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $97.4 million and sell $72.1 million of various currencies (principally United States dollars and euros) with maturities ranging principally from 30 to 180 days. The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month end spot rates as adjusted for amortized forward points. A hypothetical 10% change in exchange rates for these currencies would change the 2002 fair value by approximately $0.5 million and would have changed the 2001 fair value by approximately $1.4 million. The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its borrowings and the accounts receivable securitization facility. The Company manages the interest rate risk on its borrowings through interest rate swap agreements, which have fixed the base rate on a $250.0 million notional amount of the $486.9 million of variable rate borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2002. If market interest rates for similar borrowings had averaged 1% more than they did in 2002, the Companys 2002 interest expense, after considering the effects of its interest rate swaps, would have increased, and earnings before income taxes would have decreased by $1.1 million. By comparison, if market interest rates had averaged 1% less than they did during 2002, the Companys 2002 interest expense, after considering the effects of its interest rate swaps, would have decreased, and earnings before income taxes would have increased by $1.1 million. If market interest rates for the accounts receivable securitization facility had averaged 1% more than they did in 2002, the Companys discount expense would have increased, and earnings before income taxes would have decreased by $1.3 million. By comparison, if market interest rates had averaged 1% less than they did in 2002, the Companys discount expense would have decreased, and earnings before income taxes would have increased by $1.3 million. These amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the Companys borrowing cost, interest rate swap agreements and accounts receivable securitization facility without any actions by management to mitigate its exposure to such changes. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on the above instruments, but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties. The Companys interest rate swap agreements effectively convert a portion of its variable rate borrowings to a fixed rate basis through 2003, thus reducing the impact of changes in interest rates on future interest expense. Approximately 51% of the Companys outstanding variable rate borrowings as of December 31, 2002 have been hedged through the designation of interest rate swap agreements classified as cash flow hedges. A gain of $9.3 million attributable to changes in the fair value of interest rate swap agreements was recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) in 2002. If in the future the interest rate swap agreements were determined to be ineffective or were terminated before the contractual termination dates, or if it became probable that the hedged variable cash flows associated with the variable rate borrowings would stop, the Company would be required to reclassify into earnings all or a portion of the unrealized losses on cash flow hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss). Interest rate differentials to be paid or received as a result of interest rate swaps are recognized as an adjustment of interest expense related to the designated borrowings. Based on the maturities of the Companys interest rate swap agreements, interest expense for the year ending December 31, 2003 is expected to be $9.2 million higher than the interest cost on the variable rate borrowings through the recognition of amounts included as unrealized losses on cash flow hedges at December 31, 2002. The Company uses yen denominated floating rate borrowings to protect a portion of the value of its investment in its subsidiary in Japan. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from this hedge are not included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, but are recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) in stockholders equity. Net gains (losses) of ($1.6) million, $5.8 million and $7.7 million attributable to the yen denominated floating rate borrowings hedge were recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. As of January 1, 2002, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, related to acquisitions completed before July 1, 2001. Statement No. 142 prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and requires the Company to evaluate these intangibles for impairment on an annual basis. In accordance with the Statements provisions, an assembled workforce intangible asset with an unamortized balance of $5.5 million as of January 1, 2002 was reclassified from other intangibles to goodwill. In the first quarter of 2002, the Company completed the initial impairment test of goodwill and, in the fourth quarter of 2002, completed the required annual impairment test of goodwill as prescribed by Statement No. 142, and determined that recorded goodwill was not impaired and no goodwill write down was necessary. In October 2002, the Company purchased the DEKOMPRESSOR product line from Pain Concepts, Inc., at a total cost of $10.0 million giving the Company access to intellectual property and other commercial rights relating to the design and manufacture of certain medical devices. Intangible assets acquired, principally patents, are being amortized over 17 years. The Company is contingently liable for potential future milestone payments of up to $42.5 million, primarily based on future sales growth over the next five years. On October 1, 2002, the Company entered into an agreement with Curis, Inc., which eliminated all royalties payable to Curis relating to future Stryker sales of OP 1. Under terms of the agreement, the Company made a one time cash payment of $14.0 million to Curis. The payment was allocated to existing patents and is being amortized over 15 years. On July 1, 2002, the Company acquired SDI from Tyco International Ltd., for $135.0 million in cash. The acquisition expands the Companys spinal product line by adding interbody spinal cages for the United States market as well as other thoracolumbar and cervical spinal fixation devices. The acquisition was funded using existing credit facilities. The acquisition of SDI was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The results of operations for the acquired business are included in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements beginning July 1, 2002. The acquisition of SDI added $25.3 million to the Companys sales for the second half of 2002. SDI had sales of $55.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 and sales of $33.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2002. The purchase price of $135.0 million in cash and liabilities assumed has been preliminarily allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. Based on the preliminary purchase price allocation, $87.1 million of the purchase price was allocated to patent licensing agreements to be amortized over their remaining life of 8 years, $12.4 million to inventory, $38.0 million to deferred tax assets related to future tax deductions, $5.1 million to other tangible assets and $7.6 million to liabilities assumed. Immediately after the acquisition was consummated, management of the Company began to implement an integration plan to combine Stryker and SDI. In conjunction with the integration plan, the Company has recorded additional purchase liabilities of $3.6 million, which were included in the preliminary purchase price allocation. The additional purchase liabilities include $3.1 million for severance and related costs and $0.5 million for contractual obligations. The severance and related costs are provided for workforce reductions covering 37 SDI employees. The workforce reductions were completed during the fourth quarter of 2002 with severance payments to be made through the third quarter of 2003. The Companys pro forma consolidated financial results did not differ significantly as a result of the SDI acquisition. In July 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. The Statement addresses the timing of recognition and the related measurement of the costs of one time termination benefits such as those associated with the closing of the Rutherford facility. Under the provisions of Statement No. 146, the employment related closing costs for Rutherford would be recognized over the 12 month closing period. Statement No. 146 is effective for exit activities initiated after December 31, 2002, with early application allowed. The Company initiated the actions related to Rutherford in June 2002 and did not adopt the provisions of Statement No. 146 when recording the costs of the Rutherford closing. Accordingly, the actual employment related costs of the closing were expensed, upon union approval of the shutdown agreement, in the third quarter of 2002. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. Interpretation No. 45 changes current practice in accounting for, and disclosure of, guarantees. Interpretation No. 45 will require that certain guarantees be recorded as liabilities at fair value on the Companys balance sheet. Current practice requires that liabilities related to guarantees be recorded only when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, as those terms are defined in FASB Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. Interpretation No. 45 also requires a guarantor to make significant new disclosures, even when the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee is remote, which is another change from current practice. The disclosure requirements of Interpretation No. 45 are effective immediately and are included in Note 14, "Contingencies" to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The initial recognition and measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The Company has not yet determined what effect, if any, the new recognition and measurement provisions will have on the Companys future financial results. In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. Statement No. 148 amends Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, Statement No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of Statement No. 123 to require disclosure in interim financial statements regarding the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The Company does not intend to adopt a fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation until a final standard is issued by the FASB that addresses concerns related to applicability of current option pricing models to non exchange traded employee stock option plans.
