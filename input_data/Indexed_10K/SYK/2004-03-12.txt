ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Level Overview Stryker Corporation (the "Company" or "Stryker") is a leader in the worldwide orthopaedic market and is one of the worlds largest medical device companies. Stryker delivers results through a wide range of capabilities including joint replacements, trauma, spine and micro implant systems, orthobiologics, powered surgical instruments, surgical navigation systems and endoscopic products as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. Stryker also provides outpatient physical therapy services in the United States. The Company segregates its operations into two reportable business segments: Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The Orthopaedic Implants segment sells orthopaedic reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma and spinal implants, bone cement and the bone growth factor osteogenic protein 1 (OP 1). The MedSurg Equipment segment sells powered surgical instruments, endoscopic products, hospital beds and stretchers and micro implant and surgical navigation systems. Other includes Physical Therapy Services and corporate administration, interest expense and interest income. Domestic sales accounted for 64% of total revenues in 2003. Most of the Companys products are marketed directly to more than 6,000 hospitals and to doctors and other health care facilities by approximately 2,100 sales and marketing personnel in the United States. Stryker primarily maintains separate and dedicated sales forces for each of its principal product lines to provide focus and a high level of expertise to each medical specialty served. International sales accounted for 36% of total revenues in 2003. The Companys products are sold in more than 100 countries through more than 1,900 local dealers and direct sales efforts. Local dealer support and direct sales are coordinated by approximately 1,900 sales and marketing personnel. Stryker distributes its products through sales subsidiaries and branches with offices located in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. Stryker exports products to dealers and to customers in Africa, Bangladesh, China, the CIS (former Soviet Union), Cyprus, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Korea, Latin America, Malaysia, the Middle East, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Vietnam and Yugoslavia. The Companys business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of orthopaedic implant surgeries is lower during the summer months. 18 Outlook for 2004 The Companys outlook for 2004 continues to be very optimistic regarding the markets it participates in and the underlying growth rates in orthopaedic procedures. The Company expects diluted net earnings per share for 2004 to approximate $2.68. The financial expectations for 2004 include net sales growth of approximately 16% as a result of strong growth in shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment, favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements and higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services. If foreign currency exchange rates hold at January 27, 2004 levels, the Company anticipates a favorable impact on net sales in the first quarter and full year of 2004 of approximately $45 million and $145 million, respectively. As the Company pays down outstanding borrowings under its Unsecured Credit Facilities and reduces the $150.0 million outstanding under its accounts receivable securitization facility, the Company expects to generate cash earnings in excess of its needs to fund future working capital requirements. The Company anticipates investing in future business growth, including business and product line acquisitions to supplement its current product offerings, instrumentation in support of new product launches and future building expansions, including manufacturing facility expansions for certain divisions within its MedSurg segment. Results of Operations The table below outlines the components of the consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of net sales and the year to year percentage change in dollar amounts: Percentage of Net Sales Percentage Change 2003 2002 2001 2003/2002 2002/2001 Net sales 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 20% 16% Cost of sales 36.2 36.9 37.0 18 15 Gross profit 63.8 63.1 63.0 22 16 Research, development and engineering expenses 5.0 4.7 5.5 27 Selling, general and administrative expenses 39.1 38.7 37.9 22 18 Restructuring and acquisition related charges 0.6 (100) Other expense (income) 1.8 2.3 4.0 (8) (33) Earnings before income taxes and extraordinary item 18.0 16.8 15.6 29 25 Income taxes 5.5 5.3 5.1 24 20 Earnings before extraordinary item 12.5 11.5 10.4 31 27 Extraordinary loss, net of income taxes (0.2) Net earnings 12.5% 11.5% 10.3% 31 29 19 The table below sets forth domestic/international and product line sales information: Net Sales (in millions) Percentage Change 2003 2002 2001 2003/2002 2002/2001 Domestic/international sales Domestic $2,333.4 $1,973.7 $1,688.4 18% 17% International 1,291.9 1,037.9 913.9 24 14 Total net sales $3,625.3 $3,011.6 $2,602.3 20 16 Product line sales Orthopaedic Implants $2,093.0 $1,704.8 $1,447.2 23 18 MedSurg Equipment 1,309.3 1,105.3 974.2 18 13 Physical Therapy Services 223.0 201.5 180.9 11 11 Total net sales $3,625.3 $3,011.6 $2,602.3 20 16 2003 Compared with 2002 Stryker Corporations net sales increased 20% in 2003 to $3,625.3 million from $3,011.6 million in 2002. Net sales grew by 12% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix; 2% related to higher selling prices; 5% due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates; and 1% as a result of acquired businesses. Domestic sales were $2,333.4 million for 2003, representing an increase of 18% as a result of strong shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment and higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services. International sales were $1,291.9 million for 2003, representing an increase of 24% as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $145.9 million for 2003. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, international sales increased 10% in 2003. Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $2,093.0 million for 2003, representing an increase of 23% as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive, trauma and spinal implants. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 16% for the year. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $1,309.3 million for 2003, representing an increase of 18% as a result of higher shipments of powered surgical instruments, endoscopic products, hospital beds and stretchers and micro implant and surgical navigation systems. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 15% for the year. Physical Therapy Services revenues were $223.0 million for 2003, representing an increase of 11% as a result of new physical therapy centers and higher revenues from existing centers. Cost of sales represented 36.2% of sales compared with 36.9% in 2002. The lower cost of sales percentage in 2003 is due to the faster sales growth in the higher margin Orthopaedic Implants business and an increase in the absorption of fixed manufacturing costs caused by increased production at certain of the Companys manufacturing plants to meet current demand. Research, development and engineering expenses represented 5.0% of sales in 2003 compared to 4.7% in 2002. The higher spending level is the result of final development spending in advance of the Companys product launches in 2003 and continued focus on new product development for anticipated future product launches. New product introductions in 2003 included the Trident Ceramic Acetabular System, Simplex P with Tobramycin Bone Cement and the CORE platform of micro powered surgical instruments in the United States market and the System 5 heavy duty, battery powered surgical instruments in Europe. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 22% in 2003 and represented 39.1% of sales compared with 38.7% in 2002. The 22% increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is partially due to an increase in sales commission expense as a result of the 20% increase in net sales in 2003. In addition, the Company incurred a $14.0 million increase in insurance costs during 2003 resulting from increased premiums 20 charged by third party insurers and a wholly owned captive insurance company established in 2003 as more fully described in Other Matters. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in 2003 is primarily due to higher distribution costs associated with the increased sales mix of Orthopaedic Implants, increased amortization of loaner instrument sets, the increase in insurance costs and higher advertising costs associated with the Companys previously announced patient education campaign. The Company recognized charges of $17.2 million ($11.5 million net of income taxes) related to restructuring and acquisition related items in the third quarter of 2002. The 2002 restructuring and acquisition related items included a charge of $21.0 million ($14.1 million net of income taxes) for employment related costs to close the Companys Rutherford, New Jersey, manufacturing facility, partially offset by a credit of $3.8 million ($2.6 million net of income taxes) to reverse certain Howmedica acquisition related costs to reflect actual final payments required. See the following comparison of 2002 results to 2001 results for additional information. Interest expense declined to $22.6 million in 2003 from $40.3 million in 2002, primarily as a result of lower outstanding debt balances. The increase in intangibles amortization to $45.4 million in 2003 from $28.9 million in 2002 is primarily the result of the increased intangible assets recorded as a result of the July 1, 2002 acquisition of the Surgical Dynamics Inc. spinal implant business (SDI) from Tyco International Ltd. as more fully described in Other Matters. In addition, the Company recorded a $6.5 million charge related to a trademark impairment resulting from a branding initiative adopted by the Company in the fourth quarter of 2003. The branding initiative is intended to improve the Companys customers and other stakeholders overall awareness of Strykers capabilities. The charge is included in intangibles amortization in the consolidated statements of earnings. Other income was $3.8 million in 2003, compared with $0.5 million of other expense in 2002 due to foreign currency transaction gains in the current year compared to losses in the prior year and higher interest income. The effective income tax rate was 30.5% in 2003 compared with 31.8% in 2002. The Companys effective income tax rate for 2003 was reduced primarily as a result of increased manufacturing in lower tax jurisdictions such as Ireland and Puerto Rico. Net earnings increased 31% to $453.5 million from $345.6 million in 2002; basic net earnings per share increased 30% to $2.28 in 2003 from $1.75 in 2002; and diluted net earnings per share increased 31% to $2.23 in 2003 from $1.70 in 2002. Excluding the impact of the restructuring and acquisition related items for the year ended December 31, 2002 adjusted net earnings increased 27% from $357.1 million in 2002 to $453.5 million in 2003. Adjusted basic net earnings per share increased 26% from $1.81 in 2002 to $2.28 in 2003. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share increased 27% from $1.75 in 2002 to $2.23 in 2003. These adjusted non GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of the Companys GAAP financial results. The Company has provided this supplemental non GAAP information because it provides meaningful information regarding the Companys results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented. Management uses this non GAAP financial information for reviewing the operating results of its business segments and for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process. In addition, the Company believes investors utilize this information to evaluate period to period results and to understand potential future operating results. The Company believes that the economic nature of the restructuring charge and the acquisition related credit are sufficiently unique that similar items have not been recorded in the prior two fiscal years nor are they reasonably likely to recur within two years. In addition, the Company reasonably believes that it is probable that the financial impact of each of these individual items will become insignificant by the end of 2004. The Company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its Consolidated Financial Statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and to not rely solely on any single financial measure. The reconciliations of these non GAAP financial measures are as follows (in millions): 21 2003 2002 % Change Reported net earnings $453.5 $345.6 31% Restructuring charge 14.1 Acquisition related credit (2.6) Adjusted net earnings $453.5 $357.1 27 Basic net earnings per share: Reported basic net earnings per share $2.28 $1.75 30 Restructuring charge $.07 Acquisition related credit ($.01) Adjusted basic net earnings per share $2.28 $1.81 26 Diluted net earnings per share: Reported diluted net earnings per share $2.23 $1.70 31 Restructuring charge $.07 Acquisition related credit ($.01) Adjusted diluted net earnings per share $2.23 $1.75 27 2002 Compared with 2001 Stryker Corporations net sales increased 16% in 2002 to $3,011.6 million from $2,602.3 million in 2001. Net sales grew by 11% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix; 3% related to higher selling prices; and 2% as a result of acquired businesses. Domestic sales were $1,973.7 million for 2002, representing an increase of 17% as a result of strong shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment and higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services. The July 1, 2002, acquisition of SDI added $22.8 million to domestic sales for 2002. International sales were $1,037.9 million for 2002, representing an increase of 14% as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The acquisition of SDI added $2.5 million to international sales for 2002. The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $13.7 million for 2002. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, international sales increased 12% in 2002. Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $1,704.8 million for 2002, representing an increase of 18% as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive, trauma and spinal implants. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 17% for the year. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $1,105.3 million for 2002, representing an increase of 13% as a result of higher shipments of powered surgical instruments, endoscopic products, hospital beds and stretchers and micro implant and surgical navigation systems. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 13% for the year. Physical Therapy Services revenues were $201.5 million for 2002, representing an increase of 11% as a result of new physical therapy centers and higher revenues from existing centers. Cost of sales represented 36.9% of sales compared with 37.0% in 2001. The slightly lower cost of sales percentage in 2002 was due to an increase in the absorption of fixed manufacturing costs caused by increased production at certain of the Companys manufacturing plants to meet current demand and higher sales growth for the higher margin Orthopaedic Implant products, offset partially by higher product obsolescence resulting from product launches. While research, development and engineering expenses in 2002 were consistent with prior year amounts, they decreased to 4.7% of sales from 5.5% in 2001. Research, development and engineering spending was affected in 2002 by the commercial launch of OP 1, which occurred in various markets in the second and fourth quarters of 2001. Following the launch, in 2002 Stryker Biotech recorded a portion of its expenses as cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses, compared with 2001, when this division classified substantially all of its costs as research, development and engineering. Increased spending from the Companys continued focus on new product development partially offset the decreased research, development and engineering expenses related to Stryker Biotech. New product introductions in 2002 included ScorpioFlex knee 22 for the United States market, Super Secur Fit Plus hip for the Japanese market, Trident Ceramic Acetabular System in Canada, Xia II Spinal System, System 5 heavy duty, battery powered surgical instruments, TPS Saber Drill, SDC Pro 2 surgical DVD documentation system, PainPump2, Precision System for percutaneous cement delivery, fluoroscopic software module for the Stryker Navigation System and Go Bed +. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 18% in 2002 and represented 38.7% of sales compared with 37.9% in 2001. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was partially due to an increase in sales commission expense as a result of the 16% increase in net sales in 2002. In addition, the Company incurred an $8.9 million increase in insurance costs during 2002. The change in classification of certain Stryker Biotech expenses, as discussed above, also contributed to the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. Discount expense related to the accounts receivable securitization facility, which was included in selling, general and administrative expenses, declined to $2.7 million in 2002 from $5.8 million in 2001 as a result of lower discount rates. The Company recognized charges of $17.2 million ($11.5 million net of income taxes) related to restructuring and acquisition related items in the third quarter of 2002. The 2002 restructuring and acquisition related items included a charge of $21.0 million ($14.1 million net of income taxes) for employment related costs to close the Companys Rutherford, New Jersey, manufacturing facility, partially offset by a credit of $3.8 million ($2.6 million net of income taxes) to reverse certain Howmedica acquisition related costs to reflect actual final payments required. The $21.0 million restructuring charge related primarily to a shutdown agreement reached between the Company and the employee bargaining unit to close the Orthopaedics division implant manufacturing facility in Rutherford, New Jersey, which was ratified by the members of the I.U.E. CWA Local 485 on August 23, 2002. The charge covered employment related severance costs for 353 employees. The Rutherford facility was closed during 2003 with final severance payments to be made by the end of 2005. The Orthopaedics division has completed the transition of production to its facilities in Mahwah, New Jersey, as well as Cork and Limerick, Ireland. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recognized charges of $0.6 million related to various restructuring and acquisition related events. The 2001 restructuring and acquisition related charges included $2.4 million of charges, partially offset by the reversal of prior year restructuring accruals totaling $1.8 million. Interest expense declined to $40.3 million in 2002 from $67.9 million in 2001, primarily as a result of lower outstanding debt balances. The decrease in intangibles amortization to $28.9 million in 2002 from $38.4 million in 2001 was primarily the result of the Companys adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which prohibits the amortization of goodwill. If the nonamortization provisions of Statement No. 142 had been applied in the prior year, amortization expense for 2001 would have been reduced by $18.1 million and net earnings would have increased by $12.1 million ($.06 per diluted share). Other expense was $0.5 million in 2002, compared with $1.6 million of other income in 2001 due to foreign currency transaction losses in the current year versus gains in the prior year, partially offset by higher interest income. The effective income tax rate was 31.8% in 2002 compared with 33.0% in 2001. The Companys effective income tax rate for 2002 was reduced from 33.0% to 31.8% in the fourth quarter of 2002, thereby reducing income tax expense by $6.1 million, primarily as a result of increased manufacturing in lower tax jurisdictions such as Ireland and Puerto Rico. Earnings before extraordinary item increased 27% to $345.6 million from $271.8 million in 2001; basic earnings per share before extraordinary item increased 27% to $1.75 in 2002 from $1.38 in 2001; and diluted earnings per share before extraordinary item increased 27% to $1.70 in 2002 from $1.34 in 2001. In December 2001, the Company refinanced and prepaid the remaining $642.7 million outstanding under the $1,650.0 million Senior Secured Credit Facilities established in 1998 in connection with the Howmedica acquisition. The prepayment of the 1998 Facilities resulted in the write off in 2001 of related unamortized deferred loan costs of $7.1 million, which was reflected as an extraordinary loss of $4.8 million (net of income taxes of $2.3 million; $.02 per basic and diluted share). Net earnings were $345.6 million (basic and diluted net earnings per share of $1.75 and $1.70, respectively) compared with $267.0 million (basic and diluted net earnings per share of $1.36 and $1.32, respectively) in 2001. 23 Excluding the impact of the restructuring and acquisition related items on 2002 and 2001 and the impact of the change in goodwill amortization and the extraordinary item on 2001, adjusted net earnings in 2002 were $357.1 million, representing a 26% increase over adjusted net earnings of $284.3 million in 2001. Adjusted basic net earnings per share increased 25% to $1.81 compared with $1.45 in 2001. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share increased 25% to $1.75 compared with $1.40 in 2001. These adjusted non GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of the Companys GAAP financial results. The Company has provided this supplemental non GAAP information because it provides meaningful information regarding the Companys results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented. Management uses this non GAAP financial information for reviewing the operating results of its business segments and for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process. In addition, the Company believes investors utilize this information to evaluate period to period results and to understand potential future operating results. The Company believes that the economic nature of the restructuring charge, the acquisition related items and extraordinary loss are sufficiently unique that similar items have not been recorded in the prior two fiscal years nor are they reasonably likely to recur within two years. In addition, the Company reasonably believes that it is probable that the financial impact of each of these individual items will become insignificant by the end of 2004. The Company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its Consolidated Financial Statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and to not rely solely on any single financial measure. The reconciliations of these non GAAP financial measures are as follows (in millions): 2002 2001 % Change Reported net earnings $345.6 $267.0 29% Restructuring charge/(credit) 14.1 (0.2) Acquisition related charge/(credit) (2.6) 0.6 Goodwill and assembled workforce amortization 12.1 Extraordinary loss 4.8 Adjusted net earnings $357.1 $284.3 26 Basic net earnings per share: Reported basic net earnings per share $1.75 $1.36 29 Restructuring charge/(credit) $.07 Acquisition related charge/(credit) ($.01) Goodwill and assembled workforce amortization $.06 Extraordinary loss $.02 Adjusted basic net earnings per share $1.81 $1.45 25 Diluted net earnings per share: Reported diluted net earnings per share $1.70 $1.32 29 Restructuring charge/(credit) $.07 Acquisition related charge/(credit) ($.01) Goodwill and assembled workforce amortization $.06 Extraordinary loss $.02 Adjusted diluted net earnings per share $1.75 $1.40 25 Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys working capital at December 31, 2003 increased $103.3 million to $547.1 million from $443.8 million at December 31, 2002, including the effect of the proceeds from the sale of an additional $20.0 million of accounts receivable pursuant to the accounts receivable securitization facility, that were used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the Companys Unsecured Credit Facilities. The increase in working capital resulted from growth in the Companys overall business and the use of strong earnings to fund increases in accounts receivable, inventory and prepaid expenses and to pay current liabilities due in 2003, primarily for 24 income taxes and restructuring and acquisition related liabilities. Trade accounts payable and other accrued liabilities increased in 2003 as a result of the growth in the business, higher obligations for third party sales agent commissions, third party royalties, non income based taxes, increased reserves for legal claims and assessments and increases in other accrued liabilities. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding, excluding the effect of $150.0 million outstanding under the Companys $200.0 million accounts receivable securitization facility, of 58 days was unchanged at December 31, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002. Days sales in inventory decreased 6 days to 120 days at December 31, 2003 from 126 days at December 31, 2002. The lower days sales in inventory is primarily the result of improved inventory management and higher provisions for product obsolescence as a result of product launches. The Company generated cash of $648.5 million from operations in 2003 compared with $516.2 million in 2002. The generation of cash in 2003 is the result of strong cash earnings (net earnings plus noncash adjustments) and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses. These items were partially offset by increases in deferred charges and accounts receivable from increased sales and payments of $15.5 million attributable to restructuring and acquisition related liabilities and acquisition purchase liabilities. In 2003, the Company used cash of $10.8 million for business and product line acquisitions, $144.5 million for capital expenditures and $23.7 million for the payment of dividends. In addition to the borrowings used to fund business and product line acquisitions, the Company borrowed an additional $664.5 million under its existing credit facilities to fund cash flow needs during 2003 and made repayments of $1,144.6 million against the credit facilities. Total borrowings declined by $475.6 million after adjusting for the effect of foreign currency translation. In 2003, the Company used cash of $144.5 million for capital expenditures, including $27.7 million related to the construction of Phase II of the Companys Mahwah, New Jersey, manufacturing and distribution facility. In addition, the Company spent $4.6 million for the expansion of the Companys manufacturing facility in West Lebanon, New Hampshire, and $3.8 million for the expansion of the Companys Cork, Ireland, manufacturing facility. The Company had $65.9 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2003. The Company also had outstanding borrowings totaling $26.1 million at that date. Current maturities of long term debt at December 31, 2003 are $7.3 million and will increase to $15.6 million in 2006. The Companys $750.0 million five year, nonamortizing, revolving credit agreement expires in December 2006. As a result of current cash and outstanding debt balances, the Company decided not to renew its previously existing $250.0 million 364 day revolving credit agreement which expired in December 2003. The Company believes its cash on hand, as well as anticipated cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to fund future operating capital requirements, future manufacturing facility construction and other capital expenditures, future business and product line acquisitions and required debt repayments. Should additional funds be required, the Company had $802.1 million of additional borrowing capacity available under all of its existing credit facilities and an additional $50.0 million of eligible accounts receivable which could be sold through its accounts receivable securitization facility at December 31, 2003. The Companys future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than one year, including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business, are summarized as follows (in millions): Payment Period 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Long term debt $7.3 $0.0 $15.6 $0.0 $0.0 $3.2 Operating leases 43.7 34.8 26.4 20.5 16.9 49.3 Unconditional purchase obligations 162.5 0.7 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 25 The Companys additional borrowing capacity, along with the expected expiration period of the commitment, are summarized as follows (in millions): Amount of Commitment Total Expiration Per Period Amount Less than In excess of Committed 1 year 1 year Lines of credit $785.3 $68.9 $716.4 Standby letters of credit 16.8 4.5 12.3 $802.1 $73.4 $728.7 Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates these estimates. Estimates are based on historical experience, when available, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes that an understanding of the following critical accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable. The Company makes estimates regarding the future ability of its customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends. If actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional accounts receivable write offs may be necessary, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. Inventory Reserves The Company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. The markets in which the Company operates are highly competitive, with new products and surgical procedures introduced on an ongoing basis. Such marketplace changes may cause the Companys products to become obsolete. The Company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. Income TaxesThe Company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States. Accordingly, management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions. Tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates. Because tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant, the 26 Company records accruals representing managements best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters. To the extent additional information becomes available, such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable outcome. Other Matters The Company distributes its products throughout the world. As a result, the Companys financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets. The Companys operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the United States dollar and the Japanese yen and European currencies, in particular the euro and the British pound. When the United States dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies increases. When the United States dollar strengthens, the opposite situation occurs. The Company manufactures its products in the United States, France, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, Canada and Puerto Rico and incurs the costs to manufacture in the applicable local currencies. This worldwide deployment of factories serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the Companys cost of sales. The Company follows the provisions of FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by Statements No. 137 and No. 138, in accounting for its derivative financial instruments. The Statements require the Company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not documented and accounted for as hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings. If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The Company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk to the Company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products. The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies. At December 31, 2003, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $123.9 million and sell $154.9 million of various currencies (principally United States dollars and euros) with maturities ranging principally from 30 to 180 days. At December 31, 2002, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $82.0 million and sell $97.7 million of various currencies (principally United States dollars and euros) with maturities ranging principally from 30 to 180 days. The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points. A hypothetical 10% change in exchange rates for these currencies would change the 2003 fair value by approximately $2.1 million and would have changed the 2002 fair value by approximately $0.5 million. At December 31, 2003, the Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties. The Company is exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates as a result of its borrowings and the accounts receivable securitization facility. The Company managed a portion of its interest rate risk on its borrowings through interest rate swap agreements, which had fixed the base rate on a $250.0 million notional amount of the variable rate borrowings during 2003. These interest rate swap agreements expired during 2003. If market interest rates for similar borrowings had averaged 1% more than they did in 2003, the Companys 2003 27 interest expense, after considering the effects of its interest rate swaps, would have increased, and earnings before income taxes would have decreased, by $0.7 million. By comparison, if market interest rates had averaged 1% less than they did during 2003, the Companys 2003 interest expense, after considering the effects of its interest rate swaps, would have decreased, and earnings before income taxes would have increased, by $0.7 million. If market interest rates for the accounts receivable securitization facility had averaged 1% more than they did in 2003, the Companys discount expense would have increased, and earnings before income taxes would have decreased, by $1.7 million. By comparison, if market interest rates had averaged 1% less than they did in 2003, the Companys discount expense would have decreased, and earnings before income taxes would have increased, by $1.7 million. These amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the Companys borrowing cost, interest rate swap agreements and accounts receivable securitization facility without any actions by management to mitigate its exposure to such changes. The Companys interest rate swap agreements, which matured over various terms ranging from September 2003 through December 2003, effectively converted a portion of its variable rate borrowings to a fixed rate basis, thus reducing the impact of changes in interest rates on interest expense. The Company designated the interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges. Gains of $9.2 million and $9.3 million and a loss of $22.0 million attributable to changes in the fair value of interest rate swap agreements were recorded as components of accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Interest rate differentials paid or received as a result of interest rate swaps were recognized as an adjustment of interest expense related to the designated borrowings. The Company has used yen denominated floating rate borrowings to protect a portion of the value of its investment in its subsidiary in Japan. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from this hedge were not included in the consolidated statements of earnings, but were recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) in stockholders equity. Net gains (losses) of ($2.1) million, ($1.6) million and $5.8 million attributable to the yen denominated floating rate borrowings hedge were recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company has certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged. These investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currencies. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar increased the value of these investments in net assets by $176.3 million. This gain eliminated the previously recorded cumulative loss of $68.6 million that had been deferred and recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity at December 31, 2002. On July 1, 2002, the Company acquired SDI from Tyco International Ltd., for $135.0 million in cash. The acquisition expanded the Companys spinal product line by adding interbody spinal cages for the United States market as well as other thoracolumbar and cervical spinal fixation devices. The acquisition was funded using existing credit facilities. The acquisition of SDI was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The results of operations for the acquired business are included in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements beginning July 1, 2002. The Companys pro forma consolidated financial results in 2002 did not differ significantly as a result of the SDI acquisition. The Company is partially self insured for product liability claims. In 2003, the Company established a wholly owned captive insurance company in the U.S. to manage its self insured retention limits. The captive insurance company provides insurance reserves for estimated liabilities for product claims incurred but not reported based on actuarially determined liabilities. The actuarial valuations are based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events. During the second quarter of 2003, the Company issued 50,000 shares of restricted stock to its newly appointed President and Chief Operating Officer. The stock vests ratably on the first five anniversary dates of the grant, provided that the recipient is still employed by the Company. The aggregate market value of the restricted stock at the date of issuance of $3.4 million, as measured at the quoted price of the Companys common stock, has been recorded as deferred stock based compensation, a separate component of stockholders equity, and is being amortized over the five year vesting period. 28 In December 2003, the Company announced that its subsidiary, Physiotherapy Associates, Inc., and Stryker received a subpoena from the United States Attorneys Office in Boston, Massachusetts, in connection with a Department of Justice investigation of Physiotherapy Associates billing and coding practices. Physiotherapy Associates provides physical, occupational and speech therapy services to patients through 374 outpatient centers in the United States and represented 6% and 7% of Strykers net sales for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively Revenues derived from billings to U.S. Federal health care programs approximated 14% of Physiotherapy Associates revenues during these periods. The Company is fully cooperating with the Department of Justice regarding this matter. In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to Statement No. 132, Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. This revision requires additional disclosures by the Company regarding its plan assets, investment strategies, plan obligations and cash flows. The Company has adopted these new disclosure requirements for all of its defined benefit plans. ITEM 7A.
