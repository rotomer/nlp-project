ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Level Overview Stryker Corporation (the "Company" or "Stryker") is a leader in the worldwide orthopaedic market and is one of the worlds largest medical device companies. Stryker delivers results through a wide range of capabilities including joint replacements, trauma, spine and micro implant systems, orthobiologics, powered surgical instruments, surgical navigation systems and endoscopic products as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. Stryker also provides outpatient physical therapy services in the United States. The Company segregates its operations into two reportable business segments: Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The Orthopaedic Implants segment sells orthopaedic reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma, spine and micro implant systems, bone cement and the bone growth factor osteogenic protein 1 (OP 1). The MedSurg Equipment segment sells powered surgical instruments, surgical navigation systems, endoscopic products, medical video imaging equipment and hospital beds and stretchers. The Other category includes Physical Therapy Services and corporate administration, interest expense and interest income. Domestic sales accounted for 65% of total revenues in 2004. Most of the Companys products are marketed directly to more than 6,000 hospitals and to doctors and other health care facilities by approximately 2,350 sales and marketing personnel in the United States. Stryker primarily maintains separate and dedicated sales forces for each of its principal product lines to provide focus and a high level of expertise to each medical specialty served. International sales accounted for 35% of total revenues in 2004. The Companys products are sold in more than 100 countries through more than 1,750 local dealers and direct sales forces. Local dealer support and direct sales are coordinated by approximately 1,900 local and regional sales and marketing personnel. Stryker distributes its products through sales subsidiaries and branches with offices located in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. Stryker exports products to dealers and to customers in Africa, Bangladesh, China, the CIS (former Soviet Union), Cyprus, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Korea, Latin America, Malaysia, the Middle East, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Vietnam and Yugoslavia. The Companys business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of orthopaedic implant surgeries is lower during the summer months. 21 In the third quarter of 2004, the Company completed its acquisition, by merger, of all of the outstanding stock of SpineCore, Inc. (SpineCore), for an upfront payment of $120.0 million in cash plus certain transaction costs. SpineCore is a developer of artificial lumbar and cervical discs. Terms of the transaction also include milestone and royalty payments of up to an additional $240.0 million upon the achievement of commercialization of SpineCores products in the United States, which is not expected to occur before 2008. This acquisition is expected to enhance the Companys presence in the spinal implant market, an important growth area within its Orthopaedic Implants segment. Additional details, including the financial statement impact resulting from the acquisition, are included in Results of Operations. Outlook for 2005 The Companys outlook for 2005 continues to be optimistic regarding the markets it participates in and the underlying growth rates in orthopaedic procedures. The Company expects diluted net earnings per share for 2005 to approximate $1.74, excluding the anticipated impact from the recognition of the cost of employee stock options as more fully described in Other Matters. The financial expectations for 2005 include a net sales increase of approximately 15% as a result of strong growth in shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment, favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements and higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services. If foreign currency exchange rates hold at current levels, the Company anticipates a favorable impact on net sales in the first quarter and full year of 2005 of approximately $15 million and $75 million, respectively. Excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects sales growth of approximately 13% in 2005, which is comparable to the 14% sales growth, excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rates, reported for the full year of 2004. The Company has paid off substantially all previously outstanding borrowings under its existing credit facilities and eliminated the amounts previously outstanding under its accounts receivable securitization facility and expects to generate cash earnings (net earnings plus noncash adjustments) in excess of its needs to fund future working capital requirements. The Company anticipates investing in future business growth, including business and product line acquisitions to supplement its current product offerings, loaner instrumentation for surgical implants in support of new product launches and future building expansions, including manufacturing facility expansions for certain divisions. Results of Operations The table below outlines the components of the consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of net sales and the year to year percentage change in dollar amounts: Percentage of Net Sales Percentage Change 2004 2003 2002 2004/2003 2003/2002 Net sales 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 18% 20% Cost of sales 35.4 36.2 36.9 15 18 Gross profit 64.6 63.8 63.1 19 22 Research, development and engineering expenses 5.0 5.0 4.7 17 27 Selling, general and administrative expenses 38.8 39.1 38.7 17 22 Intangibles amortization 1.1 1.3 1.0 5 57 Purchased in process research and development 2.8 Restructuring and acquisition related items 0.6 (100) Operating income 16.9 18.5 18.2 7 23 Other expense (income) 0.1 0.5 1.4 (82) (54) Earnings before income taxes 16.8 18.0 16.8 10 29 Income taxes 5.9 5.5 5.3 26 24 Net earnings 10.9% 12.5% 11.5% 3 31 22 The table below sets forth domestic/international and product line sales information: Net Sales (in millions) Percentage Change 2004 2003 2002 2004/2003 2003/2002 Domestic/international sales: Domestic $2,753.0 $2,333.4 $1,973.7 18% 18% International 1,509.3 1,291.9 1,037.9 17 24 Total net sales $4,262.3 $3,625.3 $3,011.6 18 20 Product line sales: Orthopaedic Implants $2,562.5 $2,192.5 $1,798.3 17 22 MedSurg Equipment 1,454.9 1,209.8 1,011.8 20 20 Physical Therapy Services 244.9 223.0 201.5 10 11 Total net sales $4,262.3 $3,625.3 $3,011.6 18 20 The table below sets forth additional sales growth information for significant products within the Companys Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment product lines on both a reported basis and excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates: Percentage Change 2004/2003 2003/2002 Constant Constant Reported Currency Reported Currency Worldwide Orthopaedic Implants sales: Hips 14% 9% 20% 14% Knees 18 14 18 13 Trauma 17 11 25 15 Spine 18 15 40 35 Micro implants 16 12 11 4 Worldwide MedSurg Equipment sales: Powered surgical instruments and surgical navigation systems 17 15 21 17 Endoscopic products and medical video imaging equipment 21 20 21 19 Patient handling and emergency medical equipment 25 23 12 10 23 2004 Compared with 2003 Stryker Corporations net sales increased 18% in 2004 to $4,262.3 million from $3,625.3 million in 2003. Net sales grew by 13% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix; 3% due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates; and 2% related to higher selling prices. Domestic sales were $2,753.0 million for 2004, representing an increase of 18% as a result of strong shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment and higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services. International sales were $1,509.3 million for 2004, representing an increase of 17% as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $120.8 million for 2004. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, international sales increased 7% in 2004. Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $2,562.5 million for 2004, representing an increase of 17% as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive, trauma, spine and micro implant systems, bone cement and the bone growth factor OP 1. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 13% for the year. Sales of hip implant systems increased 14% during the year, 9% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Sales growth for hip products slowed during 2004 primarily due to tougher comparables resulting from the launch of the Trident ceramic on ceramic hip system in the United States in the second quarter of 2003. Sales of knee implant systems increased 18% during the year, 14% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, due to strong growth in Scorpio and Duracon knee systems in the United States. Sales of trauma implant systems increased 17% during the year, 11% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as a result of the full scale launch of the Gamma3 Hip Fracture System in the United States, Japan and Europe in 2004. Strong growth in the Companys T2 Nailing System, both in the United States and internationally, also drove trauma sales growth in 2004. Sales of spinal implant systems increased 18% during the year, 15% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to strong sales growth of cervical and interbody products in the United States. Sales of micro implant systems increased 16% during the year, 12% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as a result of solid worldwide sales of craniomaxillofacial products. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $1,454.9 million for 2004, representing an increase of 20% as a result of higher shipments of powered surgical instruments and surgical navigation systems, endoscopic products, and patient handling and emergency medical equipment. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 18% for the year. Sales of powered surgical instruments and surgical navigation systems increased 17% during the year, 15% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, due to strong sales growth in heavy duty powered instruments, interventional pain products and surgical navigation systems both domestically and in Europe. Sales of endoscopic products increased 21% during the year, 20% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as a result of solid growth in medical video imaging equipment and sports medicine products in the United States. Sales of patient handling and emergency medical equipment increased 25% during the year, 23% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, due to strong growth in hospital beds and emergency medical equipment both domestically and in the international markets. Physical Therapy Services revenues were $244.9 million for 2004, representing an increase of 10% with 6% of the growth resulting from new physical therapy centers and 4% of the increase coming from higher revenues at existing centers. Cost of sales represented 35.4% of sales in 2004 compared with 36.2% in 2003. The lower cost of sales percentage in 2004 is partially due to increased average selling prices for the Companys products and improved manufacturing efficiencies at several of the Companys manufacturing and distribution facilities, including its recently completed Mahwah, New Jersey, manufacturing and distribution facility, and lower purchase prices of raw materials, including cobalt chromium and titanium alloys. Research, development and engineering expenses represented 5.0% of sales in both 2004 and 2003. These expenses increased 17% in 2004 to $211.0 million. The higher spending level is the result of final development spending in advance of the Companys product launches in 2004 and continued focus on new product 24 development for anticipated future product launches, together with, beginning in the third quarter of 2004, spending associated with the continued development of products acquired from SpineCore. New product introductions in 2004 in the Orthopaedic Implants segment included the Restoration Modular Hip System in the United States and Europe, the Triathlon Knee System in the United States and Europe, the Scorpio NRG knee and CentPillar hip systems in the Japanese market, a worldwide launch of the OASYS posterior cervical fixation system and a full scale launch of the Gamma3 Hip Fracture System in the United States, Japan and Europe. The Triathlon system represents the Companys evolutionary design developed to more closely reproduce natural knee motion and to provide mobility with stability through more than 150 degrees of flexion. Within the MedSurg Equipment segment, new product introductions in 2004 included a new video platform with the 1088 High Definition Camera, the first fully digital, high definition, progressive scan medical video camera, and the new M Series stretcher, designed to fit the needs of acute care and specialty surgical care facilities. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 17% in 2004 and represented 38.8% of sales compared with 39.1% in 2003. The 17% increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is partially due to an increase in sales commission expense as a result of the 18% increase in net sales in 2004, increased meeting costs and higher amortization expense associated with loaner instrument sets. In addition, the Company incurred a $12.1 million increase in insurance costs during 2004 resulting from increased premiums charged by third party insurers and its wholly owned captive insurance company established in 2003 as more fully described in Other Matters. The purchased in process research and development charge of $120.8 million recorded in the third quarter of 2004 relates to the acquisition of SpineCore, a development stage company. At the date of the acquisition, the artificial lumbar and cervical spinal disc implant technologies acquired were in preliminary stages of clinical studies in the United States and had not yet reached technological feasibility. The upfront payment of $120.0 million, plus certain transaction costs, was allocated to assets acquired, purchased in process research and development and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. Interest expense declined to $6.8 million in 2004 from $22.6 million in 2003, primarily as a result of lower outstanding debt balances. The effective income tax rate was 35.0% in 2004. The reported effective income tax rate for 2004 reflects the nondeductibility for U.S. income tax purposes of the purchased in process research and development charge recognized pursuant to the aforementioned acquisition of SpineCore. Excluding this nondeductible charge, the Companys effective income tax rate was reduced to 30.0% in 2004 compared with 30.5% in 2003 primarily as a result of increased manufacturing in lower tax jurisdictions such as Ireland and Puerto Rico. Net earnings increased 3% to $465.7 million from $453.5 million in 2003; basic net earnings per share increased 2% to $1.16 in 2004 from $1.14 in 2003; and diluted net earnings per share increased 3% to $1.14 in 2004 from $1.11 in 2003. Excluding the impact of the $120.8 million purchased in process research and development charge recorded in the third quarter of 2004, adjusted net earnings increased 29% from $453.5 million in 2003 to $586.5 million in 2004; adjusted basic net earnings per share increased 28% from $1.14 in 2003 to $1.46 in 2004; and adjusted diluted net earnings per share increased 29% from $1.11 in 2003 to $1.43 in 2004. This adjusted financial measure does not replace the presentation of the Companys reported financial results stated under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company has provided this supplemental non GAAP financial measure because it provides meaningful information regarding the Companys results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented. Management uses this non GAAP financial measure for reviewing the operating results of its business segments and for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process. In addition, the Company believes investors will utilize this information to evaluate period to period results and to better understand potential future operating results. The Company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its Consolidated Financial Statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and to not rely solely on any single financial measure. The reconciliation of this non GAAP financial measure is as follows (in millions): 25 2004 2003 % Change Reported net earnings $465.7 $453.5 3% Purchased in process research and development 120.8 Adjusted net earnings $586.5 $453.5 29 Basic net earnings per share: Reported basic net earnings per share $1.16 $1.14 2 Purchased in process research and development $.30 Adjusted basic net earnings per share $1.46 $1.14 28 Diluted net earnings per share: Reported diluted net earnings per share $1.14 $1.11 3 Purchased in process research and development $.29 Adjusted diluted net earnings per share $1.43 $1.11 29 2003 Compared with 2002 Stryker Corporations net sales increased 20% in 2003 to $3,625.3 million from $3,011.6 million in 2002. Net sales grew by 12% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix; 5% due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates; 2% related to higher selling prices; and 1% as a result of acquired businesses. Domestic sales were $2,333.4 million for 2003, representing an increase of 18% as a result of strong shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment and higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services. International sales were $1,291.9 million for 2003, representing an increase of 24% as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $145.9 million for 2003. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, international sales increased 10% in 2003. Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $2,192.5 million for 2003, representing an increase of 22% as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive, trauma, spine and micro implant systems, bone cement and the bone growth factor OP 1. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 16% for the year. Sales of hip implant systems increased 20% during the year, 14% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Sales growth for hip products was primarily driven by the launch of the Trident ceramic on ceramic hip system in the United States in the second quarter of 2003. Sales of knee implant systems increased 18% during the year, 13% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, due to strong growth in Scorpio and Duracon knee systems in the United States and in Scorpio systems in Japan and the Pacific region. Sales of trauma implant systems increased 25% during the year, 15% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as a result of strong growth in the intramedullary nail product portfolio in the United States, led by the T2 Nailing System, and strong growth in hip fracture and external fixation products in Japan. Sales of spinal implant systems increased 40% during the year, 35% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to incremental sales of interbody cages resulting from the third quarter 2002 acquisition of Surgical Dynamics Inc. in the United States and strong domestic and international growth in thoracolumbar implant products. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $1,209.8 million for 2003, representing an increase of 20% as a result of higher shipments of powered surgical instruments and surgical navigation systems, endoscopic products, and patient handling and emergency medical equipment. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 16% for the year. Sales of powered surgical instruments and surgical navigation systems increased 21% during the year, 17% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, due to strong sales growth in heavy duty powered instruments, micro powered tools and interventional pain products both domestically and in Europe and domestic sales growth of the DEKOMPRESSOR discectomy probe acquired in the fourth quarter of 2002. Sales of endoscopic products increased 21% during the year, 19% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as a result of strong growth in medical video imaging 26 equipment and arthroscopic products in the United States. Sales of patient handling and emergency medical equipment increased 12% during the year, 10% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, due to strong domestic growth in hospital beds and emergency medical equipment. Physical Therapy Services revenues were $223.0 million for 2003, representing an increase of 11% with 8% of the growth resulting from new physical therapy centers and 3% of the increase coming from higher revenues at existing centers. Cost of sales represented 36.2% of sales compared with 36.9% in 2002. The lower cost of sales percentage in 2003 was due to the faster sales growth in the higher margin Orthopaedic Implants business and an increase in the absorption of fixed manufacturing costs caused by increased production at certain of the Companys manufacturing plants to meet current demand. Research, development and engineering expenses represented 5.0% of sales in 2003 compared with 4.7% in 2002. The higher spending level was the result of final development spending in advance of the Companys product launches in 2003 and continued focus on new product development for anticipated future product launches. New product introductions in 2003 included the Trident Ceramic Acetabular System, Simplex P with Tobramycin Bone Cement and the CORE platform of micro powered surgical instruments in the United States market and the System 5 heavy duty, battery powered surgical instruments in Europe. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 22% in 2003 and represented 39.1% of sales compared with 38.7% in 2002. The 22% increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was partially due to an increase in sales commission expense as a result of the 20% increase in net sales in 2003. In addition, the Company incurred a $14.0 million increase in insurance costs during 2003 resulting from increased premiums charged by third party insurers and a wholly owned captive insurance company established in 2003 as more fully described in Other Matters. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in 2003 was primarily due to higher distribution costs associated with the increased sales mix of Orthopaedic Implants, increased amortization of loaner instrument sets, the increase in insurance costs and higher advertising costs associated with the Companys previously announced patient education campaign. The increase in intangibles amortization to $45.4 million in 2003 from $28.9 million in 2002 was primarily the result of the increased intangible assets recorded as a result of the July 1, 2002 acquisition of the Surgical Dynamics Inc. spinal implant business (SDI) from Tyco International Ltd. In addition, the Company recorded a $6.5 million charge related to a trademark impairment resulting from a branding initiative adopted by the Company in the fourth quarter of 2003. The branding initiative is intended to improve the Companys customers and other stakeholders overall awareness of Strykers capabilities. The charge is included in intangibles amortization in the consolidated statements of earnings. The Company recognized charges of $17.2 million ($11.5 million net of income taxes) related to restructuring and acquisition related items in the third quarter of 2002. The 2002 restructuring and acquisition related items included a charge of $21.0 million ($14.1 million net of income taxes) for employment related costs to close the Companys Rutherford, New Jersey, manufacturing facility, partially offset by a credit of $3.8 million ($2.6 million net of income taxes) to reverse certain Howmedica acquisition related costs to reflect actual final payments required. Interest expense declined to $22.6 million in 2003 from $40.3 million in 2002, primarily as a result of lower outstanding debt balances. Other income was $3.8 million in 2003, compared with $0.5 million of other expense in 2002 due to foreign currency transaction gains in the current year compared to losses in the prior year and higher interest income. The effective income tax rate was 30.5% in 2003 compared with 31.8% in 2002. The Companys effective income tax rate for 2003 was reduced primarily as a result of increased manufacturing in lower tax jurisdictions such as Ireland and Puerto Rico. 27 Net earnings increased 31% to $453.5 million from $345.6 million in 2002; basic net earnings per share increased 31% to $1.14 in 2003 from $.87 in 2002; and diluted net earnings per share increased 31% to $1.11 in 2003 from $.85 in 2002. Excluding the impact of the restructuring and acquisition related items for the year ended December 31, 2002, adjusted net earnings increased 27% from $357.1 million in 2002 to $453.5 million in 2003. Adjusted basic net earnings per share increased 27% from $.90 in 2002 to $1.14 in 2003. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share increased 26% from $.88 in 2002 to $1.11 in 2003. This adjusted financial measure does not replace the presentation of the Companys reported financial results stated under GAAP. The Company has provided this supplemental non GAAP financial measure because it provides meaningful information regarding the Companys results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented. Management uses this non GAAP financial measure for reviewing the operating results of its business segments and for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process. In addition, the Company believes investors will utilize this information to evaluate period to period results and to better understand potential future operating results. The Company believes that the economic nature of the restructuring charge and the acquisition related credit were sufficiently unique that similar items were not recorded in the prior two fiscal years, nor were they reasonably likely to recur within two years. In addition, the Company believes that the financial impact of each of these individual items was insignificant by the end of 2004. The Company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its Consolidated Financial Statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and to not rely solely on any single financial measure. The reconciliation of this non GAAP financial measure is as follows (in millions): 2003 2002 % Change Reported net earnings $453.5 $345.6 31% Restructuring charge 14.1 Acquisition related credit (2.6) Adjusted net earnings $453.5 $357.1 27 Basic net earnings per share: Reported basic net earnings per share $1.14 $.87 31 Restructuring charge $.04 Acquisition related credit ($.01) Adjusted basic net earnings per share $1.14 $.90 27 Diluted net earnings per share: Reported diluted net earnings per share $1.11 $.85 31 Restructuring charge $.03 Acquisition related credit ($.01) Adjusted diluted net earnings per share $1.11 $.88 26 Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys working capital at December 31, 2004 increased $465.9 million to $1,029.1 million from $563.2 million at December 31, 2003. The increase in working capital resulted from growth in the Companys overall business and the use of cash earnings to fully repay amounts outstanding under the Companys accounts receivable securitization program and to fund increases in accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses and loaner instrumentation for surgical implants. Accounts payable and other accrued liabilities increased in 2004 as a result of the growth in the business, higher obligations for sales commissions, royalties, non income based taxes, increased reserves for legal claims and assessments and increases in other accrued liabilities. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding, excluding the effect of amounts outstanding ($0 at December 31, 2004 and $150.0 million at December 31, 2003) under the Companys $200.0 million accounts receivable securitization facility, was 58 days at both December 31, 2004 and 2003. Days sales in inventory increased 2 days to 122 days at December 31, 2004 from 120 days at December 31, 2003. The higher days sales in inventory is partially due to increased inventories to support 2004 and anticipated 2005 product launches. 28 The Company generated cash of $593.3 million from operations in 2004 compared with $648.5 million in 2003. The reduction in cash from operations in 2004 compared to the prior year is primarily due to the repayment of all amounts previously outstanding under the accounts receivable securitization facility representing an operating cash usage of $150.0 million in 2004 compared with an operating cash source of $20.0 million in 2003. The generation of cash of $593.3 million in 2004 is the result of cash earnings and increases in accounts payable, current income taxes payable and accrued expenses. These items were partially offset by the aforementioned repayment of amounts outstanding under the accounts receivable securitization facility and increases in loaner instrumentation and accounts receivable from increased sales. In 2004, the Company used cash of $144.7 million for acquisitions, $187.8 million for capital expenditures and $28.0 million for the payment of dividends. During 2004, the Company repaid the remaining $15.5 million of debt outstanding under the Companys Unsecured Credit Facility from the Howmedica acquisition. Total borrowings declined by $16.1 million after adjusting for the effects of foreign currency translation. In 2004, the Company used cash of $187.8 million for capital expenditures, including $36.1 million related to the expansion of the Companys manufacturing facility in West Lebanon, New Hampshire, and $20.7 million related to the construction of the Companys new manufacturing facilities in Portage, Michigan. The Company had $349.4 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2004. The Company also had outstanding borrowings totaling $10.0 million at that date. Current maturities of long term debt at December 31, 2004 are $9.3 million. The Company believes its cash on hand, as well as anticipated cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to fund future operating capital requirements, future manufacturing facility construction and other capital expenditures and future acquisitions to supplement its current product offerings. Should additional funds be required, the Company had $826.0 million of additional borrowing capacity available under all of its existing credit facilities, including the Companys $750.0 million five year, nonamortizing, revolving credit agreement that expires in December 2006. In addition, the Company had $200.0 million of eligible accounts receivable that could be sold through its accounts receivable securitization facility at December 31, 2004. The Companys future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than one year, including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business, are summarized as follows (in millions): Payment Period 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Long term debt $9.3 $0.0 $0.7 $0.0 $0.0 $0.0 Operating leases 51.0 44.0 37.4 29.0 19.3 49.6 Unconditional purchase obligations 230.2 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 The Companys additional borrowing capacity, along with the expected expiration period of the commitments, is summarized as follows (in millions): Amount of Commitment Total Expiration Per Period Amount Less than In excess of Committed 1 year 1 year Unsecured revolving credit agreement and other lines of credit $826.0 $99.9 $726.1 Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Estimates are based on historical experience, when available, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the 29 circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes that of its significant accounting policies (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), an understanding of the following critical accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable. The Company makes estimates regarding the future ability of its customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends. If actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional accounts receivable write offs may be necessary, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. Inventory Reserves The Company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. The markets in which the Company operates are highly competitive, with new products and surgical procedures introduced on an ongoing basis. Such marketplace changes may cause some of the Companys products to become obsolete. The Company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. Income Taxes The Company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States. Accordingly, management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions. Tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates. Because tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant, the Company records accruals representing managements best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters. To the extent additional information becomes available, such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable outcome. Other Matters The Company distributes its products throughout the world. As a result, the Companys financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets. The Companys operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the United States dollar and the Japanese yen and European currencies, in particular the euro and the British pound. When the United States dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies increases. When the United States dollar strengthens, the opposite situation occurs. The Company manufactures its products in the United States, France, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, Canada and Puerto Rico and incurs the costs to manufacture in the applicable local currencies. This worldwide deployment of factories serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the Companys cost of sales. The Company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk to the Company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate 30 to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products. The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies. At December 31, 2004, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $137.7 million and sell $173.1 million of various currencies (principally United States dollars and euros) with maturities ranging principally from 30 to 180 days. The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points. A hypothetical 10% change in exchange rates for these currencies would change the December 31, 2004 fair value by approximately $6.1 million. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties. The Company has certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged. These investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currencies that are deferred and recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar increased the value of these investments in net assets, and the related deferred gain in stockholders equity, by $102.2 million to $209.9 million. The Company is partially self insured for product liability claims. In 2003, the Company established a wholly owned captive insurance company in the United States to manage its self insured retention limits. The captive insurance company provides insurance reserves for estimated liabilities for product claims incurred but not reported based on actuarially determined liabilities. The actuarial valuations are based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events. In December 2003, the Company announced that its subsidiary Physiotherapy Associates, Inc., and Stryker received a subpoena from the United States Attorneys Office in Boston, Massachusetts, in connection with a Department of Justice investigation of Physiotherapy Associates billing and coding practices. Physiotherapy Associates provides physical, occupational and speech therapy services to patients through 428 outpatient centers in the United States as of December 31, 2004 and represented 6% of Strykers net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. Revenues derived from billings to U.S. federal health care programs approximated 14% of Physiotherapy Associates revenues during these periods. The Company is fully cooperating with the Department of Justice regarding this matter. On October 22, 2004, the President of the United States signed the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act). The Act creates a temporary incentive for United States corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned in foreign jurisdictions by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. The deduction is subject to a number of limitations, and significant uncertainty remains about the way to interpret numerous provisions in the Act. Due to these factors, the Company is not yet in a position to determine whether, and to what extent, it might repatriate foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to the United States. Based on its current analysis, the Company may repatriate up to $800.0 million, with a related income tax expense and liability of up to $56.0 million. The Company plans to finalize its assessment after Congress or the Treasury Department provides additional clarifying language on key elements of the repatriation provision. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a revision to Statement No. 123, Share Based Payment. This revision supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related implementation guidance. This revision requires companies to recognize the cost of stock options based on the grant date fair value pursuant to their employee stock option plans over the period during which the recipient is required to provide services in exchange for the options, typically the vesting period. Pursuant to the requirements of the Statement, the Company plans to adopt the provisions of the standard during the third quarter of 2005 using the modified retrospective transition method provided in the Statement. Under this method, the Company will restate all prior periods presented on a consistent basis. The Company does not believe the adoption of this Statement will have a material impact on the trend of net earnings or net earnings per share. 31 ITEM 7A.
