ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Level Overview Stryker Corporation (the Company or Stryker) is one of the worlds leading medical technology companies with the most broadly based range of products in orthopaedics and a significant presence in other medical specialties. Stryker works with respected medical professionals to help people lead more active and more satisfying lives. The Companys products include implants used in joint replacement, trauma, craniomaxillofacial and spinal surgeries; biologics; surgical, neurologic, ear, nose & throat and interventional pain equipment; endoscopic, surgical navigation, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. Stryker also provides outpatient physical therapy services in the United States. The Company segregates its operations into two reportable business segments: Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The Orthopaedic Implants segment sells orthopaedic reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma, spinal and micro implant systems, bone cement and the bone growth factor OP 1. The MedSurg Equipment segment sells surgical equipment; surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications, and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. The Other category includes Physical Therapy Services and corporate administration, interest expense and interest income. Domestic sales accounted for 65% of total revenues in 2005. Most of the Companys products are marketed directly to more than 6,000 hospitals and to doctors and other health care facilities by approximately 2,800 sales and marketing personnel in the United States. Stryker primarily maintains separate and dedicated sales forces for each of its principal product lines to provide focus and a high level of expertise to each medical specialty served. International sales accounted for 35% of total revenues in 2005. The Companys products are sold in more than 100 countries through both Company owned sales subsidiaries and branches and third party dealers and distributors. The Companys business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of orthopaedic implant surgeries is lower during the summer months. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company completed the repatriation of $722 million of foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act (the Act). The Act provided a temporary incentive for United States companies to repatriate accumulated income earned in foreign jurisdictions at a reduced income tax cost. Additional details, including the financial statement impact resulting from the repatriation of funds, are included in Results of Operations. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company acquired, by merger, all of the outstanding stock of PlasmaSol Corp. (PlasmaSol). PlasmaSol has developed a technology that should allow Stryker to provide sterilization equipment for use with certain of its MedSurg Equipment products. The cost of the transaction totaled approximately $17.5 million including an upfront cash payment plus the assumption of certain liabilities. In the first quarter of 2005, the Company acquired, by merger, eTrauma.com Corp. (eTrauma) for approximately $50.0 million in cash plus certain transaction costs. The acquisition expanded the Companys digital imaging equipment product offerings within its MedSurg Equipment segment by adding eTraumas proprietary Picture Archive and Communications Systems (PACS) image management and viewing software. In the third quarter of 2004, the Company completed its acquisition, by merger, of all of the outstanding stock of SpineCore, Inc. (SpineCore), for an upfront payment of $120.0 million in cash plus certain transaction costs. SpineCore is a developer of artificial lumbar and cervical discs. Terms of the transaction also include milestone and royalty payments of up to an additional $240.0 million upon the achievement of commercialization of SpineCores products in the United States, which is not expected to occur before 2008. This acquisition is 24 expected to enhance the Companys presence in the spinal implant market, an important growth area within its Orthopaedic Implants segment. Additional details, including the financial statement impacts resulting from these acquisitions, are included in Results of Operations. Outlook for 2006 The Companys outlook for 2006 continues to be optimistic regarding underlying growth rates in orthopaedic procedures and the Companys broadly based range of products in orthopaedics and other medical specialties, despite the potential for increased pricing pressure on Orthopaedic Implants products in the United States, Japan and certain other foreign markets. The Company projects diluted earnings per share of $2.02 in 2006, including the recognition of the cost of employee stock options as described in Other Matters. The projection represents a 21% increase over adjusted restated diluted net earnings per share of $1.67 in 2005 calculated as follows:  Adjusted restated diluted net earnings per share for 2005: Reported diluted net earnings per share $1.64 Deduct stock option compensation expense fair value method $(.08) Restated diluted net earnings per share $1.57 Adjustments: Purchased in process research and development $.04 Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings $.07 Adjusted restated diluted net earnings per share $1.67 The purchased in process research and development charge and the additional income taxes on the repatriation of foreign earnings are more fully described in Results of Operations. The financial forecast for 2006 includes a net sales increase in the range of 11% to 14% as a result of growth in shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment and higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services, offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, the Company anticipates an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately 2% to 3% in the first quarter of 2006 and an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately 1% to 2% for the full year of 2006. Excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects annual net sales growth in the range of 12% to 15% in 2006, which is comparable to the 14% sales growth, excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rates, reported for the full year of 2005. 25 Results of Operations The table below outlines the components of the consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of net sales and the year to year percentage change in dollar amounts:  Percentage of Net Sales Percentage Change 2005  2004  2003 2005/2004  2004/2003 Net sales 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 14% 18% Cost of sales 35.2 35.4 36.2 13 15 Gross profit 64.8 64.6 63.8 15 19 Research, development and engineering expenses 5.7 5.0 5.0 33 17 Selling, general and administrative expenses 37.2 38.8 39.1 10 17 Intangibles amortization 1.0 1.1 1.3 2 5 Purchased in process research and development 0.3 2.8 (87) Operating income 20.5 16.9 18.5 39 7 Other income (expense) 0.1 (0.1) (0.5) (82) Earnings before income taxes 20.6 16.8 18.0 40 10 Income taxes 6.7 5.9 5.5 31 26 Net earnings 13.9% 10.9% 12.5% 45 3 The table below sets forth domestic/international and product line sales information:   Net Sales (in millions)  Percentage Change 2005  2004  2003 2005/2004  2004/2003 Domestic/international sales: Domestic $3,165.6 $2,753.0 $2,333.4 15% 18% International 1,705.9 1,509.3 1,291.9 13 17 Total net sales $4,871.5 $4,262.3 $3,625.3 14 18 Product line sales: Orthopaedic Implants $2,855.1 $2,562.5 $2,192.5 11 17 MedSurg Equipment 1,753.8 1,454.9 1,209.8 21 20 Physical Therapy Services 262.6 244.9 223.0 7 10 Total net sales $4,871.5 $4,262.3 $3,625.3 14 18 26 The table below sets forth additional sales growth information for significant products within the Companys Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment product lines on both a reported basis and a constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates:   Percentage Change  2005/2004  2004/2003 Constant Constant Reported Currency Reported Currency Worldwide Orthopaedic Implants sales: Hips 4% 4% 14% 9% Knees 14 13 18 14 Trauma 15 16 17 11 Spine 17 17 18 15 Micro implants 12 12 16 12 Worldwide MedSurg Equipment sales: Surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems 16 16 17 15 Endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems 24 24 21 20 Patient handling and emergency medical equipment 23 22 25 23 2005 Compared with 2004 Stryker Corporations net sales increased 14% in 2005 to $4,871.5 million from $4,262.3 million in 2004. Net sales grew by 12% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix, 1% related to higher selling prices and 1% due to acquisitions. Domestic sales were $3,165.6 million for 2005, representing an increase of 15% as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment and higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services. International sales were $1,705.9 million for 2005, representing an increase of 13% as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $11.5 million for 2005. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, international sales increased 12% in 2005. Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $2,855.1 million for 2005, representing an increase of 11% as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive, trauma, spinal and micro implant systems; bone cement; and the bone growth factor OP 1. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 11% for the year. Hip Implant Systems: Sales of hip implant systems increased 4% during the year, and also 4% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, due to growth in the Trident hip system in Europe and the Pacific region and in Accolade cementless hip products and Restoration Modular Hip System revision hips in the United States, partially offset by lower sales of the Trident ceramic on ceramic hip system and hip fracture products in the United States. Knee Implant Systems: Sales of knee implant systems increased 14% during the year, 13% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, due to strong growth in the recently launched Triathlon Knee System in the United States, Europe and the Pacific region as well as the Scorpio knee system in Europe, Japan and the Pacific region. 27 Trauma Implant Systems: Sales of trauma implant systems increased 15% during the year, 16% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as a result of the full scale launch of the Gamma3 Hip Fracture System in the United States, Japan and Europe in the second half of 2004. Strong growth in the Companys T2 Nailing System, both in the United States and internationally, also drove trauma sales growth in 2005. Spinal Implant Systems: Sales of spinal implant systems increased 17% during the year, and also 17% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to strong sales growth of interbody devices in the United States led by sales of the recently launched AVS spacer products as well as solid worldwide growth in cervical and thoraco lumbar product sales. Micro Implant Systems: Sales of micro implant systems increased 12% during the year, and also 12% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as a result of strong worldwide sales of implant products for hand indications and solid domestic sales of products for neuro indications. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $1,753.8 million for 2005, representing an increase of 21% as a result of higher shipments of surgical equipment; surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 20% for the year. Surgical Equipment and Surgical Navigation Systems: Sales of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems increased 16% during the year, and also 16% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, due to strong worldwide sales growth in the System 5 heavy duty powered systems, interventional pain products, SteriShield personal protection systems and surgical navigation products as well as strong sales growth in the Neptune operating waste management system in the United States. Endoscopic, Communications and Digital Imaging Systems: Sales of endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems increased 24% during the year, and also 24% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as a result of strong growth in medical video imaging equipment, led by growth of digital imaging equipment and the 1088 High Definition Camera, and strong growth in general surgery products in the United States, partially offset by slower growth in arthroscopy in the United States resulting from the discontinuance of allograft products during the year. Patient Handling and Emergency Medical Equipment: Sales of patient handling and emergency medical equipment increased 23% during the year, 22% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, due to strong sales growth in hospital and maternity beds and emergency medical equipment in the United States and solid growth in stretcher sales in the United States. Physical Therapy Services revenues were $262.6 million for 2005, representing an increase of 7% with all of the growth coming from new physical therapy centers. Cost of sales represented 35.2% of sales in 2005 compared with 35.4% in 2004. The lower cost of sales percentage in 2005 is partially due to increased average selling prices for the Companys products and lower excess and obsolete inventory costs associated with discontinued products partially offset by faster sales growth in the lower margin MedSurg Equipment segment and higher growth in royalty costs relative to sales growth. Research, development and engineering expenses represented 5.7% of sales in 2005 compared with 5.0% in 2004. These expenses increased 33% in 2005 to $279.8 million. The higher spending level is the result of the Companys continued focus on new product development for anticipated future product launches and continued investments in new technologies, together with, beginning in the third quarter of 2004, spending associated with the continued development of products acquired from SpineCore. New product introductions in 2005 in the Orthopaedic Implants segment included X3 Polyethylene, the Companys next generation highly crosslinked polyethylene featuring a higher level of strength and wear reduction in both hip and knee replacements, and the posterior stabilized version of the Triathlon Knee System in the United States, Europe, Canada and the Pacific region. Within the MedSurg Equipment segment, new product introductions in 2005 included the Maestro drill which expanded the Companys line of micro powered instruments for spine; neurology; and ear, nose and throat applications. 28 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10% in 2005 and represented 37.2% of sales compared with 38.8% in 2004. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2005 is due to lower meeting costs and slower growth in advertising costs and insurance premiums relative to the Companys growth in net sales. These decreases are partially offset by an increase in sales commission expense as a result of the 14% growth in net sales in 2005 in addition to higher amortization expense associated with loaner instrument sets. The purchased in process research and development charge of $15.9 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 relates to the acquisition of PlasmaSol, a private, development stage company. At the date of the acquisition, the sterilization technology acquired had not yet been approved for sale by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and, therefore, had not yet reached technological feasibility. The purchase price of $17.5 million was preliminarily allocated to assets acquired primarily for deferred tax assets associated with acquired net operating losses and purchased in process research and development based on their fair value at the date of acquisition. The purchased in process research and development charge of $120.8 million recorded in the third quarter of 2004 relates to the acquisition of SpineCore, a private, development stage company. At the date of the acquisition, the artificial lumbar and cervical spinal disc implant technologies acquired were in preliminary stages of clinical studies in the United States and had not yet reached technological feasibility. The upfront payment of $120.0 million, plus certain transaction costs, was allocated to assets acquired, purchased in process research and development and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. Interest expense, which is included in other income (expense), increased to $7.7 million in 2005 from $6.8 million in 2004, primarily as a result of increased borrowings in Europe to complete the repatriation of foreign earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005. Interest income, which is included in other income (expense), increased to $13.3 million in 2005 from $4.7 million in 2004, primarily due to increased cash and marketable securities balances throughout the year. The effective income tax rate was 32.7% for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 35.0% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The reported effective income tax rate for 2005 reflects a charge of $27.4 million to recognize the income tax expense and related liability associated with the repatriation of $722 million of foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act completed in the fourth quarter. The reported effective income tax rate for 2005 also reflects the nondeductibility, for income tax purposes, of the $15.9 million purchased in process research and development charge associated with the PlasmaSol acquisition. The reported effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2004 reflects the nondeductibility, for income tax purposes, of the $120.8 million purchased in process research and development charge associated with the SpineCore acquisition. Excluding the impact of income taxes on the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005 and the impact of the purchased in process research and development charges in 2005 and 2004, the Companys effective income tax rate was reduced to 29.5% in 2005 compared with 30.0% in 2004, primarily as a result of increased manufacturing in lower tax jurisdictions. Net earnings in 2005 increased 45% to $675.2 million from $465.7 million in 2004; basic net earnings per share increased 44% to $1.67 in 2005 from $1.16 in 2004; and diluted net earnings per share increased 44% to $1.64 in 2005 from $1.14 in 2004. Excluding the impacts of the charges to write off purchased in process research and development in 2005 and 2004 and to recognize income tax expense associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005, adjusted net earnings increased 23% to $718.5 million in 2005 from $586.5 million in 2004. Adjusted basic net earnings per share increased 22% to $1.78 in 2005 from $1.46 in 2004, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share increased 22% to $1.75 in 2005 from $1.43 in 2004. This adjusted financial measure does not replace the presentation of the Companys reported financial results stated under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company has provided this supplemental non GAAP financial measure because it provides meaningful information regarding the Companys results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented. Management uses this non GAAP financial measure for reviewing the operating results of its business segments and for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process. In addition, the Company believes investors will utilize this information to evaluate period to period results and to better understand potential future operating results. The 29 Company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its Consolidated Financial Statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely solely on any single financial measure. The reconciliation of this non GAAP financial measure is as follows (in millions):  2005 2004 % Change Reported net earnings $675.2 $465.7 45% Purchased in process research and development 15.9 120.8 (87) Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings 27.4 Adjusted net earnings $718.5 $586.5 23 Basic net earnings per share: Reported basic net earnings per share $1.67 $1.16 44 Purchased in process research and development $.04 $.30 (87) Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings $.07 Adjusted basic net earnings per share $1.78 $1.46 22 Diluted net earnings per share: Reported diluted net earnings per share $1.64 $1.14 44 Purchased in process research and development $.04 $.29 (86) Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings $.07 Adjusted diluted net earnings per share $1.75 $1.43 22 2004 Compared with 2003 Stryker Corporations net sales increased 18% in 2004 to $4,262.3 million from $3,625.3 million in 2003. Net sales grew by 13% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix, 3% due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and 2% related to higher selling prices. Domestic sales were $2,753.0 million for 2004, representing an increase of 18% as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment and higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services. International sales were $1,509.3 million for 2004, representing an increase of 17% as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $120.8 million for 2004. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, international sales increased 7% in 2004. Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $2,562.5 million for 2004, representing an increase of 17% as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive, trauma, spinal and micro implant systems; bone cement; and the bone growth factor OP 1. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 13% for the year. Hip Implant Systems: Sales of hip implant systems increased 14% during the year, 9% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Sales growth for hip products slowed during 2004 primarily due to tougher comparables resulting from the launch of the Trident ceramic on ceramic hip system in the United States in the second quarter of 2003. Knee Implant Systems: Sales of knee implant systems increased 18% during the year, 14% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, due to strong growth in Scorpio and Duracon knee systems in the United States. Trauma Implant Systems: Sales of trauma implant systems increased 17% during the year, 11% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as a result of the full scale launch of the Gamma3 Hip Fracture System in the United States, Japan and Europe in 2004. Strong growth in the Companys T2 Nailing System, both in the United States and internationally, also drove trauma sales growth in 2004. 30 Spinal Implant Systems: Sales of spinal implant systems increased 18% during the year, 15% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to strong sales growth of cervical and interbody products in the United States. Micro Implant Systems: Sales of micro implant systems increased 16% during the year, 12% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as a result of strong sales of implant products for hand indications and solid domestic sales of implant products for neuro indications. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $1,454.9 million for 2004, representing an increase of 20% as a result of higher shipments of surgical equipment; surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 18% for the year. Surgical Equipment and Surgical Navigation Systems: Sales of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems increased 17% during the year, 15% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, due to strong sales growth in heavy duty powered instruments, interventional pain products and surgical navigation systems both domestically and in Europe. Endoscopic, Communications and Digital Imaging Systems: Sales of endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems increased 21% during the year, 20% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as a result of solid growth in digital imaging equipment and sports medicine products in the United States. Patient Handling and Emergency Medical Equipment: Sales of patient handling and emergency medical equipment increased 25% during the year, 23% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, due to strong growth in hospital beds and emergency medical equipment both domestically and in the international markets. Physical Therapy Services revenues were $244.9 million for 2004, representing an increase of 10%, with 6% of the growth resulting from new physical therapy centers and 4% of the increase coming from higher revenues at existing centers. Cost of sales represented 35.4% of sales in 2004 compared with 36.2% in 2003. The lower cost of sales percentage in 2004 is partially due to increased average selling prices for the Companys products and improved manufacturing efficiencies at several of the Companys manufacturing and distribution facilities, including its Mahwah, New Jersey, manufacturing and distribution facility, and lower purchase prices of raw materials, including cobalt chromium and titanium alloys. Research, development and engineering expenses represented 5.0% of sales in both 2004 and 2003. These expenses increased 17% in 2004 to $211.0 million. The higher spending level is the result of final development spending in advance of the Companys product launches in 2004 and continued focus on new product development for anticipated future product launches, together with, beginning in the third quarter of 2004, spending associated with the continued development of products acquired from SpineCore. New product introductions in 2004 in the Orthopaedic Implants segment included the Restoration Modular Hip System in the United States and Europe; the Triathlon Knee System in the United States and Europe; the Scorpio NRG knee and CentPillar hip systems in Japan; a worldwide launch of the OASYS posterior cervical fixation system; and a full scale launch of the Gamma3 Hip Fracture System in the United States, Japan and Europe. The Triathlon Knee System represents the Companys evolutionary design developed to more closely reproduce natural knee motion and to provide mobility with stability through more than 150 degrees of flexion. Within the MedSurg Equipment segment, new product introductions in 2004 included a new video platform with the 1088 High Definition Camera, the first fully digital, high definition, progressive scan medical video camera, and the new M Series stretcher, designed to fit the needs of acute care and specialty surgical care facilities. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 17% in 2004 and represented 38.8% of sales compared with 39.1% in 2003. The 17% increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is partially due to an increase in sales commission expense as a result of the 18% increase in net sales in 2004, increased meeting costs and higher amortization expense associated with loaner instrument sets. In addition, the Company incurred 31 a $12.1 million increase in insurance costs during 2004 resulting from increased premiums charged by third party insurers and its wholly owned captive insurance company established in 2003 as more fully described in Other Matters. The purchased in process research and development charge of $120.8 million recorded in the third quarter of 2004 relates to the acquisition of SpineCore. Interest expense, which is included in other income (expense), declined to $6.8 million in 2004 from $22.6 million in 2003, primarily as a result of lower outstanding debt balances. The effective income tax rate was 35.0% in 2004. The reported effective income tax rate for 2004 reflects the nondeductibility, for income tax purposes, of the purchased in process research and development charge associated with the SpineCore acquisition. Excluding the effect of this nondeductible charge, the Companys effective income tax rate was reduced to 30.0% in 2004 compared with 30.5% in 2003, primarily as a result of increased manufacturing in lower tax jurisdictions. Net earnings in 2004 increased 3% to $465.7 million from $453.5 million in 2003; basic net earnings per share increased 2% to $1.16 in 2004 from $1.14 in 2003; and diluted net earnings per share increased 3% to $1.14 in 2004 from $1.11 in 2003. Excluding the impact of the $120.8 million purchased in process research and development charge recorded in 2004, adjusted net earnings increased 29% to $586.5 million in 2004 from $453.5 million in 2003. Adjusted basic net earnings per share increased 28% to $1.46 in 2004 from $1.14 in 2003, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share increased 29% to $1.43 in 2004 from $1.11 in 2003. The reconciliation of this non GAAP financial measure, as previously described, is as follows (in millions):  2004 2003 % Change Reported net earnings $465.7 $453.5 3% Purchased in process research and development 120.8 Adjusted net earnings $586.5 $453.5 29 Basic net earnings per share: Reported basic net earnings per share $1.16 $1.14 2 Purchased in process research and development $.30 Adjusted basic net earnings per share $1.46 $1.14 28 Diluted net earnings per share: Reported diluted net earnings per share $1.14 $1.11 3 Purchased in process research and development $.29 Adjusted diluted net earnings per share $1.43 $1.11 29 Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys working capital at December 31, 2005 increased $592.2 million to $1,621.3 million from $1,029.1 million at December 31, 2004. The increase in working capital resulted from growth in the Companys overall business and the use of cash earnings to fund increases in accounts receivable, inventories and prepaid expenses. Accrued liabilities increased in 2005 as a result of the growth in the business, higher obligations for acquisitions, sales commissions, royalties, dividends and increases in other accrued liabilities. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding was 54 days at December 31, 2005 compared with 58 days at December 31, 2004. Days sales in inventory decreased 8 days to 114 days at December 31, 2005 from 122 days at December 31, 2004. The decrease in days sales outstanding and days sales in inventory at December 31, 2005 is primarily due to improved asset management. 32 The Company generated cash of $863.8 million from operations in 2005 compared with $593.3 million in 2004. The increase in cash from operations in 2005 compared with the prior year is primarily due to higher net earnings in 2005 and the elimination of amounts outstanding under the accounts receivable securitization facility representing an operating cash usage of $150.0 million in 2004 along with the improvements in days sales outstanding and days sales in inventory. In 2005, the Company used cash of $271.7 million for capital expenditures, including $50.9 million for the expansion of the companys manufacturing facility in Lebanon, New Hampshire; $41.5 million related to the implementation of ERP systems at multiple manufacturing and distribution facilities; $27.3 million for the construction of the Companys new manufacturing facilities in Portage, Michigan; and $20.1 million for the Companys new manufacturing facility in Neuchtel, Switzerland. In addition, the Company used cash of $59.7 million for acquisitions and $36.2 million for the payment of dividends; it also purchased and sold marketable securities. These securities, which are classified as available for sale investments in accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, totaled $565.3 million at December 31, 2005. In the first quarter of 2005, the Company acquired eTrauma for approximately $50.0 million in cash plus certain transaction costs. The acquisition of eTrauma was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The results of operations for the acquired business are included in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of the acquisition and did not materially impact the Companys reported operating results. Pro forma consolidated results of operations would not differ significantly as a result of the eTrauma acquisition. The purchase price for eTrauma has been preliminarily allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. Based on the preliminary purchase price allocation, $22.0 million was allocated to identifiable intangibles, to be amortized over their remaining lives of 5 to 8 years, and $31.6 million was allocated to goodwill. Immediately after the acquisition was consummated, management of the Company began to implement an integration plan to combine Stryker and eTrauma. In conjunction with the integration plan, the Company recorded additional purchase liabilities for severance and related costs of $0.3 million, which were included in the purchase price allocation. The Company had $491.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and $565.3 million in marketable securities at December 31, 2005. The Company also had outstanding borrowings totaling $231.6 million at that date. Current maturities of long term debt at December 31, 2005 were $47.4 million. The Company believes its cash on hand and marketable securities, as well as anticipated cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to fund future operating capital requirements; future manufacturing facility construction and other capital expenditures; future business and product line acquisitions to supplement its current product offerings; loaner instrumentation for surgical implants in support of new product launches; and required debt repayments. In November 2005, the Company established a $1,000.0 million Unsecured Credit Facility, which replaced the previously outstanding $750.0 million Unsecured Credit Facility. The new facility, which expires in November 2010, includes a senior term loan with an original principal amount of &euro;190.0 million and a senior 5 year nonamortizing, revolving credit agreement with a maximum amount of $1,000.0 million, less any outstanding amount of the senior term loan. A total of &euro;190.0 million was drawn under the senior term loan to facilitate the repatriation of foreign earnings and remains outstanding at December 31, 2005. Should additional funds be required, the Company had $842.1 million of additional borrowing capacity available under all of its existing credit facilities, including the Companys $1,000.0 million Unsecured Credit Facility. In addition, the Company had $200.0 million of eligible accounts receivable that could be sold through its accounts receivable securitization facility at December 31, 2005. 33 The Companys future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than 1 year, including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business, are summarized as follows (in millions):  Payment Period 2006  2007  2008  2009  2010  Thereafter Long term debt $47.4 $48.2 $47.3 $47.3 $41.4 $0.0 Operating leases 51.2 42.9 35.4 26.0 17.1 48.4 Unconditional purchase obligations 165.7 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 The Companys additional borrowing capacity, along with the expected expiration period of the commitments, is summarized as follows (in millions):  Amount of Commitment Total Expiration Per Period Amount Less than In excess of Committed 1 year 1 year Unsecured revolving credit agreement and other lines of credit $842.1 $112.8 $729.3 Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Estimates are based on historical experience, when available, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes that of its significant accounting policies (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), an understanding of the following critical accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable. The Company makes estimates regarding the future ability of its customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends. If actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional accounts receivable write offs may be necessary, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. Inventory Reserves The Company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. The markets in which the Company operates are highly competitive, with new products and surgical procedures being introduced on an ongoing basis. Such marketplace changes may cause some of the Companys products to become obsolete. The Company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. 34 Income Taxes The Company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States. Accordingly, management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions. Tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and product royalty arrangements, may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates. Because tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant, the Company records accruals representing managements best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters. These income tax accruals are included within the income taxes liability in the consolidated balance sheets. To the extent additional information becomes available, such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable outcome. Other Matters The Company distributes its products throughout the world. As a result, the Companys financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets. The Companys operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the United States dollar and the Japanese yen and European currencies, in particular the euro and the British pound. When the United States dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies increases. When the United States dollar strengthens, the opposite situation occurs. The Company manufactures its products in the United States, France, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, Canada and Puerto Rico and incurs the costs to manufacture in the applicable local currencies. This worldwide deployment of factories serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the Companys cost of sales. The Company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk to the Company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products. The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies. At December 31, 2005, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $131.6 million and sell $92.1 million of various currencies (principally United States dollars and euros) with maturities ranging principally from 30 to 180 days. The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points. A hypothetical 10% change in exchange rates for these currencies would change the December 31, 2005 fair value by approximately $0.2 million. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties. The Company has certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged. These investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currencies that are deferred and recorded as a separate component of shareholders equity. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar decreased the value of these investments in net assets, and the related deferred gain in shareholders equity, by $192.9 million to $17.0 million. The Company is partially self insured for product liability claims and utilizes a wholly owned captive insurance company in the United States to manage its self insured retention limits. The captive insurance company provides insurance reserves for estimated liabilities for product claims incurred but not reported based on actuarially determined liabilities. The actuarial valuations are based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events. 35 In December 2003, the Company announced that it and its subsidiary Physiotherapy Associates, Inc., received a subpoena from the United States Attorneys Office in Boston, Massachusetts, in connection with a Department of Justice investigation of Physiotherapy Associates billing and coding practices. In March 2005, the Company announced that it received a subpoena from the United States Department of Justice requesting documents for the period January 2002 through the present relating to "any and all consulting contracts, professional service agreements, or remuneration agreements between Stryker Corporation and any orthopedic surgeon, orthopedic surgeon in training, or medical school graduate using or considering the surgical use of hip or knee joint replacement/reconstruction products manufactured or sold by Stryker Corporation." The Company is fully cooperating with the Department of Justice regarding these matters. In December 2004, the FASB issued a revision to Statement No. 123, Share Based Payment. This revision supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related implementation guidance. On April 14, 2005, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a new rule allowing companies to delay the required adoption date of the revised Statement to their first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. Based on this ruling, the Company will adopt the provisions of the revised Statement effective January 1, 2006 rather than July 1, 2005 as initially required by the revised Statement. The revised Statement requires companies to recognize the cost of stock options based on the grant date fair value determined under their employee stock option plans over the period during which the recipient is required to provide services in exchange for the options, typically the vesting period. The Company plans to adopt the provisions of the revised Statement using the modified retrospective transition method provided in the revised Statement. Under this method, the Company will restate all prior periods presented on a consistent basis, based on the pro forma expense previously disclosed under Statement No. 123. As a result, the Companys net earnings for 2005, 2004 and 2003 will be reduced by $31.6 million, $25.7 million and $19.1 million, respectively, or $.08, $.06, and $.04 per diluted share, respectively. The Company does not believe the adoption of the revised Statement will have a material impact on the trend of net earnings or net earnings per share.  ITEM 7A.
