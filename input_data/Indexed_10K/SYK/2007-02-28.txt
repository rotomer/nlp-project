ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Throughout this discussion, references are made to the following financial measures: "constant currency," "adjusted net earnings," "adjusted basic net earnings per share" and "adjusted diluted net earnings per share." These financial measures do not replace the presentation of Stryker Corporations (the Company or Stryker) reported financial results under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company has provided these supplemental non GAAP financial measures because they provide meaningful information regarding the Companys results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented. Management uses these non GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of its business segments, for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process and bases certain annual bonus plans on these non GAAP financial measures. In order to measure the Companys sales performance on a constant currency basis, it is necessary to remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which affects the comparability and trend of sales. In order to measure the Companys earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, it is necessary to exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. These items include purchased in process research and development charges recorded in 2006, 2005 and 2004 and the additional income taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings recorded in 2005. Additional details regarding the nature, determination and financial statement impact of these items are included in Results of Operations. Given the nature of these items, management believes that excluding them from certain financial metrics is more representative of the Companys past and potential future operational performance. In addition, the Company believes investors will utilize this information to evaluate period to period results on a comparable basis and to better understand potential future operating results. The Company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its Consolidated Financial Statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely solely on any single financial measure. Executive Level Overview Stryker is one of the worlds leading medical technology companies with the most broadly based range of products in orthopaedics and a significant presence in other medical specialties. Stryker works with respected medical professionals to help people lead more active and more satisfying lives. The Companys products include implants used in joint replacement, trauma, craniomaxillofacial and spinal surgeries; biologics; surgical, neurologic, ear, nose & throat and interventional pain equipment; endoscopic, surgical navigation, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. Stryker also provides outpatient physical therapy services in the United States. 25 The Company segregates its operations into two reportable business segments: Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The Orthopaedic Implants segment sells orthopaedic reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma, spinal and craniomaxillofacial implant systems, bone cement and the bone growth factor OP 1. The MedSurg Equipment segment sells surgical equipment; surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. The Other category includes Physical Therapy Services and corporate administration, interest expense and interest and marketable securities income. Domestic sales accounted for 66% of total revenues in 2006. Most of the Companys products are marketed directly to doctors, hospitals and other health care facilities by approximately 3,200 sales and marketing personnel in the United States. Stryker primarily maintains separate and dedicated sales forces for each of its principal product lines to provide focus and a high level of expertise to each medical specialty served. International sales accounted for 34% of total revenues in 2006. The Companys products are sold in more than 100 countries through both Company owned sales subsidiaries and branches as well as third party dealers and distributors. The Companys business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of orthopaedic implant surgeries is lower during the summer months. In the first quarter of 2006, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Sightline Technologies Ltd. (Sightline), a private, development stage company, for an upfront payment of $50.0 million in cash plus certain transaction costs and the assumption of certain liabilities. Sightline is a developer of flexible endoscopes that should improve insertion and sterilization during colonoscopy procedures. This acquisition is expected to enhance the Companys presence in the gastrointestinal and other markets within its MedSurg Equipment segment. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company acquired, by merger, all of the outstanding stock of PlasmaSol Corp. (PlasmaSol). PlasmaSol has developed a technology that should allow Stryker to provide sterilization equipment for use with certain of its MedSurg Equipment products. The cost of the transaction totaled $17.5 million including an upfront cash payment plus the assumption of certain liabilities. In the first quarter of 2005, the Company acquired, by merger, all of the outstanding stock of eTrauma.com Corp. (eTrauma) for $50.0 million in cash plus certain transaction costs. The acquisition expanded the Companys digital imaging equipment product offerings within its MedSurg Equipment segment by adding eTraumas proprietary Picture Archive and Communications Systems (PACS) image management and viewing software. In the third quarter of 2004, the Company acquired, by merger, all of the outstanding stock of SpineCore, Inc. (SpineCore), for an upfront payment of $120.0 million in cash plus certain transaction costs. SpineCore is a developer of artificial lumbar and cervical discs. This acquisition is expected to enhance the Companys presence in the spinal implant market, an important growth area within its Orthopaedic Implants segment. Additional details, including the financial statement impacts resulting from these acquisitions, are included in Results of Operations. On December 31, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). The Statement requires an entity to recognize, on its balance sheet, an asset or liability reflecting the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans as the difference between the projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets with changes continuing to be reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) component of shareholders equity net of related income taxes. This Statement does not change the calculation of the amount of net periodic benefit cost included in net earnings. As a result of the adoption of the Statement, the funded status of the Companys defined benefit pension plans resulted in the recognition, in the Companys December 31, 2006 consolidated balance sheet, of an 26 additional $22.8 million liability with corresponding changes in accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) and deferred income taxes. The adoption of the Statement did not require a restatement of prior periods. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No. 123 (revised), Share Based Payment. The revised Statement requires companies to measure the cost of employee stock options based on the grant date fair value and recognize that cost over the period during which a recipient is required to provide services in exchange for the options, typically the vesting period. The Company adopted the provisions of the revised Statement using the modified retrospective transition method provided in the revised Statement. Under this method, the Company restated all prior periods presented on a consistent basis, based on the pro forma expense previously disclosed. Additional details, including the financial statement impact resulting from this adoption, are included in Results of Operations. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company completed the repatriation of $722 million of foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act (the Act). The Act provided a temporary incentive for United States companies to repatriate accumulated income earned in foreign jurisdictions at a reduced income tax cost. Additional details, including the financial statement impact resulting from the repatriation of funds, are included in Results of Operations. Outlook for 2007 The Companys outlook for 2007 continues to be optimistic regarding underlying growth rates in orthopaedic procedures and the Companys broadly based range of products in orthopaedics and other medical specialties, despite the potential for increased pricing pressure in certain markets. The Company projects that diluted net earnings per share for 2007 will approximate $2.42, representing a 28% increase over diluted net earnings per share of $1.89 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Excluding the impact of the charge to write off purchased in process research and development associated with the acquisition of Sightline in 2006, as more fully described in Results of Operations, the Company projects that diluted net earnings per share for 2007 will increase 20% over adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $2.02 for the year ended December 31, 2006. The financial forecast for 2007 includes a constant currency net sales increase in the range of 11% to 13% as a result of growth in shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment which is comparable to the 11% constant currency net sales increase reported for the full year of 2006. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, the Company anticipates a favorable impact on net sales of approximately 1% to 2% in the first quarter of 2007 and a favorable impact on net sales of approximately 0% to 1% for the full year of 2007. 27 Results of Operations The table below outlines the components of the consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of net sales and the year to year percentage change in dollar amounts:  Percentage of Net Sales Percentage Change 2006  2005  2004 2006/2005  2005/2004 Net sales 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 11% 14% Cost of sales 34.2 35.3 35.5 8 14 Gross profit 65.8 64.7 64.5 13 15 Research, development and engineering expenses 6.0 5.8 5.0 14 32 Selling, general and administrative expenses 38.1 38.0 39.5 11 10 Intangibles amortization 0.8 1.0 1.1 (11) 2 Purchased in process research and development 1.0 0.3 2.8 231 (87) Operating income 19.9 19.5 16.0 13 39 Other income (expense) 0.5 0.1 (0.1) 556 Earnings before income taxes 20.4 19.6 15.9 16 41 Income taxes 6.0 6.4 5.6 5 31 Net earnings 14.4% 13.2% 10.3% 21 46 The table below sets forth domestic/international and product line sales information:  Net Sales (in millions)  Percentage Change 2006  2005  2004 2006/2005  2005/2004 Domestic/international sales: Domestic $3,556.8 $3,165.6 $2,753.0 12% 15% International 1,848.8 1,705.9 1,509.3 8 13 Total net sales $5,405.6 $4,871.5 $4,262.3 11 14 Product line sales: Orthopaedic Implants $3,110.1 $2,849.5 $2,556.2 9 11 MedSurg Equipment 2,037.1 1,759.4 1,461.2 16 20 Physical Therapy Services 258.4 262.6 244.9 (2) 7 Total net sales $5,405.6 $4,871.5 $4,262.3 11 14 28 The table below sets forth additional sales growth information for significant products within the Companys Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment product lines on both a reported basis and a constant currency basis:   Percentage Change  2006/2005  2005/2004 Constant Constant Reported Currency Reported Currency Worldwide Orthopaedic Implants sales: Hips 2% 2% 4% 4% Knees 12 12 14 14 Trauma 13 14 17 17 Spine 18 18 17 17 Craniomaxillofacial 16 16 8 7 Worldwide MedSurg Equipment sales: Surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems 12 12 16 16 Endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems 19 19 24 24 Patient handling and emergency medical equipment 18 17 23 22 2006 Compared with 2005 Stryker Corporations net sales increased 11% in 2006 to $5,405.6 million from $4,871.5 million in 2005. Net sales grew by 10% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix and 1% as a result of higher selling prices. Domestic sales were $3,556.8 million for 2006, representing an increase of 12% as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. International sales were $1,848.8 million for 2006, representing an increase of 8% as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was unfavorable by $5.2 million for 2006. On a constant currency basis, international sales increased 9% in 2006. Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $3,110.1 million for 2006, representing an increase of 9%, on both a reported and constant currency basis, as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive, trauma, spinal and craniomaxillofacial implant systems; bone cement; and the bone growth factor OP 1. Hip Implant Systems: Sales of hip implant systems increased 2% during the year on both a reported and constant currency basis. In the United States, sales growth was driven by sales of the recently launched X3 polyethylene and increased sales in Accolade cementless hip products and Restoration Modular Hip System revision hip products, partially offset by declines in sales of other hip systems. Solid growth in the Trident Hip System, Accolade cementless hip products and Restoration Modular Hip System revision hip products in Europe as well as solid growth in Accolade cementless hip products and the Trident Hip System in the Pacific region also contributed to the sales growth in hip implant systems. Knee Implant Systems: Sales of knee implant systems increased 12% during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, due to strong growth in the Triathlon Knee System in the United States, Europe and the Pacific region and solid growth in the Scorpio Knee System in most international markets, partially offset by slower growth in Japan as a result of government imposed price cuts. 29 Trauma Implant Systems: Sales of trauma implant systems increased 13% during the year, 14% on a constant currency basis, as a result of strong worldwide sales growth in the Gamma3 Hip Fracture System and strong sales growth in the T2 Nailing System in the United States and Europe, partially offset by slower growth in Japan as a result of the price cuts. Spinal Implant Systems: Sales of spinal implant systems increased 18% during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, primarily due to strong worldwide sales growth of interbody devices led by sales of the AVS vertebral spacer system as well as solid worldwide sales growth in thoraco lumbar products. Craniomaxillofacial Implant Systems: Sales of craniomaxillofacial implant systems increased 16% during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, as a result of strong domestic sales growth led by products for neurologic indications and craniomaxillofacial implants. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $2,037.1 million for 2006, representing an increase of 16%, on both a reported and constant currency basis, as a result of higher shipments of surgical equipment; surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. Surgical Equipment and Surgical Navigation Systems: Sales of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems increased 12% during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, due to strong domestic sales growth in surgical navigation systems and operating room equipment and solid domestic sales growth in interventional pain products. Strong sales growth in powered surgical instruments outside the United States also led to the Companys sales growth. Endoscopic,Communications and Digital Imaging Systems: Sales of endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems increased 19% during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, as a result of strong worldwide sales growth in medical video imaging equipment led by the recently launched 1188 HD Camera and related accessories as well as imaging and communications products. Strong worldwide sales growth in general surgery products also contributed to the Companys sales growth. Patient Handling and Emergency Medical Equipment: Sales of patient handling and emergency medical equipment increased 18% during the year, 17% on a constant currency basis, due to strong sales growth in hospital bed products in the United States, Latin America and Canada, strong domestic sales growth in emergency medical equipment as well as solid stretcher sales growth in Europe and Latin America. Physical Therapy Services revenues were $258.4 million for 2006, representing a decrease of 2% primarily due to lower revenues from existing centers. Cost of sales represented 34.2% of sales in 2006 compared with 35.3% in 2005. The lower cost of sales percentage in 2006 is primarily due to lower excess and obsolete inventory costs as a result of fewer comparative product introductions during the year and reduced royalty costs related to the expiration of certain royalty agreements partially offset by faster sales growth in the lower margin MedSurg Equipment segment. Research, development and engineering expenses represented 6.0% of sales in 2006 compared with 5.8% in 2005. These expenses increased 14% in 2006 to $324.6 million. The higher spending level is the result of the Companys continued focus on new product development for anticipated future product launches and continued investments in new technologies. New product introductions in 2006 for the Orthopaedic Implants segment included the LFIT Anatomic Femoral Heads with X3 polyethylene liners which address range of motion and dislocation potential and the AVS AS Spacer which is used for anterior lumbar interbody fusion. Within the MedSurg Equipment segment, new product introductions in 2006 included the 1188 HD Camera and related accessories, the next generation of Stryker 3 Chip HD Cameras, the System 6 heavy duty power system and the Precision Oscillating Tip Saw which features a stationary blade shaft with an oscillating tip. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 11% in 2006 and represented 38.1% of sales compared with 38.0% in 2005. The slight increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of 30 sales in 2006 is due to higher sales related costs, primarily compensation, loaner instrumentation amortization and sample expenses, partially offset by decreases in insurance costs and slower growth in discretionary spending. The purchased in process research and development charge of $52.7 million recorded in the first quarter of 2006 relates to the acquisition of Sightline. At the date of the acquisition, the flexible endoscope technologies acquired had not yet reached technological feasibility. The upfront payment of $50.0 million, plus certain transaction costs and the assumption of certain liabilities, was preliminarily allocated to assets acquired, purchased in process research and development and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. The purchased in process research and development charge of $15.9 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 relates to the acquisition of PlasmaSol. At the date of the acquisition, the sterilization technology acquired had not yet been approved for sale by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and, therefore, had not yet reached technological feasibility. The purchase price of $17.5 million was allocated to assets acquired, primarily for deferred income tax assets associated with acquired net operating losses, and purchased in process research and development based on their fair value at the date of acquisition. The Company believes that the technologies acquired in both the Sightline and PlasmaSol acquisitions will result in the introduction of new products and additional future sales. However, factors including regulatory delays, safety concerns or patent disputes could delay the introduction or marketing of these potential new products. Additionally, unanticipated issues may arise during current and future clinical trials that could delay or terminate a products development prior to regulatory approval. The Company may experience an unfavorable impact on its operating results if it is unable to capitalize on those efforts by attaining the proper FDA approval. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has not encountered significant issues and expects completion of the development and initial commercialization of the flexible endoscope technologies and the sterilization technologies in 2007 and 2008, respectively. As a result of the adoption of FASB Statement No. 123 (revised) requiring the expensing of stock options, the Companys operating income for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was reduced by $56.2 million and $48.7 million, respectively, and the Companys net earnings for the same periods were reduced by $36.5 million and $31.6 million, respectively. Basic and diluted net earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 were reduced by $.09 and $.08, respectively. Interest and marketable securities income, which is included in other income (expense), increased to $41.4 million in 2006 from $13.3 million in 2005, primarily as a result of increased cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances compared to the year earlier period. Interest expense, which is included in other income (expense), increased to $9.5 million in 2006 from $7.7 million in 2005, primarily as a result of borrowings in Europe to complete the repatriation of foreign earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005. The Companys effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 29.5% as compared to an effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005 of 32.6%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflects the impact of the nondeductibility for income tax purposes of the purchased in process research and development charge associated with the acquisition of Sightline. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005 reflects the impact of the nondeductibility for income tax purposes of the purchased in process research and development charge associated with the acquisition of PlasmaSol as well as the income taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings. After considering these factors, the Companys reported effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 are lower than the United States statutory income tax rate primarily as a result of manufacturing in lower tax, international jurisdictions. Net earnings in 2006 increased 21% to $777.7 million from $643.6 million in 2005; basic net earnings per share increased 20% to $1.91 in 2006 from $1.59 in 2005; and diluted net earnings per share increased 20% to $1.89 in 2006 from $1.57 in 2005. Excluding the impacts of the charges to write off purchased in process research and development in 2006 and 2005 and to recognize the income tax expense associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005, adjusted net earnings increased 21% to $830.4 million in 2006 from $686.9 million in 2005. Adjusted basic net 31 earnings per share increased 20% to $2.04 in 2006 from $1.70 in 2005, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share increased 21% to $2.02 in 2006 from $1.67 in 2005. The reconciliations of these non GAAP financial measures are as follows (in millions except per share amounts):  2006 2005 % Change Reported net earnings $777.7 $643.6 21% Purchased in process research and development 52.7 15.9 231 Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings 27.4 Adjusted net earnings $830.4 $686.9 21 Basic net earnings per share: Reported basic net earnings per share $1.91 $1.59 20 Purchased in process research and development $.13 $.04 225 Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings $.07 Adjusted basic net earnings per share $2.04 $1.70 20 Weighted average basic shares outstanding 406.5 403.7 Diluted net earnings per share: Reported diluted net earnings per share $1.89 $1.57 20 Purchased in process research and development $.13 $.04 225 Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings $.07 Adjusted diluted net earnings per share $2.02 $1.67 21 Weighted average diluted shares outstanding 411.8 410.8 The weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of these non GAAP financial measures are the same as the weighted average shares outstanding used in the calculation of the reported per share amounts. 2005 Compared with 2004 Stryker Corporations net sales increased 14% in 2005 to $4,871.5 million from $4,262.3 million in 2004. Net sales grew by 12% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix, 1% related to higher selling prices and 1% due to acquisitions. Domestic sales were $3,165.6 million for 2005, representing an increase of 15% as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment and higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services. International sales were $1,705.9 million for 2005, representing an increase of 13% as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $11.5 million for 2005. On a constant currency basis, international sales increased 12% in 2005. Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $2,849.5 million for 2005, representing an increase of 11% as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive, trauma, spinal and craniomaxillofacial implant systems; bone cement; and the bone growth factor OP 1. Sales of Orthopaedic Implants also increased 11% for the year on a constant currency basis. Hip Implant Systems: Sales of hip implant systems increased 4% during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, due to growth in sales of the Trident Hip System in Europe and the Pacific region and in Accolade cementless hip products and Restoration Modular Hip System revision hips in the United States, partially offset by lower sales of the Trident ceramic on ceramic hip system and hip fracture products in the United States. 32 Knee Implant Systems: Sales of knee implant systems increased 14% during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, due to strong sales growth in the recently launched Triathlon Knee System in the United States, Europe and the Pacific region as well as the Scorpio Knee System in Europe, Japan and the Pacific region. Trauma Implant Systems: Sales of trauma implant systems increased 17% during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, as a result of the full scale launch of the Gamma3 Hip Fracture System in the United States, Japan and Europe in the second half of 2004. Strong growth in the Companys T2 Nailing System, both in the United States and internationally, also drove trauma sales growth in 2005. Spinal Implant Systems: Sales of spinal implant systems increased 17% during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, primarily due to strong sales growth of interbody devices in the United States led by sales of the recently launched AVS spacer products as well as solid worldwide growth in cervical and thoraco lumbar product sales. Craniomaxillofacial Implant Systems: Sales of craniomaxillofacial implant systems increased 8% during the year, 7% on a constant currency basis, as a result of solid domestic sales of products for neurologic indications. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $1,759.4 million for 2005, representing an increase of 20% as a result of higher shipments of surgical equipment; surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. Sales of MedSurg Equipment also increased 20% for the year on a constant currency basis. Surgical Equipment and Surgical Navigation Systems: Sales of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems increased 16% during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, due to strong worldwide sales growth in the System 5 heavy duty powered system, interventional pain products, Sterishield personal protection systems and surgical navigation products as well as strong sales growth in the Neptune operating waste management system in the United States. Endoscopic,Communications and Digital Imaging Systems: Sales of endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems increased 24% during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, as a result of strong sales growth in medical video imaging equipment, led by growth of digital imaging equipment and the 1088 HD Camera, and strong growth in general surgery products in the United States, partially offset by slower sales growth in arthroscopy in the United States resulting from the discontinuance of allograft products during the year. Patient Handling and Emergency Medical Equipment: Sales of patient handling and emergency medical equipment increased 23% during the year, 22% on a constant currency basis, due to strong sales growth in hospital and maternity beds and emergency medical equipment in the United States and solid stretcher growth in the U. S. market. Physical Therapy Services revenues were $262.6 million for 2005, representing an increase of 7% with all of the growth coming from new physical therapy centers. Cost of sales represented 35.3% of sales in 2005 compared with 35.5% in 2004. The lower cost of sales percentage in 2005 is partially due to increased average selling prices for the Companys products and lower excess and obsolete inventory costs associated with discontinued products, partially offset by faster sales growth in the lower margin MedSurg Equipment segment and higher growth in royalty costs relative to sales growth. Research, development and engineering expenses represented 5.8% of sales in 2005 compared with 5.0% in 2004. These expenses increased 32% in 2005 to $284.7 million. The higher spending level is the result of the Companys continued focus on new product development for anticipated future product launches and continued investments in new technologies, together with, beginning in the third quarter of 2004, spending associated with the continued development of products acquired from SpineCore. New product introductions in 2005 in the Orthopaedic Implants segment included X3 polyethylene, the Companys next generation highly crosslinked polyethylene featuring a higher level of strength and wear reduction in both hip and knee replacements, and the 33 posteriorly stabilized version of the Triathlon Knee System in the United States, Europe, Canada and the Pacific region. Within the MedSurg Equipment segment, new product introductions in 2005 included the Maestro drill, which expanded the Companys line of micro powered instruments for spine; neurologic; and ear, nose & throat applications. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10% in 2005 and represented 38.0% of sales compared with 39.5% in 2004. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2005 is due to lower meeting costs and slower growth in advertising costs and insurance premiums relative to the Companys growth in net sales. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales commission expense as a result of the 14% growth in net sales in 2005 in addition to higher amortization expense associated with loaner instrument sets. The purchased in process research and development charge of $15.9 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 relates to the acquisition of PlasmaSol, as previously described. The purchased in process research and development charge of $120.8 million recorded in the third quarter of 2004 relates to the acquisition of SpineCore, a private, development stage company. At the date of the acquisition, the artificial lumbar and cervical spinal disc implant technologies acquired were in preliminary stages of clinical studies in the United States and had not yet reached technological feasibility. The upfront payment of $120.0 million, plus certain transaction costs, was allocated to assets acquired, purchased in process research and development and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. The Company believes that the technologies acquired in both the PlasmaSol and SpineCore acquisitions will result in the introduction of new products and additional future sales. However, factors including regulatory delays, safety concerns or patent disputes could delay the introduction or marketing of these potential new products. Additionally, unanticipated issues may arise during current and future clinical trials that could delay or terminate a products development prior to regulatory approval. The Company may experience an unfavorable impact on its operating results if it is unable to capitalize on those efforts by attaining the proper FDA approval. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had not encountered significant issues and expects completion of the development and initial commercialization of both the sterilization technologies and spinal disc implant technologies beginning in 2008. As a result of the adoption of FASB Statement No. 123 (revised), the Companys operating income for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was reduced by $48.7 million and $38.9 million, respectively, and the Companys net earnings for the same periods were reduced by $31.6 million and $25.7 million, respectively. Basic and diluted net earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 were reduced by $.08 and $.06, respectively. Interest and marketable securities income, which is included in other income (expense), increased to $13.3 million in 2005 from $4.7 million in 2004, primarily due to increased cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances compared to the year earlier period. Interest expense, which is included in other income (expense), increased to $7.7 million in 2005 from $6.8 million in 2004, primarily as a result of increased borrowings in Europe to complete the repatriation of foreign earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005. The effective income tax rate was 32.6% for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 35.1% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The effective income tax rate for 2005 reflects a charge of $27.4 million to recognize the income tax expense and related liability associated with the repatriation of $722 million of foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act completed in the fourth quarter. The effective income tax rate for 2005 also reflects the impact of the nondeductibility for income tax purposes of the purchased in process research and development charge associated with the acquisition of PlasmaSol. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2004 reflects the impact of the nondeductibility for income tax purposes of the purchased in process research and development charge associated with the acquisition of SpineCore. After considering these factors, the Companys reported effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 are lower than the United States statutory income tax rate primarily as a result of manufacturing in lower tax, international jurisdictions. 34 Net earnings in 2005 increased 46% to $643.6 million from $440.0 million in 2004; basic net earnings per share increased 45% to $1.59 in 2005 from $1.10 in 2004; and diluted net earnings per share increased 45% to $1.57 in 2005 from $1.08 in 2004. Excluding the impacts of the charges to write off purchased in process research and development in 2005 and 2004 and to recognize income tax expense associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005, adjusted net earnings increased 22% to $686.9 million in 2005 from $560.8 million in 2004. Adjusted basic net earnings per share increased 21% to $1.70 in 2005 from $1.40 in 2004, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share increased 22% to $1.67 in 2005 from $1.37 in 2004. The reconciliations of these non GAAP financial measures are as follows (in millions except per share amounts):  2005 2004 % Change Reported net earnings $643.6 $440.0 46% Purchased in process research and development 15.9 120.8 (87) Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings 27.4 Adjusted net earnings $686.9 $560.8 22 Basic net earnings per share: Reported basic net earnings per share $1.59 $1.10 45 Purchased in process research and development $.04 $.30 (87) Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings $.07 Adjusted basic net earnings per share $1.70 $1.40 21 Weighted average basic shares outstanding 403.7 401.2 Diluted net earnings per share: Reported diluted net earnings per share $1.57 $1.08 45 Purchased in process research and development $.04 $.30 (87) Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings $.07 Adjusted diluted net earnings per share $1.67 $1.37 22 Weighted average diluted shares outstanding 410.8 409.3 The weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of these non GAAP financial measures are the same as the weighted average shares outstanding used in the calculation of the reported per share amounts. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys working capital at December 31, 2006 increased $561.5 million to $2,182.8 million from $1,621.3 million at December 31, 2005. The increase in working capital resulted from growth in the Companys overall business and the use of cash earnings to fund increases in accounts receivable, inventories and prepaid expenses. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding was 56 days at December 31, 2006 compared with 54 days at December 31, 2005. Days sales in inventory increased 8 days to 122 days at December 31, 2006 from 114 days at December 31, 2005. The increase in days sales in inventory at December 31, 2006 is primarily due to higher levels of inventory in support of anticipated product launches and first quarter sales as well as managements effort to run the manufacturing plants at a steady rate during the year. The Company generated cash of $867.3 million from operations in 2006 compared with $833.4 million in 2005. The increase in cash from operations in 2006 compared with the prior year is primarily due to increased earnings partially offset by growth in the working capital accounts, primarily inventories and accounts receivable. 35 In 2006, the Company used cash of $217.5 million for capital expenditures, including $29.4 million related to the implementation of ERP systems at multiple manufacturing and distribution facilities; $24.1 million for the expansion of the Companys OP 1 manufacturing facility in Lebanon, New Hampshire; $17.5 million for the new corporate headquarters in Kalamazoo, Michigan; and $12.5 million for construction of the Homer Stryker Center for education and clinical research in Mahwah, New Jersey. In addition, the Company used cash of $97.1 million for acquisitions and $44.6 million for the payment of dividends. The Company also purchases and sells marketable securities, which are classified as available for sale investments in accordance with the provisions of FASB Statement No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. Marketable securities totaled $998.2 million at December 31, 2006. In addition to the acquisitions discussed previously, the Company acquired eTrauma in the first quarter of 2005 for an upfront payment of $50.0 million in cash plus certain transaction costs. The acquisition of eTrauma was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The results of operations for the acquired business are included in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of the acquisition and did not materially impact the Companys reported operating results. Pro forma consolidated results of operations would not differ significantly as a result of the eTrauma acquisition. The purchase price for eTrauma was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. Based on the purchase price allocation, $22.0 million was allocated to identifiable intangible assets, to be amortized over their remaining lives of 5 to 8 years, and $30.2 million was allocated to goodwill. Immediately after the acquisition was consummated, management of the Company began to implement an integration plan to combine Stryker and eTrauma. In conjunction with the integration plan, the Company recorded additional purchase liabilities for severance and related costs of $0.3 million, which were included in the purchase price allocation. The Company had $416.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $998.2 million in marketable securities at December 31, 2006. The Company also had outstanding borrowings totaling $14.8 million at that date, all of which were classified as current obligations. The Company believes its cash on hand and marketable securities, as well as anticipated cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to fund future operating capital requirements; future manufacturing facility construction and other capital expenditures; future business and product line acquisitions to supplement its current product offerings; loaner instrumentation for surgical implants in support of new product launches; required debt repayments and the payment of dividends. Should additional funds be required, the Company had $1,028.1 million of additional borrowing capacity available under all of its existing credit facilities, including the Companys $1,000.0 million 5 year nonamortizing, revolving Unsecured Credit Facility that expires in November 2010. In addition, the Company had $200.0 million of eligible accounts receivable that could be sold through its accounts receivable securitization facility at December 31, 2006. The Companys future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than 1 year, including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business, are summarized as follows (in millions):  Payment Period 2007  2008  2009  2010  2011  Thereafter Long term debt $14.8 $ $ $ $ $ Operating leases 62.1 51.3 38.5 22.7 13.3 25.4 Unconditional purchase obligations 208.4 5.5 1.0 36 The Companys additional borrowing capacity, along with the expected expiration period of the commitments, is summarized as follows (in millions):  Amount of Commitment Total Expiration Per Period Amount Less than In excess of Committed 1 year 1 year Unsecured Credit Facility and other lines of credit $1,028.1 $65.8 $962.3 Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Estimates are based on historical experience, when available, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes that of its significant accounting policies (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), an understanding of the following critical accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable. The Company makes estimates regarding the future ability of its customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends. If actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional accounts receivable write offs may be necessary, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. Inventory Reserves The Company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. The markets in which the Company operates are highly competitive and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis. Such marketplace changes may cause some of the Companys products to become obsolete. The Company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. Income Taxes The Company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States. Accordingly, management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions. Tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and product royalty arrangements, may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates. Because tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant, the Company records accruals representing managements best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters. These income tax accruals are included 37 within the income taxes liability in the consolidated balance sheets. To the extent additional information becomes available, such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable outcome. Other Matters The Company distributes its products throughout the world. As a result, the Companys financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets. The Companys operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the United States dollar, the Japanese yen and European currencies, in particular the euro and the British pound. When the United States dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies increases. When the United States dollar strengthens, the opposite situation occurs. The Company manufactures its products in the United States, France, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, Canada and Puerto Rico and incurs the costs to manufacture in the applicable local currencies. This worldwide deployment of factories serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the Companys cost of sales. The Company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk to the Company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products. The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies. All forward currency exchange contracts are marked to market each period with resulting gains (losses) included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of earnings. At December 31, 2006, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $387.9 million and sell $227.0 million of various currencies (principally United States dollars and euros) with maturities ranging principally from 7 to 180 days. At December 31, 2005, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $217.6 million and sell $196.1 million of various currencies (principally United States dollars and euros) with maturities ranging principally from 7 to 180 days. The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currencies relative to the U. S. dollar would change the December 31, 2006 fair value by approximately $9.7 million. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties. The Company has certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged. These investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currencies that are deferred and recorded as a separate component of shareholders equity. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar increased the value of these investments in net assets, and the related deferred gain in shareholders equity, by $102.6 million to $119.6 million from $17.0 million at December 31, 2005. The Company is partially self insured for product liability claims and utilizes a wholly owned captive insurance company in the United States to manage its self insured retention limits. The captive insurance company provides insurance reserves for estimated liabilities for product claims incurred but not reported based on actuarially determined liabilities. The actuarial valuations are based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events. In December 2003, the Company announced that its subsidiary Physiotherapy Associates, Inc., and Stryker received a subpoena from the United States Attorneys Office in Boston, Massachusetts, in connection with a United States Department of Justice investigation of Physiotherapy Associates billing and coding practices. In March 2005, the Company announced that it received a subpoena from the United States Department of Justice requesting documents for the period January 2002 through the present relating to "any and 38 all consulting contracts, professional service agreements, or remuneration agreements between Stryker Corporation and any orthopedic surgeon, orthopedic surgeon in training, or medical school graduate using or considering the surgical use of hip or knee joint replacement/reconstruction products manufactured or sold by Stryker Corporation." In June 2006, the Company announced that it received a subpoena from the United States Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, requesting documents for the period January 2001 through the present regarding possible violations of federal criminal law, including possible violation of the antitrust laws, relating to the manufacture and sale of orthopaedic implant devices. The Company is fully cooperating with the Department of Justice regarding these matters. In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. This Interpretation clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. The Interpretation also provides guidance for the measurement and classification of tax positions, interest and penalties and requires additional disclosure on an annual basis. The Company plans to adopt the provisions of the Interpretation effective January 1, 2007, as required. The Company has not yet determined the effect the adoption of the Interpretation will have on the financial position of the Company but does not anticipate a material impact. Any difference between the amounts recognized in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements prior to the adoption of the Interpretation and the amounts reported after the adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment recorded in the beginning balance of retained earnings on January 1, 2007 and will not require restatement of prior periods.
