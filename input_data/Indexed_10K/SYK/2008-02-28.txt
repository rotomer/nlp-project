ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Throughout this discussion, references are made to the following financial measures: "constant currency," "adjusted net earnings from continuing operations," "adjusted basic net earnings per share from continuing operations" and "adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations." These financial measures are an alternative representation of Stryker Corporations (the Company or Stryker) past and potential future operational performance and do not replace the presentation of the Companys reported financial results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company has provided these supplemental non GAAP financial measures because they provide meaningful information regarding the Companys results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented. Management uses these non GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of its business segments, for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process and bases certain annual bonus plans on these non GAAP financial measures. In order to measure the Companys sales performance on a constant currency basis, it is necessary to remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which affects the comparability and trend of sales. Constant currency results are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates. In order to measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, the Company excludes the intangible asset impairment charge recorded in 2007, the purchased in process research and development charges recorded in 2006 and 2005 and the additional income taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings recorded in 2005, each of which affects the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. Additional details regarding the nature, determination and financial statement impact of these items are included in Results of Operations. In addition, the Company believes investors will utilize this information to evaluate period to period results on a comparable basis and to better understand potential future operating results. The Company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its Consolidated Financial Statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely solely on any single financial measure. Executive Level Overview Stryker is one of the worlds leading medical technology companies with the most broadly based range of products in orthopaedics and a significant presence in other medical specialties. Stryker works with respected medical professionals to help people lead more active and more satisfying lives. The Companys products include implants used in joint replacement, trauma, spinal and craniomaxillofacial surgeries; biologics; surgical, neurologic, ear, nose & throat and interventional pain equipment; endoscopic, surgical navigation, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. The Company segregates its operations into two reportable business segments: Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The Orthopaedic Implants segment sells orthopaedic reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma, spinal and craniomaxillofacial implant systems, bone cement and the bone growth factor OP 1. The MedSurg Equipment segment sells surgical equipment; surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. The Other category includes corporate administration, interest expense and interest and marketable securities income. Domestic sales accounted for 64% of total revenues in 2007. Most of the Companys products are marketed directly to doctors, hospitals and other healthcare facilities by approximately 3,500 sales and marketing personnel in the United States. Stryker primarily maintains separate and dedicated sales forces for each of its principal product lines to provide focus and a high level of expertise to each medical specialty served. International sales accounted for 36% of total revenues in 2007. The Companys products are sold in more than 100 countries through Company owned sales subsidiaries and branches as well as third party dealers and distributors. 27 The Companys business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of orthopaedic implant surgeries is lower during the summer months. In 2007 the Company announced that it reached a resolution with the U.S. Attorneys office for the District of New Jersey in connection with a previously announced investigation relating to "any and all consulting contracts, professional service agreements, or remuneration agreements between Stryker Corporation and any orthopedic surgeon, orthopedic surgeon in training, or medical school graduate using or considering the surgical use of hip or knee joint replacement/reconstruction products manufactured or sold by Stryker Corporation." The resolution is in the form of a non prosecution agreement for an 18 month period. During the term of the agreement, the Companys Orthopaedics subsidiary is subject to oversight by a federal monitor, as appointed by the U.S. Attorney, regarding compliance with certain standards and procedures in connection with the retention and payment of orthopaedic surgeon consultants related to reconstructive products and the provision of certain benefits to such surgeons. In 2007 the Company sold its outpatient physical therapy business, Physiotherapy Associates, to Water Street Healthcare Partners, for $150.0 million in cash less certain indebtedness. Physiotherapy Associates operating results are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Additional details, including the financial statement impact resulting from this divestiture, are included in Results of Operations and Other Matters. In 2007 the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. This Interpretation clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold an income tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. The Interpretation also provides guidance for the measurement and classification of income tax positions, interest and penalties, and requires additional disclosure on an annual basis. Additional details, including the financial statement impact resulting from this adoption, are included in Results of Operations. In 2006 the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Sightline Technologies Ltd. (Sightline), a private, development stage company, for an upfront payment of $50.0 million in cash plus certain transaction costs and the assumption of certain liabilities. Sightline has developed flexible endoscopes that should improve insertion and sterilization during colonoscopy procedures. Terms of the transaction also include milestone payments of up to an additional $90.0 million upon the achievement of certain operational and financial targets related to Sightlines products, the first of which is expected to occur in 2008. This acquisition is expected to enhance the Companys presence in the gastrointestinal and other markets within its MedSurg Equipment segment. In 2005 the Company acquired, by merger, all of the outstanding stock of PlasmaSol Corp. (PlasmaSol). PlasmaSol has developed a technology that should allow Stryker to provide sterilization equipment for use with certain of its MedSurg Equipment products. The cost of the transaction totaled $17.5 million, including an upfront cash payment plus the assumption of certain liabilities. In 2005 the Company acquired, by merger, all of the outstanding stock of eTrauma.com Corp. (eTrauma) for $50.0 million in cash plus certain transaction costs. The acquisition expanded the Companys digital imaging equipment product offerings within its MedSurg Equipment segment by adding eTraumas proprietary Picture Archive and Communications Systems (PACS) image management and viewing software. Sightlines, PlasmaSols and eTraumas operating results are included in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of the acquisitions and did not materially impact the Companys operating results. Pro forma consolidated results of operations would not differ significantly as a result of these acquisitions. Additional details, including the financial statement impacts resulting from these acquisitions, are included in Results of Operations. 28 In 2005 the Company completed the repatriation of $722 million of foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act (the Act). The Act provided a temporary incentive for U.S. companies to repatriate accumulated income earned in foreign jurisdictions at a reduced income tax cost. Additional details, including the financial statement impact resulting from the repatriation of funds, are included in Results of Operations. Outlook for 2008 The Companys outlook for 2008 continues to be optimistic regarding underlying growth rates in orthopaedic procedures and sales growth in the Companys broadly based range of products in orthopaedics and other medical specialties, despite the potential for increased pricing pressure in certain markets. The Company projects that diluted net earnings per share for 2008 will approximate $2.88, representing a 22% increase over diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.37 for the year ended December 31, 2007. Excluding the impact of the charge to reflect the intangible asset impairment in 2007, as more fully described in Results of Operations, the Company projects that diluted net earnings per share for 2008 will increase 20% over adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.40 for the year ended December 31, 2007. The financial forecast for 2008 includes a constant currency net sales increase in the range of 11% to 13% as a result of growth in shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near December 31, 2007 levels, the Company anticipates a favorable impact on net sales of approximately 2.5% to 3% in the first quarter of 2008 and a favorable impact on net sales of approximately 1% to 1.5% for the full year of 2008. Results of Operations The table below outlines the components of net earnings from continuing operations from the consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of net sales and the year to year percentage change in dollar amounts:  Percentage of Net Sales Percentage Change 2007  2006  2005 2007/2006  2006/2005 Net sales 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 17% 12% Cost of sales 31.1 31.4 32.3 15 9 Gross profit 68.9 68.6 67.7 17 13 Research, development and engineering expenses 6.3 6.3 6.2 16 14 Selling, general and administrative expenses 39.9 39.8 39.9 17 11 Intangibles amortization 0.7 0.8 1.0 (3) (10) Intangible asset impairment 0.3 Purchased in process research and development 1.0 0.3 (100) 231 Operating income 21.8 20.7 20.2 23 14 Other income (expense) 1.0 0.6 0.1 108 516 Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 22.8 21.3 20.3 25 17 Income taxes 6.4 6.3 6.6 19 6 Net earnings from continuing operations 16.4% 15.0% 13.7% 28 22 29 The table below sets forth domestic/international and product line sales information:   Net Sales (in millions)  Percentage Change 2007  2006  2005 2007/2006  2006/2005 Domestic/international sales: Domestic $3,850.3 $3,298.4 $2,903.0 17% 14% International 2,150.2 1,848.8 1,705.9 16 8 Total net sales $6,000.5 $5,147.2 $4,608.9 17 12 Product line sales: Orthopaedic Implants $3,570.7 $3,110.1 $2,849.5 15 9 MedSurg Equipment 2,429.8 2,037.1 1,759.4 19 16 Total net sales  $6,000.5  $5,147.2  $4,608.9 17 12 The tables below set forth additional geographical sales growth information for significant products within the Companys Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment segments on both a reported basis and a constant currency basis:  Year Ended December 31, 2007 Percentage Change Domestic International Total Constant Constant Reported Reported Currency Reported Currency Orthopaedic Implants sales: Hips 7 12 5 9 6 Knees 15 16 9 16 13 Trauma 29 12 6 19 15 Spinal 29 16 10 25 23 Craniomaxillofacial 24 6 0 17 14 Total Orthopaedic Implants 16 13 7 15 12 MedSurg Equipment sales: Surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems 17 26 18 20 17 Endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems 18 30 21 21 19 Patient handling and emergency medical equipment 18 7 3 16 15 Total MedSurg Equipment 18 24 17 19 17 30  Year Ended December 31, 2006 Percentage Change Domestic International Total Constant Constant Reported Reported Currency Reported Currency Orthopaedic Implants sales: Hips 4 0 1 2 2 Knees 16 7 7 12 12 Trauma 23 7 9 13 14 Spinal 20 13 14 18 18 Craniomaxillofacial 24 7 7 16 16 Total Orthopaedic Implants 12 5 6 9 9 MedSurg Equipment sales: Surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems 12 13 13 12 12 Endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems 16 32 30 19 19 Patient handling and emergency medical equipment 19 14 10 18 17 Total MedSurg Equipment 15 19 18 16 16 2007 Compared with 2006 The Companys net sales increased 17% in 2007 to $6,000.5 million from $5,147.2 million in 2006. Net sales grew by 14% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix and by 3% due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Companys domestic sales were $3,850.3 million for 2007, representing an increase of 17%, and international sales were $2,150.2 million for 2007, representing an increase of 16%, as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $131.5 million for 2007. On a constant currency basis, international sales increased 9% in 2007. Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $3,570.7 million for 2007, representing an increase of 15% as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive, trauma, spinal and craniomaxillofacial implant systems; bone cement; and the bone growth factor OP 1. On a constant currency basis, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 12% in 2007. Hip Implant Systems: Sales of hip implant systems increased 9% during the year (6% on a constant currency basis). In the United States, sales growth was driven by sales of X3 polyethylene and Accolade cementless hip products, partially offset by declines in other hip systems. Solid sales growth in the Exeter, Trident, X3 polyethylene and Accolade hip products in Europe, the Pacific region and the Latin America region also led to the Companys constant currency sales growth for 2007. Knee Implant Systems: Sales of knee implant systems increased 16% during the year (13% on a constant currency basis) due to strong growth in the Triathlon Knee System in the United States, Europe, Canada and the Pacific region and solid growth in the Scorpio Knee System in Europe, the Pacific region and the Latin America region. 31 Trauma Implant Systems: Sales of trauma implant systems increased 19% in 2007 (15% on a constant currency basis) as a result of strong sales growth in the Gamma3 Hip Fracture System in the United States, Europe, Canada and the Pacific region as well as solid sales growth in the Companys T2 Nailing System in the United States and Europe, partially offset by a sales decline in Japan as a result of government imposed price cuts. Spinal Implant Systems: Sales of spinal implant systems increased 25% in 2007 (23% on a constant currency basis). Sales growth for 2007 was driven by strong worldwide sales growth of thoracolumbar implant systems, interbody devices and cervical implants. Craniomaxillofacial Implant Systems: Sales of craniomaxillofacial implant systems increased 17% in 2007 (14% on a constant currency basis) primarily due to strong sales growth of products for neurological indications and craniomaxillofacial implants in the United States, Europe and the Pacific region. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $2,429.8 million for 2007, representing an increase of 19% as a result of higher shipments of surgical equipment; surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. On a constant currency basis, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 17% in 2007. Surgical Equipment and Surgical Navigation Systems: Sales of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems increased 20% in 2007 (17% on a constant currency basis) due to strong sales growth in powered surgical and operating room equipment in the United States, Europe and the Pacific region. Solid sales growth in interventional pain products in Europe also led to the Companys constant currency sales growth. Endoscopic, Communications and Digital Imaging Systems: Sales of endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems increased 21% in 2007 (19% on a constant currency basis) as a result of strong worldwide sales growth of medical video imaging equipment led by the 1188 HD Camera and complementary products such as the X8000 Lightsource and Vision Elect Monitor. Strong sales growth in arthroscopy and communication products in the United States, Europe and the Pacific region also led to the Companys constant currency sales growth. Patient Handling and Emergency Medical Equipment: Sales of patient handling and emergency medical equipment increased 16% in 2007 (15% on a constant currency basis) due to strong sales growth of stretchers and emergency medical equipment in the United States and Europe. In addition, constant currency sales growth in 2007 was led by strong sales growth in hospital beds in the United States as well as strong sales growth in maternity beds in the United States, Canada, Europe and the Latin America region. Cost of sales represented 31.1% of sales in 2007 compared with 31.4% in 2006. The cost of sales percentage in 2007 was favorably impacted by efficiencies gained within manufacturing plants and product distribution channels. Research, development and engineering expenses represented 6.3% of sales for both 2007 and 2006. These expenses increased 16% in 2007 to $375.3 million. The higher spending level is the result of the Companys continued focus on new product development for anticipated future product launches and continued investments in new technologies. New product introductions in 2007 for the Orthopaedic Implants segment included the condylar stabilizing (CS) ultra congruent insert for the Triathlon Knee System; the Scorpio NRG with X3 advanced bearing technology; and the Omega 3 Compression Hip Screw System. Within the MedSurg Equipment segment, new product introductions in 2007 included InTouch, a high acuity care bed; the SDC Ultra, an all in one medical imaging information management system; the CORE Sumex drill, designed for use in ENT procedures; and the 45L PneumoSure insufflator. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 17% in 2007 and represented 39.9% of sales compared with 39.8% in 2006. The slight increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2007 is due to higher sales related costs, primarily compensation and increased regulatory compliance 32 related costs, partially offset by decreases in insurance costs and slower growth in discretionary spending. In 2007 the Company recorded a $19.8 million charge ($12.7 million net of income taxes) to write off patents associated with intervertebral body fusion cage products. The impairment followed a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) decision to downgrade certain intervertebral body fusion products to class II devices, along with a weak market for sales of these specific products. As a result, the Company performed a discounted cash flow analysis over the remaining life of the patented technologies and determined that the charge was required. The purchased in process research and development charge of $52.7 million recorded in 2006 relates to the acquisition of Sightline. At the date of the acquisition, the flexible endoscope technologies acquired had not yet reached technological feasibility. The upfront payment of $50.0 million, plus certain transaction costs and the assumption of certain liabilities, was allocated to assets acquired, purchased in process research and development and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. The amount written off as purchased in process research and development was not deductible for income tax purposes in the United States. The Company believes that the technologies acquired in the Sightline acquisition will result in the introduction of new products and additional future sales. However, unanticipated issues may arise that could delay or terminate a products development prior to commercialization, which could have an unfavorable impact on the Companys operating results. As of December 31, 2007, the Company must refine certain product specifications highlighted during customer preference trials and validate manufacturing processes in order to achieve its plan for initial commercialization of the flexible endoscope technologies in 2008. Interest and marketable securities income, which is included in other income (expense), increased to $85.5 million in 2007 from $41.4 million in 2006 primarily as a result of increased cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances in 2007 compared to 2006. Interest expense, which is included in other income (expense), increased to $22.2 million in 2007 from $9.5 million in 2006, primarily as a result of interest expense associated with unresolved income tax positions. The Companys effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 was 28.0% compared to an effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 of 29.5%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflects the impact of the intangible asset impairment charge of $12.7 million (net of $7.1 million income tax benefit). The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflects the impact of the nondeductibility for income tax purposes of the purchased in process research and development charge associated with the acquisition of Sightline. After considering these factors, the Companys reported effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily as a result of manufacturing in lower income tax international jurisdictions. Upon adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 48, the Company recognized an increase in the interest expense accrual associated with unresolved income tax positions, which was accounted for by reducing the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings by $7.6 million (net of income taxes). In addition, the Company reclassified $179.2 million from the current income taxes liability to noncurrent liabilities to match the anticipated timing of future income tax payments. Net earnings from continuing operations increased 28% in 2007 to $986.7 million from $771.4 million in 2006. Basic net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 27% in 2007 to $2.41 from $1.90 in 2006, and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 27% in 2007 to $2.37 from $1.87 in 2006. Excluding the impacts of the charges to reflect the intangible asset impairment in 2007 and to write off purchased in process research and development recorded in 2006, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased 21% in 2007 to $999.4 million from $824.1 million in 2006. Adjusted basic net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 20% in 2007 to $2.44 from $2.03 in 2006, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 20% in 2007 to $2.40 from $2.00 in 2006. 33 The reconciliations of these non GAAP financial measures are as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):  2007 2006 Percentage Change Reported net earnings from continuing operations $986.7 $771.4 28% Intangible asset impairment 12.7 Purchased in process research and development 52.7 (100) Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations $999.4 $824.1 21 Basic net earnings per share of common stock: Reported basic net earnings per share of common stock from continuing operations $2.41 $1.90 27 Intangible asset impairment $.03 Purchased in process research and development $.13 (100) Adjusted basic net earnings per share of common stock from continuing operations $2.44 $2.03 20 Weighted average basic shares outstanding 409.7 406.5 Diluted net earnings per share of common stock: Reported diluted net earnings per share of common stock from continuing operations $2.37 $1.87 27 Intangible asset impairment $.03 Purchased in process research and development $.13 (100) Adjusted diluted net earnings per share of common stock from continuing operations $2.40 $2.00 20 Weighted average diluted shares outstanding 417.2 411.8 The weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of these non GAAP financial measures are the same as the weighted average shares outstanding used in the calculation of the reported per share amounts. The sale of Physiotherapy Associates resulted in a gain on sale of discontinued operations of $25.7 million (net of income taxes), or $.06 per diluted share in 2007. Net earnings from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $5.0 million, or $.01 per diluted share, compared to net earnings from discontinued operations of $6.3 million, or $.02 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006. Net earnings increased 31% in 2007 to $1,017.4 million from $777.7 million in 2006. Basic net earnings per share increased 30% in 2007 to $2.48 from $1.91 in 2006, and diluted net earnings per share increased 29% in 2007 to $2.44 from $1.89 in 2006. 2006 Compared with 2005 The Companys net sales increased 12% in 2006 to $5,147.2 million from $4,608.9 million in 2005. Net sales grew by 11% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix and 1% as a result of higher selling prices. Domestic sales were $3,298.4 million for 2006, representing an increase of 14% as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. International sales were $1,848.8 million for 2006, representing an increase of 8% as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was unfavorable by $5.2 million for 2006. On a constant currency basis, international sales increased 9% in 2006. 34 Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $3,110.1 million for 2006, representing an increase of 9%, on both a reported and constant currency basis, as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive, trauma, spinal and craniomaxillofacial implant systems; bone cement; and the bone growth factor OP 1. Hip Implant Systems: Sales of hip implant systems increased 2% during the year on both a reported and constant currency basis. In the United States, sales growth was driven by sales of the recently launched X3 polyethylene and increased sales in Accolade cementless hip products and Restoration Modular Hip System revision hip products, partially offset by declines in sales of other hip systems. Solid growth in the Trident Hip System, Accolade cementless hip products and Restoration Modular Hip System revision hip products in Europe as well as solid growth in Accolade cementless hip products and the Trident Hip System in the Pacific region also contributed to the sales growth in hip implant systems. Knee Implant Systems: Sales of knee implant systems increased 12% during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, due to strong growth in the Triathlon Knee System in the United States, Europe and the Pacific region and solid growth in the Scorpio Knee System in most international markets, partially offset by slower growth in Japan as a result of government imposed price cuts. Trauma Implant Systems: Sales of trauma implant systems increased 13% during the year (14% on a constant currency basis) due to strong worldwide sales growth in the Gamma3 Hip Fracture System and strong sales growth in the T2 Nailing System in the United States and Europe, partially offset by slower growth in Japan as a result of the price cuts. Spinal Implant Systems: Sales of spinal implant systems increased 18% during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, primarily due to strong worldwide sales growth of interbody devices led by sales of the AVS vertebral spacer system as well as solid worldwide sales growth in thoracolumbar products. Craniomaxillofacial Implant Systems: Sales of craniomaxillofacial implant systems increased 16% during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, as a result of strong domestic sales growth led by products for neurologic indications and craniomaxillofacial implants. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $2,037.1 million for 2006, representing an increase of 16%, on both a reported and constant currency basis, as a result of higher shipments of surgical equipment; surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. Surgical Equipment and Surgical Navigation Systems: Sales of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems increased 12% during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, due to strong domestic sales growth in surgical navigation systems and operating room equipment and solid domestic sales growth in interventional pain products. Strong sales growth in powered surgical instruments outside the United States also led to the Companys sales growth. Endoscopic, Communications and Digital Imaging Systems: Sales of endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems increased 19% during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, as a result of strong worldwide sales growth in medical video imaging equipment led by the recently launched 1188 HD Camera and related accessories as well as imaging and communications products. Strong worldwide sales growth in general surgery products also contributed to the Companys sales growth. Patient Handling and Emergency Medical Equipment: Sales of patient handling and emergency medical equipment increased 18% during the year (17% on a constant currency basis) due to strong sales growth in hospital bed products in the United States, the Latin America region and Canada, strong domestic sales growth in emergency medical equipment as well as solid stretcher sales growth in Europe and the Latin America region. 35 Cost of sales represented 31.4% of sales in 2006 compared with 32.3% in 2005. The lower cost of sales percentage in 2006 is primarily due to lower excess and obsolete inventory costs as a result of fewer comparative product introductions during the year and reduced royalty costs related to the expiration of certain royalty agreements partially offset by faster sales growth in the lower margin MedSurg Equipment segment. Research, development and engineering expenses represented 6.3% of sales in 2006 compared with 6.2% in 2005. These expenses increased 14% in 2006 to $324.6 million. The higher spending level is the result of the Companys continued focus on new product development for anticipated future product launches and continued investments in new technologies. New product introductions in 2006 for the Orthopaedic Implants segment included the LFIT Anatomic Femoral Heads with X3 polyethylene liners, which address range of motion and dislocation potential, and the AVS AS Spacer, which is used for anterior lumbar interbody fusion. Within the MedSurg Equipment segment, new product introductions in 2006 included the 1188 HD Camera and related accessories, the next generation of Stryker 3 Chip HD Cameras, the System 6 heavy duty power system and the Stryker Precision Oscillating Tip Saw, which features a stationary blade shaft with an oscillating tip. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 11% in 2006 and represented 39.8% of sales compared with 39.9% in 2005. The slight decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in 2006 is due to decreases in insurance costs and slower growth in discretionary spending, partially offset by higher sales related costs, primarily compensation, loaner instrumentation amortization and sample expenses. The purchased in process research and development charge of $52.7 million recorded in 2006 relates to the acquisition of Sightline. The purchased in process research and development charge of $15.9 million recorded in 2005 relates to the acquisition of PlasmaSol. At the date of the PlasmaSol acquisition, the sterilization technology acquired had not yet been approved for sale by the FDA and, therefore, had not yet reached technological feasibility. The purchase price of $17.5 million was allocated to assets acquired, primarily for deferred income tax assets associated with acquired net operating losses, and purchased in process research and development based on their fair value at the date of acquisition. The amounts written off as purchased in process research and development were not deductible for income tax purposes in the United States. The Company believes that the technologies acquired in both the Sightline and PlasmaSol acquisitions will result in the introduction of new products and additional future sales. However, unanticipated issues may arise that could delay or terminate a products development prior to regulatory approval or commercialization, which could have an unfavorable impact on the Companys operating results. As previously described, as of December 31, 2007, the Company must refine certain product specifications highlighted during customer preference trials and validate manufacturing processes in order to achieve its plan for initial commercialization of the flexible endoscope technologies in 2008. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had not encountered significant issues and expects completion of the development and initial commercialization of the sterilization technologies in 2010. Interest and marketable securities income, which is included in other income (expense), increased to $41.4 million in 2006 from $13.3 million in 2005, primarily as a result of increased cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances in 2006 compared to 2005. Interest expense, which is included in other income (expense), increased to $9.5 million in 2006 from $7.7 million in 2005, primarily as a result of borrowings in Europe to complete the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005. The Companys effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 29.5% as compared to an effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005 of 32.5%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflects the impact of the nondeductibility for income tax purposes of the purchased in process research and development charge associated with the acquisition of Sightline. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005 reflects the impact of the nondeductibility for income tax purposes of the purchased in process research and development charge associated with the acquisition of PlasmaSol as well as the additional $27.4 million of income taxes recorded as a result of the repatriation of foreign earnings. After considering these factors, the Companys reported effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 are lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily as a result of manufacturing in lower income tax international jurisdictions. 36 Net earnings from continuing operations increased 22% in 2006 to $771.4 million from $632.5 million in 2005. Basic net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 21% in 2006 to $1.90 from $1.57 in 2005, and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 21% in 2006 to $1.87 from $1.54 in 2005. Excluding the impacts of the charges to write off purchased in process research and development in 2006 and 2005 and to recognize the income tax expense associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased 22% in 2006 to $824.1 million from $675.8 million in 2005. Adjusted basic net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 22% in 2006 to $2.03 from $1.67 in 2005, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 21% in 2006 to $2.00 from $1.65 in 2005. The reconciliations of these non GAAP financial measures are as follows (in millions except per share amounts):  2006 2005 Percentage Change Reported net earnings from continuing operations $771.4 $632.5 22% Purchased in process research and development 52.7 15.9 231 Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings 27.4 (100) Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations $824.1 $675.8 22 Basic net earnings per share of common stock: Reported basic net earnings per share of common stock from continuing operations $1.90 $1.57 21 Purchased in process research and development $.13 $.04 225 Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings $.07 (100) Adjusted basic net earnings per share of common stock from continuing operations $2.03 $1.67 22 Weighted average basic shares outstanding 406.5 403.7 Diluted net earnings per share of common stock: Reported diluted net earnings per share of common stock from continuing operations $1.87 $1.54 21 Purchased in process research and development $.13 $.04 225 Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings $.07 (100) Adjusted diluted net earnings per share of common stock from continuing operations $2.00 $1.65 21 Weighted average diluted shares outstanding 411.8 410.8 The weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of these non GAAP financial measures are the same as the weighted average shares outstanding used in the calculation of the reported per share amounts. Net earnings from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $6.3 million, or $.02 per diluted share, compared to net earnings from discontinued operations of $11.1 million, or $.03 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2005. Net earnings increased 21% in 2006 to $777.7 million from $643.6 million in 2005. Basic net earnings per share increased 20% in 2006 to $1.91 from $1.59 in 2005; and diluted net earnings per share increased 20% in 2006 to $1.89 from $1.57 in 2005. 37 Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys working capital at December 31, 2007 increased $1,389.1 million to $3,571.9 million from $2,182.8 million at December 31, 2006. The increase in working capital resulted from growth in the Companys overall business, the proceeds from the sale of Physiotherapy Associates and the use of cash earnings to fund increases in accounts receivable, inventories and prepaid expenses. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding was 56 days at both December 31, 2007 and 2006 and days sales in inventory decreased one day to 137 days at December 31, 2007 from 138 days at December 31, 2006. The Company generated cash of $1,028.3 million from operations in 2007 compared with $867.3 million in 2006. The increase in cash from operations in 2007 compared with the prior year is primarily due to increased earnings partially offset by growth in the working capital accounts, primarily accounts receivable and inventories. In 2007 the Company borrowed an additional $103.7 million and used cash of $102.9 million for payments on borrowings. The Company also used cash of $187.7 million for capital expenditures, including $14.3 million related to the implementation of ERP systems at multiple manufacturing and distribution facilities; $13.9 million for facility expansions; and $7.0 million to complete the construction of the Homer Stryker Center for education and clinical research in Mahwah, New Jersey. In addition, the Company used $54.8 million for acquisitions and $89.7 million for the payment of dividends. The Company also purchased and sold marketable securities, which are classified as available for sale investments in accordance with the provisions of FASB Statement No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. The Company had $290.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2,120.3 million in marketable securities at December 31, 2007. The Company also had outstanding borrowings totaling $16.8 million at that date, all of which were classified as current obligations. The Company believes its cash on hand and marketable securities, as well as anticipated cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to fund future operating capital requirements; future manufacturing facility construction and other capital expenditures; future business and product line acquisitions to supplement its current product offerings; loaner instrumentation for surgical implants in support of new product launches; required debt repayments and the payment of dividends. As of December 31, 2007, approximately 9% of the Companys investments in available for sale securities were held in triple A rated (per Standard & Poors) asset backed debt securities, of which the majority related to investments in automobile loans. At December 31, 2007, less than 1% of the Companys investments in marketable securities were exposed to a risk of loss related to the declining value of the subprime mortgage securities market. Should additional funds be required, the Company had $1,047.3 million of additional borrowing capacity available under all of its existing credit facilities, including the Companys $1,000.0 million 5 year nonamortizing, revolving Unsecured Credit Facility that expires in November 2010. In addition, the Company had the entire $200.0 million accounts receivable securitization facility available at December 31, 2007. The Companys future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than 1 year, including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business, are summarized as follows (in millions):  Payment Period 2008  2009  2010  2011  2012  Thereafter Long term debt $ 16.8 $ $ $ $ $ Operating leases 42.0 34.3 22.2 10.3 6.7 11.7 Unconditional purchase obligations 339.7 69.1 15.1 10.8 10.3 Other 4.0 2.8 2.4 2.1 1.6 14.9 Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits and timing of employee retirements, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which income tax payments to settle these unresolved income tax positions or contributions to fund defined benefits plans will be made. 38 The Companys additional borrowing capacity, along with the expected expiration period of the commitments, is summarized as follows (in millions):  Amount of Commitment Total Expiration Per Period Amount Less than In excess of Committed 1 year 1 year Unsecured Credit Facility and other lines of credit $1,047.3 $56.4 $990.9 Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Estimates are based on historical experience, when available, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes that of its significant accounting policies (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), an understanding of the following critical accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable. The Company makes estimates regarding the future ability of its customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends. If actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional accounts receivable write offs may be necessary, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. Inventory Reserves The Company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. The markets in which the Company operates are highly competitive and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis. Such marketplace changes may cause some of the Companys products to become obsolete. The Company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. Income Taxes The Company operates in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States. Accordingly, management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions. Income tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and product royalty arrangements, may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates. Because income tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant, the Company records accruals representing managements best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters. 39 To the extent additional information becomes available, such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable outcome. Other Matters The Company distributes its products throughout the world. As a result, the Companys financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets. The Companys operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the U.S. dollar, the Japanese yen and European currencies, in particular the euro and the British pound. When the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies increases. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, the opposite situation occurs. The Company manufactures its products in the United States, France, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, Canada and Puerto Rico and incurs the costs to manufacture in the applicable local currencies. This worldwide deployment of factories serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the Companys cost of sales. The Company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk to the Company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products. The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies. All forward currency exchange contracts are marked to market each period, with resulting gains (losses) included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of earnings. At December 31, 2007, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $427.9 million and sell $257.7 million of various currencies (principally U.S. dollars and euros) with maturities ranging principally from 4 to 101 days. At December 31, 2006, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $387.9 million and sell $227.0 million of various currencies (principally U.S. dollars and euros) with maturities ranging principally from 7 to 180 days. The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would change the December 31, 2007 fair value by approximately $7.4 million. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties. The Company has certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged. These investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currencies. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar increased the value of these investments in net assets, and the related deferred gain in shareholders equity, by $152.7 million to $272.3 million from $119.6 million at December 31, 2006. The Company is partially self insured for product liability claims and utilizes a wholly owned captive insurance company in the United States to manage its self insured retention limits. The captive insurance company provides insurance reserves for estimated liabilities for product claims incurred but not reported based on actuarially determined liabilities. The actuarial valuations are based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events. In 2003 the Company announced that it received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts in connection with a U.S. Department of Justice investigation of Physiotherapy Associates billing and coding practices. Under the terms of the Physiotherapy sale agreement, Stryker retained responsibility for certain cash damages to be paid in connection with this investigation. The Companys liability for such damages was fixed under the sale agreement, with interest to be accrued through the date of payment, which occurred in 2007. Liabilities previously recorded by the Company were sufficient to cover these obligations. 40 In 2007 the Company disclosed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has made an informal inquiry of the Company regarding possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in connection with the sale of medical devices in certain foreign countries. Subsequently, in 2008, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice, Criminal Division, requesting certain documents for the period January 1, 2000 through the present in connection with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry. In 2006 the Company announced that it received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, requesting documents for the period January 2001 through the present regarding possible violations of federal criminal law, including possible violation of the antitrust laws, relating to the manufacture and sale of orthopaedic implant devices. The Company is fully cooperating with the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regarding these matters. In 2007 the Company received two warning letters from the FDA regarding compliance with certain quality system specifications at its reconstructive implant manufacturing facilities: one letter for its facility in Cork, Ireland and another for its facility in Mahwah, New Jersey. The Company takes these matters very seriously and has been fully cooperating with the FDA to address their observations.  ITEM 7A.
