ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Throughout this discussion, references are made to the following financial measures: constant currency, adjusted net earnings, adjusted basic net earnings per share, adjusted diluted net earnings per share, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations, adjusted basic net earnings per share from continuing operations and adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations. These financial measures are an alternative representation of Stryker Corporations (the Company or Stryker) past and potential future operational performance and do not replace the presentation of the Companys reported financial results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company has provided these supplemental non GAAP financial measures because they provide meaningful information regarding the Companys results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented. Management uses these non GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of its business segments, for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process and bases certain annual bonus plans on these non GAAP financial measures. In order to measure the Companys sales performance on a constant currency basis, it is necessary to remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which affects the comparability and trend of sales. Constant currency results are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates. In order to measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, the Company excludes the patent litigation gain and the income tax expenses associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings recorded in 2009, the restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and 2008, and the intangible asset impairment charge recorded in 2007, each of which affects the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. Additional details regarding the nature, determination and financial statement impact of these items are included in Results of Operations. In addition, the Company believes investors will utilize this information to evaluate period to period results on a comparable basis and to better understand potential future operating results. The Company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its Consolidated Financial Statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely solely on any single financial measure. Executive Level Overview Stryker is one of the worlds leading medical technology companies with the most broadly based range of products in orthopaedics and a significant presence in other medical specialties. Stryker works with respected medical professionals to help people lead more active and more satisfying lives. The Companys products include implants used in joint replacement, trauma and spinal surgeries; surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems; endoscopic and communications systems; patient handling and emergency medical equipment as well as other medical device products used in a variety of medical specialties. 20 Table of Contents Domestic sales accounted for 64% of total revenues in 2009. Most of the Companys products are marketed directly to doctors, hospitals and other healthcare facilities by approximately 4,100 sales and marketing personnel in the United States. Stryker primarily maintains separate and dedicated sales forces for each of its principal product lines to provide focus and a high level of expertise to each medical specialty served. International sales accounted for 36% of total revenues in 2009. The Companys products are sold in more than 100 countries through Company owned sales subsidiaries and branches as well as third party dealers and distributors. The Companys business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of orthopaedic implant surgeries is lower during the summer months. In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company acquired Ascent Healthcare Solutions, Inc. (Ascent), the market leader in the reprocessing and remanufacturing of medical devices in the United States, for $525.0 million in an all cash transaction. In addition, the Company settled an outstanding patent infringement lawsuit and received $62.5 million pursuant to a confidential settlement. The Company also repatriated $787.0 million of foreign earnings to the United States which was used in part to fund the acquisition of Ascent. In the third quarter of 2009, the Company decided to terminate certain third party agreements at the Companys EMEA Division, to simplify the organization structure at its Biotech, EMEA, Japan and Canada divisions and to discontinue selling certain products within its Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg business segments. Additional details, including the financial statement impact of these transactions, are included in Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources. In 2009 a federal grand jury in the District of Massachusetts returned an indictment charging Stryker Biotech LLC and certain current and former employees of Stryker Biotech with wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), distribution of a misbranded device and false statements to the FDA. The Company still hopes to be able to reach a fair and just resolution of this matter. Conviction of these charges could result in significant monetary fines and Stryker Biotechs exclusion from participating in federal and state healthcare programs, which could have a material affect on Stryker Biotechs business. However, the ultimate resolution of these matters is not reasonably estimatable at this time. The Company understands that certain former Stryker Biotech employees have pled guilty to charges in connection with this matter. In 2009 the FDA Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Devices Advisory Panel voted not to recommend that the Company receive marketing approval for its OP 1 Putty. The Company is reviewing its strategic alternatives for OP 1, which could be impacted by the ultimate resolution of the indictment. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company decided to simplify the structure of its Japanese distribution business and to substantially reduce development efforts associated with the product technologies acquired from Sightline Technologies Ltd. (Sightline) in 2006. Unanticipated issues arose that delayed the regulatory approval and commercialization efforts of new products associated with the product technologies acquired. Additional details, including the financial statement impact resulting from those decisions, are included in Results of Operations. 21 Table of Contents Results of Operations The table below outlines the components of net earnings from continuing operations from the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a percentage of net sales and the year to year percentage change in dollar amounts: Percentage of Net Sales Percentage Change 2009 2008 2007 2009/2008 2008/2007 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 0 % 12 % Cost of sales 32.5 31.7 31.1 2 14 Gross profit 67.5 68.3 68.9 (1 ) 11 Research, development and engineering expenses 5.0 5.5 6.3 (9 ) (2 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses 37.3 39.1 39.9 (5 ) 10 Intangibles amortization 0.5 0.6 0.7 (11 ) (3 ) Restructuring charges 1.0 0.5 92 Intangible asset impairment 0.3 (100 ) Operating income 23.7 22.6 21.8 5 16 Other income (expense) 0.4 0.9 1.0 (52 ) (3 ) Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 24.2 23.5 22.8 3 15 Income taxes 7.7 6.4 6.4 19 13 Net earnings from continuing operations 16.5 % 17.1 % 16.4 % (4 ) 16 The Company segregates its operations into two reportable business segments: Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The Orthopaedic Implants segment includes orthopaedic reconstructive (hip and knee), trauma, craniomaxillofacial and spinal implant systems and other related products. The MedSurg Equipment segment includes surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems; endoscopic and communications systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment.

Net sales grew by 2% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Companys domestic sales were $4,317.4 million for 2009, representing an increase of 1%, as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants partially offset by lower shipments of MedSurg Equipment. International sales were $2,405.7 million for 2009, representing a decrease of 1%. The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was unfavorable by $110.1 million for 2009. On a constant currency basis, international sales increased 3% in 2009 as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. 23 Table of Contents Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $4,119.7 million for 2009, representing an increase of 4%. On a constant currency basis, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 6% in 2009 as a result of higher shipments of hips, knees, trauma, craniomaxillofacial and spinal implant systems. Hip Implant Systems: Sales of hip implant systems increased 2% in 2009 (5% on a constant currency basis). In the United States, sales growth was driven by Trident hip products, X3 Polyethylene hip products, Accolade cementless hip products and Restoration Modular Hip System revision hip products. Sales growth in several hip systems, including X3 Polyethylene and Accolade cementless hip products in Europe, Canada and the Latin America and Pacific regions and Trident in Japan, also contributed to the Companys constant currency sales growth in 2009. Knee Implant Systems: Sales of knee implant systems increased 4% in 2009 (6% on a constant currency basis) due to strong sales growth in the Triathlon Knee System in the United States, Europe, Japan, Canada and the Pacific region and solid sales growth in the Scorpio Knee System in the Latin America region. Trauma Implant Systems: Sales of trauma implant systems increased 5% in 2009 (6% on a constant currency basis) as a result of sales growth in the Gamma 3 Hip Fracture System and the SPS Calcaneal Foot Plating System in the United States, Europe, Canada, Latin America and Pacific regions as well as sales growth in the Companys VariAx Distal Radius System in Europe, Canada and the Latin America region. Strong sales growth in the HydroSet injectable bone substitute product in the United States, Canada and the Pacific region also contributed to the Companys constant currency sales growth in 2009. Spinal Implant Systems: Sales of spinal implant systems increased 10% in 2009 (11% on a constant currency basis). The increase was driven by strong worldwide sales growth of thoracolumbar implant systems, interbody devices and cervical implants in the United States, Europe and the Latin America and Pacific regions. Craniomaxillofacial Implant Systems: Sales of craniomaxillofacial (CMF) implant systems increased 8% in 2009 (9% on a constant currency basis) primarily due to strong sales growth of products for neurological indications in the United States, Japan, Canada and the Latin America and Pacific regions. Sales growth of the HydroSet injectable bone substitute products in the United States, Europe Canada and the Pacific region also contributed to the Companys constant currency sales growth. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $2,603.4 million for 2009, representing a decrease of 5%. The general economic slowdown in the United States resulted in a significant and rapid contraction in hospital capital budgets that depressed demand for certain MedSurg Equipment products. The severe weakening of the economy caused the Companys hospital customers to reduce capital purchases, which generate about 60% of sales within the MedSurg Equipment segment, to a degree not previously experienced in prior recessionary periods. On a constant currency basis, sales of MedSurg Equipment decreased 4% in 2009 as higher shipments of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems were offset by lower shipments of endoscopic and communication systems as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. Surgical Equipment and Surgical Navigation Systems: Sales of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems increased 1% in 2009 (2% on a constant currency basis) due to worldwide sales growth in operating room equipment as well as sales growth in powered surgical products in the United States, Europe, Japan and the Latin America region and sales growth in interventional pain products in the United States, Japan and the Pacific region. Endoscopic and Communications Systems: Sales of endoscopic and communications systems decreased 2% in 2009 (1% decrease on a constant currency basis) due to lower sales of medical video imaging equipment products and image portal products in the United States partially offset by worldwide sales growth in arthroscopy and general surgery products as well as sales growth in communications products in Japan and the Latin America and Pacific regions and medical video imaging equipment in Europe, Japan and the Latin America and Pacific regions. 24 Table of Contents Patient Handling and Emergency Medical Equipment: Sales of patient handling and emergency medical equipment decreased 22% in 2009 (20% decrease on a constant currency basis) due to lower worldwide sales of hospital bed products and stretchers in the United States, Europe, Canada and the Pacific and Latin America regions, partially offset by sales growth in stretchers in Japan and emergency medical equipment in the United States. Cost of sales represented 32.5% of sales in 2009 compared with 31.7% in 2008. The increase in the cost of sales percentage is primarily due to increased spending for compliance initiatives, higher excess and obsolete inventory costs associated with the Orthopaedic Implants businesses as well as higher unabsorbed costs due to lower production levels. Research, development and engineering expenses represented 5.0% of sales in 2009 compared with 5.5% in 2008. The spending level in 2009 decreased by 9% to $336.2 million due to tight control on discretionary spending as well as the Companys continued focus of certain research and development resources on compliance initiatives. New product introductions in 2009 for the Orthopaedic Implants segment included the Rejuvenate Modular Primary Hip system; the VariAx elbow plating system and the Xia Uniplanar Titanium Spinal System. Within the MedSurg equipment segment, new product introductions in 2009 included the 1288 HD Camera, the Impression non powered support surface, the Flyte Suit personal protection system and the RemB micro electric system. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 5% in 2009 and represented 37.3% of sales compared with 39.1% in 2008. In 2009 the Company settled an outstanding patent infringement lawsuit and received $62.5 million pursuant to a confidential settlement agreement. This gain represented a reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses. The remaining decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2009 is due to tight control on discretionary spending that more than offset increased legal settlement costs, net of insurance recoveries, recorded for certain product liability claims. In 2009 the Company recorded $67.0 million ($48.4 million net of income taxes) in restructuring charges related to decisions to terminate certain third party agent agreements at the Companys EMEA Division, to simplify the organization structure at its Biotech, EMEA, Japan and Canada divisions and to discontinue selling certain products within its Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment segments. In 2008 the Company recorded $34.9 million ($21.7 million net of income taxes) in restructuring charges related to the decisions to simplify the structure of the Companys Japanese distribution business and to substantially reduce development efforts associated with Sightline product technologies acquired in 2006. Interest and marketable securities income, which is included in other income (expense), decreased to $53.9 million in 2009 from $97.7 million in 2008 primarily as a result of lower average yields on the Companys investments. The Companys effective income tax rate on earnings for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 31.8% compared to an effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 of 27.4%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2009 reflects the impact of restructuring charges of $48.4 million (net of $18.6 million income tax benefits), the patent litigation gain of $42.9 million (net of $19.6 million income tax expenses) and the impact of the $67.1 million income tax expenses associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings of $787.0 million. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 reflects the impact of the restructuring charges of $21.7 million (net of $13.2 million income tax benefits). In addition to these factors, the Companys reported effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 are lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily as a result of manufacturing in lower income tax jurisdictions. Net earnings decreased 4% in 2009 to $1,107.4 million from $1,147.8 million in 2008. Basic net earnings per share decreased 1% in 2009 to $2.79 from $2.81 in 2008, and diluted net earnings per share decreased to $2.77 in 2009 from $2.78 in 2008. 25 Table of Contents Excluding the impact of the patent litigation gain, the income tax charge associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings and the restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and 2008, adjusted net earnings increased 1% in 2009 to $1,180.0 million from $1,169.5 million in 2008. Adjusted basic net earnings per share increased 4% in 2009 to $2.97 from $2.87 in 2008 and adjusted diluted net earnings per share increased 4% in 2009 to $2.95 from $2.83 in 2008. The reconciliations of these non GAAP financial measures are as follows (in millions, except per share amounts): 2009 2008 PercentageChange Reported net earnings $ 1,107.4 $ 1,147.8 (4 ) Restructuring charges 48.4 21.7 123 Patent litigation gain (42.9 ) Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings 67.1 Adjusted net earnings $ 1,180.0 $ 1,169.5 1 Basic net earnings per share of common stock: Reported basic net earnings per share $ 2.79 $ 2.81 (1 ) Restructuring charges $ 0.12 $ 0.05 140 Patent litigation gain $ (0.11 ) Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings $ 0.17 Adjusted basic net earnings per share $ 2.97 $ 2.87 4 Weighted average basic shares outstanding 397.4 408.1 Diluted net earnings per share of common stock: Reported diluted net earnings per share $ 2.77 $ 2.78 (0 ) Restructuring charges $ 0.12 $ 0.05 140 Patent litigation gain $ (0.11 ) Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings $ 0.17 Adjusted diluted net earnings per share $ 2.95 $ 2.83 4 Weighted average diluted shares outstanding 399.4 413.6 The weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of these non GAAP financial measures are the same as the weighted average shares outstanding used in the calculation of the reported per share amounts. 2008 Compared with 2007 The Companys net sales increased 12% in 2008 to $6,718.2 million from $6,000.5 million in 2007. Net sales grew by 11% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix and by 1% due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Companys domestic sales were $4,282.2 million for 2008, representing an increase of 11%, as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. International sales were $2,436.0 million for 2008, representing an increase of 13%. The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $84.7 million for 2008. On a constant currency basis, international sales increased 9% in 2008 as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $3,967.5 million for 2008, representing an increase of 11%. On a constant currency basis, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 9% in 2008 as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive, trauma, spinal and craniomaxillofacial implant systems and bone cement. 26 Table of Contents Hip Implant Systems: Sales of hip implant systems increased 3% in 2008 (1% on a constant currency basis). In the United States, sales growth was driven by increased sales of the Cormet Hip Resurfacing product and sales growth in X3 Polyethylene and Accolade cementless hip products, partially offset by declines in other hip systems. Sales growth in several hip systems, including Accolade, X3 Polyethylene and ABG II in Europe and Secur Fit in Japan and the Pacific region, also contributed to the Companys constant currency sales growth in 2008. Knee Implant Systems: Sales of knee implant systems increased 14% in 2008 (13% on a constant currency basis) due to strong sales growth in the Triathlon Knee System in the United States, Europe, Canada and the Pacific region and solid sales growth in the Scorpio Knee System in Japan and the Latin America region. Trauma Implant Systems: Sales of trauma implant systems increased 18% in 2008 (14% on a constant currency basis) as a result of strong worldwide sales growth in the Gamma3 Hip Fracture System and the SPS Calcaneal Foot Plating System and strong sales growth in the Companys T2 Nailing System in the United States, Canada and the Pacific region. Strong sales growth in the HydroSet injectable bone substitute product in the United States and the Pacific region also contributed to the Companys constant currency sales growth in 2008. Spinal Implant Systems: Sales of spinal implant systems increased 19% in 2008 (18% on a constant currency basis). The increase was driven by strong worldwide sales growth of thoracolumbar implant systems, interbody devices and cervical implants. Craniomaxillofacial Implant Systems: Sales of craniomaxillofacial implant systems increased 16% in 2008 (15% on a constant currency basis) primarily due to strong sales growth of products for neurological indications and craniomaxillofacial implants and the HydroSet injectable bone substitute product in the United States and the Pacific region. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $2,750.7 million for 2008, representing an increase of 14%. On a constant currency basis, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 13% in 2008 as a result of higher shipments of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. Surgical Equipment and Surgical Navigation Systems: Sales of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems increased 17% in 2008 (15% on a constant currency basis) due to strong worldwide sales growth in powered surgical and operating room equipment as well as solid sales growth in interventional pain products in the United States and the Pacific region. Endoscopic and Communications: Sales of endoscopic and communications systems increased 9% in 2008 (8% on a constant currency basis) as a result of strong worldwide sales growth in arthroscopy and general surgery as well as strong international sales growth of medical video imaging equipment, led by the 1188 HD camera and complimentary products, partially offset by lower sales of medical video imaging equipment in the United States. Strong sales growth in communication products, led by the SwitchPoint Infinity 2, in the United States and Canada also contributed to the Companys constant currency sales growth. Patient Handling and Emergency Medical Equipment: Sales of patient handling and emergency medical equipment increased 18% in 2008 (17% on a constant currency basis) due to strong sales growth of hospital bed products in the United States and the Latin America region and stretchers and emergency medical equipment in the United States and Europe. Cost of sales represented 31.7% of sales in 2008 compared with 31.1% in 2007. The increase in the cost of sales percentage is primarily due to increased compliance initiative spending and higher commodity and freight costs. 27 Table of Contents Research, development and engineering expenses represented 5.5% of sales in 2008 compared with 6.3% in 2007. As anticipated, the spending level in 2008 decreased by 2% to $367.8 million as the Company implemented a more normalized level of spending for these costs compared to prior periods as well as the Companys focus of certain research and development resources on compliance initiatives, which has slowed down some research and development projects and reduced outside contractor spending on certain projects. New product introductions in 2008 for the Orthopaedic Implants segment included the Tritanium Primary Hip System; the Triathlon TS Revision Knee System; the Triathlon Partial Knee Resurfacing System; the Asnis Screw System; the VariAx Hand and Foot Trauma Systems; and the Xia III Thoracolumbar Spinal System. Within the MedSurg Equipment segment, new product introductions in 2008 included the S3 Med/Surg Hospital Bed and the Neptune 2 Waste Management System. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10% in 2008 and represented 39.1% of sales compared with 39.9% in 2007. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2008 is due to tight control of discretionary spending in the second half of 2008 partially offset by increases in sales related costs and costs associated with compliance activities. In 2008 the Company recorded $34.9 million ($21.7 million net of income taxes) in restructuring charges related to the decisions to simplify the structure of the Companys Japanese distribution business and to substantially reduce development efforts associated with Sightline product technologies acquired in 2006. In 2007 the Company recorded a $19.8 million charge ($12.7 million net of income taxes) to write off patents associated with intervertebral body fusion cage products. The impairment followed a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) decision to downgrade certain intervertebral body fusion products to Class II devices, along with a weak market for sales of these specific products. As a result, the Company performed a discounted cash flow analysis over the remaining life of the patented technologies and determined that the charge was required. Interest and marketable securities income, which is included in other income (expense), increased to $97.7 million in 2008 from $85.5 million in 2007 primarily as a result of increased average cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances in 2008 compared to 2007. Interest expense, which is included in other income (expense), increased to $30.5 million in 2008 from $22.2 million in 2007, primarily as a result of interest expense associated with unresolved income tax positions. The Companys effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 27.4% compared to an effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 of 28.0%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 reflects the impact of the restructuring charges of $21.7 million (net of $13.2 million income tax benefits). The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflects the impact of the intangible asset impairment charge of $12.7 million (net of $7.1 million income tax benefit). In addition to these factors, the Companys reported effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily as a result of manufacturing in lower income tax jurisdictions. Net earnings from continuing operations increased 16% in 2008 to $1,147.8 million from $986.7 million in 2007. Basic net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 17% in 2008 to $2.81 from $2.41 in 2007, and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 17% in 2008 to $2.78 from $2.37 in 2007. Excluding the impact of the restructuring charges recorded in 2008 and the charge to reflect the intangible asset impairment in 2007, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased 17% in 2008 to $1,169.5 million from $999.4 million in 2007. Adjusted basic net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 18% in 2008 to $2.87 from $2.44 in 2007, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 18% in 2008 to $2.83 from $2.40 in 2007. 28 Table of Contents The reconciliations of these non GAAP financial measures are as follows (in millions, except per share amounts): 2008 2007 PercentageChange Reported net earnings from continuing operations $ 1,147.8 $ 986.7 16 Restructuring charges 21.7 Intangible asset impairment 12.7 (100 ) Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations $ 1,169.5 $ 999.4 17 Basic net earnings per share of common stock from continuing operations: Reported basic net earnings per share from continuing operations $ 2.81 $ 2.41 17 Restructuring charges $ 0.05 Intangible asset impairment $ 0.03 (100 ) Adjusted basic net earnings per share from continuing operations $ 2.87 $ 2.44 18 Weighted average basic shares outstanding 408.1 409.7 Diluted net earnings per share of common stock from continuing operations: Reported diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations $ 2.78 $ 2.37 17 Restructuring charges $ 0.05 Intangible asset impairment $ 0.03 (100 ) Adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations $ 2.83 $ 2.40 18 Weighted average diluted shares outstanding 413.6 417.2 The weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of these non GAAP financial measures are the same as the weighted average shares outstanding used in the calculation of the reported per share amounts. Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2007 included a gain of $25.7 million (net of income taxes), or $0.06 per diluted share, to reflect the divestiture of the Companys outpatient physical therapy business, Physiotherapy Associates, and net earnings from discontinued operations of $5.0 million, or $0.01 per diluted share. Net earnings increased 13% in 2008 to $1,147.8 million from $1,017.4 million in 2007. Basic net earnings per share increased 13% in 2008 to $2.81 from $2.48 in 2007, and diluted net earnings per share increased 14% in 2008 to $2.78 from $2.44 in 2007. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys working capital at December 31, 2009 increased $893.0 million to $4,410.2 million from $3,517.2 million at December 31, 2008. The increase in working capital resulted from cash earnings, increases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses partially offset by the use of cash to fund dividend payments and acquisitions. The increase in working capital is also due to the reclassification of auction rate securities (ARS) from non current assets to current assets within the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2009, as more fully described below. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding was 56 days at December 31, 2009 and 59 days at December 31, 2008. Days sales in inventory decreased by 10 days to 145 days at December 31, 2009 from 155 days at December 31, 2008. Days sales in inventory at December 31, 2009 is lower than the December 31, 2008 level primarily due to lower levels of inventory resulting from a slowdown in sales as well as higher excess and obsolete inventory costs associated with the Orthopaedic Implants businesses. The Company generated cash of $1,460.7 million from operations in 2009 compared with $1,175.9 million in 2008. The increase in cash from operations in 2009 is primarily due to a reduction in inventories, slower growth in accounts receivable and increases in income taxes payable. 29 Table of Contents In 2009 the Company used cash of $131.3 million for capital expenditures. In addition, the Company used cash of $198.4 million for the payment of dividends and $570.2 million of cash to fund acquisitions. The Company also purchased and sold marketable securities, which are classified as available for sale investments in accordance with the provisions of the Investments Debt and Equity Securities Topic of the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (Codification). The Company had $658.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2,296.1 million in current marketable securities at December 31, 2009. The Company had outstanding borrowings totaling $18.0 million at that date, all of which were classified as current obligations. The Company believes its cash on hand and marketable securities, proceeds from the January 2010 note offering as more fully described below as well as anticipated cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to fund future operating capital requirements; future manufacturing facility construction and other capital expenditures; future business and product line acquisitions to supplement its current product offerings; loaner instrumentation for surgical implants in support of new product launches; required debt repayments and the payment of dividends. On January 15, 2010, the Company sold $500.0 million of senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2015 (the 2015 Notes) and $500.0 million of senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2020 (the 2020 Notes). The 2015 Notes will bear interest at 3.00% per year and, unless previously redeemed, will mature on January 15, 2015. The 2020 Notes will bear interest at 4.375% per year and, unless previously redeemed, will mature on January 15, 2020. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, stock repurchases and other business opportunities. Should additional funds be required, the Company had $1,049.2 million of additional borrowing capacity available under all of its existing credit facilities as of December 31, 2009, including the Companys $1,000.0 million 5 year nonamortizing, revolving Unsecured Credit Facility that expires in November 2010. The Companys additional borrowing capacity, along with the expected expiration period of the commitments, is summarized as follows (in millions): TotalAmountCommitted Amount ofCommitmentExpiration Per Period Less Than1 Year In Excessof 1 Year Unsecured Credit Facility and other lines of credit $ 1,049.2 $ 1,015.3 $ 33.9 The Company reviews declines in the fair value of its investments classified as available for sale for impairment in accordance with the provisions of the Investments Debt and Equity Securities Topic of the FASB Codification in order to determine whether the decline in fair value is an other than temporary impairment. Other than temporary impairments of available for sale marketable securities are recorded in earnings. Beginning in February 2008, liquidity issues in the global credit markets resulted in the failure of auctions for all of the ARS investments held by the Company, as the amount of securities submitted for sale in those auctions exceeded the amount of purchase bids. To date, the Company has collected all interest receivable on outstanding ARS when due and expects to continue to do so in the future. Due to current market conditions, the ARS investments have continued to experience failed auctions. These failed auctions result in a lack of liquidity in the securities but do not affect the underlying collateral of the securities. The Company does not anticipate that the lack of liquidity in its ARS, even for an extended period of time, will affect its ability to finance its operations, including its expansion programs and planned capital expenditures. The Company continues to monitor efforts by the financial markets to find alternative means for restoring the liquidity of these investments. As of December 31, 2009, the Company held $156.3 million, at par value, of ARS investments. In 2008 the Company entered into an ARS Rights agreement (Rights) with UBS Financial Services Inc. (UBS), one of its investment providers, whereby the Company received the right to sell its ARS at par value to UBS at any time 30 Table of Contents during the period June 30, 2010 through July 2, 2012. These Rights are nontransferable securities registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (U.S. SEC). As a result of accepting the ARS Rights, the Company has released UBS and its employees/agents from all claims except claims for consequential damages directly or indirectly relating to UBSs marketing and sale of ARS and agreed not to serve as a class representative or receive benefits under any class action settlement or investor fund. The Company has elected to apply the fair value option to its ARS Rights pursuant to the provisions of the Financial Instruments Topic of the FASB Codification. As a result of this election, in the twelve month period ended December 31, 2009, the Company recorded a loss of $11.0 million in other income (expense) to recognize the change in fair value estimate of its ARS Rights; the loss was offset by a corresponding gain in the fair value estimate of the related trading marketable securities. The Company intends to exercise its ARS Rights described above when it becomes due and has, therefore, reclassified the ARS as current marketable securities within its Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2009. The Companys future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than 1 year, including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business, are summarized as follows (in millions): Payment Period Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 After 2014 Long term debt $ 18.0 $ $ $ $ $ $ 18.0 Operating leases 49.0 34.3 26.3 19.4 14.3 24.8 168.1 Unconditional purchase obligations 388.9 124.5 16.2 1.9 1.3 1.3 534.1 Contributions to defined benefit plans 19.0 19.0 Other 4.0 2.1 1.6 2.1 1.3 46.4 57.5 $ 478.9 $ 160.9 $ 44.1 $ 23.4 $ 16.9 $ 72.5 $ 796.7 As further described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2009 the Companys defined benefit pension plans are in an underfunded status of $85.1 million. Due to the rules affecting tax deductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and the potential for changes in legislation in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the future periods, beyond 2010, in which contributions to fund defined benefit pension plans will be made. As further described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2009, the Company has recorded a liability for unresolved income tax positions of $292.7 million. Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the amount or the future periods in which income tax payments to settle these unresolved income tax positions will be made. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Estimates are based on historical experience, when available, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes that, of its significant accounting policies (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), an understanding of the following critical accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 31 Table of Contents Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable. The Company makes estimates regarding the future ability of its customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends. If actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional accounts receivable write offs may be necessary, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. Inventory Reserves The Company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. The markets in which the Company operates are highly competitive and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis. These marketplace changes may cause some of the Companys products to become obsolete. The Company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. Income Taxes The Company operates in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States. Accordingly, management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions. Income tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing and product royalty arrangements, may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates. Because income tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant, the Company records accruals representing managements best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters. To the extent additional information becomes available, such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable outcome. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In 2009 the Company adopted the provisions of the Business Combinations Topic of the FASB Codification. This topic significantly changes the principles and requirements for how an acquisition is recognized and measured in financial statements, including the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. This topic also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring goodwill acquired in a business combination and requires disclosures to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. The additional disclosure requirements regarding the Business Combinations Topic of the FASB Codification are included in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2008 the Company adopted the provisions of the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB Codification for financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis. This topic applies to all financial assets and financial liabilities that are being measured and reported on a fair value basis, establishes a framework for measuring fair value of assets and liabilities and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. There was no impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of the adoption of this topic. The additional disclosure requirements regarding fair value measurements are included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2009 the Company adopted the non financial assets and liabilities guidance of the Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures Topic that were previously deferred. In 2008 the Company adopted the provisions of the Financial Instruments Topic of the FASB Codification. This topic allows companies the option to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value. Such election, which may be applied on an instrument by instrument basis, is typically irrevocable once elected. The Company has elected to apply the fair value option to its ARS Rights agreement as more fully described in Liquidity and Capital Resources. 32 Table of Contents Other Matters The Company distributes its products throughout the world. As a result, the Companys financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as weak economic conditions or changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Companys operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the U.S. dollar, European currencies, in particular the euro and the British pound, the Japanese yen, the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. When the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies increases. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, the opposite situation occurs. The Company develops and manufactures its products in the United States, Canada, China, France, Germany, Ireland, Puerto Rico and Switzerland and incurs costs in the applicable local currencies. This worldwide deployment of facilities serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the Companys cost of sales. The Company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk to the Company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products as well as, in 2009, intercompany loans associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings. The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies. All forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period, with resulting gains (losses) included in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. At December 31, 2009, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $2,041.1 million and sell $280.5 million of various currencies (principally U.S. dollars and euros) with maturities ranging from 4 to 106 days. At December 31, 2008, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $412.5 million and sell $288.4 million of various currencies (principally U.S. dollars and euros) with maturities ranging from 2 to 110 days. The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would change the December 31, 2009 fair value by approximately $79.1 million. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties. The Company has certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged. These investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar increased the value of these investments in net assets and the related foreign currency translation adjustment gain in shareholders equity by $73.8 million to $277.5 million from $203.7 million at December 31, 2008. In 2009 the Company received a subpoena from the Attorney General of New Jersey requesting various documents related to the financial interests and arrangements of physicians participating in certain clinical trials for or on behalf of the Company. The Company is evaluating the scope of the subpoena and its response. The Attorney General of New Jersey reportedly issued similar subpoenas to other major medical device manufacturing companies. In 2009 a federal grand jury in the District of Massachusetts returned an indictment charging Stryker Biotech LLC and certain current and former employees of Stryker Biotech with wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), distribution of a misbranded device and false statements to the FDA. The Company still hopes to be able to reach a fair and just resolution of this matter. Conviction of these charges could result in significant monetary fines and Stryker Biotechs exclusion from participating in federal and state health care programs, which could have a material affect on Stryker Biotechs business. However, the ultimate resolution of these matters is not reasonably estimatable at this time. The Company understands that certain former Stryker Biotech employees have pled guilty to charges in connection with this matter. 33 Table of Contents In 2009 the Company received a warning letter from the U.S. FDA related to compliance issues for one of its craniomaxillofacial (CMF) implant products that was previously sold through its CMF distribution facility in Portage, Michigan. In 2008 the Company received a warning letter from the FDA related to quality systems and compliance issues at its OP 1 implant manufacturing facility in Hopkinton, Massachusetts. In 2007 the Company received two warning letters from the FDA regarding compliance with certain quality system specifications at its reconstructive implant manufacturing facilities: one letter for its facility in Cork, Ireland and another for its facility in Mahwah, New Jersey. In October 2009, the FDA informed the Company that the warning letter related to its OP 1 implant manufacturing facility had been resolved following a productive reinspection earlier in 2009. The Company takes these matters very seriously and continues to fully cooperate with the FDA to address their observations at the other facilities. In 2007 the Company announced that it reached a resolution with the U.S. Attorneys office for the District of New Jersey in connection with a previously announced investigation relating to any and all consulting contracts, professional service agreements, or remuneration agreements between Stryker Corporation and any orthopedic surgeon, orthopedic surgeon in training, or medical school graduate using or considering the surgical use of hip or knee joint replacement/reconstruction products manufactured or sold by Stryker Corporation. The resolution was in the form of a non prosecution agreement for an 18 month period that ended on March 27, 2009. During the term of the agreement, the Companys Orthopaedics subsidiary was subject to oversight by a federal monitor, as appointed by the U.S. Attorney, regarding compliance with certain standards and procedures in connection with the retention and payment of orthopaedic surgeon consultants related to reconstructive products and the provision of certain benefits to such surgeons. Subsequent to entering into the non prosecution agreement, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS) issued a civil subpoena to the Company in seeking to determine whether the Company violated various laws by paying consulting fees and providing other things of value to orthopedic surgeons and healthcare and educational institutions as inducements to use Strykers orthopedic medical devices in procedures paid for in whole or in part by Medicare. The Company produced numerous documents and other materials to HHS in response to the subpoena and had been working with HHS to attempt to narrow the scope of the requested production. In 2008 the U.S. Department of Justice and HHS sought judicial enforcement of the subpoena and a court agreed to enforce it in January 2009. At the same time, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey dismissed the Companys complaint, which had asked the court to quash the subpoena and sought other appropriate relief on the grounds that the subpoena was overbroad and oppressive. In 2007 the Company disclosed that the U.S. SEC made an informal inquiry of the Company regarding possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in connection with the sale of medical devices in certain foreign countries. Subsequently, in 2008, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice, Criminal Division, requesting certain documents for the period since January 1, 2000 in connection with the U.S. SEC inquiry. The Company is fully cooperating with the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. SEC regarding these matters. The Company is partially self insured for product liability claims and utilizes a wholly owned captive insurance company in the United States to manage its self insured retention limits. The captive insurance company provides insurance reserves for estimated liabilities for product claims incurred but not reported based on actuarially determined liabilities. The actuarial valuations are based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events. ITEM 7A.
