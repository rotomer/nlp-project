ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Throughout this discussion, references are made to the following financial measures: constant currency, adjusted net earnings, adjusted basic net earnings per share, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share. These financial measures are an alternative representation of Stryker Corporations (the Company or Stryker) past and potential future operational performance and do not replace the presentation of the Companys reported financial results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company has provided these supplemental non GAAP financial measures because they provide meaningful information regarding the Companys results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented. Management uses these non GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of its business segments, for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process and bases certain annual bonus plans on these non GAAP financial measures. In order to measure the Companys sales performance on a constant currency basis, it is necessary to remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which affects the comparability and trend of sales. Constant currency results are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates. In order to measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, the Company excludes the impairment of property, plant and equipment and gain on sale of certain assets recorded in 2010, the patent litigation gain recorded in 2009, the income tax effect associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings recorded in 2010 and 2009 and the restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and 2008, each of which affects the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. Additional details regarding the nature, determination and financial statement impact of these items are included in Results of Operations. In addition, the Company believes investors will utilize this information to evaluate period to period results on a comparable basis and to better understand potential future operating results. The Company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its Consolidated Financial Statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely solely on any single financial measure.

Net sales grew by 7% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix, 1% due to the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and 3% due to acquisitions, which were partially offset by an unfavorable impact of 2% due to changes in price. The Companys domestic sales were $4,792.8 million for 2010, representing an increase of 11%, as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. International sales were $2,527.2 million for 2010, representing an increase of 5%. The impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $69.7 million for 2010. On a constant currency basis, international sales increased 2% in 2010 as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. 23 Table of Contents Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $4,308.4 million for 2010, representing an increase of 5%. On a constant currency basis, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 3% in 2010 as a result of higher shipments of hips, knees, trauma and spinal implant systems. Hip Implant Systems: Sales of hip implant systems increased 5% in 2010 (3% on a constant currency basis). In the United States, sales growth of hip products was driven by sales of X3 Polyethylene, Rejuvenate hip products, Accolade cementless hip products and Restoration Modular Hip System revision hip products. Sales growth in X3 Polyethylene hip products in Europe, Canada, the Pacific and Latin America regions as well as sales growth in Trident hip products in Japan and the Pacific and Latin America regions also contributed to the Companys constant currency sales growth in 2010. Sales growth in Accolade cementless hip products in Europe, Japan and the Latin America region also contributed to the Companys constant currency sales growth in 2010. Knee Implant Systems: Sales of knee implant systems increased 4% in 2010 (3% on a constant currency basis) due to due to worldwide sales growth in the Triathlon knee system as well as sales growth in Scorpio knee products in the Latin America region. Trauma Implant Systems: Sales of trauma implant systems increased 8% in 2010 (7% on a constant currency basis) as a result of sales growth in the Gamma3 Hip Fracture System in the United States, Europe, Canada and the Pacific region as well as sales growth in the Companys T2 Nailing System in the United States, Europe and the Pacific region. Sales growth in VariAx distal radius products in the United States, Europe, Canada, Japan and the Latin America region also contributed to the Companys constant currency sales growth. Spinal Implant Systems: Sales of spinal implant systems increased 2% in 2010 (1% on a constant currency basis). The increase was driven by sales growth of thoracolumbar implant systems in the United States, Europe, Japan, Canada and the Latin America region, interbody device products in Japan and Canada as well as cervical implants in the United States and Canada. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $3,011.6 million in 2010, representing an increase of 16%. On a constant currency basis, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 15% in 2010 as a result of higher shipments of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems, endoscopic and communications systems as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. Sales of MedSurg Equipment were also positively impacted by 7% from acquisitions and 1% from a one time shipment of patient handling equipment. Surgical Equipment and Surgical Navigation Systems: Sales of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems increased 8% in 2010 (8% on a constant currency basis) due to worldwide sales growth in operating room equipment as well as sales growth in powered surgical products in the United States, Europe, Canada, the Pacific and Latin America regions and sales growth in interventional pain products in the United States, Japan, Canada and the Latin America region. Endoscopic and Communications Systems: Sales of endoscopic and communications systems increased 7% in 2010 (6% on a constant currency basis) due to worldwide sales growth in general surgery products and sales growth in communications products in Europe, Japan and the Latin America region. Sales growth in medical video equipment in the United States, Japan, Canada, and the Pacific and Latin America regions also contributed to the Companys constant currency sales growth. Patient Handling and Emergency Medical Equipment: Sales of patient handling and emergency medical equipment increased 20% in 2010 (18% on a constant currency basis) due to higher sales of hospital bed products and stretchers in the United States and the Latin America region. Strong sales growth of EMS products in the United States and the Pacific region also contributed to the Companys constant currency sales growth. Sales of patient handling and emergency medical equipment in 2010 were also positively impacted by 3% from acquisitions and 3% from a one time shipment of patient handling equipment. 24 Table of Contents Cost of sales represented 31.2% of sales in 2010 compared to 32.5% in 2009. The decrease in the cost of sales percentage is primarily due to lower excess and obsolete inventory charges, higher absorption due to higher production levels as well as a favorable impact from the effect of foreign currency exchange rates on costs from the Companys Euro based manufacturing sites. Research, development and engineering expenses represented 5.4% of sales in 2010 compared to 5.0% in 2009. The spending level in 2010 increased by 17% to $393.9 million. The higher spending level is the result of the Companys increased focus on new product development for anticipated future product launches and continued investments in new technologies. New product introductions in 2010 for the Orthopaedic Implants segment included the ADM X3 Mobile Bearing Acetabular system. Within the MedSurg equipment segment, new product introductions in 2010 included the Prime series of stretchers and the WiSe 1:3 Transmitter. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 8% in 2010 and represented 37.0% of sales compared to 37.3% in 2009. In 2010 the Company sold its Orthopaedic Implant manufacturing facility in Caen, France and recorded a gain of $24.3 million, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. In 2009 the Company settled an outstanding patent infringement lawsuit and received $62.5 million pursuant to a confidential settlement agreement. This gain also represented a reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses. The remaining decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in 2010 is primarily due to management of discretionary spending levels. In 2010 the Company announced a definitive agreement to sell its OP 1 product family for use in orthopaedic bone applications and its manufacturing facility based in Lebanon, NH. As a result of the announcement, the Company recorded a $76.6 million (net of $46.9 million income tax expense) non cash impairment charge to reflect the reduction of the carrying amount of the associated assets to their fair value. Interest and marketable securities income, which is included in other income (expense), decreased to $48.7 million in 2010 from $53.9 million in 2009 primarily as a result of lower average yields on the Companys investments. Interest expense, which is also included in other income (expense), increased to $77.5 million in 2010 from $23.2 million in 2009 primarily as a result of the interest cost on the debt issued in January 2010. The Companys effective income tax rate on earnings for the year ended December 31, 2010 was 26.4% compared to an effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2009 of 31.8%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 reflects the property, plant and equipment impairment charge of $76.6 million (net of $46.9 million income tax benefit), the gain on sale of the Caen facility of $13.4 million (net of $10.9 million income tax expense) and the impact of the favorable income tax expense adjustment of $7.4 million associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings to the United States completed in the fourth quarter of 2009. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2009 reflects the impact of restructuring charges of $48.4 million (net of $18.6 million income tax benefits), the patent litigation gain of $42.9 million (net of $19.6 million income tax expenses) and the impact of the $67.1 million income tax expenses associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings of $787.0 million. The Companys effective income tax rate on earnings for the fourth quarter of 2010 was 22.2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 of 41.5%. The effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2010 reflects the property, plant and equipment impairment charge of $76.6 million (net of $46.9 million income tax benefit). The effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2009 reflects the patent litigation gain of $42.9 million (net of $19.6 million income tax expenses) and the impact of the $67.1 million income tax expenses associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings of $787.0 million. In addition to these factors, the Companys reported effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 are lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily as a result of manufacturing in lower income tax jurisdictions. Net earnings increased 15% in 2010 to $1,273.4 million from $1,107.4 million in 2009. Basic net earnings per share increased 15% in 2010 to $3.21 from $2.79 in 2009, and diluted net earnings per share increased 15% to $3.19 in 2010 from $2.77 in 2009. 25 Table of Contents Excluding the impact of the property, plant and equipment impairment charge and gain on sale of certain assets recorded in 2010, the patent litigation gain recorded in 2009, the income tax adjustment associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings recorded in 2010 and 2009 and the restructuring charges recorded in 2009, adjusted net earnings increased 13% in 2010 to $1,329.2 million from $1,180.0 million in 2009. Adjusted basic net earnings per share increased 13% in 2010 to $3.35 from $2.97 in 2009 and adjusted diluted net earnings per share increased 13% in 2010 to $3.33 from $2.95 in 2009. The reconciliations of these non GAAP financial measures are as follows (in millions, except per share amounts): 2010 2009 PercentageChange Reported net earnings $ 1,273.4 $ 1,107.4 15 Restructuring charges 48.4 (100 ) Patent litigation gain (42.9 ) (100 ) Gain on sale of property, plant and equipment (13.4 ) Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings (7.4 ) 67.1 Impairment of property, plant and equipment 76.6 Adjusted net earnings $ 1,329.2 $ 1,180.0 13 Basic net earnings per share of common stock: Reported basic net earnings per share $ 3.21 $ 2.79 15 Restructuring charges $ 0.12 (100 ) Patent litigation gain $ (0.11 ) (100 ) Gain on sale of property, plant and equipment $ (0.03 ) Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings $ (0.02 ) $ 0.17 Impairment of property, plant and equipment $ 0.19 Adjusted basic net earnings per share $ 3.35 $ 2.97 13 Weighted average basic shares outstanding 396.4 397.4 Diluted net earnings per share of common stock: Reported diluted net earnings per share $ 3.19 $ 2.77 15 Restructuring charges $ 0.12 (100 ) Patent litigation gain $ (0.11 ) (100 ) Gain on sale of property, plant and equipment $ (0.03 ) Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings $ (0.02 ) $ 0.17 Impairment of property, plant and equipment $ 0.19 Adjusted diluted net earnings per share $ 3.33 $ 2.95 13 Weighted average diluted shares outstanding 399.5 399.4 The weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of these non GAAP financial measures are the same as the weighted average shares outstanding used in the calculation of the reported per share amounts. 2009 Compared to 2008 The Companys net sales increased to $6,723.1 million in 2009 from $6,718.2 million in 2008. Net sales grew by 2% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Companys domestic sales were $4,317.4 million for 2009, representing an increase of 1%, as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants partially offset by lower shipments of MedSurg Equipment. 26 Table of Contents International sales were $2,405.7 million for 2009, representing a decrease of 1%. The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was unfavorable by $110.1 million for 2009. On a constant currency basis, international sales increased 3% in 2009 as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $4,119.7 million for 2009, representing an increase of 4%. On a constant currency basis, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 6% in 2009 as a result of higher shipments of hips, knees, trauma, craniomaxillofacial and spinal implant systems. Hip Implant Systems: Sales of hip implant systems increased 2% in 2009 (5% on a constant currency basis). In the United States, sales growth was driven by Trident hip products, X3 Polyethylene hip products, Accolade cementless hip products and Restoration Modular Hip System revision hip products. Sales growth in several hip systems, including X3 Polyethylene and Accolade cementless hip products in Europe, Canada and the Latin America and Pacific regions and Trident hip products in Japan also contributed to the Companys constant currency sales growth in 2009. Knee Implant Systems: Sales of knee implant systems increased 4% in 2009 (6% on a constant currency basis) due to strong sales growth in the Triathlon Knee System in the United States, Europe, Japan, Canada and the Pacific region and solid sales growth in the Scorpio Knee System in the Latin America region. Trauma Implant Systems: Sales of trauma implant systems increased 5% in 2009 (6% on a constant currency basis) as a result of sales growth in the Gamma 3 Hip Fracture System and the SPS Calcaneal Foot Plating System in the United States, Europe, Canada and the Latin America and Pacific regions as well as sales growth in the Companys VariAx Distal Radius System in Europe, Canada and the Latin America region. Strong sales growth of the HydroSet injectable bone substitute product in the United States, Canada and the Pacific region also contributed to the Companys constant currency sales growth in 2009. Spinal Implant Systems: Sales of spinal implant systems increased 10% in 2009 (11% on a constant currency basis). The increase was driven by strong worldwide sales growth of thoracolumbar implant systems, interbody devices and cervical implants in the United States, Europe and the Latin America and Pacific regions. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $2,603.4 million for 2009, representing a decrease of 5%. The general economic slowdown in the United States resulted in a significant and rapid contraction in hospital capital budgets that depressed demand for certain MedSurg Equipment products. The severe weakening of the economy caused the Companys hospital customers to reduce capital purchases, which generates the majority of sales within the MedSurg Equipment segment, to a degree not previously experienced in prior recessionary periods. On a constant currency basis, sales of MedSurg Equipment decreased 4% in 2009 as higher shipments of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems were offset by lower shipments of endoscopic and communication systems as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. Surgical Equipment and Surgical Navigation Systems: Sales of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems increased 1% in 2009 (2% on a constant currency basis) due to worldwide sales growth in operating room equipment as well as sales growth in powered surgical products in the United States, Europe, Japan and the Latin America region and sales growth in interventional pain products in the United States, Japan and the Pacific region. Endoscopic and Communications Systems: Sales of endoscopic and communications systems decreased 2% in 2009 (1% decrease on a constant currency basis) due to lower sales of medical video imaging equipment products and image portal products in the United States partially offset by worldwide sales growth in arthroscopy and general surgery products, sales growth in communications products in Japan and the Latin America and Pacific regions and medical video imaging equipment in Europe, Japan and the Latin America and Pacific regions. 27 Table of Contents Patient Handling and Emergency Medical Equipment: Sales of patient handling and emergency medical equipment decreased 22% in 2009 (20% decrease on a constant currency basis) due to lower worldwide sales of hospital bed products and stretchers in the United States, Europe, Canada and the Pacific and Latin America regions, partially offset by sales growth in stretchers in Japan and emergency medical equipment in the United States. Cost of sales represented 32.5% of sales in 2009 compared to 31.7% in 2008. The increase in the cost of sales percentage is primarily due to increased spending for compliance initiatives, higher excess and obsolete inventory costs associated with the Orthopaedic Implants businesses as well as higher unabsorbed costs due to lower production levels. Research, development and engineering expenses represented 5.0% of sales in 2009 compared to 5.5% in 2008. The spending level in 2009 decreased by 9% to $336.2 million due to tight control on discretionary spending as well as the Companys continued focus of certain research and development resources on compliance initiatives. New product introductions in 2009 for the Orthopaedic Implants segment included the Rejuvenate Modular Primary Hip system, the VariAx elbow plating system and the Xia Uniplanar Titanium Spinal System. Within the MedSurg equipment segment, new product introductions in 2009 included the 1288 HD Camera, the Impression non powered support surface, the Flyte Suit personal protection system and the RemB micro electric system. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 5% in 2009 and represented 37.3% of sales compared to 39.1% in 2008. In 2009 the Company settled an outstanding patent infringement lawsuit and received $62.5 million pursuant to a confidential settlement agreement. This gain represented a reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses. The remaining decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2009 is due to tight control on discretionary spending that more than offset increased legal settlement costs, net of insurance recoveries, recorded for certain product liability claims. In 2009 the Company recorded $67.0 million ($48.4 million net of income taxes) in restructuring charges related to decisions to terminate certain third party agent agreements at the Companys EMEA Division, to simplify the organization structure at its Biotech, EMEA, Japan and Canada divisions and to discontinue selling certain products within its Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment segments. In 2008 the Company recorded $34.9 million ($21.7 million net of income taxes) in restructuring charges related to the decisions to simplify the structure of the Companys Japanese distribution business and to substantially reduce development efforts associated with Sightline product technologies acquired in 2006. Interest and marketable securities income, which is included in other income (expense), decreased to $53.9 million in 2009 from $97.7 million in 2008 primarily as a result of lower average yields on the Companys investments. The Companys effective income tax rate on earnings for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 31.8% compared to an effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 of 27.4%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2009 reflects the impact of restructuring charges of $48.4 million (net of $18.6 million income tax benefits), the patent litigation gain of $42.9 million (net of $19.6 million income tax expenses) and the impact of the $67.1 million income tax expenses associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings of $787.0 million. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 reflects the impact of the restructuring charges of $21.7 million (net of $13.2 million income tax benefits). In addition to these factors, the Companys reported effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 are lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily as a result of manufacturing in lower income tax jurisdictions. Net earnings decreased 4% in 2009 to $1,107.4 million from $1,147.8 million in 2008. Basic net earnings per share decreased 1% in 2009 to $2.79 from $2.81 in 2008, and diluted net earnings per share decreased to $2.77 in 2009 from $2.78 in 2008. 28 Table of Contents Excluding the impact of the patent litigation gain and the income tax charge associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings recorded in 2009 and the restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and 2008, adjusted net earnings increased 1% in 2009 to $1,180.0 million from $1,169.5 million in 2008. Adjusted basic net earnings per share increased 4% in 2009 to $2.97 from $2.87 in 2008 and adjusted diluted net earnings per share increased 4% in 2009 to $2.95 from $2.83 in 2008. The reconciliations of these non GAAP financial measures are as follows (in millions, except per share amounts): 2009 2008 PercentageChange Reported net earnings $ 1,107.4 $ 1,147.8 (4 ) Restructuring charges 48.4 21.7 123 Patent litigation gain (42.9 ) Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings 67.1 Adjusted net earnings $ 1,180.0 $ 1,169.5 1 Basic net earnings per share of common stock: Reported basic net earnings per share $ 2.79 $ 2.81 (1 ) Restructuring charges $ 0.12 $ 0.05 140 Patent litigation gain $ (0.11 ) Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings $ 0.17 Adjusted basic net earnings per share $ 2.97 $ 2.87 4 Weighted average basic shares outstanding 397.4 408.1 Diluted net earnings per share of common stock: Reported diluted net earnings per share $ 2.77 $ 2.78 Restructuring charges $ 0.12 $ 0.05 140 Patent litigation gain $ (0.11 ) Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings $ 0.17 Adjusted diluted net earnings per share $ 2.95 $ 2.83 4 Weighted average diluted shares outstanding 399.4 413.6 The weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of these non GAAP financial measures are the same as the weighted average shares outstanding used in the calculation of the reported per share amounts. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys working capital at December 31, 2010 increased $1,616.2 million to $6,026.4 million from $4,410.2 million at December 31, 2009. The increase in working capital was primarily due to the issuance of $1,000.0 million of senior unsecured notes in January 2010 as well as increases in accounts receivable, inventories and prepaid expenses, partially offset by the use of cash to fund dividend payments and acquisitions. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding was 56 days at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Days sales in inventory increased by 9 days to 154 days at December 31, 2010 from 145 days at December 31, 2009. Days sales in inventory at December 31, 2010 is higher than the December 31, 2009 level primarily due to higher levels of inventory in support of anticipated 2011 sales growth. The Company generated cash of $1,547.4 million from operations in 2010 compared to $1,460.7 million in 2009. The increase in cash from operations in 2010 is primarily due to increased earnings partially offset by increased inventory levels and higher tax payments. 29 Table of Contents In 2010 the Company used cash of $425.5 million for the repurchase of common stock, $238.3 million for the payment of dividends, $182.1 million for capital expenditures and $265.4 million for acquisitions. On January 15, 2010, the Company sold $500.0 million of the 2015 Notes and $500.0 million of the 2020 Notes. The 2015 Notes bear interest at 3.00% per year and, unless previously redeemed, will mature on January 15, 2015. The 2020 Notes bear interest at 4.375% per year and, unless previously redeemed, will mature on January 15, 2020. The Company received net proceeds of $996.1 million, net of an offering discount of $3.9 million. The 2015 Notes and 2020 Notes carry effective interest rates of 3.02% and 4.46%, respectively. Debt issuance costs of $10.5 million were incurred in connection with the sale of the senior unsecured notes. These costs were capitalized and are amortized to interest expense over the lives of the related senior unsecured notes. The Company also purchased and sold marketable securities, including exercising its Auction Rate Securities (ARS) Rights agreement, which are classified as available for sale investments and trading marketable securities, respectively, in accordance with the provisions of the Investments Debt and Equity Securities Topic of the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (Codification). The Company had $1,757.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2,622.5 million in current marketable securities at December 31, 2010. The Company had outstanding borrowings totaling $1,021.8 million at December 31, 2010. On January 3, 2011 the Company completed the acquisition of the Neurovascular division from Boston Scientific Corporation. The initial payment of $1.45 billion was funded from the Companys cash position. An addition $50.0 million will be payable upon completion of certain milestones. The Company believes its cash and current marketable securities on hand, anticipated future cash flows from operations and additional borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities will be sufficient to fund future operating capital requirements; future manufacturing facility construction and other capital expenditures; loaner instrumentation for surgical implants in support of new product launches; future debt service requirements; and the payment of dividends. In August 2010 the Company refinanced its credit facility with a new $1,000.0 million Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility due August 2013 (the 2010 Facility). The 2010 Facility replaces the previously outstanding $1,000.0 million Unsecured Credit Facility due in November 2010 (the 2005 Facility). The 2010 Facility includes an increase option permitting the Company to increase the size of the facility up to an additional $500.0 million, a $500.0 million multicurrency sublimit (with no sublimit for euro borrowings), a $100.0 million letter of credit sublimit and other terms, conditions and covenants substantially the same as the 2005 Facility. The 2010 Facility has an annual facility fee ranging from 10 to 45 basis points and bears interest at LIBOR, as defined in the 2010 Facility agreement, plus an applicable margin ranging from 65 to 205 basis points, both of which are dependent on the Companys credit rating. Based on the Companys current credit ratings, the 2010 Facility has an annual facility fee of 12.5 basis points and an interest margin of 87.5 basis points. Should additional funds be required, the Company had $1,027.5 million of additional borrowing capacity available under all of its existing credit facilities as of December 31, 2010, including the 2010 Facility. The Companys additional borrowing capacity, along with the expected expiration period of the commitments, is summarized as follows (in millions): TotalAmountCommitted Amount ofCommitmentExpiration Per Period Less Than1 Year In Excessof 1 Year Unsecured Credit Facility and other lines of credit $ 1,027.5 $ 117.1 $ 910.4 The Company reviews declines in the fair value of its investments classified as available for sale for impairment in accordance with the provisions of the Investments Debt and Equity Securities Topic of the FASB Codification in order to determine whether the decline in fair value is an other than temporary impairment. Other than temporary impairments of available for sale marketable securities are recorded in earnings. 30 Table of Contents In June 2010 the Company exercised the ARS Rights agreement (ARS Rights) it had entered into in 2008 with UBS Financial Services Inc. (UBS), one of its investment providers, whereby the Company received the right to sell its ARS at par value to UBS at any time during the period from June 30, 2010 through July 2, 2012. Pursuant to this agreement, the Company redeemed its entire remaining outstanding ARS investment of $139.9 million par value in the second quarter. Prior to the exercise of the ARS Rights, the Company had applied the fair value option to its ARS Rights pursuant to the provisions of the Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Topic of the FASB Codification. As a result of this election, in the twelve month period ended December 31, 2010, the Company recorded a loss of $17.0 million in other income (expense) to recognize the change in fair value estimate of its ARS Rights. These losses were offset by corresponding gains in the fair value estimate of the related ARS investment. The Companys future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than 1 year, including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business, are summarized as follows (in millions): Payment Period 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 After 2015 Total Balance sheet obligations: Long term debt $ 25.3 $ $ $ $ 499.6 $ 496.9 $ 1,021.8 Contributions to defined benefit plans 18.7 18.7 Other 8.6 2.2 2.7 1.9 1.7 39.8 56.9 Off balance sheet arrangements: Unconditional purchase obligations 548.8 181.0 140.6 120.1 91.5 1,082.0 Operating leases 48.2 36.0 24.8 17.4 12.3 10.2 148.9 $ 649.6 $ 219.2 $ 168.1 $ 139.4 $ 605.1 $ 546.9 $ 2,328.3 As further described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2010 the Companys defined benefit pension plans are in an underfunded status of $107.7 million. Due to the rules affecting tax deductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and the potential for changes in legislation in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the future periods, beyond 2011, in which contributions to fund defined benefit pension plans will be made. As further described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2010, the Company has recorded a liability for uncertain income tax positions of $365.6 million. Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Estimates are based on historical experience, when available, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes that, of its significant accounting policies (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), an understanding of the following critical accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 31 Table of Contents Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable. The Company makes estimates regarding the future ability of its customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends. If actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional accounts receivable write offs may be necessary, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. Inventory Reserves The Company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. The markets in which the Company operates are highly competitive and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis. These marketplace changes may cause some of the Companys products to become obsolete. The Company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. Income Taxes The Company operates in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States. Accordingly, management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions. Income tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing, product royalty and foreign branch arrangements, may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates. Because income tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant, the Company records accruals representing managements best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters. To the extent additional information becomes available, such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable outcome. Legal and Other Contingencies The Company is involved in various proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and intellectual property, and other matters that are more fully described in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time. In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory relief, which could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements. For legal matters for which management has sufficient information to reasonably estimate the Companys future obligations, a liability representing managements best estimate of the probable cost, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded. The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies. If actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management, additional expense may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. To partially mitigate losses arising from unfavorable outcomes in such matters, the Company purchases third party insurance coverage subject to certain deductibles and loss limitations. Future operating results may be unfavorably impacted by any settlement payments or losses beyond the amounts of insurance carried. In addition, such matters may negatively impact the Companys ability to obtain cost effective third party insurance coverage in future periods. 32 Table of Contents Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In 2010 the Company adopted the provisions of the Improvement to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities Topic of the FASB Codification. The topic requires a qualitative approach to identifying a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity (VIE) and requires ongoing assessment of whether an entity is a VIE and whether an interest in a VIE makes the holder the primary beneficiary of the VIE. There was no impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of the adoption of this topic of the FASB Codification. In 2010 the Company adopted the provisions of the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic Improving Disclosures About Fair Value Measurements of the FASB Codification. This topic requires companies to make new disclosures about recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements, including significant transfers into and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, and information on purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurements. The enhanced disclosures about recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements are included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2009 the Company adopted the provisions of the Business Combinations Topic of the FASB Codification. This topic significantly changes the principles and requirements for how an acquisition is recognized and measured in financial statements, including the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. This topic also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring goodwill acquired in a business combination and requires disclosures to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. The additional disclosure requirements regarding the Business Combinations Topic of the FASB Codification are included in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Matters The Company distributes its products throughout the world. As a result, the Companys financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as weak economic conditions or changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Companys operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the U.S. dollar, European currencies, in particular the euro and the British pound, the Japanese yen, the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. When the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies increases. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, the opposite situation occurs. The Company develops and manufactures its products in the United States, China, France, Germany, Ireland, Puerto Rico and Switzerland and incurs costs in the applicable local currencies. This worldwide deployment of facilities serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the Companys cost of sales. The Company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk to the Company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products as well as, in 2010, nonfunctional cash balances associated with the anticipated acquisition of the Neurovascular division from Boston Scientific and, in 2009, intercompany loans associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings. The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies. All forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period, with resulting gains (losses) included in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. At December 31, 2010, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $1,011.9 million and sell $366.9 million of various currencies (principally U.S. dollars and euros) with maturities ranging from 7 to 99 days. At December 31, 2009, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange 33 Table of Contents contracts to purchase $2,041.1 million and sell $280.5 million of various currencies (principally U.S. dollars and euros) with maturities ranging from 4 to 106 days. The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would change the December 31, 2010 fair value by approximately $63.9 million. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties. The Company has certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged. These investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the strengthening of U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies decreased the value of these investments in net assets and the related foreign currency translation adjustment loss in shareholders equity by $81.0 million to $196.5 million from $277.5 million at December 31, 2009. In the third quarter of 2010, the Company received separate subpoenas from the U.S. Department of Justice related to (i) the sales, marketing and regulatory matters related to the Stryker PainPump and (ii) sales, marketing and regulatory matters related to the OtisKnee device. The Company is in the process of responding to these subpoenas. In March 2010 a shareholders derivative action complaint against certain current and former Directors and Officers of the Company was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan Southern Division. This lawsuit was brought by the Westchester Putnam Counties Heavy and Highway Laborers Local 60 Benefit Funds and Laborers Local 235 Benefit Funds. The complaint alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duties and gross mismanagement in connection with certain product recalls, FDA warning letters, government investigations relating to physician compensation and the criminal proceeding brought against the Companys Biotech division. The case has been stayed while a Special Committee of the Board of Directors evaluates the claims. In January 2010 a purported class action lawsuit against the Company was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of those who purchased the Companys common stock between January 25, 2007 and November 13, 2008, inclusive. The lawsuit seeks remedies under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In May 2010 the lawsuit was transferred to the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan Southern Division. The Company intends to defend itself vigorously. In 2009 a federal grand jury in the District of Massachusetts returned an indictment charging Stryker Biotech LLC and certain current and former employees of Stryker Biotech with wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the FDA, distribution of a misbranded device and false statements to the FDA. The Company still hopes to be able to reach a fair and just resolution of this matter. The ultimate resolution of this matter is not reasonably estimable at this time, however, a conviction on the charges described above could result in significant monetary fines. Because Stryker Biotech is not presently involved in the sale of health care products and services (see additional information in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), any conviction on these charges resulting in exclusion from participating in federal and state health care programs would not be expected to have a material effect on Stryker Biotechs present business operations. Certain former Stryker Biotech employees have pled guilty to charges in connection with this matter. In 2009 the Company received a warning letter from the FDA related to compliance issues for one of its craniomaxillofacial (CMF) implant products that was previously sold through its CMF distribution facility in Portage, Michigan. In 2007 the Company received two warning letters from the FDA regarding compliance with certain quality system specifications at its reconstructive implant manufacturing facilities: one letter for its facility in Cork, Ireland and another for its facility in Mahwah, New Jersey. In March 2010 the FDA informed the Company that the warning letter related to its Mahwah manufacturing facility had been resolved following a re inspection in 2009 and additional corrective actions. In May 2010 the FDA informed the Company that the 34 Table of Contents warning letters related to its Cork, Ireland and CMF facilities had been resolved following FDA re inspection of the Cork, Ireland facility and additional corrective actions at both the Cork and CMF facilities. In 2007 the Company announced that it reached a resolution with the U.S. Attorneys office for the District of New Jersey in connection with an investigation relating to any and all consulting contracts, professional service agreements, or remuneration agreements between Stryker Corporation and any orthopedic surgeon, orthopedic surgeon in training, or medical school graduate using or considering the surgical use of hip or knee joint replacement/reconstruction products manufactured or sold by Stryker Corporation. The resolution was in the form of a non prosecution agreement, which included oversight by a federal monitor, for an 18 month period that ended on March 27, 2009. Subsequent to entering into the non prosecution agreement, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS) issued a civil subpoena to the Company in seeking to determine whether the Company violated various laws by paying consulting fees and providing other things of value to orthopedic surgeons and healthcare and educational institutions as inducements to use Strykers orthopedic medical devices in procedures paid for in whole or in part by Medicare. The investigation is ongoing and the Company has produced numerous documents and other materials to HHS in response to the subpoena. In 2007 the Company disclosed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made an informal inquiry of the Company regarding possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in connection with the sale of medical devices in certain foreign countries. Subsequently, in 2008, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice, Criminal Division, requesting certain documents for the period since January 1, 2000 in connection with the SEC inquiry. The Company is fully cooperating with the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC regarding these matters. ITEM 7A.
