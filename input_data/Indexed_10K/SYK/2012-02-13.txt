ITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under GAAP with certain non GAAP financial measures, including percentage sales growth in constant currency, adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share. We believe that these non GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. Management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency, adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Management uses these non GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments, for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain annual bonus plans on these non GAAP financial measures. To measure percentage sales growth in constant currency, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates. To measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. Because non GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies non GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth, net earnings and diluted net earnings per share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non GAAP financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures at the end of the discussion of Results of Operations below, provide a more complete understanding of our business. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.ABOUT STRYKERStryker is one of the worlds leading medical technology companies, with 2011 revenues of $8,307 and net earnings of $1,345. We are dedicated to helping healthcare professionals perform their jobs more efficiently while enhancing patient care. We offer a diverse array of innovative medical technologies, including reconstructive, medical and surgical, and neurotechnology and spine products, to help people lead more active and more satisfying lives. In 2011 we began segregating our reporting into three reportable business segments: Reconstructive, MedSurg, and Neurotechnology and Spine. See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Recent Business DevelopmentsIn January 2012 we reached a settlement regarding a 2009 indictment charging Stryker Biotech LLC and certain then current employees and a former employee of Stryker Biotech with wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the FDA, distribution of a misbranded device and false statements to the FDA. We reached a settlement with the United States Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts, under which Stryker pled to one misdemeanor charge and paid a non tax deductible fine of $15. As a result of this resolution, the Department of Justice dismissed all thirteen felony charges against Stryker Biotech contained in the 2009 federal grand jury indictment. All of the charges against the then current and former employees of Stryker Biotech have also been dismissed. The settlement represented a recognized subsequent event and accordingly was recorded in our fourth quarter 2011 results.In 2011 we recorded $38 in severance and related costs in connection with focused reductions of our global workforce and other restructuring activities that are expected to reduce our global workforce by approximately 5% by the end of 2012. The targeted reductions and other restructuring activities are being initiated to provide efficiencies and realign resources in advance of the new Medical Device Excise Tax scheduled to begin in 2013, as well as to allow for continued investment in strategic areas and drive growth. In addition, we recorded $25 in intangible asset impairments and $13 in contractual and other obligations, as certain of our restructuring actions resulted in the discontinued use of specific assets and the exit of certain lease and other commitments.In 2011 we recorded an income tax benefit related to a favorable settlement with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regarding its proposed adjustment to our previously filed 2003 through 2007 income tax returns related to income tax positions we had taken with respect to our cost sharing arrangements with two wholly owned entities operating in Ireland, and we recorded charges for other uncertain tax positions related to the outcome of the IRS settlements. The net benefit of these adjustments for uncertain tax positions was $99 (net of tax).In October 2011 we acquired Concentric Medical, Inc. (Concentric), which manufactures and markets minimally invasive products for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, in an all cash transaction for $135. The acquisition of Concentric enhances our product offerings within our Neurotechnology and Spine segment.In July 2011 we completed the acquisition of Memometal Technologies (Memometal) in an all cash transaction for $150, including the assumption of $9 in debt, as well as an additional $12 to be paid upon the completion of certain milestones. The acquisition of 9 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.Memometal enhances our product offerings within our Reconstructive segment.In June 2011 we completed the acquisition of Orthovita, Inc. (Orthovita) in an all cash transaction for $316. The acquisition of Orthovita complements our existing product offerings, primarily within our Neurotechnology and Spine business segment. In February 2011 we completed the previously announced sale of our OP 1 product family for use in orthopaedic bone applications and our manufacturing facility based in West Lebanon, NH for total consideration of $60.In January 2011 we completed the previously announced acquisition of assets of the Neurovascular division of Boston Scientific Corporation (Neurovascular) in an all cash transaction for $1,450, with an additional $50 payment to be made upon completion of certain milestones. The acquisition of Neurovascular substantially enhances our presence in the neurotechnology market, allowing us to offer a comprehensive portfolio of products in both neurosurgical and neurovascular devices. In September 2011 we sold $750 of senior unsecured notes due September 2016 and in January 2010 we sold $500 of senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2015 and $500 of senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2020. The net proceeds from the offerings have been and will continue to be available for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, stock repurchases and other business opportunities.

In 2011, net sales grew by 6.1% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix, 2.4% due to the favorable impact of foreign currency and 6.8% due to acquisitions, which were partially offset by an unfavorable impact of 1.8% due to changes in price. In 2010, net sales grew by 6.9% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix, 1.0% due to the favorable impact of foreign currency and 2.6% due to acquisitions, which were partially offset by an unfavorable impact of 1.7% due to changes in price.In the United States, net sales increased 9.9% in 2011, after increasing 11.0% in 2010. In constant currency, international sales increased 13.4% in 2011, compared to 2.2% in 2010. In 2011 acquisitions contributed $496 or 6.8% to net sales, compared to $177 or 2.6% in 2010. The remaining increases in 2011 and 2010 were primarily due to higher United States shipments of Medsurg products and higher international shipments of MedSurg products and Neurotechnology and Spine products.The following geographical sales growth information by segment is provided to supplement the net sales information presented above:10 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.

The increase in units sold was due to higher industry demand. In addition, net sales were negatively impacted by the unfavorable impact of changes in price, which were partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency. In constant currency Reconstructive net sales increased by 1.5% in 2011. Reconstructive net sales for 2010 increased 4.9% from 2009, primarily due to increases in unit volumes for Hips, Knees, and Trauma and Extremities products, due to higher worldwide industry demand. In constant currency Reconstructive net sales increased by 3.5% in 2010.MedSurg net sales in 2011 increased 12.7% from 2010, led by Medical while Endoscopy and Instruments also increased, primarily due to a 9.5% increase in unit volume and changes in product mix, the favorable impact of foreign currency and acquisitions. In constant currency MedSurg net sales increased by 11.2% in 2011. MedSurg net sales in 2010 increased 15.5% from 2009, led by increases in Medical as well as increases in Endoscopy and Instruments. Net sales in 2010 were positively impacted by 7.1% from acquisitions; the remainder is due to increases in unit volume from higher worldwide demand. In constant currency MedSurg net sales increased by 14.7% in 2010.Neurotechnology and Spine net sales in 2011 increased 48.5% from 2010, primarily due to the acquisition of Neurovascular; sales growth from acquisitions was 42.6%. The remainder of the increase included 6.3% due to increases in unit volume and changes in product mix and the favorable impact of foreign currency, which were partially offset by an unfavorable impact of changes in price. In constant currency Neurotechnology and Spine net sales in 2011 increased by 46.4%. Neurotechnology and Spine net sales in 2010 increased 6.1% from 2009, primarily due to increases in unit volumes in both Spine and Neurotechnology product lines, from higher worldwide demand. In constant currency Neurotechnology and Spine net sales in 2010 increased by 5.6%. Consolidated Cost of SalesCost of sales increased 23.0% from 2010 to 33.8% of sales compared to 31.2% in 2010. Cost of sales in 2011 includes an additional cost of $143 ($97 net of taxes) related to inventory that was stepped up to fair value following the acquisitions of Neurovascular, 11 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.Orthovita, Memometal and Concentric. The remaining increase in the cost of sales percentage was primarily due to the impact of lower pricing on sales resulting in an increase in cost of sales as a percent of sales and the impact of changes in product mix and of a weaker United States dollar on purchases from international manufacturing operations. Cost of sales in 2010 decreased 4.7% from 2009 to 31.2% of sales compared to 32.5% in 2009. The decrease in the cost of sales percentage was primarily due to lower excess and obsolete inventory charges, higher absorption due to higher production levels as well as a favorable impact from the effect of foreign currency on costs from our euro based manufacturing sites.Research, Development and Engineering ExpensesResearch, development and engineering expenses represented 5.6% of sales in 2011 compared to 5.4% in 2010 and 5.0% in 2009. The higher spending levels are the result of our focus on new product development for anticipated future product launches and continued investments in new technologies. Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses in 2011 increased 16.4% and represented 37.9% of sales compared to 37.0% in 2010 and 37.3% in 2009. In 2011 we recorded $66 ($45 net of taxes) in transaction and acquisition costs and integration related charges associated with the acquisitions of the Neurovascular, Orthovita, Memometal and Concentric businesses. In addition, in 2011 general and administrative expenses include the payment of an intellectual property infringement claim, offset by a favorable resolution of a value added tax issue. In 2010 we sold a manufacturing facility in France and recorded a gain of $24 ($13 net of taxes), which is included in general and administrative expenses. In 2009 we settled an outstanding patent infringement lawsuit and received $62 ($43 net of taxes) pursuant to a legal agreement. Restructuring ChargesIn 2011 we recorded $76 ($60 net of taxes) in restructuring charges related to focused reductions of our global workforce and other restructuring, expected to reduce our global workforce by approximately 5% and be substantially complete by the end of 2012 at a total cost of approximately $150 to $175. The actions were initiated in 2011 to provide efficiencies and realign resources in advance of the new Medical Device Excise Tax scheduled to begin in 2013, as well as to allow for continued investment in strategic areas and drive growth. In 2009 we recorded $67 ($49 net of taxes) in restructuring charges related to agency conversion charges associated with the termination of certain third party agent agreements, asset impairment charges related primarily to identifiable intangible assets as a result of our decision to discontinue selling certain products, severance and related costs resulting from our decision to simplify the organization structure at our Biotech, EMEA, Japan and Canada divisions and contractual obligations and other charges in connection with the termination of various supplier contracts as well as other incidental costs related to the discontinued product lines. Property, plant and equipment impairmentIn 2010 we recorded a $124 ($76 net of taxes) non cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount of certain assets to fair value related to our OP 1 product family and related manufacturing facility.Other Income (Expense)Other expense in 2011 decreased $22 from 2010, primarily due to reductions of accrued interest expense resulting from settlements reached with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS). We reached a favorable settlement regarding an IRS proposed adjustment to our previously filed 2003 through 2007 income tax returns, related to the income tax positions we had taken for our Irish cost sharing arrangements. We also reached a settlement with the IRS with respect to the allocation of income with a wholly owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico for the years 2006 through 2009. The positive effect on interest expense from these tax settlements helped offset lower average yields on our investments combined with lower cash and cash equivalent and marketable securities balances compared to 2010. The decrease in these balances and the corresponding reduction in interest and investment income was primarily due to the purchases of the Neurovascular, Orthovita, Memometal and Concentric businesses, which were funded with cash. Other expense in 2010 increased $52 from 2009 primarily due to lower average yields on our investments combined with higher interest cost on the debt issued in January 2010.Income TaxesOur effective income tax rate on earnings was 20.2%, 26.4% and 31.8% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The effective income tax rate for 2011 includes the net impact of the settlement with the IRS of income allocation issues with a wholly owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico and our Irish cost sharing arrangements, effective settlement of all United States federal tax matters for tax years 2003 through 2007 and charges for other uncertain income tax positions. The effective income tax rate for 2010 includes the impact of the property, plant and equipment impairment charge, the gain on sale of a manufacturing facility and the favorable income tax expense adjustment associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings to the United States completed in 2009. The effective income tax rate for 2009 includes the impact of restructuring charges, the patent litigation gain and the impact of the income tax expenses associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings.12 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.Net EarningsNet earnings in 2011 increased 5.7% from 2010 to $1,345. Basic net earnings per share in 2011 increased 8.4% from 2010 to $3.48, and diluted net earnings per share in 2011 increased 8.2% from 2010 to $3.45. Net earnings in 2010 increased 15.0% from 2009 to $1,273. Basic net earnings per share in 2010 increased 15.0% to $3.21 as compared to $2.79 in 2009, and diluted net earnings per share in 2010 increased 15.0% to $3.19 as compared to $2.77 in 2009.Reported net earnings includes benefits from settlements and other adjustments related to uncertain tax positions, restructuring and related charges and acquisition and integration related charges related to the Neurovascular, Orthovita, Memometal and Concentric acquisitions, including transaction costs, integration related costs and additional cost of sales for inventory sold in the year that was stepped up to fair value. Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted net earnings in 2011 increased 9.0% to $1,448 after increasing 12.6% in 2010. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share in 2011 increased 11.7% to $3.72 after increasing 12.9% in 2010. The following reconciles the non GAAP financial measures adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, reported net earnings and diluted net earnings per share: 2011 2010 2009Reported net earnings$1,345 $1,273 $1,107Acquisition and integration related charges: Cost of sales inventory step up97 Selling, general and administrative expenses acquisition and integration related charges45 Restructuring charges60 49Uncertain income tax position adjustments(99) Gain on sale of property, plant and equipment (13) Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings (7) 67Impairment of property, plant and equipment 76 Patent litigation gain (43)Adjusted net earnings$1,448 $1,329 $1,180 2011 2010 2009Diluted net earnings per share of common stock: Reported diluted net earnings per share$3.45 $3.19 $2.77Acquisition and integration related charges: Cost of sales inventory set up0.25 Selling, general and administrative expenses acquisition and integration related charges0.12 Restructuring charges0.16 0.12Uncertain income tax position adjustments(0.26) Gain on sale of property, plant and equipment (0.03) Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings (0.02) 0.17Impairment of property, plant and equipment 0.19 Patent litigation gain (0.11)Adjusted diluted net earnings per share$3.72 $3.33 $2.95Weighted average diluted shares outstanding389.5 399.5 399.4The weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of our non GAAP financial measures are the same as the weighted average shares outstanding used in the calculation of our reported per share amounts.FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITYOperating ActivitiesOperating cash flow was $1,434 in 2011, a decrease of 7.3% from 2010. Operating cash flow resulted primarily from net earnings adjusted for non cash items (depreciation and amortization, stock based compensation, sale of inventory stepped up to fair value at acquisition and deferred income taxes), partially offset by an increase in working capital. The net of accounts receivable, inventory, loaner instrumentation and accounts payable consumed $498 of operating cash flow in 2011. Inventory consumed $166 of operating cash flow primarily due to the building of inventory related to acquisitions and other business growth, increased stock levels in advance of new product introductions and higher inventory levels in support of anticipated 2012 sales growth. Inventory days on hand increased by 4 days due to the impact of the above. Accounts receivable used $143, primarily due to the building of accounts receivable related to acquisitions and other business growth. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding increased by 2 days due to 13 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.timing of sales.Operating cash flow was $1,547 in 2010, a 6% increase from 2009. Operating cash flow resulted primarily from net earnings adjusted for non cash items (depreciation and amortization, stock based compensation, sale of inventory stepped up to fair value at acquisition, property, plant and equipment impairment, deferred income taxes and gain on sale of property, plant and equipment), partially offset by an increase in working capital. The net of accounts receivable, inventory, loaner instrumentation and accounts payable consumed $349 of operating cash flow in 2010 primarily due to increases in inventories and accounts receivable. Inventory consumed $131 of operating cash flow driven by higher inventory levels in support of anticipated 2011 sales growth. Inventory days on hand increased by 9 days due to the impact of foreign exchange and higher inventory levels. Accounts receivable used $121 primarily to support business growth. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding of 56 were unchanged from the prior year. Investing Activities Net investing activities consumed $2,135 of cash in 2011 and $795 of cash in 2010, primarily due to acquisitions and capital spending, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets.Acquisitions. Acquisitions used $2,066 of cash in 2011 primarily for the acquisitions of Neurovascular for $1,450; Orthovita for $316; Memometal for $150; and Concentric for $135. In 2010 acquisitions used $265 of cash primarily for the acquisitions of the Sonopet Ultrasonic Aspirator control consoles, handpieces and accessories, Gaymar Industries, Inc. and the bioimplantable implants product line and related assets from Porex Surgical, Inc.Capital Spending. We manage capital spending to support our business growth. Capital expenditures, primarily to support capacity expansion, new product introductions, innovation and cost savings, were $226 in 2011 and $182 in 2010.Proceeds from Asset Sales. Proceeds from asset sales contributed $67 to cash in 2011, primarily due to the sale of certain assets related to the OP 1 product family. In 2010 proceeds from asset sales contributed $61 to cash, primarily due to the sale of a manufacturing facility in France.Financing ActivitiesDividend Payments. Dividends paid per common share increased 20.0% to $0.72 per share in 2011. Total dividend payments to common shareholders were $279 in 2011 and $238 in 2010. The increase in dividend payments resulted from increases in our quarterly dividend from $0.15 per share in 2010 to $0.18 per share in 2011.Long Term and Short Term Debt. We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and overall cost of capital. In September 2011 we sold $750 of senior unsecured notes due September 2016 and in January 2010 we sold $500 of senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2015 and $500 of senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2020. The net proceeds from the offerings have been and will continue to be available for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, stock repurchases and other business opportunities. Total debt was $1,768 in 2011 and $1,021 in 2010. Share Repurchases. The total use of cash for share repurchases was $622 in 2011 and $426 in 2010.LiquidityOur cash and marketable securities were $3,418 at December 31, 2011 and $4,380 at December 31, 2010 and our current assets exceeded current liabilities by $5,383 at December 31, 2011 and $6,027 at December 31, 2010. We anticipate being able to support our short term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We have funded, and may continue from time to time to fund, ourselves in the capital markets. We have strong short and long term debt ratings that we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due. In addition, we have a $1,000 credit facility with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient funding to meet short term financing requirements. We had approximately $1,098 of borrowing capacity available under all of our existing credit facilities at December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, approximately 62% of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were held in locations outside of the United States. These funds are considered indefinitely reinvested to be used to expand operations either organically or through acquisitions outside the United States. We do not intend to repatriate any significant amounts of cash in the foreseeable future.Guarantees and Other Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have guarantees or other off balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.14 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND FORWARD LOOKING CASH REQUIREMENTSAs further described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2011 our defined benefit pension plans were in an underfunded status of $106, of which approximately $94 related to plans outside the United States. Due to the rules affecting tax deductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and the potential for changes in legislation in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions, we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods, beyond 2012, in which contributions to fund defined benefit pension plans will be made. As further described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2011, we have recorded a liability for uncertain income tax positions of $249. Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits, we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made.Our future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than one year, including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business, are: Payment Period 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 After 2016 TotalShort term and Long term debt$17 $ $ $500 $ $1,251 $1,768Unconditional purchase obligations518 135 127 100 8 2 890Operating leases57 46 32 27 22 44 228Contributions to defined benefit plans22 22Other6 2 2 2 1 40 53 $620 $183 $161 $629 $31 $1,337 $2,961CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. These include allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves, income taxes, acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets, and legal and other contingencies. We believe these accounting policies, and others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. Allowance for Doubtful AccountsWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable. We make estimates regarding the future ability of our customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends. If actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional accounts receivable write offs may be necessary, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.Inventory ReservesWe maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell certain products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. We make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record provisions based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.Income TaxesOur annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary, reversing over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred, the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction has already been taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment. Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, tax planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate 15 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized. We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable, but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These differences of interpretation with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that it is more likely than not that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate.Acquisitions, Goodwill and IntangiblesWe account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting. Under the purchase method, our Consolidated Financial Statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition. In addition, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed must be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third party valuation specialists for significant items. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management, but are inherently uncertain. We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. Certain intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands. Other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain trademarks or brands, customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to trademarks and brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, trademark and or brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarks or brands are sold. Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable lived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors. All of our acquired technology and customer related intangibles are expected to have determinable useful lives. The costs of determinable lived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life. The value of indefinite lived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment. Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite lived intangibles. We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year. We have early adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011 08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other: Testing Goodwill for Impairment, which permits us to consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill. In certain circumstances, we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability. In those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level. We test individual indefinite lived intangibles by reviewing the individual book values compared to the fair value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets based on the income approach. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. We believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, indefinite lived intangible assets may be reclassified to a determinable life asset and an additional impairment assessment may be performed. 16 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.We did not recognize any material impairment charges for goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets during the years presented as our annual impairment testing indicated that all reporting unit goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset fair values exceeded their respective recorded values. However, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. A significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect the financial statements in any given year. The recorded value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets from recently acquired businesses are derived from more recent business operating plans and macroeconomic environmental conditions and, therefore, are more susceptible to an adverse change that could require an impairment charge. We review long lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level, as defined. Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over their useful life based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related assets or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique. Assets classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Legal and Other ContingenciesWe are involved in various proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and intellectual property, and other matters that are more fully described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time. In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory and equitable relief, which could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief. For legal matters for which management has sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing managements best estimate of the probable cost, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded. The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies. If actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management, additional expense may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.To partially mitigate losses arising from unfavorable outcomes in such matters, we purchase third party insurance coverage subject to certain deductibles and loss limitations. Future operating results may be unfavorably impacted by any settlement payments or losses beyond the amounts of insurance carried. In addition, such matters may negatively impact our ability to obtain cost effective third party insurance coverage in future periods.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS No new accounting pronouncements that were issued or became effective during the year have had or are expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of new accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.OTHER INFORMATIONHedging and Derivative Financial InstrumentsWe distribute our products throughout the world. As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as weak economic conditions or changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the United States dollar, European currencies, in particular the euro, Swiss franc and the British pound, the Japanese yen, the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. We develop and manufacture products in the United States, China, France, Germany, Ireland, Puerto Rico and Switzerland and incur costs in the applicable local currencies. This worldwide deployment of facilities serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on our cost of sales.We enter into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products. The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies. All forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period, with resulting gains (losses) included in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar would change the December 31, 2011 fair value by approximately $48. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of non performance by 17 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.counterparties on our outstanding forward currency exchange contracts, but we do not anticipate nonperformance by any of our counterparties.We have certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged. These investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For 2011, the strengthening of United States dollar relative to foreign currencies decreased the value of these investments in net assets and the related foreign currency translation adjustment loss in shareholders equity by $20, to $176 from $196 at December 31, 2010.Legal and Regulatory MattersIn April 2011 lawsuits brought by Hill Rom Company, Inc. and affiliated entities against us were filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin and the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. The suits allege infringement under United States patent laws with respect to certain patient handling equipment manufactured and sold by us and seek damages and permanent injunctions. The Wisconsin lawsuit has subsequently been transferred to the United States District Court in Indiana. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves in these matters. In the third quarter of 2010, we received a subpoena from the United States Department of Justice related to sales, marketing and regulatory matters related to the Stryker PainPump. Also in the third quarter of 2010, we received a subpoena from the United States Department of Justice related to the sales and marketing of the OtisKnee device. These investigations are ongoing. In March 2010 a shareholders derivative action complaint against certain of our current and former Directors and Officers was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan Southern Division. This lawsuit was brought by the Westchester Putnam Counties Heavy and Highway Laborers Local 60 Benefit Funds and Laborers Local 235 Benefit Funds. The complaint alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duties and gross mismanagement in connection with certain product recalls, United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warning letters, government investigations relating to physician compensation and the criminal proceeding brought against our Biotech division. The case has been stayed while a Special Committee of the Board of Directors evaluates the claims.In January 2010 a purported class action lawsuit against us was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of those who purchased our common stock between January 25, 2007 and November 13, 2008, inclusive. The lawsuit seeks remedies under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In May 2010 the lawsuit was transferred to the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan Southern Division. We are defending ourselves vigorously.In 2009 a federal grand jury in the District of Massachusetts returned an indictment charging Stryker Biotech LLC and certain then current employees and a former employee of Stryker Biotech with wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the FDA, distribution of a misbranded device and false statements to the FDA. In January 2012 Stryker Biotech reached a settlement with the United States Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts, under which Stryker pled to one misdemeanor charge and paid a non tax deductible fine of $15. As a result of this resolution, the Department of Justice dismissed all thirteen felony charges against Stryker Biotech contained in the 2009 federal grand jury indictment. All of the charges against the then current and former employees of Stryker Biotech have also been dismissed.In 2007, the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS) issued a civil subpoena to us in seeking to determine whether we violated various laws by paying consulting fees and providing other things of value to orthopedic surgeons and healthcare and educational institutions as inducements to use Strykers orthopedic medical devices in procedures paid for in whole or in part by Medicare. The investigation is ongoing and we have produced numerous documents and other materials to HHS in response to the subpoena.In 2007 we disclosed that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made an inquiry of us regarding possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in connection with the sale of medical devices in certain foreign countries. Subsequently, in 2008, we received a subpoena from the United States Department of Justice, Criminal Division, requesting certain documents for the period since January 1, 2000 in connection with the SEC inquiry. We are fully cooperating with the United States Department of Justice and the SEC regarding these matters.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKQuantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are included in the "Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Liquidity" and "Other Information" sections of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition in Item 7 of this report.18 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
