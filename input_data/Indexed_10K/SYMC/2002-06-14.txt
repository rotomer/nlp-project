Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward Looking Statements and Factors That May Affect Future Results The following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. Such factors include, among others things, those risk factors set forth in this section and elsewhere in this report. We identify forward looking statements by words such as may, will, should, could, expects, plans, anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential, or continue or similar terms that refer to the future. We cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Overview Symantec provides a broad range of content and network security software and appliance solutions to enterprises, individuals and service providers. We are a leading provider of client, gateway and server security solutions for virus protection, firewall and virtual private network, vulnerability management, intrusion detection, Internet content and e mail filtering, remote management technologies and security services to enterprises and service providers around the world. Founded in 1982, we have offices in 38 countries worldwide. We have a 52/53 week fiscal accounting year. Accordingly, all references as of and for the periods ended March 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 reflect amounts as of and for the periods ended March 29, 2002, March 30, 2001 and March 31, 2000, respectively. The fiscal accounting years ended March 29, 2002, March 30, 2001 and March 31, 2000 each comprised 52 weeks of operations. Revenue Recognition We derive revenue primarily from sales of packaged software products, perpetual software license agreements, product maintenance and professional services, and recognize this revenue in accordance with Statement of Position, or SOP, 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, as modified by SOP 98 9, and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, when the following conditions have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; passage of title occurs; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; if applicable, customer acceptance has been received; collection of a fixed or determinable license fee is considered reasonably assured; and if appropriate, reasonable estimates of future product returns have been made. We sell packaged products through a multi tiered distribution channel. We defer revenue on all distribution and reseller channel inventory in excess of specified inventory levels in these channels. We offer the right of return of our products under various policies and programs with our distributors, resellers and end user customers. We estimate and record reserves for end user product returns and channel and end user rebates, and we account for these reserves as an offset to revenue. We enter into perpetual software license agreements through direct sales to customers and indirect sales with distributors and resellers. The license agreements generally include product maintenance agreements, for which the related revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the agreements. Our professional services include consulting, education, and managed security services. We recognize consulting services revenue as services are performed or upon written acceptance from customers, if 16 Table of Contents applicable. We recognize education services revenue as services are performed. We recognize managed security services revenue ratably over the period that such contracted services are provided. In arrangements that include software licenses and maintenance and or professional services, and packaged products with content updates (multiple elements), we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value of the undelivered elements, and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue. VSOE of each element is based on the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately. If VSOE does not exist for undelivered items such as maintenance or professional services, then the entire arrangement fee is recognized over the performance period. Critical Accounting Policies In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue, operating income and net income (loss), as well as on the value of certain assets on our consolidated balance sheet. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. See Summary of Significant Accounting Policies beginning on page 50 in the consolidated financial statements for more information about these critical accounting policies, as well as descriptions of other significant accounting policies. We have engaged in discussions with our audit committee of the Board of Directors regarding the development, selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies. Channel Revenue Deferrals We defer revenue relating to products, primarily in our Consumer and Enterprise Administration segments, that we have shipped into our distribution and reseller channels to the extent that such shipments result in there being inventory in excess of certain specified inventory levels for these channels. We defer this revenue as an offset to accounts receivable. We estimate the excess of inventory levels in these channels by analyzing channel inventory level and distribution sell through trends obtained from our channel partners, as well as various historical trends on a product basis. In addition, we consider other factors in assessing these specified inventory levels, such as product seasonality, current market conditions, economic trends, existing security threats and timing of new product releases. On the same basis, we estimate the associated cost of revenues related to the channel revenue deferral. If we made different judgments or utilized different estimates, material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues and cost of revenues for any period presented. Reserves for Product Returns End users may return our products, primarily within our Enterprise Administration and Consumer segments, through distributors and resellers or to us directly for a full refund within a reasonably short period from the date of purchase. Our estimated reserves for such end user product returns are based primarily on historical trends. Product returns by distributors and resellers principally relate to stock balancing and the replacement of obsolete products. Our return policy allows distributors and resellers, subject to certain contractual limitations, to return purchased products in exchange for new products or for credit towards future purchases. Channel revenue deferrals, as discussed above, are designed to take into account any distributor and reseller stock balancing returns. In addition, we fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channels. We also consider other factors such as the timing of upgrades and new versions of products, current market conditions, economic trends and changes in technology. If we made different judgments or utilized different estimates, material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented. 17 Table of Contents Reserves for Rebates We estimate and record reserves for channel and end user rebates, related primarily to products within our Enterprise Security, Enterprise Administration and Consumer segments. Our estimated reserves for channel volume incentive rebates are based on distributors and resellers actual performance against the terms and conditions of volume incentive rebate programs, which are typically entered into quarterly. Our reserves for end user rebates are estimated on the terms and conditions of the promotional program, actual sales during the promotion, amount of actual redemptions received, historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program and the value of the rebate. We also consider current market conditions and economic trends when estimating our reserve for rebates. If we made different judgments or utilized different estimates, material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potential uncollectible trade receivables. We review our trade receivables by aging category to identify specific customers with known disputes or collectibility issues. We exercise judgment when determining the adequacy of these reserves as we evaluate historical bad debt trends, general economic conditions in the U.S. and internationally, and changes in customer financial conditions. If we made different judgments or utilized different estimates, material differences may result in additional reserves for trade receivables, which would be reflected by charges in general and administrative expenses for any period presented. Impairment of Long Lived Assets We evaluate long lived assets, including property, equipment, leasehold improvements, acquired product rights and goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than the assets carrying amount. Such impairment loss would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Significant judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results, which are used in the preparation of projected cash flows. If we made different judgments or utilized different estimates, material differences may result in write downs of net long lived assets, which would be reflected by charges to our operating results for any period presented. Effective April 1, 2002, impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets will be assessed according to new accounting guidelines (see Recent Accounting Pronouncements below). Restructuring and Site Closures During fiscal 2002, we incurred expenses related to consolidating, moving and relocating various groups or sites. In determining the charge related to our excess facilities, certain estimates were used, such as potential ability to sublease and sublease terms upon the negotiation of future subleases, broker commissions, costs of tenant improvements and related exit costs. In developing our estimates, we obtained information from third party leasing agents to calculate anticipated third party sublease income and the vacancy period prior to finding a sub leasee. Market conditions will affect our ability to sublease facilities on terms consistent with our estimates. Our ability to sublease facilities ahead of schedule or the negotiation of lease terms resulting in higher or lower sublease income than estimated will affect our accrual and the related charge for restructuring, site closures and other expenses. Difference between estimates of related broker commissions, tenant improvements and related exit costs may increase or decrease our accrual upon final negotiation. If we employed different assumptions regarding these various components of our exit costs, the costs recorded for any period presented could vary materially from those actually recorded. 18 Table of Contents Deferred Income Taxes On a quarterly basis we evaluate our deferred tax asset balance for realizability. To the extent we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized, we will establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets. Realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon future U.S. taxable income and future taxable income in certain foreign jurisdictions, as well as our implementation of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require possible material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made. Recent Significant Acquisitions and Divestitures In August 2001, we divested our web access management product line, which we acquired in our acquisition of AXENT, to PassGo Technologies Ltd. for approximately $1.1 million. We also entered into an exclusive license and option agreement with PassGo whereby they will license our web access management technology products. In consideration for the license, PassGo is required to pay us quarterly royalties based on their net revenue over a four year period. PassGo also has an option to purchase this technology at a price starting at $18.8 million and declining to $3.3 million over a four year period. In December 2000, we acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of AXENT, an enterprise security software company, in exchange for Symantec common stock. We also assumed all of the outstanding AXENT employee stock options. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase and was initially recorded for approximately $924.7 million, which included goodwill of $699.7 million, tangible and intangible assets of $220.8 million, in process research and development of $22.3 million, deferred compensation of $992,000, offset by $19.1 million in deferred income taxes. During the December 2001 quarter, we recorded additional deferred tax assets of $5.0 million attributable to carryforward tax benefits, with a corresponding offset to goodwill. During the June 2001 quarter, we increased the purchase price and goodwill by $4.5 million, as we resolved certain pre acquisition contingencies. Effective April 1, 2002, the related net balance of goodwill and workforce in place for the AXENT acquisitions and other acquisitions completed prior to July 1, 2001 will no longer be amortized, but will be subject to an annual impairment test. See Recent Accounting Pronouncements. For further discussion on our recent significant acquisitions and divestitures, see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K. 19 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth each item from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net revenues and the percentage change in the total amount of each item for the periods indicated. Please note that these results reflect our acquisition of AXENT commencing on December 18, 2000, the date of that acquisition. Period to Period Percentage Increase (Decrease) Year Ended March 31, 2002 2001 compared compared 2002 2001 2000 to 2001 to 2000 Net revenues 100% 100 % 100 % 26 % 14 % Cost of revenues 18 15 16 57 2 Gross margin 82 85 84 20 17 Operating expenses: Research and development 15 15 15 29 17 Sales and marketing 40 41 41 22 14 General and administrative 5 5 6 20 6 Amortization of goodwill 19 8 2 176 299 Amortization of other intangibles from acquisitions * * Acquired in process research and development 3 1 419 Restructuring, site closures and other expenses 2 1 458 (59 ) Litigation judgment * Total operating expenses 81 72 66 40 27 Operating income 1 13 18 (93 ) (19 ) Interest income 3 4 2 (5 ) 148 Interest expense (1 ) * * Income, net of expense, from sale of technologies and product lines 1 2 15 (24 ) (81 ) Other income (expense), net (3 ) * * Income before income taxes 4 16 35 (68 ) (45 ) Provision for income taxes 7 9 12 (4 ) (12 ) Net income (loss) (3 )% 7 % 23 % (144 ) (62 ) * Percentage change is not meaningful. Net Revenues Net revenues increased 26% to approximately $1.1 billion during fiscal 2002 from $853.6 million during fiscal 2001. Net revenues increased 14% to approximately $853.6 million during fiscal 2001 from $745.7 million during fiscal 2000. The increase during fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 was due primarily to increased sales of our enterprise security products and a significant increase in sales of our consumer products during the second half of fiscal 2002. The increase in enterprise security products during fiscal 2002 was attributable to a full year of sales related to AXENT solutions as compared to approximately three months during fiscal 2001. From a regional standpoint, this increase was primarily due to growth in net revenues in the United States and to a lesser extent in Europe. The increase during fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000 was largely due to sales of our enterprise security products, including introductions of new products and increased sales outside of the United States. 20 Table of Contents The increase in enterprise security products during fiscal 2001 was attributable to approximately three months of sales related to AXENT solutions, as a result of our acquisition of AXENT in December 2000. Segments Enterprise Security Our Enterprise Security segment revenue comprised approximately 42%, 33% and 22% of total net revenues during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Net revenues increased $172.1 million, or 61%, to approximately $454.9 million during fiscal 2002 from $282.8 million during fiscal 2001 and increased $116.0 million, or 70%, to $282.8 million during fiscal 2001 from $166.8 million during fiscal 2000. The increase during fiscal 2002 over fiscal 2001 was primarily due to our first full year of sales of intrusion detection, vulnerability management and firewall product solutions, as a result of our acquisition of AXENT in December 2000, and in particular, significant growth in sales of virus protection product solutions. Enterprise Administration Our Enterprise Administration segment represented approximately 21%, 27% and 29% of total net revenues during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Net revenues decreased by approximately $8.1 million, or 4%, during fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 due to a decline in sales of our pcAnywhere product, partially offset by growth in sales of our Ghost Corporate Edition product. The decline in our pcAnywhere product was the result of a decrease in small business and home office sales, which was partially offset by an increase in corporate sales. Net revenues increased by approximately $13.9 million, or 6%, during fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000 primarily due to the release of our Ghost Corporate Edition product. Consumer Products Our Consumer Products segment represented approximately 35%, 39% and 43% of total net revenues during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Net revenues increased by approximately $45.8 million, or 14%, during fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001. This increase was primarily related to an increase in sales of our Norton AntiVirus and Norton Internet Security products, mostly as a result of strong consumer and small business spending, and an increase in the renewal subscription pricing of our antivirus products. This increase was offset by a decline in sales of our Winfax and Macintosh products. In particular, we experienced a significant increase in sales of consumer products over the second half of fiscal 2002, and we do not expect sales to continue to grow at the same rate going forward. Over the last six years, our sales to individual consumers, home offices and small businesses have been seasonal, with higher sales generally in our December and March quarters. Net revenues increased by approximately $11.3 million, or 4%, during fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000. This increase was primarily due to the increase in customer focus on protecting their home computers from Internet related attacks. This factor contributed to growth in sales of our Norton Internet Security product, which was introduced in the March 2000 quarter. Services and Other Our Services and Other segments represented approximately 2%, 1% and 6% of total net revenues during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Net revenues increased in absolute dollars during fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001, due primarily to our services segment as the demand for our consulting services increased. Net revenues decreased in absolute dollars during fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000, due to our divestiture of the Visual Caf and ACT! product lines in December 1999, which is included in the Other segment. 21 Table of Contents International Net revenues outside of the United States represented approximately 47%, 48% and 45% of total net revenues during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. International net revenues increased by $91.6 million, or 22%, to approximately $504.6 million during fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001. This increase in net revenues was the result of increased sales in Europe and Asia, primarily from increased sales of our enterprise security and consumer products. International revenues increased by $77.3 million, or 23%, to approximately $413.0 million during fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000. This increase was largely due to stronger sales in Europe and Japan. Weakness in international currencies during fiscal 2002 negatively impacted our international revenue growth by approximately $14.0 million as compared to the impact of average international currency rates during fiscal 2001. The negative impact during fiscal 2001 as compared to the impact of average international currency rates during fiscal 2000 was approximately $43.8 million. Product Returns We estimate and record channel deferrals and obsolescence reserves to cover exposures related to product returns. Product returns principally relate to stock balancing and the replacement of obsolete products, which are offset by orders of equal or greater value for the current versions of the products. The mix of products returned from our distributors/resellers as compared to products sold to our distributors/resellers does not impact our gross margin, as our gross margin is materially consistent across our various product families. Changes in the level of product returns and related product returns provision are generally offset by a change in the level of gross revenue. As a result, the product returns provision did not have a material impact on reported net revenues in any period presented. Gross Margin Gross margin represents net revenues less cost of revenues. Cost of revenues consists primarily of manufacturing expenses, costs for producing manuals and CDs, packaging costs, royalties paid to third parties under publishing contracts, costs of consulting services, technical support costs and amortization and write off of acquired product rights. Gross margin was approximately 82%, 85% and 84% of net revenues during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The decline in gross margin during fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 was mostly driven by increased amortization of acquired product rights from our acquisition of AXENT and technical support costs as a result of an increase in related enterprise sales. In addition, consulting service costs included in costs of revenue increased along with the related increase in consulting service revenues. This contributed to the decline in gross margin during fiscal 2002, as consulting services typically have lower margins than our products. Gross margin improved slightly during fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000 due primarily to higher margins associated with the increase in enterprise related sales and cost savings achieved in reduced packaging costs. Acquired Product Rights Acquired product rights are comprised of purchased product rights, technologies and workforce in place. During fiscal 2001, we recorded approximately $86.2 million in acquired product rights in connection with our acquisition of AXENT, and during fiscal 2000, we recorded approximately $11.3 million in acquired product rights in connection with other acquisitions. During fiscal 2002, amortization of acquired product rights totaled approximately $32.2 million, of which $31.1 million and $1.1 million was recorded in cost of revenues and income (net of expense) from sale of technologies and product lines, respectively. During fiscal 2001 and 2000, amortization of acquired product rights totaled $17.3 million and $9.7 million, respectively, and was recorded in cost of revenues. Acquired product rights, with the exception of workforce in place, will be amortized over the next four years. Effective 22 Table of Contents April 1, 2002, the net balance of workforce in place of approximately $3.9 million, net of a deferred tax liability, will be included with goodwill and will no longer be amortized but will be subject to an annual impairment test. For further discussion on acquired product rights and related amortization, see Notes 3 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K. Research and Development Expenses We charge research and development expenditures to operations as incurred. As a percentage of net revenues, research and development expenses remained flat at 15% during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000. Although research and development expenses remained flat as a percentage of net revenues, absolute dollars increased 29% to approximately $164.0 million during fiscal 2002 from $126.7 million during fiscal 2001. The increase was primarily a result of salary increases and other employee related expenses, infrastructure related expenditures and a full year of AXENT related research and development expenses as compared to approximately three months during fiscal 2001. Research and development expenses increased 17% to approximately $126.7 million during fiscal 2001 from $108.4 million during fiscal 2000. The increase was a result of Enterprise Security segment hiring, salary increases and other employee related expenses and AXENT related research and development expenses that were included from the date of acquisition. This increase was partially offset by the lack of expenses during fiscal 2001 associated with the divested Visual Caf and ACT! product lines and the patent claim settlements in the Consumer Products segment. Sales and Marketing Expenses Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 40% during fiscal 2002 and were flat at 41% during fiscal 2001 and 2000. Sales and marketing expenses were approximately $428.5 million, $350.0 million and $306.8 million during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The absolute dollar increase in sales and marketing expenses during fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 was primarily related to Enterprise Security segment hiring, salary and commission increases, outside services for consultants and contractors, infrastructure related expenditures, and a full year of AXENT related sales and marketing expenses as compared to approximately three months during fiscal 2001. The absolute dollar increase in sales and marketing expenses during fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000 was also due to increased Enterprise Security segment hiring, increase in salaries, commissions and other performance based compensation, and AXENT related sales and marketing expenses which were included from the date of acquisition. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues remained flat at 5% during fiscal 2002 and 2001 and were 6% during fiscal 2000. General and administrative expenses were approximately $53.9 million, $44.8 million and $42.2 million during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The absolute dollar increase in general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 was primarily due to a full year of AXENT related general and administrative expenses as compared to approximately three months during fiscal 2001, salary increases, legal fees, infrastructure related expenditures and bad debt expense, offset by a reduction of other general and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses in absolute dollars increased during fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000, primarily due to an increase in salary related expenses and other general and administrative expenses, offset by a reduction in bad debt expenses. 23 Table of Contents Amortization of Goodwill and Other Intangibles from Acquisitions Amortization of goodwill and other intangibles from acquisitions increased 176% to approximately $196.8 million during fiscal 2002 from $71.3 million during fiscal 2001, and increased 299% to approximately $71.3 million during fiscal 2001 from $17.9 million during fiscal 2000. These increases were related primarily to the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles associated with the acquisition of AXENT in December 2000. Effective April 1, 2002, the net balance of goodwill of approximately $521.9 million will no longer be amortized but will be subject to an annual impairment test. As a result, amortization charges will decrease significantly going forward; however, our operating results may be subject to increased volatility as a result of periodic goodwill impairment charges. Other intangibles from acquisitions will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. Acquired In Process Research and Development Expenses We recorded no acquired in process research and development charges during fiscal 2002. During fiscal 2001, we acquired AXENT and during fiscal 2000, we acquired URLabs and L 3 Network Securitys operations. We wrote off approximately $22.3 million and $4.3 million of acquired in process research and development associated with these acquisitions during fiscal 2001 and 2000, respectively. These write offs were necessary because the acquired technologies had not yet reached technological feasibility and there were no alternative uses. The efforts required to develop the acquired in process technology principally related to the completion of all planning, design, development and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product or service can be produced to meet its design specifications including features, functions and performance. We expect the acquired in process technology to be developed into commercially feasible products. However, there are no assurances that this will occur. If we fail to complete these products in their entirety, or in a timely manner, we may not continue to attract new users, we may be unable to retain our existing users and the value of the other intangible assets may become impaired. We determined the fair value of the acquired in process technology for each of the purchases by estimating the projected cash flows related to these projects, including the cost to complete the acquired in process technologies and future revenues to be earned upon commercialization of the products. We discounted the resulting cash flows back to their net present values. We based the net cash flows from such projects on our analysis of the respective markets and estimates of revenues and operating profits related to these projects. A valuation specialist used our estimates to establish the amount of acquired in process research and development to be written off for these acquisitions during fiscal 2001 and 2000. Actual spending on these product development projects since our acquisition of the companies discussed below did not differ materially from the original assumptions and projections discussed in prior filings. AXENT The in process technology acquired in the AXENT acquisition consisted primarily of research and development related to the next generation of ESM, Intruder Alert, Raptor Firewall, Webthority and other projects. AXENTs research and development was focused on providing more robust features in its development of these next generation products. We have added these projects to our product offerings, with the exception of Webthority, which was divested with our web access management product line in August 2001. L 3 Network Security The in process technology acquired in the L 3 Network Security purchase consisted primarily of research and development related to the next generation of Retriever and Expert. We have integrated this technology into our vulnerability management products. 24 Table of Contents URLabs The in process technology acquired in the URLabs purchase consisted primarily of research and development related to the next generation of URLabs two main products, I Gear and Mail Gear, which have been added to our product offerings. Restructuring, Site Closures and Other Expenses Restructuring, site closures and other expenses were approximately $20.4 million, $3.7 million and $9.0 million during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. During fiscal 2002, we incurred expenses related to consolidating smaller sites into a larger facility in Newport News, Virginia, consolidating most of our United Kingdom facilities to Maidenhead, UK, consolidating our European support functions by moving our Leiden, Netherlands facility to Dublin, Ireland and relocating our North American support group to Springfield, Oregon. As a result, we recorded approximately $17.8 million for exit costs, including $12.8 million in rent and related exit costs remaining on the abandoned facilities and $5.0 million in related abandoned fixed asset and leasehold improvement write offs. In addition, we recorded approximately $2.6 million for costs of severance, related benefits and outplacement services, as we reorganized various operating functions, including former AXENT operations, and reduced our workforce by 87 employees. During the June 2002 quarter, we will record costs of severance, related benefits and outplacement services, as a result of the relocation of our Leiden, Netherlands operations to Dublin, Ireland. During fiscal 2001, we reorganized various operating functions, including a portion of our operations in Toronto. We reduced our workforce by 60 employees and ten members of our senior management, and as a result, we recorded approximately $3.7 million for costs of severance, related benefits, outplacement services and abandonment of certain equipment. During fiscal 2000, we reduced our operations and realigned our business units, including operations in Melville and Toronto and our Internet Tools business unit. We reduced our workforce by 154 employees and five members of our senior management, and as a result, we recorded approximately $9.7 million for severance, related benefits, outplacement services and abandonment of certain facilities and equipment. For further discussion on restructuring, site closures and other expenses, see Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K. Litigation Judgment During the March 2002 quarter, we accrued litigation expenses of approximately $3.1 million for post judgment interest and other costs related to a judgment by a Canadian court on a decade old copyright action assumed by us as a result of our acquisition of Delrina Corporation. For further discussion on our current litigation, see Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K. Interest Income, Interest Expense and Other Income (Expense) Interest income was approximately $31.7 million, $33.3 million and $13.4 million during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Although interest income was relatively flat during fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001, average cash balances were higher during fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001, which was offset by a decrease in average interest rates. Interest income increased significantly during fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000 due to higher average cash balances during fiscal 2001. Interest expense was approximately $9.2 million during fiscal 2002, nearly all of which was related to the issuance of $600.0 million of 3% convertible subordinated debentures in October 2001. Interest expense was not significant during fiscal 2001 and 2000. Other expense, net of approximately $627,000 during fiscal 2002 was primarily comprised of net losses from non functional currency transactions. Other expense, net was approximately $22.5 million during fiscal 2001 and consisted primarily of impairment charges on our equity investments. Other income, net was 25 Table of Contents approximately $1.3 million during fiscal 2000 and was primarily comprised of net gains from non functional currency transactions. Income, Net of Expense, from Sale of Technologies and Product Lines Income, net of expense, from sale of technologies and product lines was approximately $15.5 million, $20.4 million, and $107.4 million during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. During fiscal 2002 and 2001, income, net of expense, from sale of technologies and product lines was related primarily to royalties from Interact Commerce Corporation, who subsequently merged with The Sage Group plc, as a result of the divestiture of our ACT! product line in December 1999. Income, net of expense, from sale of technologies and product lines during fiscal 2000 related primarily to gains of $68.5 million and $18.3 million on the divestiture of our Visual Caf and ACT! product lines, respectively, in December 1999. In addition, income, net of expense, from sale of technologies and product lines during fiscal 2000 included $14.7 million related to payments from JetForm Corporation, associated with our sale of certain software products, technologies and tangible assets to JetForm during fiscal 1997, and $5.0 million related to royalties from Interact. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate on income before one time charges (acquired in process research and development, restructuring, site closures and other expenses), goodwill amortization expense and gain on sale of product lines was 32% during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000. Our fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000 effective rates were lower than the U.S. federal and state combined statutory rate primarily due to a lower statutory tax rate on income generated by our Irish operations. Our effective tax rate on income before taxes was 162%, 55% and 34% during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The higher effective tax rate during fiscal 2002 and 2001 reflects the non deductibility of acquired in process research and development and substantially all of the goodwill amortization. In addition, during fiscal 2000, tax was provided on the gain on sale of product lines at an effective tax rate of 34%. This rate is lower than the U.S. federal and state combined statutory rate because a portion of the gain is attributable to our Irish operations and accordingly subject to a lower Irish tax rate. Realization of approximately $46.0 million of our net deferred tax asset as of March 31, 2002 is dependent primarily upon future U.S. taxable income of $131.0 million. Realization of the remaining $12.0 million of our net deferred tax asset as of March 31, 2002 is dependent in part on future taxable income in certain foreign jurisdictions and on our implementation of tax planning strategies. We believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized based on historical earnings and expected levels of future taxable income as well as the implementation of tax planning strategies. Levels of future taxable income are subject to the various risks and uncertainties discussed in the Business Risk Factors set forth in this Item 7. Additional valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets may be necessary if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. We will assess the need for additional valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. We project our effective tax rate to be 32% for fiscal 2003 as a result of the discontinuation of goodwill amortization (see Recent Accounting Pronouncements for further discussion). This projection, however, is subject to change due to potential tax law changes and fluctuations in the geographic allocation of earnings. Selected Pro Forma Financial Data For comparative purposes, the following table displays, on a pro forma basis, our results of operations as if the acquisition of AXENT had occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2000 and excluding all acquisition related amortization and one time charges and the operating results of the divested Visual Caf and ACT! product 26 Table of Contents lines. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and may be different from pro forma measures used by other companies. Year Ended March 31, 2002 2001 2000 (In thousands, except per share data; unaudited) Pro forma net revenues $ 1,071,438 $ 944,150 $ 826,587 Pro forma net income $ 200,713 $ 184,234 $ 142,523 Pro forma net income per share diluted $ 1.30 $ 1.17 $ 0.94 Shares used to compute pro forma net income per share diluted 158,777 157,084 151,990 The following items represent the difference between the pro forma financial data and the related GAAP financial data in the Consolidated Statements of Operations: During fiscal 2001 and 2000, pro forma net revenues include AXENT net revenues of approximately $90.6 million and $80.9 million, respectively, as if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2000. During fiscal 2002, the pro forma net income excludes all acquisition related amortization and one time charges of approximately $249.7 million (tax benefit of $20.8 million). During fiscal 2001, the pro forma net income includes AXENTs net loss of approximately $6.2 million and excludes all acquisition related amortization and one time charges of $139.3 million (tax benefit of $12.8 million). During fiscal 2000, the pro forma net income includes AXENTs net income of approximately $5.0 million and excludes all acquisition related amortization and one time charges of $40.9 million (tax benefit of $10.0 million) and the operating results of the divested Visual Caf and ACT! product lines of $63.5 million. During fiscal 2002, shares used to compute pro forma net income per share (diluted) include approximately 7.6 million shares issuable from assumed exercise of options and 7.6 million shares issuable upon conversion of the 3% convertible subordinated debentures issued in October 2001. Correspondingly, the numerator used to compute pro forma net income (diluted) during fiscal 2002 excludes the interest expense of approximately $6.2 million from the 3% convertible subordinated debentures, net of income tax. During fiscal 2001 and 2000, shares used to compute pro forma net income per share (diluted) include approximately 20.6 million and 27.6 million shares, respectively, which represents the number of Symantec shares that would have been exchanged for AXENTs weighted number of common shares outstanding for the respective periods. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal source of liquidity is our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. Cash, cash equivalents and short term investments increased $818.0 million to approximately $1.4 billion at the end of fiscal 2002 from $557.0 million at the end of fiscal 2001. This increase was largely due to the net proceeds from the issuance of convertible subordinated debentures of approximately $584.6 million and from cash provided from operations of $511.2 million, as well as net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and sales of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan. The cash provided by these factors was partially offset by cash paid to purchase marketable securities and investments, net of proceeds, of approximately $721.7 million, and to a lesser extent cash paid to repurchase common stock and capital expenditures. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $511.2 million and was comprised of net non cash related expenses of $293.2 million and a net increase of $246.2 million in liabilities, net of a decrease in assets, offset by a net loss of approximately $28.2 million. Net trade accounts receivable decreased $27.5 million to approximately $89.2 million as of March 31, 2002 from $116.7 million as of March 31, 2001. The decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to net 27 Table of Contents revenues being generated more evenly throughout the March 2002 quarter due primarily to the increase in sales of consumer products, which resulted in higher cash collections. In prior quarters, we had generated a larger percentage of net revenues during the last month of each quarter. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $869.3 million and was comprised primarily of $721.7 million in net purchases of marketable securities and investments, and $140.9 million of capital expenditures, including $62.0 million for the implementation of Oracle 11i and a CRM system and $25 million in January 2002 and $18 million in November 2001 for land and a building in Maidenhead, United Kingdom and Dublin, Ireland, respectively. On January 16, 2001, the Board of Directors replaced an earlier stock repurchase program with a new authorization to repurchase up to $700.0 million, not to exceed 30.0 million shares, of Symantecs common stock with no expiration date. During the September 2001 quarter, we repurchased 9.6 million shares at prices ranging from $17.78 to $24.50 per share, for an aggregate amount of approximately $204.4 million. During the March 2001 quarter, we repurchased 10.0 million shares at prices ranging from $23.04 to $25.58 per share, for an aggregate amount of approximately $244.4 million. On October 24, 2001, we completed a private offering of $600.0 million of 3% convertible subordinated debentures due November 1, 2006, the net proceeds of which were approximately $584.6 million. The debentures are convertible into shares of Symantecs common stock by the holders at any time before maturity at a conversion price of $34.14 per share, subject to certain adjustments. We may redeem the notes on or after November 5, 2004, at a redemption price of 100.75% of stated principal during the period November 5, 2004 through October 31, 2005 and 100% thereafter. Interest will be paid semi annually, commencing May 1, 2002. We intend to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, including working capital, potential acquisitions, stock repurchases and investments in our infrastructure. The following table displays our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2002: Payments Due In Total Payments Fiscal 2004 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2008 Due Fiscal 2003 and 2005 and 2007 and Thereafter (In thousands) Convertible subordinated debentures $ 600,000 $ $ $ 600,000 $ Operating leases 86,070 26,901 34,687 16,335 8,147 Total contractual obligations $ 686,070 $ 26,901 $ 34,687 $ 616,335 $ 8,147 The above table assumes that the convertible subordinated debentures will be paid in cash upon maturity and excludes the balance of our current liabilities. We believe that existing cash and short term investments, cash generated from operating results and cash from the subordinated convertible debenture offering will be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next year. Synthetic Leases We currently have two real estate leasing arrangements that we have classified as operating leases. One of the lease arrangements is for two existing office buildings in Cupertino, California. Lease payments for these facilities are based on the three month LIBOR in effect at the beginning of each fiscal quarter plus a specified margin. We have the right to acquire the related properties at any time during the seven year lease period ending February 1, 2006. If, at the end of the lease term we do not renew the lease, purchase the properties or arrange for a third party to purchase the properties, we may be obligated to the lessor for all or some portion of an amount up to the guaranteed residual amount of approximately $66.0 million, representing approximately 84% of the lessors purchase price of the property. On March 30, 2001, we entered into a master lease agreement for land and the construction of two office buildings, one in Newport News, Virginia, effective June 6, 2001, and another in Springfield, Oregon, effective 28 Table of Contents April 6, 2001. Our lease payments will vary based on one , three or six month LIBOR plus a specified margin. We have the right to acquire the related properties at any time during the six and one half year lease period ending September 28, 2007. We moved into the Oregon facility immediately after the end of the December 2001 quarter and into the Virginia facility in April 2002. If, at the end of the lease term we do not renew the lease, purchase the properties or arrange for a third party to purchase the properties, we may be obligated to the lessor for all or some portion of an amount up to the guaranteed residual amount representing approximately 85% of the lessors ultimate purchase price of the properties, up to a maximum amount of approximately $55.1 million as of March 31, 2002. As security for each of these arrangements, we are required to maintain a cash collateral balance, which was approximately $124.3 million as of March 31, 2002. We are required to invest the cash collateral in U.S. Treasury securities or certificates of deposit with specified lenders and maturities not to exceed two to three years. In accordance with the lease terms, these funds are not available to meet operating cash requirements. As of March 31, 2002, the investments related to the California lease totaled approximately $77.4 million and the investments related to the Oregon and Virginia leases totaled $46.9 million. These amounts were classified as non current restricted investments within the consolidated financial statements. In addition, we are obligated to maintain certain financial covenants including a minimum cash balance, tangible net worth and quarterly earnings before income tax, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, and maximum debt and senior debt to EBITDA ratios. Future acquisitions, financing activities or operating losses may cause us to be in violation of these financial covenants. In the event of default, we may be required to release the cash collateral and take possession of the buildings. As of March 31, 2002, we were in compliance with all of the above financial covenants. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. SFAS No. 141 requires that all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to an annual impairment test. Other intangibles will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. We will adopt SFAS No. 142 in our first quarter of fiscal 2003. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 142, we will stop the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives with a net carrying value of approximately $525.9 million, net of a deferred tax liability, as of March 31, 2002. As a result of the discontinuance of the amortization of goodwill existing as of March 31, 2002 and excluding the impact of potential impairment charges, the application of SFAS No. 142 is expected to result in an increase in our results of operations of approximately $198.4 million during fiscal 2003. During the first six months of fiscal 2003, we will perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives as of April 1, 2002, using the two step process required under SFAS 142. We have not yet determined what effect these tests will have on our earnings and financial position. In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. SFAS No. 144 supersedes SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, and addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets. We will adopt this statement on April 1, 2002. Adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. The lessors associated with lease agreements relating to certain of our facilities, described under Synthetic Leases above, are special purpose entities or equivalent structures. Presently, we account for these leases as operating leases, while the special purpose entities or equivalent structures own and account for the leased assets and related liabilities in their records. The FASB has indicated that it will, prior to June 30, 2002, issue proposed new rules on accounting for Entities That Lack Sufficient Independent Economic Substance, including special purpose entities, in the form of an Interpretation to SFAS No. 94, Consolidation of All Majority Owned Subsidiaries, and Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements. 29 Table of Contents Based on public comments from the FASB to date, the proposed interpretation will provide guidance for determining when an entity (such as us), the Primary Beneficiary, should consolidate another entity, a special purpose entity or equivalent structure (such as the lessor), that functions to support the activities of the Primary Beneficiary. The expected proposed Interpretation may result in us having to consolidate the operating results of the special purpose entities and equivalent structures, which are the lessors under the aforementioned operating lease agreements. The effective date of these proposed new rules on our current operating leases could be as early as the beginning of our fiscal year 2004, and sooner on any new leases entered into after the new rules effective date which utilize special purpose entities or equivalent structures. Business Risk Factors There is uncertainty as to whether or not we will be able to sustain the growth rates in sales of our products, particularly in consumer antivirus protection products. During the second half of fiscal 2002, we experienced a higher than expected rate of growth in sales of our consumer antivirus protection products, and we may not be able to sustain this high growth rate on a consistent basis going forward. We believe that consumer antivirus sales were spurred by a number of factors, including outbreaks of the well publicized Code Red and Nimda viruses and a reaction from the September 11 terrorist attacks. In addition, although the release of new operating systems incorporating security and virus protection features, particularly past releases of Microsoft Windows, have increased competition in our market and had a harmful effect on demand, the recent release of Windows XP may have actually spurred additional sales. These positive factors are likely to weaken over time, and it is possible that growth rates in sales of antivirus protection products may decline. These factors may have also had a short term effect on growth in enterprise security products, and we note that sales of our enterprise security products decreased from the third to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. If sales of these products decline faster than expected, our stock price may be harmed. We have grown, and may continue to grow, through acquisitions, which give rise to a number of risks that could have adverse consequences for our future operating results. We have made six acquisitions since March 1999, with our acquisition of AXENT Technologies, Inc. in December 2000 being the largest. Although we cannot assure you that we will be successful in completing them, we will likely pursue future acquisitions. Integrating acquired businesses has been and will continue to be a complex, time consuming and expensive process. To integrate acquired businesses, we must implement our technology systems in the acquired operations and assimilate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations. Our past acquisitions have given rise to substantial amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets that have been amortized or written off in subsequent years. Future acquisitions may result in substantial amounts of goodwill that will be subject to an annual impairment test and other intangible assets that will be amortized, subject to an annual impairment test or written off. In addition, a number of our acquisitions have resulted in substantial restructuring and other related expenses and write offs of acquired in process research and development costs, and this also may occur as a result of future acquisitions. Further, we may need to issue equity or incur additional debt to finance future acquisitions, which could be dilutive to our existing stockholders or could increase our leverage. Any of these and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from acquired operations or to realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition. Further, the difficulties of integrating acquired businesses could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management focus from other opportunities and challenges, and increase our expenses and working capital requirements. Demand for our products is subject to seasonal trends. Although there is no assurance this trend will continue, our sales of consumer products over the last six years have been seasonal, with higher sales generally in our December and March quarters. In addition, we anticipate that sales of enterprise security products may be higher in the March quarter in the future, as our sales force attempts to close transactions before the end of our fiscal year. To the extent seasonality makes it more difficult to predict our revenues and value our business, our stock price may suffer and the volatility of our stock may increase. Our increased sales of enterprise wide site licenses may increase fluctuations in our financial results. Sales of enterprise wide site licenses through our Enterprise Security segment have been increasing and now represent a major portion of our business. This enterprise market has significantly different characteristics than the consumer market and different skills and resources are needed to penetrate this market. As our enterprise 30 Table of Contents segment becomes more important to our business and our product strategy continues to develop, we may face new competitors or new levels of competition. Enterprise licensing arrangements involve a longer sales cycle than sales through other distribution channels, require greater investment of resources in establishing the enterprise relationship and can sometimes result in lower operating margins. The timing of the execution of volume licenses, or their nonrenewal or renegotiation by large customers, could cause our results of operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Economic and political conditions and conditions affecting the network security market in particular may have a negative impact on our revenues and margins. The market for our products depends on economic conditions affecting the broader network security, Internet infrastructure and related markets. More generally, the slowdown in the U.S. economy may hurt consumer demand for our services. On the enterprise side, the continued slowdown in corporate earnings and tightening of corporate budgets may cause potential customers to delay or cancel security projects, reduce their overall or security specific information technology budgets, or reduce or cancel orders for our products. Further, in this environment, customers may experience financial difficulty, cease operations or fail to budget for the purchase of our products. This, in turn, may lead to longer sales cycles, delays in payment and collection, and price pressures, causing us to realize lower revenues and margins. In addition, the terrorist acts of September 11, 2001 created an uncertain economic and political environment in many parts of the world, and we cannot predict the impact of these events, or of any related military action, on our customers or business. Piracy of our software may have a significant impact on our net revenues. While we are unable to determine the exact extent of piracy of our software products, software piracy may depress our net revenues. While this would adversely affect domestic revenue, revenue loss is believed to be even more significant outside of the United States, particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. We engage in efforts to educate consumers on the benefits of licensing genuine products and to educate lawmakers on the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected and we cooperate with the Business Software Alliance in their efforts to combat piracy. However, such continued efforts may not be successful in preventing piracy of our products from occurring. We are in the process of making substantial changes to our information systems that could disrupt our business. The information systems that supported our accounting, finance, order management and manufacturing systems were based on Oracle 10.7, and many of the business applications used in other aspects of our business have been tightly coupled with Oracle 10.7. Oracle has released a new version, 11i, and has announced that support for Oracle 10.7 will be discontinued after June 2002. In addition, as our business has grown, we have developed needs for an increasingly robust customer relationship management, or CRM, system. During fiscal 2002, we began implementing Oracle 11i and a new CRM system. Oracle 11i implementation occurred in the December 2001 quarter for the United States operations and should be completed by the June 2002 quarter for the Europe, Middle East and Africa operations. The first two phases of the CRM implementation occurred in June 2001 and February 2002, with the remaining implementation phases scheduled for the first and third quarters of fiscal 2003. These types of transitions frequently prove disruptive to the underlying business of an enterprise and may cause us to incur higher costs than we anticipate. Failure to manage a smooth transition to the new systems and the ongoing operations and support of the new systems could materially harm our business operations. 31 Table of Contents Our markets are competitive and our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to anticipate or react to this competition. Our markets are competitive. If we are unable to anticipate or react to this competition, our operating results could be adversely affected by reducing our sales or the prices we can charge for our products. In the recent past, many of our competitors have significantly lowered the price of their products and we may have to do the same to remain competitive. Our ability to remain competitive depends, in part, on our ability to enhance our products or develop new products that are compatible with new hardware and operating systems. We have no control over, and limited insight into, development efforts by third parties with respect to new hardware and operating systems and we may not respond effectively or timely to such changes in the market. In addition, we have limited resources and we must make strategic decisions as to the best allocation of our resources to position ourselves for changes in our markets. We may from time to time allocate resources to projects or markets that do not develop as rapidly or fully as we expect. We may fail to allocate resources to third party products, to markets or to business models that are more successful than we anticipate. Our software products and web site may be subject to intentional disruption. Although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent intentional disruptions, such as software viruses specifically designed to impede the performance of our products, we expect to be an ongoing target of such disruptions. Similarly, experienced computer programmers, or hackers, may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our web site and misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of our services. Our activities could be substantially disrupted and our reputation, and future sales, harmed if these efforts are successful. We face risks associated with our foreign operations. A significant portion of our net revenues, manufacturing costs and operating expenses result from transactions outside of the United States, often in foreign currencies. As a result, our future operating results could be negatively affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and general uncertainty with each countrys political and economic structure. In addition, governmental regulation of imports or exports or our failure to obtain any required export approval of our technologies, particularly our encryption technologies, could impede our international sales. In light of recent terrorist activity, governments could enact additional regulation or restrictions on the use, import or export of encryption technologies. Additional regulation of encryption technology could delay or prevent the acceptance and use of encryption products and public networks for secure communications. This might decrease demand for our products and services. Introduction of new operating systems may adversely affect our financial results and stock price. The inclusion of security, remote access or virus protection tools in new operating systems and hardware packages could adversely affect our sales. For example, the inclusion of features by Microsoft in future editions of Windows which directly compete with our products may decrease or delay the demand for certain of our products, including those currently under development. Additionally, as hardware vendors incorporate additional server based network management and security tools into network operating systems, the demand may decrease for some of our products, including those currently under development. Our earnings and stock price are subject to significant fluctuations. Due to many factors, including those noted in this section, our earnings and stock price have been and may continue to be subject to significant volatility. There have been previous quarters in which we have experienced shortfalls in revenue and earnings from levels expected by securities analysts and investors, which have had an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock. This may occur again in the future. Any such volatility may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our common stock or securities convertible or exercisable into our common stock. 32 Table of Contents Fluctuations in our quarterly operating results have affected our stock price in the past and could affect our stock price in the future. If our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts and investors, the trading price of shares of our common stock and of the debentures could be negatively affected. Our quarterly operating results have varied substantially in the past and may vary substantially in the future depending upon a number of factors, including: the timing of announcements and releases of new or enhanced versions of our products and product upgrades; the introduction of competitive products; uncertainty about and customer confidence in the current economic conditions and outlook; reduced demand for any given product; seasonality in the end of period buying patterns of foreign and domestic software customers; and the markets transition between new releases of operating systems. In addition to the foregoing factors, the risk of quarterly fluctuations is increased by the fact that a significant portion of our net revenues has historically been generated during the last month of each fiscal quarter. Most resellers tend to make a majority of their purchases at the end of a fiscal quarter. In addition, many enterprise customers negotiate site licenses near the end of each quarter. In part, this is because these two groups are able, or believe that they are able, to negotiate lower prices and more favorable terms at that time. Our reliance on a large portion of revenue occurring at the end of the quarter and the increase in the dollar value of transactions that occur at the end of a quarter can result in increased uncertainty relating to quarterly revenues. Due to this end of period buying pattern, forecasts may not be achieved, either because expected sales do not occur or because they occur at lower prices or on terms that are less favorable to us. In addition, these factors increase the chances that our results could diverge from the expectations of investors and analysts. We must effectively adapt to changes in the dynamic technological environment. We are increasingly focused on the Internet security market, which, in turn is dependent on further acceptance and increased use of the Internet. The following critical issues concerning the use of the Internet remain unresolved and may affect the market for our products and the use of the Internet as a medium to distribute or support our software products and the functionality of some of our products: security; reliability; cost; ease of use; accessibility; quality of service; and potential tax or other government regulations. In addition, new technologies, such as non PC based Internet access devices and handheld organizers are gaining acceptance. We must adapt to these changing technological demands. If we are unable to timely assimilate changes brought about by the Internet and non PC based environments, our future net revenues and operating results could be adversely affected. The results of our research and development efforts are uncertain. We will need to incur significant research and development expenditures in future periods as we strive to remain competitive. The length of our product development cycle has generally been greater than we originally expected and we are likely to experience delays in future product development. In addition, a portion of our development efforts have not been technologically successful and certain products have not achieved market acceptance. As a result, the 33 Table of Contents products we are currently developing or may develop in the future may not be technologically successful, achieve market acceptance or compete effectively with products of our competitors. We are dependent upon certain distribution channels. A large portion of our sales is made through the retail distribution channel, which is subject to events that cause unpredictability in consumer demand. This increases the risk that we may not plan effectively for the future, which could result in adverse operating results in future periods. Our retail distribution customers also carry our competitors products. These retail distributors may have limited capital to invest in inventory. Their decisions to purchase our products are partly a function of pricing, terms and special promotions offered by our competitors and other factors that we do not control and cannot predict. Our agreements with retail distributors are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated by them or by us without cause. We would be adversely affected if companies in our chain of distributors chose to increase purchases from our competition relative to the amount they purchase from us. Some distributors and resellers have experienced financial difficulties in the past. Distributors that account for a significant portion of our sales may experience financial difficulties in the future. If these distributors do experience financial difficulties and we are unable to move their inventories to other distributors, we may experience reduced sales or increased write offs, which would adversely affect our operating results. Product returns may negatively affect our net revenues. Product returns can occur when we introduce upgrades and new versions of products or when distributors or retailers have excess inventories, subject to various contractual limitations. Our return policy allows distributors, subject to these contractual limitations, to return purchased products in exchange for new products or for credit towards future purchases. End users may return our products through dealers and distributors or to us directly for a full refund within a reasonably short period from the date of purchase. Future returns could exceed the reserves we have established for product returns, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We depend on internal communications systems that may be disrupted. Our order management and product shipping centers are geographically dispersed. A business disruption could occur as a result of natural disasters or the interruption in service by communications carriers. If our communications between these centers are disrupted, particularly at the end of a fiscal quarter, we may suffer an unexpected shortfall in net revenues and a resulting adverse impact on our operating results. Communications and Internet connectivity disruptions may also cause delays in customer access to our Internet based services or product sales. We are subject to litigation that could adversely affect our financial results. From time to time, we may be subject to claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, or other product liability claims, or other claims incidental to our business. We are currently involved in a number of lawsuits. We intend to defend all of these lawsuits vigorously. However, it is possible that we could suffer an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these cases. Depending on the amount and timing of any unfavorable resolutions of these lawsuits, our future results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected in a particular period. Although infringement claims may ultimately prove to be without merit, they are expensive to defend and may consume our resources or divert our attention from day to day operations. If a third party alleges that we have infringed their intellectual property rights, we may choose to litigate the claim and or seek an appropriate license from the third party. If we engage in litigation and the third party is found to have a valid patent claim against us and a license is not available on reasonable terms, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. The trend toward consolidation in the software industry could impede our ability to compete effectively. Consolidation is underway among companies in the software industry as firms seek to offer more extensive suites of software products and broader arrays of software solutions. Changes resulting from this consolidation may negatively impact our competitive condition. In addition, to the extent that we seek to expand our product lines and skills and capacity through acquisitions, the trend toward consolidation may result in our encountering competition, and paying higher prices, for acquired businesses. 34 Table of Contents We must attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled management, marketing and technical personnel. To accomplish this, we believe that we must provide personnel with a competitive compensation package, including stock options. Increases in shares available for issuance under our stock options plans require stockholder approval in many cases, and institutional stockholders, or stockholders generally, may not approve future increases. Additionally, there are several proposals in the Congress and in the accounting industry to require corporations to include a compensation expense in their statement of operations relating to the issuance of employee stock options. If such a measure is approved, we may decide to issue fewer stock options. As a result, we may be impaired in our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel. Our intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be adequately protected from all unauthorized uses. We regard our software and underlying technology as proprietary. We seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of confidentiality agreements and copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws. Third parties may copy aspects of our products or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information without authorization or develop similar technology independently. All of our products are protected by copyright laws, and we have a number of patents and patent applications pending. We may not achieve the desired protection from, and third parties may design around, our patents. In addition, existing copyright laws afford limited practical protection. Furthermore, the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection of our proprietary rights as the laws of the United States, and we may be subject to unauthorized use of our products. Any legal action that we may bring to protect proprietary information could be expensive and may distract management from day to day operations. Our products are complex and are operated in a wide variety of computer configurations, which could result in errors or product failures. Because we offer very complex products, undetected errors, failures or bugs may occur when they are first introduced or when new versions are released. Our products often are installed and used in large scale computing environments with different operating systems, system management software and equipment and networking configurations, which may cause errors or failures in our products or may expose undetected errors, failures or bugs in our products. In the past, we have discovered software errors, failures and bugs in certain of our product offerings after their introduction and have experienced delays or lost revenues during the period required to correct these errors. Our customers computer environments are often characterized by a wide variety of standard and non standard configurations that make pre release testing for programming or compatibility errors very difficult and time consuming. Despite testing by us and by others, errors, failures or bugs may not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments. Errors, failures or bugs in products released by us could result in negative publicity, product returns, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products or claims by customers or others. In addition, if an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in one of our end customers security systems, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products, the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed. Because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques. Alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and resources and could cause interruptions, delays or cessation of our product licensing, which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and would adversely affect results of operations. Most of our license agreements with customers contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims. It is possible, however, that these provisions may not prove effective in limiting our liability. Increased utilization and costs of our technical support services may adversely affect our financial results. Like many companies in the software industry, technical support costs comprise a significant portion of our operating costs and expenses. Over the short term, we may be unable to respond to fluctuations in customer demand for support services, including periods of high customer usage in which delays may be experienced. We also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors. Further, customer demand for these services could cause increases in the costs of providing such services and adversely affect our operating results. 35 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to interest rate risk and we are not a party to any interest rate risk management transactions. We do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Sensitivity As of March 31, 2002, the fair market value of our financial instruments with exposure to interest risk was approximately USD 1.2 billion, Euro 388.0 million, and CAD 12.5 million. Sensitivity analysis for a six month horizon was performed on our floating rate and fixed rate financial investments and floating rate liabilities. Parallel shifts in the yield curve of both +/ 50 basis points would result in changes in fair market values for these investments and floating rate liabilities of less than USD 1.0 million, less than Euro 1.0 million and less than CAD 1.0 million. Exchange Rate Sensitivity We conduct business in 30 international currencies through our worldwide operations. We have established a foreign exchange risk management program, utilizing forward exchange contracts with one fiscal month duration to offset various non functional currency exposures. Under this program, increases or decreases in the value of our non functional currency assets and liabilities are offset by gains and losses on the forward exchange contracts to mitigate the risk associated with foreign exchange market fluctuations. We do not use forward exchange contracts for trading purposes. At the end of each fiscal month, all non functional currency assets and liabilities are revalued using the spot rate of the maturing forward exchange contracts and the realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in net income (loss) as a component of other income (expense). We believe that the use of forward exchange contracts should reduce the risks that arise from conducting business in international markets. We employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks. However, significant changes in exchange rates may still result in adverse effects on our operating results. We use sensitivity analyses to quantify the impact that market risk exposures may have on the fair market values of our financial instruments. The financial instruments included in the sensitivity analyses consist of all of our foreign currency assets and liabilities and all derivative instruments, principally forward exchange contracts. The sensitivity analyses assesses the risk of loss in fair market values from the impact of hypothetical changes of instantaneous, parallel shifts in exchange rates and interest rates yield curves on market sensitive instruments over a six month horizon. As of March 31, 2002, the notional amount of our forward contracts was approximately USD 239.6 million. A 10% appreciation or devaluation in foreign currencies would result in a decrease in the fair value of our forward exchange contracts by approximately USD 12.5 million and an increase in the fair value of our forward exchange contracts by USD 11.0 million, respectively. As of March 31, 2002, the fair value of our investments in marketable securities denominated in foreign currencies was approximately USD 345.4 million. A 10% appreciation or devaluation would result in an increase in the fair value of our investments by approximately USD 37.1 million and a decrease in the fair value of our investments by USD 32.8 million, respectively. 36 Table of Contents
