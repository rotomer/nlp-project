Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW Symantec provides a broad range of content and network security software and appliance solutions to enterprises, individuals and service providers. We are a leading provider of client, gateway and server security solutions for virus protection, firewall and virtual private network, security management, intrusion detection, Internet content and e mail filtering, remote management technologies and security services to enterprises and service providers around the world. Founded in 1982, we have offices in 36 countries worldwide. We have a 52/53 week fiscal accounting year. Accordingly, all references as of and for the periods ended March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 reflect amounts as of and for the periods ended March 28, 2003, March 29, 2002 and March 30, 2001, respectively. The fiscal accounting years ended March 28, 2003, March 29, 2002 and March 30, 2001 each comprised 52 weeks of operations. The fiscal accounting year ending April 2, 2004 will comprise of 53 weeks of operations, with the extra week coming in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. Revenue Recognition We derive revenue primarily from sales of packaged software products, perpetual software license agreements, product maintenance and services, and recognize this revenue in accordance with Statement of Position, or SOP, 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, as modified by SOP 98 9, and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, when the following conditions have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; passage of title occurs; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; if applicable, customer acceptance has been received; collection of a fixed or determinable license fee is considered probable; and if appropriate, reasonable estimates of future product returns have been made. We sell packaged products, which primarily include consumer products, through a multi tiered distribution channel. We defer revenue on all distribution and reseller channel inventory in excess of specified inventory levels in these channels. We defer a portion of revenue for product bundled with content updates. This deferred revenue is recognized ratably over the initial year that such updates are provided. We offer the right of return of our products under various policies and programs with our distributors, resellers and end user customers. We estimate and record reserves for end user product returns and channel and end user rebates, and we account for these reserves as an offset to revenue. We enter into perpetual software license agreements mainly for our enterprise security and enterprise administration products primarily through indirect sales with distributors and resellers. The license agreements generally include product maintenance agreements, for which the related revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the agreements. Our services include managed security services, consulting and education. We recognize managed security services revenue ratably over the period that such contracted services are provided. We recognize consulting services revenue as services are performed or upon written acceptance from customers, if applicable. We recognize education services revenue as services are performed. In arrangements that include perpetual software licenses and maintenance and or services, and packaged products with content updates (multiple elements), we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value of the undelivered elements, and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue. Our deferred revenue consists primarily of the unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance and consumer product content updates. VSOE of each element is based on the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately. We determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our stand alone sales of these elements to third parties. If VSOE does not exist for undelivered items such as maintenance or services, then the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. 17 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported amounts of net revenue, operating income and net income (loss), as well as on the value of certain assets on our consolidated balance sheet. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. See Summary of Significant Accounting Policies beginning on page 50 in the consolidated financial statements for more information about these critical accounting policies, as well as descriptions of other significant accounting policies. We have engaged in discussions with our audit committee of the Board of Directors regarding the development, selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies. Channel Revenue Deferrals We defer revenue relating to products, primarily in our Consumer and Enterprise Administration segments, that we have shipped into our distribution and reseller channels to the extent that inventory levels are in excess of certain specified inventory levels for these channels. We defer this revenue as an offset to accounts receivable. We estimate the excess inventory in these channels by analyzing channel inventory levels and distribution sell through trends obtained from our channel partners, as well as various historical trends on a product basis. In addition, we consider other factors in assessing these specified inventory levels, such as product seasonality, current market conditions, economic trends, existing security threats and timing of new product releases. On the same basis, we defer the associated cost of revenues related to the channel revenue deferral. If we made different judgments or utilized different estimates, material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues and cost of revenues for any period presented. Reserves for Product Returns End users may return our products, primarily within our Consumer and Enterprise Administration segments, through distributors and resellers or to us directly for a full refund within a reasonably short period from the date of purchase. Our estimated reserves for such end user product returns, which are recorded as an offset to revenue, are based primarily on historical trends. Our return policy allows distributors and resellers, subject to certain contractual limitations, to return purchased products in exchange for new products or for credit towards future purchases. Product returns by distributors and resellers principally relate to stock balancing and the replacement of obsolete products. Channel revenue deferrals, as discussed above, are designed to take into account any distributor and reseller stock balancing returns. In addition, we fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channels. We also consider other factors such as the timing of upgrades and new versions of products, current market conditions, economic trends and changes in technology. If we made different judgments or utilized different estimates, material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented. Reserves for Rebates We estimate and record reserves as an offset to revenue for channel and end user rebates, related primarily to products within our Enterprise Security, Enterprise Administration and Consumer segments. Our estimated reserves for channel volume incentive rebates are based on distributors and resellers actual performance against the terms and conditions of volume incentive rebate programs, which are typically entered into quarterly. Our reserves for end user rebates are estimated on the terms and conditions of the promotional program, actual sales during the promotion, amount of actual redemptions received, historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program and the value of the rebate. We also consider current market conditions and economic trends when estimating our reserve for rebates. If we made different judgments or utilized different estimates, material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potential uncollectible trade receivables. We review our trade receivables by aging category to identify specific customers with known disputes or collectibility issues. We exercise judgment when determining the adequacy of these reserves as we evaluate historical bad debt trends, general economic conditions in the U.S. and internationally, and changes in customer financial conditions. If we made different judgments or utilized different estimates, material differences may result in additional reserves for trade receivables, which would be reflected by charges in general and administrative expenses for any period presented. Impairment of Long Lived and Intangible Assets and Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial Standards, or SFAS, No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangibles, which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized and that goodwill be tested for 18 Table of Contents impairment annually, or more frequently if events and circumstances warrant. We performed the initial goodwill impairment test required by SFAS No. 142 during the June 2002 quarter. We identified four reporting units, which represent our primary operating segments (see Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K), and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill recorded upon implementation of SFAS No. 142. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test during the March 2003 quarter and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill. We will continue to test for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, or earlier if indicators of impairment exist. We also evaluate long lived and intangible assets, including property, equipment, leasehold improvements and acquired product rights, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount. Such impairment loss would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value. Significant judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results, which are used in the preparation of projected cash flows. If we made different judgments or utilized different estimates, material differences may result in write downs of net long lived and intangible assets, which would be reflected by charges to our operating results for any period presented. Restructuring and Site Closures During fiscal 2003 and 2002, we incurred expenses related to consolidating, moving and relocating various groups or sites. In determining the charge related to our excess facilities, certain estimates were used, such as the ability to sublease the facilities, the terms of future subleases, broker commissions, costs of tenant improvements and related exit costs. In developing our estimates, we obtained information from third party leasing agents to calculate anticipated third party sublease income and the vacancy period prior to finding a sub leasee. Market conditions will affect our ability to sublease facilities on terms consistent with our estimates. Our ability to sublease facilities ahead of schedule or the negotiation of lease terms resulting in higher or lower sublease income than estimated will affect our accrual and the related charge for restructuring, site closures and other expenses. Differences between estimates of related broker commissions, tenant improvements and related exit costs may increase or decrease our accrual upon final negotiation. If we employed different assumptions regarding these various components of our exit costs, the costs recorded for any period presented could vary materially from those actually recorded. Deferred Income Taxes On a quarterly basis we evaluate our deferred tax asset balance for realizability. To the extent we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized, we will establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets. Realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon future U.S. taxable income and future taxable income in certain foreign jurisdictions, as well as our implementation of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require possible material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made. Recent Events During the September 2002 quarter, we acquired the following four privately held companies for approximately $375.2 million in cash: Riptech, Inc., a provider of scalable, real time managed security services that protect clients through advanced outsourced security monitoring and professional services. Recourse Technologies, Inc., a provider of security threat management solutions that detect, analyze and respond to both known and novel threats, including intrusions, internal attacks and denial of service attacks. SecurityFocus Inc., a provider of enterprise security threat management systems, providing global early warning of cyber attacks, customized and comprehensive threat alerts, and countermeasures to prevent attacks before they occur. Mountain Wave, Inc., a provider of automated attack sensing and warning software and services for real time enterprise security operations management. As a result of these acquisitions, we recorded, as adjusted for revised estimates related to certain liabilities, approximately $4.7 million for acquired in process research and development, $40.5 million for developed technology and acquired product rights, $307.5 million for goodwill, $4.3 million for other intangibles, $19.3 million 19 Table of Contents for net deferred tax assets and $7.6 million for tangible assets, net of liabilities. See Note 3 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the above acquisitions. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth each item from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net revenues and the percentage change in the total amount of each item for the periods indicated. Period to Period Percentage Increase (Decrease) Year Ended March 31, 2003 2002 compared compared 2003 2002 2001 to 2002 to 2001 Net revenues 100 % 100 % 100 % 31 % 26 % Cost of revenues 18 18 16 28 48 Gross margin 82 82 84 32 21 Operating expenses: Research and development 14 15 15 20 29 Sales and marketing 38 40 40 23 25 General and administrative 5 5 5 35 22 Amortization of goodwill 19 8 (100 ) 176 Amortization of other intangibles from acquisitions * * Acquired in process research and development 3 * (100 ) Restructuring, site closures and other 1 2 (46 ) 458 Litigation judgment * * Total operating expenses 58 81 71 (6 ) 42 Operating income 24 1 13 4,147 (93 ) Interest income 3 3 4 19 (5 ) Interest expense (1 ) (1 ) 131 * Income, net of expense, from sale of technologies and product lines 1 2 (56 ) (24 ) Other expense, net (3 ) * Income before income taxes 26 4 16 699 (68 ) Provision for income taxes 8 7 9 56 (4 ) Net income (loss) 18 % (3 )% 7 % 983 (144 ) * Percentage change is not meaningful. Net Revenues Net revenues increased 31% to approximately $1.4 billion during fiscal 2003 from $1.1 billion during fiscal 2002 and 26% to $1.1 billion during fiscal 2002 from $853.6 million during fiscal 2001. The increase during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 was due primarily to increased sales of our consumer products and enterprise security products. The increased sales of our consumer products and enterprise security products was largely attributable to continuing growth in demand for our virus protection solutions from large organizations as well as from small businesses and consumers. From a regional standpoint, the increase was primarily due to growth in net revenues internationally and, to a lesser extent, in the United States. Strength in major foreign currencies during fiscal 2003 also positively impacted our international revenue growth. The increase during fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 was due primarily to increased sales of our enterprise security products and a significant increase in sales of our consumer products during the second half of fiscal 2002. The increase in enterprise security products during fiscal 2002 was attributable to a full year of sales related to 20 Table of Contents AXENT solutions as compared to approximately three months during fiscal 2001. From a regional standpoint, this increase was primarily due to growth in net revenues in the United States and to a lesser extent in EMEA. A significant portion of our deferred revenue balance of $331.1 million as of March 31, 2002 contributed to our total net revenues during fiscal 2003. We anticipate that our deferred revenue balance of $589.6 million as of March 31, 2003, will also be a significant portion of our net revenues during the first quarter of fiscal 2004. Segments Our Enterprise Security segment provides organizations with Internet security technology, global response and services to manage their information security needs. Our Enterprise Security segment represented approximately 42%, 42% and 33% of net revenues during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Net revenues increased approximately $138.6 million, or 30%, during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002. This increase was primarily due to strong growth in sales of our virus protection and firewall/VPN product solutions. Net revenues increased $172.2 million, or 61%, during fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001. The increase was primarily due to our first full year of sales of intrusion detection, security management and firewall product solutions, as a result of our acquisition of AXENT in December 2000, and in particular, significant growth in sales of virus protection product solutions. Our Enterprise Administration segment offers products that enable companies to be more effective and efficient within their information technology departments. Our Enterprise Administration segment represented approximately 15%, 21% and 27% of net revenues during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Net revenues decreased approximately $7.5 million, or 3%, during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 and decreased $8.1 million, or 4%, during fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001. These decreases were primarily due to a decrease in sales of our pcAnywhere product, partially offset by growth in our Ghost Corporate Edition product. We anticipate net revenues from this segment to comprise a smaller percentage of our overall revenues going forward. Our Consumer Products segment provides security and problem solving products to individual users, home offices and small businesses. Our Consumer Products segment represented approximately 41%, 35% and 39% of net revenues during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Net revenues increased approximately $194.1 million, or 52%, during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002. This increase was primarily related to stronger than expected consumer and small business spending, which contributed to the increase in sales of our Norton AntiVirus and Norton Internet Security products. Our electronic distribution channel, including original equipment manufacturer subscription renewals, also contributed to the increase in sales during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002. Net revenues increased by approximately $45.8 million, or 14%, during fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001. This increase was primarily related to an increase in sales of our Norton AntiVirus and Norton Internet Security products, mostly as a result of strong consumer and small business spending, and an increase in the renewal subscription pricing of our antivirus products. This increase was offset by a decline in sales of our Winfax and Macintosh products. We do not expect our Consumer Product net revenues to grow at as high a rate during fiscal 2004 as during fiscal 2003. Our Services segment provides information security solutions that incorporate best of breed technology, security expertise and global resources. Our Services segment represented approximately 2%, 1% and less than 1% of net revenues during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Net revenues increased approximately $15.5 million, or 142%, during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002. This increase was primarily related to sales from our managed security services, which represented approximately $13.8 million of net revenues during fiscal 2003. Net revenues increased approximately $8.6 million, or 378%, during fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001, due primarily to the increase in demand for our consulting services. Our Other segment is comprised of sunset products and products nearing the end of their life cycle and represented less than 1% of net revenues during each of the fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001. International Net revenues outside of the United States represented approximately 49%, 47% and 48% of net revenues during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. International net revenues increased by approximately $188.2 million, or 37%, during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002. This increase in net revenues was primarily the result of sales growth in EMEA and to a lesser extent in Japan, primarily from increased sales of our enterprise security and consumer products. International net revenues increased by approximately $91.6 million, or 22%, during fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001. This increase in net revenues was the result of increased sales in EMEA and Asia Pacific, primarily from increased sales of our enterprise security and consumer products. 21 Table of Contents Strength in major foreign currencies during fiscal 2003, as compared to the average major foreign currency rates during fiscal 2002, positively impacted our international revenue growth by approximately $65.5 million. Weakness in major foreign currencies during fiscal 2002, as compared to the average major foreign currency rates during fiscal 2001, negatively impacted our international revenue growth by approximately $14.0 million. We are unable to predict the extent to which revenues in future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency rates. If international sales become a greater proportion of our total sales in the future, changes in foreign exchange rates may have a potentially greater impact on our revenues and operating results. Gross Margin Gross margin represents net revenues less cost of revenues. Cost of revenues consists primarily of manufacturing expenses, costs for producing manuals and CDs, packaging costs, royalties paid to third parties under publishing contracts, costs of services, fee based technical support costs and amortization of acquired product rights. As a percentage of net revenues, gross margin remained flat at approximately 82% during fiscal year 2003 and 2002 and was 84% during 2001. The decline in gross margins during fiscal 2003 and 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 was mostly driven by increased amortization of acquired product rights from our four acquisitions in September 2002 and our acquisition of AXENT in December 2000, along with an increase in fee based technical support costs related to increased enterprise sales. In addition, the costs associated with services increased with the corresponding increase in services revenue; and our services typically generate lower gross margins than our software products. Acquired Product Rights Acquired product rights are comprised of purchased product rights, technologies, databases and revenue related order backlog and contracts from acquired companies. During fiscal 2003, we recorded approximately $40.1 million, net in acquired product rights related primarily to our acquisitions of Riptech, Recourse, SecurityFocus and Mountain Wave, and during fiscal 2001, we recorded approximately $86.2 million in acquired product rights in connection with our acquisition of AXENT. During fiscal 2003, amortization of acquired product rights totaled approximately $32.1 million, of which $30.4 million and $1.8 million was recorded in cost of revenues and income, net of expense, from sale of technologies and product lines, respectively. During fiscal 2002, amortization of acquired product rights totaled approximately $32.2 million, of which $31.1 million and $1.1 million was recorded in cost of revenues and income, net of expense, from sale of technologies and product lines, respectively. During fiscal 2001, amortization of acquired product rights totaled $17.3 million and was recorded in cost of revenues. For further discussion on acquired product rights and related amortization, see Note 3 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K. Research and Development Expenses We charge research and development expenditures to operations as incurred. As a percentage of net revenues, research and development expenses were 14% during fiscal 2003 and remained flat at 15% during fiscal 2002 and 2001. Research and development expenses increased 20% to approximately $197.3 million during fiscal 2003 from $164.0 million during fiscal 2002 and 29% to $164.0 million during fiscal 2002 from $126.7 million during fiscal 2001. The increase in research and development expenses during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily a result of increased headcount, salary increases, increased infrastructure related expenditures and increased research and development expenses associated with the companies that we acquired during fiscal 2003. The increase in research and development expenses during fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 was primarily a result of salary increases and other employee related expenses, infrastructure related expenditures and a full year of AXENT related research and development expenses as compared to approximately three months during fiscal 2001. Sales and Marketing Expenses Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 38% during fiscal 2003 and remained flat at 40% during fiscal 2002 and 2001. Sales and marketing expenses increased 23% to approximately $525.0 million during fiscal 2003 from $426.0 million during fiscal 2002 and 25% to $426.0 million during fiscal 2002 from $341.5 million during fiscal 2001. The increase in sales and marketing expenses during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily a result of increased headcount, salary increases, higher commission expenses due to the increase in sales, increased advertising and promotion expenses, increased travel and entertainment expenses and increased sales and marketing expenses associated with the companies that we acquired during fiscal 2003. The increase in sales and marketing expenses during fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 was primarily related to Enterprise Security segment hiring, salary and commission increases, outside services for consultants and contractors, 22 Table of Contents infrastructure related expenditures, and a full year of AXENT related sales and marketing expenses as compared to approximately three months during fiscal 2001. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues remained flat at 5% for each of the fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001. General and administrative expenses increased 35% to approximately $74.4 million during fiscal 2003 from $55.1 million during fiscal 2002 and 22% to $55.1 million during fiscal 2002 from $45.1 million during fiscal 2001. The increase in general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily a result of increased headcount, salary increases, increased infrastructure related expenditures, increased legal fees, increased travel and entertainment expenses and increased general and administrative expenses associated with the companies that we acquired during fiscal 2003. The increase in general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 was primarily due to AXENT related general and administrative expenses, salary increases, legal fees, infrastructure related expenditures and bad debt expense, offset by a reduction of other general and administrative expenses. Amortization of Goodwill and Other Intangibles from Acquisitions Amortization of goodwill and other intangibles from acquisitions decreased 99% to approximately $2.8 million during fiscal 2003 from $199.0 million during fiscal 2002. This decrease was due to the adoption of SFAS No. 142 on April 1, 2002, under which the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized, but are subject to an annual impairment test. Amortization of goodwill and other intangibles from acquisitions increased 173% to approximately $199.0 million during fiscal 2002 from $72.8 million during fiscal 2001. This increase was related primarily to the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles associated with the acquisition of AXENT in December 2000. Acquired In Process Research and Development Expenses Acquired in process research and development was $4.7 million during fiscal 2003, due to the Riptech, SecurityFocus and Recourse acquisitions in the September 2002 quarter. We recorded no acquired in process research and development charges during fiscal 2002. During fiscal 2001, we acquired AXENT and wrote off approximately $22.3 million of acquired in process research and development associated with this acquisition. These write offs were necessary because the acquired technologies had not yet reached technological feasibility and there were no alternative uses. The efforts required to develop the acquired in process technology principally related to the completion of all planning, design, development and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product or service can be produced to meet its design specifications including features, functions and performance. We expect the acquired in process technology to be developed into commercially feasible products. However, there are no assurances that this will occur. If we fail to complete these products in their entirety, or in a timely manner, we may not continue to attract new users, we may be unable to retain our existing users and the value of the other intangible assets may become impaired. We determined the fair value of the acquired in process technology for each of the purchases by estimating the projected cash flows related to these projects and future revenues to be earned upon commercialization of the products. We discounted the resulting cash flows back to their net present values. We based the net cash flows from such projects on our analysis of the respective markets and estimates of revenues and operating profits related to these projects. A valuation specialist used our estimates to establish the amount of acquired in process research and development to be written off for these acquisitions during fiscal 2003 and 2001. Actual spending on these product development projects since our acquisition of the companies discussed below did not differ materially from the original assumptions and projections discussed in prior filings. Riptech The in process technology acquired in the Riptech acquisition consisted primarily of research and development related to the fourth generation of its Caltarian technology, which provides real time information protection through around the clock monitoring, analysis and response. We plan to integrate this technology into our managed security services. 23 Table of Contents SecurityFocus The in process technology acquired in the SecurityFocus acquisition consisted primarily of research and development related to new versions of DeepSight Threat Management System and DeepSight Analyzer products, which are threat management systems that provide early warnings of attack, as well as countermeasures to defend these attacks. We plan to integrate this technology into our security management products. Recourse The in process technology acquired in the Recourse acquisition consisted primarily of research and development related to new versions of ManHunt, a network intrusion detection system. We plan to integrate this technology into our intrusion detection products. AXENT The in process technology acquired in the AXENT acquisition consisted primarily of research and development related to the next generation of ESM, Intruder Alert, Raptor Firewall, Webthority and other projects. AXENTs research and development was focused on providing more robust features in its development of these next generation products. We have added these projects to our product offerings, with the exception of Webthority, which was divested with our web access management product line in August 2001. Restructuring, Site Closures and Other Restructuring, site closures and other were approximately $11.1 million, $20.4 million and $3.7 million during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. During fiscal 2003, we recorded approximately $8.7 million for costs of severance, related benefits and outplacement services primarily associated with the relocation of our Leiden, Netherlands operations to Dublin, Ireland, the relocation of certain development, sales and finance activities, the outsourcing of our North American and European consumer support functions, the realignment of certain worldwide marketing efforts, and the reduction in operations in San Antonio, Texas. As a result, we terminated 424 employees. In addition, we recorded approximately $3.5 million for exit costs associated with the consolidation of certain facilities in the United States. These expenses were offset by a net reduction in expenses of approximately $1.1 million, due primarily to revised estimates of certain fiscal 2002 facility related expenses. During fiscal 2002, we incurred expenses related to consolidating smaller sites into a larger facility in Newport News, Virginia, consolidating most of our United Kingdom facilities to Maidenhead, UK, consolidating our European support functions by moving our Leiden, Netherlands facility to Dublin, Ireland and relocating our North American support group to Springfield, Oregon. As a result, we recorded approximately $17.8 million for exit costs, including $12.8 million in rent and related exit costs remaining on the abandoned facilities and $5.0 million in related abandoned fixed asset and leasehold improvement write offs. In addition, we recorded approximately $2.6 million for costs of severance, related benefits and outplacement services, as we reorganized various operating functions, including former AXENT operations, and terminated 87 employees. During fiscal 2001, we reorganized various operating functions, including a portion of our operations in Toronto. We terminated 60 employees and ten members of our senior management, and as a result, we recorded approximately $3.7 million for costs of severance, related benefits, outplacement services and abandonment of certain equipment. For further discussion on restructuring, site closures and other, see Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K. Litigation Judgment During the March 2002 quarter, we accrued litigation expenses of approximately $3.1 million for post judgment interest and other costs related to a judgment by a Canadian court on a decade old copyright action assumed by us as a result of our acquisition of Delrina Corporation. For further discussion on our current litigation, see Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K. There was no corresponding accrual during fiscal 2003 or fiscal 2001. Operating Income Operating income was approximately $341.5 million, $8.0 million and $109.6 million during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The primary factor in the increase between fiscal 2002 and 2003 was our adoption of SFAS No. 142. As a result, in fiscal 2003, we recorded no amortization of goodwill, compared with a charge of $196.8 million during fiscal 2002. In addition, strength in major foreign currencies during fiscal 2003, as compared to the average major foreign currency rates during fiscal 2002, positively impacted our operating income growth by approximately $19.9 million. Weakness in major foreign currencies during fiscal 2002, as compared to the average major foreign 24 Table of Contents currency rates during fiscal 2001, negatively impacted our operating income growth by approximately $12.1 million. We are unable to predict the extent to which operating income in future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency rates. Interest Income, Interest Expense and Other Expense, Net Interest income was approximately $37.7 million, $31.7 million and $33.3 million during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase was due to higher average invested cash balances during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002. Although interest income was relatively flat during fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001, average cash balances were higher during fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001, which was offset by a decrease in average interest rates. Interest expense was approximately $21.2 million and $9.2 million during fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively, nearly all of which was related to the issuance of $600.0 million of 3% convertible subordinated notes in October 2001. Interest expense was not significant during fiscal 2001. Other expense, net of approximately $1.3 million and $0.6 million during fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively, was primarily comprised of net losses from non functional currency transactions. Other expense, net was approximately $22.5 million during fiscal 2001 and consisted primarily of impairment charges on our equity investments. Income, Net of Expense, From Sale of Technologies and Product Lines Income, net of expense, from sale of technologies and product lines was approximately $6.9 million, $15.5 million and $20.4 million during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. During fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, income, net of expense, from sale of technologies and product lines was related primarily to royalty payments received, in connection with the divestiture of our ACT! product line in December 1999, from Interact Commerce Corporation, which subsequently merged with The Sage Group plc. During fiscal 2003, this royalty income was offset by the write off of approximately $2.7 million of developed technology related to the web access management products that were divested in the September 2001 quarter. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate on income before taxes was approximately 32%, 162% and 55% during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The higher effective tax rate in fiscal 2002 and 2001 reflects the non deductibility of acquired in process research and development and substantially all of the goodwill amortization. Realization of our net deferred tax asset at March 31, 2003 is dependent primarily upon future U.S. taxable income and our implementation of tax planning strategies. We believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized based on historical earnings and expected levels of future taxable income as well as the implementation of tax planning strategies. Levels of future taxable income are subject to the various risks and uncertainties discussed in the Business Risk Factors set forth in this Item 7. An additional valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets may be necessary if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. We will assess the need for an additional valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. We project our effective tax rate to be 32% for fiscal 2004. This projection, however, is subject to change due to potential tax law changes and fluctuations in the geographic distribution of earnings. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal source of liquidity is our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments as well as the cash that we generate over time from our operations. Cash, cash equivalents and short term investments increased $330.6 million to approximately $1.7 billion at the end of fiscal 2003 from $1.4 billion at the end of fiscal 2002. This increase is primarily due to cash provided by operations, net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and sales of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan. The cash provided by these factors was partially offset by cash paid for the companies we acquired during fiscal 2003, capital expenditures and the repurchase of common stock. Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 was approximately $583.9 million, $511.2 million and $324.5 million, respectively. During fiscal 2003, net cash provided by operating activities was comprised primarily of net income of approximately $248.4 million, net non cash related expenses of $140.9 million, and an increase in liabilities, net of assets, of $194.6 million. During fiscal 2002, net cash provided by operating activities was comprised of net non cash related expenses of approximately $339.4 million and an increase in liabilities, net of assets, of $199.9 million, offset by a net loss of approximately $28.2 million. During fiscal 2001, 25 Table of Contents net cash provided by operating activities was comprised of non cash related expenses of approximately $157.4 million, net income of $63.9 million, and an increase in liabilities, net of assets, of $103.2 million. Net trade accounts receivable increased $60.4 million to approximately $149.7 million as of March 31, 2003 from $89.2 million as of March 31, 2002. The increase in net trade accounts receivable was primarily due to higher sales in the month of March 2003 compared to the month of March 2002 and an unusually low net trade accounts receivable balance at March 31, 2002 as compared to the prior six quarter end balances. In prior quarters, we had generated a larger percentage of net revenues during the last month of each quarter. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 was approximately $756.6 million, $869.3 million and $24.2 million, respectively. During fiscal 2003, net cash used in investing activities was comprised primarily of approximately $367.5 million in acquisition related costs, $194.8 million in net purchases of marketable securities and other investments and $192.2 million of capital expenditures. During the March 2003 quarter, we exercised our option to purchase four of our facilities, previously accounted for as operating leases, for approximately $123.9 million. During fiscal 2002, net cash used in investing activities was comprised primarily of approximately $721.7 million in net purchases of marketable securities and other investments, and $140.9 million of capital expenditures. During fiscal 2001, net cash used in investing activities was comprised primarily of approximately $73.4 million of capital expenditures and other investing activities, offset by $60.2 million in net proceeds from sales of marketable securities and other investments and $37.4 million in acquired AXENT cash balances. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2003 and 2002 was approximately $73.4 million and $514.1 million, respectively, and net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2001 was $198.3 million. During fiscal 2003, net cash provided by financing activities was comprised primarily of approximately $137.7 million in net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and sales of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan, offset by $64.3 million for repurchases of common stock. During fiscal 2002, net cash provided by financing activities was comprised primarily of approximately $584.6 million in net proceeds from the issuance of 3% convertible subordinated notes in October 2001 and $133.9 million in net proceeds from exercise of stock options and sales of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan, offset by approximately $204.4 million for repurchases of common stock. During fiscal 2001, net cash used in financing activities was comprised primarily of approximately $244.4 million for repurchases of common stock, offset by $46.4 million in net proceeds from exercise of stock options and sales of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan. On January 16, 2001, the Board of Directors replaced an earlier stock repurchase program with a new authorization to repurchase up to $700.0 million of Symantecs common stock, not to exceed 30.0 million shares, with no expiration date. As of March 31, 2003, we had repurchased a total of 21.9 million shares under this program at prices ranging from $17.78 to $29.97 per share, for an aggregate amount of approximately $513.2 million. During fiscal 2003, we repurchased 2.2 million shares at prices ranging from $27.93 to $29.97 per share, for an aggregate amount of approximately $64.3 million. During fiscal 2002, we repurchased 9.6 million shares at prices ranging from $17.78 to $24.50 per share, for an aggregate amount of approximately $204.4 million. During fiscal 2001, we repurchased 10.0 million shares at prices ranging from $23.04 to $25.58 per share, for an aggregate amount of approximately $244.4 million. On October 24, 2001, we completed a private offering of $600.0 million of 3% convertible subordinated notes due November 1, 2006, the net proceeds of which were approximately $584.6 million. The notes are convertible into shares of Symantec common stock by the holders at any time before maturity at a conversion price of $34.14 per share, subject to certain adjustments. During fiscal 2003, an immaterial principal amount of our notes were converted into shares of our common stock. We may redeem the remaining notes on or after November 5, 2004, at a redemption price of 100.75% of stated principal during the period November 5, 2004 through October 31, 2005 and 100% thereafter. Interest is paid semi annually, commencing May 1, 2002. On April 17, 2003, we purchased certain assets related to Roxio Inc.s GoBack computer recovery software business for approximately $13.0 million. Also on May 13, 2003, we entered into an agreement to acquire Nexland, Inc., a technology driven Internet security company whose Internet Protocol based networking appliances are installed at enterprise branches and telecommuter offices worldwide, for approximately $19.6 million. We expect to complete the acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. 26 Table of Contents The following table displays our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2003: Total Payments Due In Payments Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2009 (In thousands) Due Fiscal 2004 and 2006 and 2008 and thereafter Convertible subordinated notes $ 600,000 $ $ $ 600,000 $ Operating leases 105,674 31,306 43,105 23,972 7,291 Total contractual obligations $ 705,674 $ 31,306 $ 43,105 $ 623,972 $ 7,291 The above table assumes that the convertible subordinated notes will be paid in cash upon maturity and excludes the balance of our current liabilities. We believe that existing cash and short term investments, cash generated from operating results and cash from the subordinated convertible debenture offering will be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next year. NEWLY ADOPTED AND RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS On April 1, 2002, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to an annual impairment test. Other intangibles will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. In addition, SFAS No. 142 required acquired workforce in place to be reclassified as goodwill. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we ceased the amortization of goodwill and recharacterized acquired workforce in place (and the related deferred tax liability) as goodwill on April 1, 2002. We also performed the initial goodwill impairment test required by SFAS No. 142 during the June 2002 quarter. We identified four reporting units, which represent our primary operating segments as indicated in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K, and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill recorded upon implementation of SFAS No. 142. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test during the March 2003 quarter and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill. We will continue to test for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, or earlier if indicators of impairment exist. As a result of the discontinuance of the amortization of goodwill existing as of March 31, 2002, the application of SFAS No. 142 resulted in an increase in our results of operations of approximately $198.4 million during fiscal 2003. At March 31, 2003, we had goodwill of approximately $833.4 million. On April 1, 2002, we adopted SFAS No. 144, Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. SFAS No. 144 supersedes SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed Of and elements of APB No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business and Extraordinary, Unusual, and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions. SFAS No. 144 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets. The adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146 requires that the liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred rather than when a commitment is made to an exit or disposal plan. SFAS No. 146 also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value. SFAS No. 146 became effective for exit or disposal activities that were initiated after December 31, 2002. The adoption of this statement may result in recognizing the cost of future restructuring activities, if any, over a period of time rather than in the reporting period that the plan of restructuring is adopted. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. Under this Interpretation, a liability shall be recognized for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing or modifying guarantees and indemnification agreements after December 31, 2002. Certain of the software licenses that we have granted contain provisions that indemnify licensees of the software from damages and costs resulting from claims alleging that our software infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party. We have historically received only a limited number of requests for indemnification under these provisions and have not been required to make material payments pursuant to these provisions. Accordingly, we have not recorded a liability related to these indemnification provisions. As of March 31, 2003, we had no liability associated with any of our indemnification agreements on our balance sheet. 27 Table of Contents In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51, that provides guidance for determining when a primary beneficiary should consolidate a variable interest entity that functions to support the activities of the primary beneficiary. The effective date of Interpretation No. 46 is the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003 for variable interest entities acquired before February 1, 2003 and immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. In the March 2003 quarter, we purchased four of our facilities that were classified as operating leases under synthetic lease transactions by purchasing the land and buildings for approximately $17.9 million and $106.0 million, respectively. As such, we had no interest in any variable interest entities as of March 31, 2003. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity, which provides guidance for classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of this statement will not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations. BUSINESS RISK FACTORS There is uncertainty as to whether or not we will be able to sustain the growth rates in sales of our products, particularly in consumer antivirus protection products. During fiscal 2003 and the second half of fiscal 2002, we experienced a higher than expected rate of growth in sales of our consumer antivirus protection products, and we expect that we will not be able to sustain this high growth rate on a consistent basis. We believe that consumer antivirus sales have been spurred by a number of factors over the past six quarters, including increased broadband connection, increased awareness of security threats to consumer systems, particularly the well publicized Code Red, Nimda, Klez, Opaserv, Yaha, Bugbear, Lovegate and Slammer threats and a reaction from the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The impact of these factors is likely to diminish over time, and it is possible that growth rates in sales of antivirus protection products may decline. Our efforts to develop and sell appliances and integrated solutions involve risk. We have recently begun selling appliances in which our software is embedded with hardware. Because of our limited experience with the manufacture of appliances, and because our appliances generate lower gross margins than our software products, our efforts to develop and sell appliances may not be as successful as we anticipate. In addition, our strategy for future growth includes integrating our various security technologies, management, customer service and support into a single enterprise security solution. We have begun implementing this strategy by selling integrated solutions, such as Symantec Gateway Security and Symantec Client Security. Our integrated solutions may not achieve market acceptance and may not be able to compete with solutions either currently in the market or introduced in the future. If we are unable to achieve market acceptance or compete effectively with solutions of our competitors, our future net revenues and operating results could be adversely affected. Economic and political conditions and conditions affecting the network security market in particular may have a negative impact on our revenues and margins. The market for our products depends on economic conditions affecting the broader network security, Internet infrastructure and related markets. More generally, the slowdown in the U.S. economy may hurt consumer demand for our products. On the enterprise side, the continued slowdown in corporate earnings and tightening of corporate budgets may cause potential customers to delay or cancel security projects, reduce their overall or security specific information technology budgets, or reduce or cancel orders for our products. Further, in this environment, customers may experience financial difficulty, cease operations or fail to budget for the purchase of our products. This, in turn, may lead to longer sales cycles, price pressures and collection issues, causing us to realize lower revenues and margins. In addition, the terrorist acts of September 11, 2001 and the fall out of the war in the Middle East have created an uncertain economic and political environment in many parts of the world, and we cannot predict the impact of these events, or of any related military action, on our customers or business. We face risks associated with our foreign operations. A significant portion of our manufacturing costs and operating expenses result from transactions outside of the United States, often in foreign currencies. Our international sales have been increasing as a percentage of our total sales and, for the first time during the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, comprised slightly more than 50% of our total sales. In fiscal year 2003, our operating results have been positively affected by changes in foreign currency rates. Our future operating results will continue to be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates, especially if international sales continue to grow as a percentage of our total sales, and we may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency rates in the future. Our operating results could also be adversely affected by general uncertainty with each countrys political and 28 Table of Contents economic structure. In addition, governmental regulation of imports or exports or our failure to obtain any required export approval of our technologies, particularly our encryption technologies, could impede our international sales. In light of recent terrorist activity and political and military instability internationally, governments could enact additional regulation or restrictions on the use, import or export of encryption technologies. Additional regulation of encryption technologies could delay or prevent the acceptance and use of encryption products and public networks for secure communications. This might decrease demand for our products and services. In addition, the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) could have an adverse impact on our operations in Asia. If there is a significant spread of SARS beyond Asia, other aspects of our operations could be negatively impacted. Demand for our products is subject to seasonal trends. Although there is no assurance this trend will continue, our sales of consumer products over the last seven years have been seasonal, with higher sales generally in our December and March quarters. In addition, we anticipate that sales of enterprise security products may be higher in the March quarter in the future, as our sales force attempts to close transactions before the end of our fiscal year. To the extent seasonality makes it more difficult to predict our revenues and value our business, our stock price may suffer and the volatility of our stock may increase. Introduction and integration of new products and technology may adversely affect our financial results. We have recently introduced new products, including newly acquired products and products incorporating newly acquired technology from our acquisitions. Examples of these products include ManHunt, Symantec Decoy Server (formerly ManTrap), DeepSight Threat Management System and DeepSight Alert Services. These products may not achieve market acceptance and or may not be able to compete with products either currently in the market or introduced in the future. If these products do not achieve market success, we may not achieve operating results that investors and analysts expect and, as a result, the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected. Increased reliance on sales of enterprise licenses may result in greater fluctuations in, or otherwise adversely affect, our financial results. Sales of enterprise licenses through our Enterprise Security segment represent a major portion of our business. Enterprise licensing arrangements involve a longer sales cycle than sales through other distribution channels, require greater investment of resources in establishing the enterprise relationship, may involve greater pricing pressure and sometimes result in lower operating margins. In recent quarters, the number of higher dollar value enterprise license contracts has increased and our reliance on such contracts in the future may result in increased uncertainty relating to quarterly revenues. In addition, the timing of the execution of volume licenses, or their nonrenewal by large customers, could cause our results of operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. We are dependent upon certain partners to distribute our products and we would be adversely affected if these relationships terminate or diminish. A large portion of our enterprise sales is made through value added and other resellers, and a large portion of our consumer sales is made through the retail distribution channel. Reliance on these channels subjects us to events that cause unpredictability in demand. This increases the risk that we may not plan effectively for the future, which could result in adverse operating results in future periods. Our distribution partners may also offer our competitors products. Their decisions to sell our products are partly a function of pricing, terms and special promotions offered by our competitors and other factors that we do not control and cannot predict. Our agreements with partners are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated by them or by us without cause. We would be adversely affected if companies in our partner program chose to sell greater amounts of competitive offerings relative to the amount they sell of our offerings. In addition, one of the channels through which we sell our consumer products is original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, who bundle our antivirus and other products with their PCs. We continuously seek to establish new OEM relationships and, conversely, are subject to OEMs who bundle our software with their products deciding either to discontinue bundling third party security software or to switch to a competitors product. When we lose an OEM relationship, our consumer sales could be adversely affected unless and until we are able to establish new relationships of similar significance. Some distribution partners have experienced financial difficulties in the past. Distribution partners may experience financial difficulties in the future. If these partners do experience financial difficulties, we may experience reduced sales or increased write offs, which would adversely affect our operating results. 29 Table of Contents We have grown, and may continue to grow, through acquisitions, which give rise to a number of risks that could have adverse consequences for our future operating results. We completed four acquisitions during the September 2002 quarter, have announced two additional acquisitions during fiscal 2004, and will likely pursue future acquisitions. Integrating acquired businesses has been and will continue to be a complex, time consuming and expensive process. To integrate acquired businesses, we must implement our technology systems in the acquired operations and assimilate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations. Our success in completing the integration of acquired businesses may impact the market acceptance of such acquisitions, and our willingness to acquire additional businesses in the future. Further, the difficulties of integrating acquired businesses could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management focus from other opportunities and challenges, and increase our expenses and working capital requirements. Our recent acquisitions have resulted in, and acquisitions we complete in the future may also cause us to recognize, substantial amounts of goodwill that will be subject to an annual, or if events require, a more frequent impairment test and other intangible assets that will be amortized and also subject to impairment testing. In addition, acquisitions may result in substantial restructuring and other related expenses and write offs of acquired in process research and development costs. Further, we may need to issue equity or incur additional debt to finance future acquisitions, which could be dilutive to our existing stockholders or could increase our leverage. Any of these and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from acquired operations or to realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition. Our markets are competitive and our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to anticipate or react to this competition. Our markets are competitive. If we are unable to anticipate or react to this competition, our operating results could be adversely affected by reducing our sales or the prices we can charge for our products. Many of our competitors have significantly lowered, and may continue to lower, the price of their products and we may have to do the same to remain competitive. Our ability to remain competitive depends, in part, on our ability to enhance our products or develop new products that are compatible with new hardware and operating systems. We have no control over, and limited insight into, development efforts by third parties with respect to new hardware and operating systems, and we may not respond effectively or timely to such changes in the market. In addition, we have limited resources and we must make strategic decisions as to the best allocation of our resources to position ourselves for changes in our markets. We may from time to time allocate resources to projects or markets that do not develop as rapidly or fully as we expect. We may fail to allocate resources to third party products, to markets or to business models that are more successful than we anticipate. The trend toward consolidation in the software industry could impede our ability to compete effectively. Consolidation is underway among companies in the software industry as firms seek to offer more extensive suites of software products and broader arrays of software and integrated software and hardware solutions. Changes resulting from this consolidation may negatively impact our competitive position. In addition, to the extent that we seek to expand our product lines and skills and capacity through acquisitions, the trend toward consolidation may result in our encountering competition, and paying higher prices, for acquired businesses. Operating system providers, and network equipment and computer hardware manufacturers are becoming substantial competitors in the market for security solutions. These competitors generally have significantly greater financial, marketing or technological resources than we do, and may leverage their strengths at the computing platform, security layer and network tier levels to compete more aggressively in the market for security solutions. Continued development, acquisition, or licensing of security solutions technology or products rights by one or more of these competitors could negatively impact our competitive position in the market for security solutions. For example, the continued inclusion of security, remote access or virus protection tools in new operating systems and hardware packages could adversely affect our sales. In particular, the inclusion of features by Microsoft in future editions of Windows which directly compete with our products may decrease or delay the demand for certain of our products, including those currently under development. Additionally, as hardware vendors incorporate security functions in the network equipment or integrate security within their network and system management products, the demand may decrease for some of our products, including those currently under development. Piracy of our software may have a significant impact on our net revenues. Although we are unable to determine the extent of piracy of our software products, software piracy may depress our net revenues. While this would adversely affect domestic revenue, revenue loss is believed to be even more significant outside of the United States, particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. We engage in efforts to educate consumers on the benefits of licensing genuine products and to educate lawmakers on the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected, and we cooperate with the Business Software Alliance in their efforts to combat piracy. However, such continued efforts may not be successful in preventing piracy of our products from occurring. 30 Table of Contents Our software products and web site may be subject to intentional disruption. Although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent intentional disruptions, such as software viruses specifically designed to impede the performance of our products, we expect to be an ongoing target of such disruptions. Similarly, experienced computer programmers, or hackers, may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our web site and misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of our services. Uninterrupted online availability of our web site is becoming increasingly important as online subscription renewals comprise a larger portion of our revenues. Our activities could be substantially disrupted, and our reputation and future sales harmed, if these efforts are successful. Fluctuations in our quarterly operating results have affected our stock price in the past and could affect our stock price in the future. If our quarterly operating results or our predictions of future operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts and investors, the trading price of shares of our common stock and of the notes could be negatively affected. Our quarterly operating results have varied substantially in the past and may vary substantially in the future depending upon a number of factors, including: the timing of announcements and releases of new or enhanced versions of our products and product upgrades; the introduction of competitive products; uncertainty about and customer confidence in the current economic conditions and outlook; reduced demand for any given product; unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; seasonality in the end of period buying patterns of foreign and domestic software customers; and the markets transition between new releases of operating systems. Any such volatility may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our common stock or securities convertible or exercisable into our common stock. In addition to the foregoing factors, the risk of quarterly fluctuations is increased by the fact that a significant portion of our net revenues has historically been generated during the last month of each fiscal quarter. Most resellers tend to make a majority of their purchases at the end of a fiscal quarter. In addition, many enterprise customers negotiate site licenses near the end of each quarter. Our reliance on a large portion of revenue occurring at the end of the quarter and the increase in the dollar value of transactions that occur at the end of a quarter can result in increased uncertainty relating to quarterly revenues. Due to this end of period buying pattern, forecasts may not be achieved, either because expected sales do not occur or because they occur at lower prices or on terms that are less favorable to us. In addition, these factors increase the chances that our results could diverge from the expectations of investors and analysts. We continue to make substantial changes to our information systems that could disrupt our business. During fiscal 2002, we began implementing Oracle 11i and a new customer relationship management system. We completed the worldwide implementation of Oracle 11i in the September 2002 quarter. The first four phases of the CRM implementation occurred in June 2001, February 2002, June 2002 and November 2002, with the remaining implementation phase scheduled for the first quarter of fiscal 2004. These types of transitions frequently prove disruptive to the underlying business of an enterprise and may cause us to incur higher costs than we anticipate. Failure to manage a smooth transition to the new systems and the ongoing operations and support of the new systems could materially harm our business operations. We must effectively adapt to changes in the dynamic technological environment. We are increasingly focused on the Internet security market, which, in turn is dependent on further acceptance and increased use of the Internet. The following critical issues concerning the use of the Internet remain unresolved and may affect the market for our products and the use of the Internet as a medium to distribute or support our software products and the functionality of some of our products: security; reliability; cost; ease of use; accessibility; quality of service; and potential tax or other government regulations. In addition, new technologies, such as wireless devices, are gaining acceptance. We must adapt to these changing technological demands. If we are unable to timely assimilate changes brought about by the Internet and wireless based environments, our future net revenues and operating results could be adversely affected. The results of our research and development efforts are uncertain. We will need to continue to incur significant research and development expenditures in future periods as we strive to remain competitive. The length of our product development cycle for new products and product enhancements has frequently been greater than we originally expected, and we are likely to experience delays in future product development. In addition, a portion of 31 Table of Contents our development efforts has not been technologically successful and certain products have not achieved market acceptance. As a result, the products we are currently developing or may develop in the future may not be technologically successful, achieve market acceptance or compete effectively with products of our competitors. Product returns may negatively affect our net revenues. Product returns can occur when we introduce upgrades and new versions of products or when distributors or retailers have excess inventories, subject to various contractual limitations. Our return policy allows distributors, subject to these contractual limitations, to return purchased products in exchange for new products or credit towards future purchases. End users may return our products for a full refund within a reasonably short period from the date of purchase. Future returns could exceed the reserves we have established for product returns, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We depend on internal communications systems that may be disrupted. Our order management and product shipping centers are geographically dispersed. A business disruption could occur as a result of natural disasters or the interruption in service by communications carriers. If our communications between these centers are disrupted, particularly at the end of a fiscal quarter, we may suffer an unexpected shortfall in net revenues and a resulting adverse impact on our operating results. Communication outages, Internet connectivity disruptions, and or increased volumes of electronic distribution transactions may also cause delays in customer access to our Internet based services or product sales. We are subject to litigation that could adversely affect our financial results. From time to time, we may be subject to claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, or other product liability claims, or other claims incidental to our business. We are currently involved in a number of lawsuits. We intend to defend all of these lawsuits vigorously. However, it is possible that we could suffer an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these cases. Depending on the amount and timing of any unfavorable resolutions of these lawsuits, our future results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected in a particular period. Although infringement claims may ultimately prove to be without merit, they are expensive to defend and may consume our resources or divert our attention from day to day operations. If a third party alleges that we have infringed their intellectual property rights, we may choose to litigate the claim and or seek an appropriate license from the third party. If we engage in litigation and the third party is found to have a valid patent claim against us and a license is not available on reasonable terms, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. We must attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled management, sales, marketing and technical personnel. To accomplish this, we believe that we must provide personnel with a competitive compensation package, including stock options. Increases in shares available for issuance under our stock options plans require stockholder approval in many cases, and institutional stockholders, or stockholders generally, may not approve future increases. Additionally, the accounting industry has recently determined that corporations will include a compensation expense in their statement of operations relating to the issuance of employee stock options. This will most likely become effective in calendar year 2004. As a result, we may decide to issue fewer stock options and may be impaired in our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel. Conversely, issuing a comparable number of stock options could adversely impact our results of operations. Our intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be adequately protected from all unauthorized uses. We regard our software and underlying technology as proprietary. We seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of confidentiality agreements and copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws. Third parties may copy aspects of our products or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information without authorization or develop similar technology independently. All of our products are protected by copyright laws, and we have a number of patents and patent applications pending. We may not achieve the desired protection from, and third parties may design around, our patents. In addition, existing copyright laws afford limited practical protection. Furthermore, the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection of our proprietary rights as the laws of the United States, and we may be subject to unauthorized use of our products. Any legal action that we may bring to protect proprietary information could be expensive and may distract management from day to day operations. Our inabilities to timely distribute our products and services over the Internet, and security patches and updated virus definitions via our LiveUpdate feature in particular, could adversely affect our business. Our ability to maintain and increase the speed with which we provide services to consumers and to increase the scope of these services is limited by and dependent upon the speed and reliability of the Internet. As we incorporate the 32 Table of Contents LiveUpdate technology into more of our products, we are increasingly reliant on the Internet as a means to distribute our security patches and updated virus definitions to our customers. Accordingly, if we, or our customers, are unable to utilize the Internet due to a failure of technology, infrastructure or other reasons, our ability to provide services may suffer, which could lead to a decrease in revenues. Our products are complex and are operated in a wide variety of computer configurations, which could result in errors or product failures. Because we offer very complex products, undetected errors, failures or bugs may occur when they are first introduced or when new versions are released. Our products often are installed and used in large scale computing environments with different operating systems, system management software and equipment and networking configurations, which may cause errors or failures in our products or may expose undetected errors, failures or bugs in our products. In the past, we have discovered software errors, failures and bugs in certain of our product offerings after their introduction and have experienced delays or lost revenues during the period required to correct these errors. Our customers computer environments are often characterized by a wide variety of standard and non standard configurations that make pre release testing for programming or compatibility errors very difficult and time consuming. Despite testing by us and by others, errors, failures or bugs may not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments. Errors, failures or bugs in products released by us could result in negative publicity, product returns, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products or claims by customers or others. In addition, if an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in one of our end customers security systems, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products, the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed. Because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques. Alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and resources and could cause interruptions, delays or cessation of our product licensing, which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and would adversely affect results of operations. Most of our license agreements with customers contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims. It is possible, however, that these provisions may not prove effective in limiting our liability. Increased utilization and costs of our technical support services may adversely affect our financial results. Like many companies in the software industry, technical support costs comprise a significant portion of our operating costs and expenses. Over the short term, we may be unable to respond to fluctuations in customer demand for support services, including periods of high customer usage in which delays may be experienced. We also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors. Further, customer demand for these services could cause increases in the costs of providing such services and adversely affect our operating results. Over the past year, we have outsourced our North American and European consumer support functions. As such, we are highly dependent on the on going business success of the companies with whom we have contracted to provide these services. If these companies experience financial difficulties, do not maintain sufficiently skilled workers and resources to satisfy our contracts or otherwise fail to perform at a sufficient level under these contracts, the level of support services to our customers may be significantly disrupted, which could materially harm our relationships with these customers. 33 Table of Contents Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in market prices, interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates. We use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks. All financial instruments used are in accordance with our global investment policy and global foreign exchange policy. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. We also hold equity interests in six privately held companies. These investments were recorded at cost, and are classified as other long term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These investments are inherently risky and we could lose our entire initial investment in these companies. As of March 31, 2003, these investments had a carrying value of approximately $10.5 million. INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY We consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. All of our cash equivalents and short term investments are classified as available for sale as of the balance sheet dates. These securities are reported at fair market value and any unrealized gains and losses are included as a component in stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Our cash equivalents and short term investments consist primarily of corporate securities, taxable auction rate securities, US government and government sponsored securities, money market funds and asset backed securities. The following table presents the fair value and hypothetical changes in fair market values of the financial instruments held as of March 31, 2003 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates (in millions): Hypothetical Fair Market Values Given an Interest Rate Increase (Decrease) of X Basis Points (bps) Fair Investment Portfolios Value (75 bps) (25 bps) 50 bps 100 bps 150 bps USD Portfolios $ 762.9 $ 767.1 $ 764.3 $ 760.1 $ 757.3 $ 754.6 EURO Portfolios 653.5 656.3 654.6 650.6 647.9 645.1 CAD Portfolios 188.0 188.4 188.1 187.7 187.4 187.1 The modeling technique used above measures the change in fair market value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of minus 75 basis points, minus 25 basis points, plus 50 basis points, plus 100 basis points and plus 150 basis points, which are representative of the movements in the United States Federal Funds Rate, Euro Area ECB Rate and Canada Overnight Rate. During October 2001, we issued $600.0 million of 3% convertible subordinated notes. The notes pay interest semi annually and mature on November 1, 2006. As of March 31, 2003, we had approximately $600.0 million principal amount of notes outstanding. EXCHANGE RATE SENSITIVITY We conduct business in 30 international currencies through our worldwide operations. We believe that the use of foreign exchange forward contracts should reduce the risks that arise from conducting business in international markets. We hedge risks associated with certain foreign currency cash, investments, receivables and payables in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency fluctuations on these assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Foreign exchange forward contracts as of March 31, 2003 were as follows (in millions): Resulting Increase (Decrease) in FV of Foreign Forward Exchange Contracts Given X% Appreciation (Devaluation) of Foreign Currency Foreign Forward Notional Exchange Contracts Amount 10% 5% (5)% (10)% Purchased $ 0.9 $ 0.1 $ $ $ Sold 66.4 (6.0 ) (3.2 ) 3.5 7.4 We believe that these foreign exchange forward contracts do not subject us to undue risk from the movement of foreign exchange rates because gains and losses on these contracts are offset by losses and gains on the underlying assets and liabilities. All contracts have a maturity of no more than 35 days. Gains and losses are accounted for as other expense, net each period. We regularly review our hedging program and may make changes as a result of this review. 34 Table of Contents
