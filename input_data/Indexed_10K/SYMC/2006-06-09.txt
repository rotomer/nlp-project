Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW We are the world leader in providing a wide range of solutions to help individuals and enterprises assure the security, availability, and integrity of their information technology, or IT, infrastructure as well as the information itself. With innovative technology solutions and services, we help individuals and enterprises protect and manage their digital assets. We provide a wide range of solutions including enterprise and consumer security, data protection, application and infrastructure management, security management, storage and server management, and response and managed security services. Founded in 1982, we have operations in 40 countries worldwide. We have a 52/53 week fiscal accounting year. Accordingly, all references as of and for the periods ended March 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 reflect amounts as of and for the periods ended March 31, 2006, April 1, 2005, and April 2, 2004, respectively. The fiscal accounting years ended March 31, 2006 and April 1, 2005 are each comprised of 52 weeks of operations, while the fiscal accounting year ended April 2, 2004 is comprised of 53 weeks of operations. The fiscal accounting year ending March 30, 2007 will comprise 52 weeks of operations. 30 Table of Contents Veritas Acquisition On July 2, 2005, we completed the acquisition of Veritas Software Corporation, or Veritas, a leading provider of software and services to enable storage and backup, whereby Veritas became a wholly owned subsidiary of Symantec in a transaction accounted for using the purchase method. The total purchase price of $13.2 billion includes Symantec common stock valued at $12.5 billion, assumed stock options and restricted stock units, or RSUs, with a fair value of $699 million, and acquisition related expenses of $39 million. The acquisition of Veritas will enable us to provide enterprise customers with a more effective way to secure and manage their most valuable asset, their information. The combined company offers customers a broad portfolio of leading software and solutions across all tiers of the infrastructure. We believe that this acquisition better positions us to help enable our customers to build a resilient IT infrastructure, manage a complex heterogeneous IT environment, and reduce overall IT risk. In addition, we believe that bringing together the market leading capabilities of Symantec and Veritas improves our ability to continuously optimize performance and help companies recover from disruptions when they occur. As a result of the acquisition, we issued approximately 483 million shares of Symantec common stock, net of treasury stock retained, options to purchase 66 million shares of Symantec common stock, and 425,000 RSUs, based on an exchange ratio of 1.1242 shares of Symantec common stock for each outstanding share of Veritas common stock as of July 2, 2005. The common stock issued had a fair value of $12.5 billion and was valued using the average closing price of our common stock of $25.87 over a range of trading days (December 14, 2004 through December 20, 2004, inclusive) around the announcement date (December 16, 2004) of the transaction. Under the terms of the agreement, we assumed each outstanding option to purchase Veritas common stock with an exercise price equal to or less than $49.00, as well as each additional option required to be assumed by applicable law. Each option assumed was converted into an option to purchase Symantec common stock based upon the exchange ratio. All other options to purchase shares of Veritas common stock not exercised prior to the acquisition were cancelled immediately prior to the acquisition and were not converted or assumed by Symantec. In addition, we assumed all of the Veritas outstanding RSUs and converted them into 425,000 Symantec RSUs, after applying the exchange ratio. The assumed options and RSUs had a fair value of $699 million. In connection with the acquisition, we have recorded $8.6 billion of goodwill, $1.3 billion of acquired product rights, $1.5 billion of other intangible assets, $63 million of deferred stock based compensation, and $2.3 billion of net tangible assets. In addition, we wrote off acquired in process research and development, or IPR&D, of $284 million because the acquired technologies had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses. We also incurred acquisition related expenses of $39 million, which consisted of $32 million for legal and other professional fees and $7 million of restructuring costs for severance, associated benefits, outplacement services, and excess facilities. The acquisition was structured to qualify as a tax free reorganization and we have accounted for it using the purchase method of accounting. The results of Veritas operations have been included in our results of operations beginning on July 2, 2005, and had a significant impact on our revenues, cost of revenues, and operating expenses during fiscal 2006. In connection with the acquisition of Veritas, we assumed Veritas contractual obligations related to its deferred revenue. Veritas deferred revenue was derived from maintenance, consulting, education, and other services. We estimated our obligation related to Veritas deferred revenue using the cost build up approach. The cost build up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs relating to fulfilling the obligation plus a normal profit margin. The sum of the costs and operating profit approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the support obligation. The estimated costs to fulfill the support obligation were based on the historical direct costs related to providing the support. As a result, we recorded an adjustment to reduce the carrying value of deferred revenue by $359 million to $173 million, which represents our estimate of the fair value of the contractual obligations assumed. The Veritas business is included in our Data Protection, Storage and Server Management, and Services segments. 31 Table of Contents Other fiscal 2006 acquisitions During fiscal 2006, in addition to Veritas, we completed acquisitions of five privately held companies and one public company for $627 million in cash, including acquisition related expenses resulting from financial advisory, legal and accounting services, duplicate sites, and severance costs. XtreamLok Pty. Ltd and substantially all of WholeSecurity, Inc. are included in our Consumer Products segment, Sygate Technologies, Inc., the remainder of WholeSecurity, BindView Development Corporation, and IMlogic, Inc. are included in our Enterprise Security Segment, and Relicore, Inc. is included in our Storage and Server Management segment. Our Business Our operating segments are significant strategic business units that offer different products and services, distinguished by customer needs. As of March 31, 2006, we had six operating segments: Consumer Products. Our Consumer Products segment focuses on delivering our Internet security and problem solving products to individual users, home offices, and small businesses. Enterprise Security. Our Enterprise Security segment provides security solutions for all tiers of a network: at the server tier behind the gateway and at the client tier, including desktop personal computers, or PCs, laptops, and handhelds. Data Protection. Our Data Protection segment provides software products designed to protect, backup, archive, and restore data across a broad range of computing environments from large corporate data centers to remote groups and PC clients, such as desktop and laptop computers. Storage and Server Management. Our Storage and Server Management segment provides solutions to simplify and automate the administration of heterogeneous storage and server environments and provide continuous availability of mission critical applications. Services. Our Services segment provides a full range of consulting and educational services to assist our customers in assessing, architecting, implementing, supporting, and maintaining their security, storage, and infrastructure software solutions. Other. Our Other segment is comprised of sunset products and products nearing the end of their life cycle and also includes all indirect costs; general and administrative expenses; amortization of acquired product rights, other intangible assets, and other assets; and charges, such as acquired in process research and development, patent settlement, amortization of deferred compensation, and restructuring, that are not charged to the other operating segments. The expenses of the former Veritas sales force that cannot be allocated to a specific operating segment are also reported in the Other segment. We expect this treatment to continue until we have completed the realignment of our combined sales force. In the quarter ended September 2005, we renamed the Enterprise Administration segment to be the Storage and Server Management segment and added the Data Protection segment. In the quarter ended June 2005, we moved Managed Security Services from the Services segment to the Enterprise Security segment and moved the services related revenue previously included in the Storage and Server Management segment to the Services segment. Net revenues for fiscal 2005 and 2004 have been reclassified to conform to our current presentation. Specifically, we reclassified $31 million and $27 million of Managed Security Services revenue from the Services segment to the Enterprise Security segment, and $5 million and an insignificant amount of services related revenue from the Storage and Server Management segment to the Services segment for fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. Beginning in the June 2006 quarter, we will consolidate our Enterprise Security, Data Protection, and Storage and Server Management segments into two segments the Security and Data Management segment and the Data Center Management segment. 32 Table of Contents Financial Results Our net income was $157 million, $536 million, and $371 million for fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, representing diluted net income per share of $0.15, $0.74, and $0.54, respectively. The decreased profitability in fiscal 2006 is primarily due to the write off of acquired IPR&D and increased amortization of acquired product rights and other intangible assets as a result of the Veritas acquisition, as well as non merger related restructuring charges. In addition, we experienced an increase in operating expenses primarily attributable to the Veritas acquisition, and specifically an increase in employee headcount and related compensation. As of March 31, 2006, employee headcount increased by approximately 148% from March 31, 2005. Approximately 71% of the increase was due to the Veritas acquisition. Fiscal 2006 delivered global revenue growth across all of our geographic regions as compared to fiscal 2005 and 2004. The overall growth is due primarily to the Veritas acquisition and is also partly attributable to increased awareness of Internet related threats around the world. Weakness in most major foreign currencies negatively impacted our international revenue growth by $48 million in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005. We are unable to predict the extent to which revenues in future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If international sales become a greater portion of our total sales in the future, changes in foreign exchange rates may have a potentially greater impact on our revenues and operating results. In the December 2005 quarter, we released our 2006 consumer products and increased subscription pricing for those 2006 consumer products that include content updates. As a result, revenue for the 2006 consumer products that include content updates is recognized on a ratable basis over the term of the license. In addition, beginning in the December 2005 quarter, this revenue is now classified as Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue. Cash flows were strong in fiscal 2006 as we delivered over $1.5 billion in operating cash flow. We ended fiscal 2006 with $2.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments. On April 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 123R, Share Based Payment. We expect the adoption of SFAS No. 123R to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates, which include judgments and assumptions, that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly. Historically, our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results; however, actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions. If actual results differ from these estimates and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Statements of Income, and in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on liquidity and our financial condition. A critical accounting estimate is based on judgments and assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made. Different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in accounting estimates could materially impact the financial statements. We believe that the estimates described below represent our critical accounting estimates, as they have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. We also refer you to our Summary of Significant Accounting Policies beginning on page 74 of this annual report. 33 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software industry. Revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and require us to make many estimates. In arrangements that include multiple elements, including perpetual software licenses and maintenance and or services, and packaged products with content updates, we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value of the undelivered elements, and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue. Our deferred revenue consists primarily of the unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance and consumer product content updates and totaled approximately $2.2 billion as of March 31, 2006, of which $248 million was presented as Long term deferred revenue in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. VSOE of each element is based on the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately. We determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our stand alone sales of these elements to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the undelivered elements. When VSOE does not exist for undelivered items such as maintenance, then the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a products estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of recognized and deferred revenue. For our 2006 consumer products that include content updates, we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the subscription upon sell through to end users. Associated cost of revenues is also recorded ratably. We record as deferred revenue and inventory the respective revenue and cost of revenue amounts of unsold product held by our distributors and resellers. We expect our distributors and resellers to maintain adequate inventory of consumer packaged products to meet future customer demand, which is generally four or six weeks of customer demand based on recent buying trends. We ship product to our distributors and resellers at their request and based on their valid purchase orders. Our distributors and resellers base the quantity of their orders on their estimates to meet future customer demand, which may exceed our expected level of a four or six week supply. We offer limited rights of return if the inventory held by our distributors and resellers is below the expected level of a four or six week supply. We estimate future returns under these limited rights of return in accordance with SFAS, No. 48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists. We typically offer liberal rights of return if inventory held by our distributors and resellers exceeds the expected level. Because we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of excess inventory that will be returned, we primarily offset Deferred revenue against Trade accounts receivable for the amount of revenue in excess of the expected inventory levels. If we made different estimates, material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues and cost of revenues for any period presented. Reserves for product returns We reserve for estimated product returns as an offset to revenue based primarily on historical trends. We fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channels as an offset to revenue. If we made different estimates, material differences could result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented. More or less product may be returned than what was estimated and or the amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what was estimated. These factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make actual results differ from our return estimates. Reserves for rebates We estimate and record reserves for channel and end user rebates as an offset to revenue. For 2006 consumer products that include content updates, rebates are recorded as a ratable offset to revenue over the term of the subscription. Our estimated reserves for channel volume incentive rebates are based on distributors and resellers actual performance against the terms and conditions of volume incentive rebate programs, which are typically entered into quarterly. Our reserves for end user rebates are estimated based on 34 Table of Contents the terms and conditions of the promotional programs, actual sales during the promotion, amount of actual redemptions received, historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program, and the value of the rebate. We also consider current market conditions and economic trends when estimating our reserves for rebates. If we made different estimates, material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented. Business Combinations When we acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to intangible assets. These estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates. At March 31, 2006, goodwill was $10.3 billion, other intangible assets, net were $1.4 billion, and acquired product rights, net were $1.2 billion. We assess the impairment of goodwill within our reporting units annually, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units, which are the same as our operating segments, to its carrying value, including the goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. To determine the reporting units fair values in the current year evaluation, we used the income approach under which we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the estimated discounted future cash flows of that unit. Our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted revenue, operating costs, and other relevant factors. If managements estimates of future operating results change, or if there are changes to other assumptions, the estimate of the fair value of our goodwill could change significantly. Such change could result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods, which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. We assess the impairment of acquired product rights and other identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount. Such impairment loss would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value. Our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted revenue, operating costs, and other relevant factors. If managements estimates of future operating results change, or if there are changes to other assumptions, the estimate of the fair value of our acquired product rights and other identifiable intangible assets could change significantly. Such change could result in impairment charges in future periods, which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. Accounting for Excess Facilities We have estimated expenses for excess facilities related to consolidating, moving, and relocating personnel or sites as a result of restructuring activities and business acquisitions. In determining our estimates, we obtain information from third party leasing agents to calculate anticipated third party sublease income and the vacancy period prior to finding a sub lessee. Market conditions may affect our ability to sublease facilities on terms consistent with our estimates. Our ability to sublease facilities on schedule or to negotiate lease terms resulting in higher or lower sublease income than estimated may affect our accrual for site closures. In addition, differences between estimated and actual related broker commissions, tenant improvements, and related exit costs may increase or decrease our accrual upon final negotiation. If we made different estimates regarding these various components of our excess facilities costs, the amount recorded for any period presented could vary materially from those actually recorded. 35 Table of Contents Income Taxes We are required to estimate our income taxes in each federal, state, and international jurisdiction in which we operate. This process requires that we estimate the current tax exposure as well as assess temporary differences between the accounting and tax treatment of assets and liabilities, including items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes. The income tax effects of the differences we identify are classified as current or long term deferred tax assets and liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our judgments, assumptions, and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Income. We must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income and, based on this assessment, establish a valuation allowance, if required. Our determination of our valuation allowance is based upon a number of assumptions, judgments, and estimates, including forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the valuation allowance in a period, we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease to our tax provision in our Consolidated Statements of Income. We failed to timely file the final pre acquisition tax return for Veritas, and as a result, it is uncertain whether we can claim a lower tax rate on a dividend made from a Veritas foreign subsidiary under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. We are currently petitioning the IRS for relief to allow us to claim the lower rate of tax. Because we were unable to obtain this relief prior to filing the Veritas tax return in May 2006, we have paid $130 million of additional U.S. taxes. The potential outcomes with respect to our payment of this amount include: If we ultimately obtain relief from the IRS on this matter, the $130 million that we paid in May will be refunded to us and we will use that amount to reestablish our income tax accrual for the Veritas transfer pricing disputes. If we ultimately do not receive relief from the IRS on this matter, and we otherwise have an adjustment arising from the Veritas transfer pricing disputes, then we would only owe additional tax with regard to such disputes to the extent that such adjustment is in excess of $130 million. If we ultimately do not receive relief from the IRS on this matter, and we otherwise do not have an adjustment arising from the Veritas transfer pricing disputes, then (1) we would be required to adjust the purchase price of Veritas to reflect a reduction in the amount of pre acquisition tax liabilities assumed; and (2) we would be required to recognize an equal amount of income tax expense, up to $130 million. Legal Contingencies From time to time, we are involved in disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business, and we do not expect this trend to change in the future. We are currently involved in legal proceedings as discussed in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as other legal matters. When the likelihood of the incurrence of costs related to our legal proceedings is probable and management has the ability to estimate such costs, we provide for estimates of external legal fees and any probable losses through charges to our Consolidated Statements of Income. These estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based upon new information and intervening events. Prior to our acquisition of Veritas, Veritas had been in discussions with the staff of the SEC regarding the SECs review of certain matters, as described in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and based on communications with the staff, Veritas expected these discussions to result in a settlement with the SEC in which we would be required to pay a $30 million penalty. As part of our accounting for the 36 Table of Contents acquisition of Veritas, we recorded an accrual related to this matter of $30 million which is included in Other accrued expenses in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2006. In addition, we are involved in other pending legal matters, for which our accrual for legal contingencies represented insignificant amounts related to external legal fees. However, even if we are successful in our pending legal matters, estimated costs for external legal fees could be more than anticipated. In addition, if we are unsuccessful, we could be forced to pay significant damages and licensing fees for which we have not accrued any amounts for loss contingencies, or to modify our business practices. Any such results could materially harm our business and could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Total Net Revenues Year Ended March 31, 2006 2005 2004 ($ in thousands) Net revenues $ 4,143,392 $ 2,582,849 $ 1,870,129 Period over period increase 1,560,543 712,720 60 % 38 % Net revenues increased in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 due primarily to sales of products acquired through the Veritas acquisition, which contributed $1.4 billion of net revenues in fiscal 2006. In addition, revenues from our enterprise security products increased $122 million and revenues from our consumer products increased $73 million in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005. The increased revenues from these products were due primarily to continuing growth in demand for our enterprise virus protection and anti spam solutions as well as our consumer security protection products, as described further in the segment discussions that follow. Beginning in the December 2005 quarter, as a result of increases in future subscription pricing for our 2006 consumer products that include content updates, revenue for these products is recognized on a ratable basis over the term of the subscription. Net revenues increased in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 due primarily to increases of $443 million and $195 million in revenue from our consumer and enterprise security products, respectively. The increased revenue from these products was due primarily to continuing growth in demand for our consumer security protection products and our enterprise virus protection products. We believe that a significant portion of the growth in demand was attributable to the continued increase in vulnerabilities, Internet attacks, and malicious code activity coupled with a growing level of awareness of these threats around the world. Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenues Year Ended March 31, 2006 2005 2004 ($ in thousands) Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenues $ 2,873,211 $ 1,945,310 $ 1,191,257 Percentage of total net revenues 69 % 75 % 64 % Period over period increase $ 927,901 $ 754,053 48 % 63 % Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue includes arrangements for software maintenance and technical support for our products, content and subscription services primarily related to our security products, revenue from arrangements where VSOE of the fair value of undelivered elements does not exist, and managed security services. These arrangements are generally offered to our customers over a specified period of time and we recognize the related revenue ratably over the maintenance, subscription, or service period. Beginning with the release of our 2006 consumer products that include content updates in the December 2005 37 Table of Contents quarter, we recognize revenue related to these products ratably. As a result, this revenue has been classified as Content, subscriptions, and maintenance beginning in the December 2005 quarter. Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue also includes professional services revenue, which consists primarily of the fees we earn related to consulting and educational services. We generally recognize revenue from our professional services as the services are performed or upon written acceptance from customers, if applicable, assuming all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue increased in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 due primarily to sales of products acquired through the Veritas acquisition, which contributed $534 million of Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue in fiscal 2006. In addition, in fiscal 2006, Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue related to our consumer security products increased $233 million as compared to fiscal 2005 due primarily to the classification of $160 million of consumer revenue as Content, subscriptions, and maintenance (rather than Licenses) in fiscal 2006. Revenue related to our enterprise security products increased $133 million, primarily due to increased awareness of information security threats. Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue increased in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 due primarily to increases of $494 million and $224 million in revenue from our consumer and enterprise security products, respectively. The increased sales of these products were due primarily due to increased awareness of information security threats and continuing growth in demand for our consumer security protection products and our enterprise virus protection solutions. Licenses revenue Year Ended March 31, 2006 2005 2004 ($ in thousands) Licenses revenue $ 1,270,181 $ 637,539 $ 678,872 Percentage of total net revenues 31 % 25 % 36 % Period over period increase (decrease) $ 632,642 $ (41,333 ) 99 % (6 )% Licenses revenue increased in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 due primarily to sales of products acquired through the Veritas acquisition, which contributed $835 million of licenses revenue in fiscal 2006. Our 2006 consumer products that include content updates were released in the December 2005 quarter, and we recognize revenue related to these products ratably as Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenues, which resulted in a decrease in Licenses revenue of $160 million in fiscal 2006. Competitive pressures, a lack of recent high profile information security threat activity, and to a lesser extent, a decrease in licensing of our enterprise security products, also partially offset the overall increase in Licenses revenue. Licenses revenue decreased in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 due primarily to a $51 million decrease in consumer products revenue. In fiscal 2005, our consumer products had a higher subscription component than in fiscal 2004, resulting in more revenue being classified as Content, subscriptions, and maintenance in fiscal 2005. Net revenues by segment Consumer Products segment Year Ended March 31, 2006 2005 2004 ($ in thousands) Consumer products revenues $ 1,388,632 $ 1,315,201 $ 871,980 Percentage of total net revenues 34 % 51 % 47 % Period over period increase $ 73,431 $ 443,221 6 % 51 % 38 Table of Contents The increase in Consumer Products revenues in fiscal 2006 was due primarily to an increase of $156 million in revenue from our Norton Internet Security products as compared to fiscal 2005. The majority of the increase in revenue was booked through our electronic distribution channel that includes original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, subscriptions, upgrades, online sales, and renewals. This increase was partially offset by the change in our consumer product revenue recognition model for our 2006 consumer products that include content updates. Beginning in the December 2005 quarter, as a result of increases in future subscription pricing for our 2006 consumer products that include content updates, revenue for these products is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription upon sell through to end users. This change in our product revenue recognition model resulted in a 7% reduction in Consumer Products revenues for fiscal 2006. In addition, revenue from our Norton AntiVirus products decreased $67 million as our customers continue to migrate to the Norton Internet Security products, which offer broader protection to address the rapidly changing threat environment. Revenue from our electronic distribution channel (which includes sales of our Norton Internet Security products and our Norton AntiVirus products) grew by $168 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. We believe that, in addition to the factors noted above, the lower growth rate in our Consumer Products segment was attributable to a changing threat environment and a strengthening U.S. dollar. In addition, during fiscal 2006, pricing for subscriptions increased, while pricing in retail and online stores remained consistent or decreased. We believe that a significant portion of the increase in Consumer Products revenues in fiscal 2005, as compared to fiscal 2004, was attributable to the continued increase in vulnerabilities, Internet attacks, and malicious code activity coupled with a growing level of awareness of these threats around the world. Specifically, the increase in our Consumer Products revenues in fiscal 2005 was due primarily to an increase of $231 million in revenue from our Norton Internet Security products and an increase of $185 million in revenue from our Norton AntiVirus products. Revenue from our electronic distribution channel grew by $297 million in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. Enterprise Security segment Year Ended March 31, 2006 2005 2004 ($ in thousands) Enterprise Security revenues $ 1,080,431 $ 958,627 $ 763,862 Percentage of total net revenues 26 % 37 % 41 % Period over period increase 121,804 194,765 13 % 25 % The increase in our Enterprise Security revenue in fiscal 2006 was due to increased growth from our anti spam products and lower but continued growth from our Enterprise AntiVirus products. Specifically, the increase in our Enterprise Security revenue was due primarily to an increase of $57 million in revenue from our Enterprise AntiVirus products, and an increase of $55 million in revenue from our antispam products during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Revenue from our Enterprise Security segment increased in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 due primarily to an increase of $148 million in revenue from our Enterprise AntiVirus products. In addition, revenue increased due to sales of antispam products formerly associated with Brightmail, which we acquired in June 2004. Data Protection segment The Data Protection segment is comprised of products acquired through the Veritas acquisition. Fiscal 2006 revenue from this segment of $744 million was comprised primarily of revenue related to Backup Exec products and NetBackup products of $336 million and $333 million, respectively. The remaining revenue was comprised of revenue related to Enterprise Vault products. 39 Table of Contents Storage and Server Management segment Year Ended March 31, 2006 2005 2004 ($ in thousands) Storage and Server Management revenues $ 793,783 $ 279,024 $ 218,531 Percentage of total net revenues 19 % 11 % 12 % Period over period increase $ 514,759 $ 60,493 * 28 % * Percentage not meaningful The increase in revenues from our Storage and Server Management segment was due primarily to sales of products acquired through the Veritas acquisition, which contributed $531 million of net revenues during fiscal 2006. This amount was offset slightly by the continued decline in sales of our pcAnywhere product, which we expect to continue to decline in the future. Revenue from our Storage and Server Management segment increased in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 due primarily to revenue from products formerly associated with PowerQuest of $52 million and ON Technology of $29 million, both of which we acquired in the second half of fiscal 2004. These increases were partially offset by a continued decline in sales of our pcAnywhere product. Services segment Year Ended March 31, 2006 2005 2004 ($ in thousands) Services revenues $ 136,625 $ 29,849 $ 15,424 Percentage of total net revenues 3 % 1 % 1 % Period over period increase $ 106,776 $ 14,425 * 94 % * Percentage not meaningful The increase in revenue from our Services segment in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to services related to the Veritas acquisition, which contributed $94 million of net revenues during fiscal 2006. In addition, the increase was due to an increase in our security consulting services of $13 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. The increase in revenue from our Services segment in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was due primarily to an increase of $13 million in revenue from our consulting services. In addition, revenue from our Services segment increased due to our acquisitions in fiscal 2005 of @stake, Inc. and LIRIC Associates. Other segment Our Other segment is comprised of sunset products and products nearing the end of their life cycle. Revenues from the Other segment in fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004 were insignificant. 40 Table of Contents Net revenues by geographic region Year Ended March 31, 2006 2005 2004 ($ in thousands) North America (U.S. and Canada) $ 2,185,945 * $ 1,334,707 ** $ 967,170 *** Percentage of total net revenues 53 % 52 % 52 % Period over period increase $ 851,238 $ 367,537 64 % 38 % EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) $ 1,321,968 $ 842,189 $ 616,504 Percentage of total net revenues 32 % 33 % 33 % Period over period increase $ 479,779 $ 225,685 57 % 37 % Asia Pacific/ Japan $ 563,487 $ 360,342 $ 247,550 Percentage of total net revenues 14 % 14 % 13 % Period over period increase $ 203,145 $ 112,792 56 % 46 % Latin America $ 71,992 $ 45,611 $ 38,905 Percentage of total net revenues 2 % 2 % 2 % Period over period increase $ 26,381 $ 6,706 58 % 17 % Total net revenues $ 4,143,392 $ 2,582,849 $ 1,870,129 * North America includes net revenues from the United States of $2.0 billion and Canada of $140 million during fiscal 2006. ** North America includes net revenues from the United States of $1.2 billion and Canada of $99 million during fiscal 2005. *** North America includes net revenues from the United States of $896 million and Canada of $71 million during fiscal 2004. The increase in net revenues in international regions in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to revenue from products acquired through the Veritas acquisition, which contributed $661 million of net revenues in international regions. Increased sales of our Norton Internet Security products in our Consumer Products segment and our antivirus and antispam products in our Enterprise Security segment also contributed to the increase in net revenue in the international regions in fiscal 2006, while the change to ratable revenue recognition with the release of the 2006 consumer products that include content updates partially offset this increase. Weakness in most major foreign currencies negatively impacted our international revenue growth by $48 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. We are unable to predict the extent to which revenues in future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If international sales become a greater portion of our total sales in the future, changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have a potentially greater impact on our revenues and operating results. The increase in net revenues in international regions in fiscal 2005 was due to increased revenue from our Norton Internet Security and Norton AntiVirus products in our Consumer Products segment and our antivirus products in our Enterprise Security segment in those regions. We believe this increase in sales is attributable to increased customer awareness related to security threats. In addition, strength in major foreign currencies positively impacted our international revenue growth in fiscal 2005 by $74 million as compared to fiscal 2004. The strength in foreign currencies in fiscal 2005 was due primarily to the strength of the Euro. 41 Table of Contents Cost of Revenues Year Ended March 31, 2006 2005 2004 ($ in thousands) Cost of revenues $ 981,869 $ 452,109 $ 327,554 Gross margin 76 % 82 % 82 % Period over period increase $ 529,760 $ 124,555 * 38 % * Percentage not meaningful Cost of revenues consists primarily of amortization of acquired product rights, fee based technical support costs, costs of billable services, payments to OEMs under revenue sharing arrangements, manufacturing and direct material costs, and royalties paid to third parties under technology licensing agreements. Gross margin decreased in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 due primarily to increased amortization of acquired product rights resulting from certain identifiable intangible assets acquired through the Veritas acquisition. Costs for services and technical support also increased in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. These increases were partially offset by ratable recognition of costs for 2006 consumer products that include content updates, which are recognized ratably over the term of the license beginning in the December 2005 quarter. We anticipate that our net revenues from our Services segment may grow to comprise a higher percentage of our total net revenues, which would have a negative impact on our gross margin, as our services typically have higher cost of revenues than our software products. Gross margin remained flat at approximately 82% in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004. Cost of content, subscriptions, and maintenance Year Ended March 31, 2006 2005 2004 ($ in thousands) Cost of content, subscriptions, and maintenance $ 621,636 $ 351,077 $ 220,795 As a % of related revenue 22 % 18 % 19 % Period over period increase $ 270,559 $ 130,282 77 % 59 % Cost of content, subscriptions, and maintenance consists primarily of fee based technical support costs, costs of billable services, and payments to OEMs under revenue sharing agreements. Cost of content, subscriptions, and maintenance increased as a percentage of the related revenue in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 due primarily to sales of products acquired through the Veritas acquisition, which contributed $228 million of additional costs and contributed 43% of the related Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue in fiscal 2006. In addition, costs related to our security services consulting segment and enterprise security products increased $21 million and $13 million, respectively. Cost of content, subscriptions, and maintenance increased in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 due primarily to revenue from our consumer products, which contributed $100 million of additional cost in fiscal 2005. In addition, in fiscal 2005, cost related to our security services consulting segment and our enterprise security products increased $15 million and $11 million, respectively. 42 Table of Contents Cost of licenses Year Ended March 31, 2006 2005 2004 ($ in thousands) Cost of licenses $ 45,943 $ 52,138 $ 65,769 As a % of related revenue 4 % 8 % 10 % Period over period decrease $ (6,195 ) $ (13,631 ) (12 )% (21 )% Cost of licenses consists primarily of royalties paid to third parties under technology licensing agreements and manufacturing and direct material costs. Cost of licenses decreased as a percentage of the related revenue in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 due primarily to lower costs associated with products acquired through the Veritas acquisition. The Veritas acquisition added $13 million of costs, which was offset by a $17 million decrease in consumer products license costs as compared to fiscal 2005. These costs and the associated revenue are reported as Content, subscriptions, and maintenance beginning with the release of our 2006 consumer products that include content updates, as we now recognize the revenue and related costs ratably over the content update period. Cost of licenses decreased in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 due primarily to a $22 million decrease in consumer licenses costs as compared to fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2005, our consumer products had a higher subscription component. Therefore, these costs and the associated revenue are reported as Content, subscriptions, and maintenance. The decrease in licenses costs in fiscal 2005 was partially offset by a $6 million increase in cost related to our storage management products. Amortization of acquired product rights Year Ended March 31, 2006 2005 2004 ($ in thousands) Amortization of acquired product rights $ 314,290 $ 48,894 $ 40,990 Percentage of total net revenues 8 % 2 % 2 % Period over period increase $ 265,396 $ 7,904 * 19 % * Percentage not meaningful Acquired product rights are comprised of developed technologies, revenue related order backlog and contracts, and patents from acquired companies. The increased amortization in fiscal 2006 is primarily associated with the Veritas acquisition, for which amortization began in July 2005. In connection with the Veritas acquisition, we recorded $1.3 billion in acquired product rights which are being amortized over their expected useful lives of three months to five years. We amortize the fair value of all other acquired product rights over their expected useful lives, generally one to eight years. For further discussion of acquired product rights and related amortization, see Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The increased amortization in fiscal 2005, as compared to fiscal 2004, is primarily associated with the Brightmail acquisition in June 2004 and the PowerQuest acquisition in December 2003. This increase was partially offset by certain acquired product rights becoming fully amortized in fiscal 2005. 43 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Sales and marketing expenses Year Ended March 31, 2006 2005 2004 ($ in thousands) Sales and marketing $ 1,486,590 $ 843,724 $ 660,573 Percentage of total net revenues 36 % 33 % 35 % Period over period increase $ 642,866 $ 183,151 76 % 28 % The increase in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was due primarily to the Veritas acquisition, which contributed $579 million in additional sales and marketing expenses. The remaining increase in sales and marketing expenses was due primarily to an increase in employee headcount, resulting in additional employee compensation cost. The increase in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was due primarily to an increase in employee headcount resulting in an additional $118 million of employee compensation cost. In addition, we spent $44 million more on advertising and promotion activities in fiscal 2005 as compared to the prior fiscal year. Research and development expenses Year Ended March 31, 2006 2005 2004 ($ in thousands) Research and development $ 664,628 $ 332,266 $ 252,284 Percentage of total net revenues 16 % 13 % 13 % Period over period increase $ 332,362 $ 79,982 * 32 % * Percentage not meaningful The increase in research and development expenses in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was due primarily to the Veritas acquisition, which contributed $320 million in additional research and development expenses. The increase in research and development expenses in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 resulted primarily from a $34 million increase in employee compensation due to increased headcount. In addition, research and development expenses increased by $26 million due to additional overhead costs related to computer labs and IT infrastructure needed to support overall company growth. The remaining increase was primarily related to increased variable research and development costs due to growth of the company, including new product offerings from business acquisitions. General and administrative expenses Year Ended March 31, 2006 2005 2004 ($ in thousands) General and administrative $ 221,412 $ 115,419 $ 94,645 Percentage of total net revenues 5 % 4 % 5 % Period over period increase $ 105,993 $ 20,774 92 % 22 % The increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was due primarily to the Veritas acquisition, which contributed $81 million in additional general and administrative 44 Table of Contents expenses. The remaining increase in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to an increase in employee headcount, resulting in additional employee compensation cost. The increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 resulted primarily from an increase in employee compensation due to increased headcount. The increased headcount and related compensation was the direct result of company growth, including business acquisitions completed in the second half of fiscal 2004 and the first quarter of fiscal 2005. Amortization of other intangible assets Year Ended March 31, 2006 2005 2004 ($ in thousands) Amortization of other intangible assets $ 148,822 $ 5,416 $ 2,954 Percentage of total net revenues 4 % * * Period over period increase $ 143,406 $ 2,462 * 83 % * Percentage not meaningful Other intangible assets are comprised of customer base, trade names, partnership agreements, and marketing related assets. The increased amortization in fiscal 2006 is primarily associated with the Veritas acquisition, for which amortization began in July 2005. In connection with the Veritas acquisition, we recorded $1.5 billion in other intangible assets which will be amortized over their useful lives of eight to ten years. For further discussion of other intangible assets from acquisitions and related amortization, see Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in amortization of other intangibles in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily associated with the Brightmail acquisition in June 2004, the ON Technology acquisition in February 2004, the PowerQuest acquisition in December 2003, and the @stake, Inc. acquisition in October 2004. Stock based compensation expense Year Ended March 31, 2006 2005 2004 ($ in thousands) Stock based compensation expense: Included in Cost of revenues $ 439 $ $ Sales and marketing $ 13,314 $ 1,298 $ Research and development 17,497 1,780 General and administrative 7,151 1,446 $ 37,962 $ 4,524 $ In connection with the acquisition of Veritas in July 2005, we assumed Veritas stock options and RSUs and converted them into options to purchase 66 million shares of Symantec common stock and 425,000 Symantec RSUs. The fair value of the assumed stock options was $688 million using the Black Scholes valuation model with the following weighted average assumptions: volatility of 36%, risk free interest rate of 3.4%, expected life of 3.5 years, and dividend yield of zero. The fair value of the RSUs was $11 million based on fair value of the underlying shares on the announcement date. The intrinsic value of the unvested options and RSUs was valued at $63 million and was recorded in Deferred stock based compensation within Stockholders equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in the September 2005 quarter. We recorded amortization of Deferred stock based compensation related to the assumed Veritas stock options and RSUs of $27 million in fiscal 2006. 45 Table of Contents In connection with the acquisition of Brightmail in June 2004, we assumed Brightmail stock options and converted them into options to purchase Symantec common stock. The intrinsic value of the assumed unvested stock options was $21 million and was recorded in Deferred stock based compensation within Stockholders equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets during fiscal 2005. During the September 2004 quarter, we reduced Deferred stock based compensation by an insignificant amount as a result of the cancellation of a portion of those options upon employee terminations. We recorded amortization of deferred stock based compensation related to the assumed Brightmail stock options of $8 million in fiscal 2006 and $3 million in fiscal 2005. On October 20, 2004, we issued 200,000 restricted shares of common stock to our then current Chief Financial Officer, at a purchase price of $1,000 (representing the aggregate par value at the time of issuance), vesting 50% at each anniversary date. The market value of the common stock on the date of grant, less the purchase price, was $6 million and was recorded in Deferred stock based compensation within Stockholders equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in fiscal 2005. Upon the retirement of our former Chief Financial Officer in December 2005, 100,000 shares were forfeited and we reversed the related Deferred stock based compensation. We recorded amortization of deferred stock based compensation related to the restricted shares of $2 million in fiscal 2006 and $1 million in fiscal 2005. Acquired in process research and development (IPR&D) Year Ended March 31, 2006 2005 2004 ($ in thousands) Acquired in process research and development $ 285,100 $ 3,480 $ 3,710 During fiscal 2006, we wrote off IPR&D totaling $285 million, of which $284 million was in connection with our acquisition of Veritas. The IPR&D was written off because the acquired technologies had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses. Technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to completion of a beta phase working prototype in which there is no remaining risk relating to the development. At the time of the acquisition in July 2005, Veritas was developing new products in multiple product areas that qualify as IPR&D. These efforts included NetBackup 6.1, Backup Exec 11.0, Server Management 5.0, and various other projects. At the time of the acquisition, it was estimated that these IPR&D development efforts would be completed over the following 12 to 18 months at an estimated total cost of $120 million. At March 31, 2006, the development efforts were continuing on schedule and within expected costs. The value assigned to the Veritas IPR&D was determined by estimating costs to develop the purchased IPR&D into commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects when completed, and discounting the net cash flows to their present values. The revenue estimates used in the net cash flow forecasts were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors, expected trends in technology, and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by Veritas and its competitors. The rate utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present values was based on Veritas weighted average cost of capital. The weighted average cost of capital was adjusted to reflect the difficulties and uncertainties in completing each project and thereby achieving technological feasibility, the percentage of completion of each project, anticipated market acceptance and penetration, market growth rates, and risks related to the impact of potential changes in future target markets. Based on these factors, a discount rate of 13.5% was deemed appropriate for valuing the IPR&D. The estimates used in valuing IPR&D were based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur. In fiscal 2005, we wrote off $3 million of IPR&D in connection with our acquisition of Brightmail. The Brightmail IPR&D related to the third generation of Brightmails antispam product offering. The efforts required to develop the acquired IPR&D principally related to the completion of all planning, design, 46 Table of Contents development, and testing activities that were necessary to establish that the product could be produced to meet its design specifications, including features, functions, and performance. We determined the fair value of the acquired IPR&D by estimating the projected cash flows related to the projects and future revenues to be earned upon commercialization of the products. We discounted the resulting net cash flows to their present values. We based the net cash flows from such projects on our analysis of the respective markets and estimates of revenues and operating profits related to these projects. In fiscal 2004, we wrote off $4 million of IPR&D in connection with our acquisitions of ON Technology, PowerQuest, and Nexland. The in process technology acquired in the ON Technology acquisition consisted primarily of research and development related to its next generation CCM/iCommand and iPatchtm products, which enable organizations and service providers to manage the full lifecycle of their computing systems over corporate networks. We are using this technology in order to construct a common platform for our Storage and Server Management segment products. The in process technology acquired in the PowerQuest acquisition consisted primarily of research and development related to its Virtual Volume Imaging technology, which provides the capability to recover from server or desktop failures and minimize system downtime. We have integrated this technology into our Storage and Server Management segment product offerings. The in process technology acquired in the Nexland acquisition consisted primarily of research and development related to a next generation firewall product. We integrated this technology into our firewall and appliance series of products within our Enterprise Security segment. The efforts required to develop the ON Technology, PowerQuest, and Nexland acquired in process technology principally related to the completion of all planning, design, development, and test activities that were necessary to establish that the product or service can be produced to meet its design specifications including features, functions, and performance. We determined the fair value of the acquired in process technology by estimating the projected cash flows related to these projects and future revenues to be earned upon commercialization of the products. We discounted the resulting net cash flows to their present values. We based the net cash flows from such projects on our analysis of the respective markets and estimates of revenues and operating profits related to these projects. Restructuring Year Ended March 31, 2006 2005 2004 ($ in thousands) Restructuring $ 24,918 $ 2,776 $ 907 As of March 31, 2006, we had a restructuring reserve of $30 million, of which $20 million was included in Other accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $10 million was included in Other long term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The restructuring reserve consists of $9 million related to a restructuring reserve assumed from Veritas in connection with the acquisition, $21 million related to restructuring reserves established in fiscal 2006, and an insignificant amount related to our fiscal 2002 restructuring plan. Restructuring reserves established in fiscal 2006 include $9 million related to our 2006 restructuring plan, $3 million related to restructuring costs as a result of the Veritas acquisition, and $9 million related to restructuring costs as a result of our other acquisitions. Restructuring expense In fiscal 2006, we recorded $25 million of restructuring costs, of which $18 million related to severance, associated benefits, and outplacement services and $7 million related to excess facilities. These restructuring costs reflect the termination of 446 redundant employees located in the United States, Europe, and Asia Pacific and the consolidation of certain facilities in Europe and Asia Pacific. In fiscal 2006, we paid $16 million related to this restructuring reserve. We expect the remainder of the costs to be paid by the end of fiscal 2018. In fiscal 2005, we recorded $3 million of restructuring charges, of which $2 million was for costs of severance, related benefits, and outplacement services related to the termination of 51 employees located in 47 Table of Contents the U.S. and Europe due to the consolidation and relocation of engineering and development functions. In addition we recorded an increase to the accrual relating to the fiscal 2002 restructuring plan of $1 million due to the termination of a sublease agreement for facilities in Eugene, Oregon. Substantially all of the costs had been paid by March 31, 2005. In fiscal 2004, we recorded $1 million of restructuring charges for costs of severance, related benefits, and outplacement services for a member of our senior management team, as well as an increase to the accrual for excess facilities in Eugene, Oregon in connection with our fiscal 2002 restructuring plan. Substantially all of the costs had been paid by March 31, 2005. The fiscal 2002 restructuring reserve consisted of the costs of excess facilities in Europe and Eugene, Oregon, net of sublease income. In fiscal 2006, we paid $2 million upon termination of the remaining leases. Substantially all of the costs had been paid by March 31, 2006. Amounts related to restructuring expense are included in Restructuring in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Acquisition related restructuring In connection with the Veritas acquisition on July 2, 2005, we assumed a restructuring reserve of $53 million related to the 2002 Veritas facilities restructuring plan. From the date of the acquisition through March 31, 2006, we paid $25 million related to this reserve. Also during this period, we reduced this reserve by $19 million as we returned some facilities to use and negotiated early lease terminations on others for amounts less than originally accrued. The remaining reserve amount of $9 million will be paid over the remaining lease terms, ending at various dates through 2022. The majority of the costs are currently scheduled to be paid by the end of fiscal 2011. With regard to the 2002 Veritas facilities restructuring plan, our actual costs have varied and could continue to vary significantly from our current estimates, depending, in part, on the commercial real estate market in the applicable metropolitan areas, our ability to obtain subleases related to these facilities and the time period to do so, the sublease rental market rates, and the outcome of negotiations with lessors regarding terminations of some of the leases. Some of these factors are beyond our control. Adjustments to the 2002 Veritas facilities restructuring plan will be made if actual lease exit costs or sublease income differ materially from amounts currently expected. In connection with the Veritas acquisition on July 2, 2005, we recorded $7 million of restructuring costs, of which $2 million related to excess facilities costs and $5 million related to severance, associated benefits, and outplacement services. These restructuring costs reflect the termination of redundant employees and the consolidation of certain facilities as a result of the Veritas acquisition. In fiscal 2006, we paid $4 million related to this reserve. We expect the remainder of the costs to be paid by the end of fiscal 2012. For information on the acquisition related costs incurred in connection with the Veritas acquisition, see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with our other acquisitions in fiscal 2006, we recorded $12 million of restructuring costs, of which $8 million related to severance, associated benefits, and outplacement services and $4 million related to excess facilities costs. These restructuring costs reflect the termination of redundant employees and the consolidation of certain facilities as a result of our other acquisitions. In fiscal 2006, we paid $3 million in connection with this reserve. We expect the remainder of the costs to be paid by the end of fiscal 2012. Amounts related to acquisition related restructuring are reflected in the purchase price allocation of the applicable acquisition. Integration planning In connection with our acquisition of Veritas, we recorded integration planning costs of $16 million in fiscal 2006 and $3 million in fiscal 2005, which consisted primarily of costs incurred for consulting services and other professional fees. 48 Table of Contents Patent settlement On May 12, 2005, we resolved patent litigation matters with Altiris, Inc. by entering into a cross licensing agreement that resolved all legal claims between the companies. As part of the settlement, we paid Altiris $10 million for use of the disputed technology. Under the transaction, we expensed $2 million of patent settlement costs in the June 2005 quarter that was related to benefits received in and prior to the June 2005 quarter. The remaining $8 million was recorded as Acquired product rights in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is being amortized to Cost of revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the remaining life of the primary patent, which expires in May 2017. On August 6, 2003, we purchased a security technology patent as part of a settlement in Hilgraeve, Inc. v. Symantec Corporation. As part of the settlement, we also received licenses to the remaining patents in Hilgraeves portfolio. The total cost of purchasing the patent and licensing additional patents was $63 million, which was paid in cash in August 2003. Under the transaction, we recorded $14 million of patent settlement costs in the June 2003 quarter that was related to benefits received by us in and prior to the June 2003 quarter. The remaining $49 million was recorded as Acquired product rights in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is being amortized to Cost of revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the remaining life of the primary patent, which expires in June 2011. Non operating Income and Expense Year Ended March 31, 2006 2005 2004 ($ in thousands) Interest and other income, net $ 106,754 $ 51,185 $ 40,254 Interest expense (17,996 ) (12,323 ) (21,164 ) Income, net of expense, from sale of technologies and product lines 9,547 Total $ 88,758 $ 38,862 $ 28,637 Percentage of total net revenues 2 % 2 % 2 % Period over period increase $ 49,896 $ 10,225 * 36 % * Percentage not meaningful The increase in Interest and other income, net in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was due primarily to a higher average investment balance, due to the cash acquired through the Veritas acquisition, and higher average interest rates. The increase in Interest and other income, net in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was due to a higher average investment balance and higher average interest rates. Interest expense in fiscal 2006 was due primarily to the interest and accretion related to the 0.25% convertible subordinated notes that were assumed in connection with the acquisition of Veritas. In August 2003, Veritas issued $520 million of 0.25% convertible subordinated notes due August 1, 2013. For further discussion of the 0.25% convertible subordinated notes, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest expense in fiscal 2005 and 2004 was primarily related to our $600 million 3% convertible subordinated notes issued in October 2001. In November 2004, substantially all of the outstanding convertible subordinated notes were converted into 70.3 million shares of our common stock and the remainder was redeemed for cash. Income, net of expense, from sale of technologies and product lines during fiscal 2004 primarily related to royalty payments received in connection with the licensing of substantially all of the ACT! product line technology. In December 2003, Interact Commerce Corporation purchased this technology from us. 49 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes Year Ended March 31, 2006 2005 2004 ($ in thousands) Tax provision on earnings $ 227,068 $ 267,720 $ 171,603 Effective tax rate on earnings 63 % 31 % 32 % Tax provision on repatriation $ (21,197 ) $ 54,249 $ Total tax provision $ 205,871 $ 321,969 $ 171,603 Total effective tax rate 57 % 38 % 32 % Our effective tax rate on income before taxes was approximately 57%, 38%, and 32% in fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 reflects the impact of the IPR&D charges and other acquisition related charges that are nondeductible for tax reporting purposes, partially offset by foreign earnings taxed at a lower rate than the U.S. tax rate, and the effect of the true up of taxes on repatriated earnings. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2005 reflects the additional tax expense attributable to the $500 million of foreign earnings that we repatriated under the American Jobs Creation Act. We believe realization of substantially all of our deferred tax assets as of March 31, 2006 of $467 million, after application of the valuation allowance, is more likely than not based on the future reversal of temporary tax differences. Realization of approximately $27 million of our deferred tax assets as of March 31, 2006 is dependent upon future taxable earnings exclusive of reversing temporary differences in certain foreign jurisdictions. Levels of future taxable income are subject to the various risks and uncertainties discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, set forth in this annual report. An additional valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets may be necessary if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. We will assess the need for an additional valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. The valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets increased by $59 million in fiscal 2006, of which approximately $58 million is attributable to acquisition related assets, the benefit of which will reduce goodwill when and if realized. The valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets increased by an immaterial amount in fiscal 2005. American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 Repatriation of foreign earnings In the March 2005 quarter, we repatriated $500 million from certain of our foreign subsidiaries that qualified for the 85% dividends received deduction under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, or the Jobs Act, enacted in October 2004. We recorded a tax charge for this repatriation of $54 million in the March 2005 quarter. In May 2005, clarifying language was issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury and the IRS with respect to the treatment of foreign taxes paid on the earnings repatriated under the Jobs Act and in September 2005, additional clarifying language was issued regarding the treatment of certain deductions attributable to the earnings repatriation. As a result of this clarifying language, we reduced the tax expense attributable to the repatriation by approximately $21 million in fiscal 2006, which reduced the cumulative tax charge on the repatriation to $33 million. The $500 million repatriation under the Jobs Act was deemed to be distributed entirely from foreign earnings that had been previously treated as indefinitely reinvested. However, this distribution from previously indefinitely reinvested earnings does not change our position going forward that future earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries will be indefinitely reinvested. Other tax matters On March 29, 2006, we received a Notice of Deficiency from the IRS claiming that we owe additional taxes, plus interest and penalties, for the 2000 and 2001 tax years based on an audit of Veritas, which we acquired in July 2005. The incremental tax liability asserted by the IRS with regard to the Veritas claim is $867 million, excluding penalties and interest. The Notice of Deficiency primarily relates to transfer pricing in connection with a technology license agreement between Veritas and a foreign subsidiary. We do not agree 50 Table of Contents with the IRS position and we intend to file a timely petition to the Tax Court to protest the assessment. No payments will be made on the assessment until the issue is definitively resolved. If, upon resolution, we are required to pay an amount in excess of our provision for this matter, the incremental amounts due would be accounted for principally as additions to the Veritas purchase price as an increase to goodwill. Any incremental interest accrued subsequent to the date of the Veritas acquisition would be recorded as an expense in the period the matter is resolved. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we made $90 million of tax related adjustments to the purchase accounting for Veritas, consisting of $120 million of additional pre acquisition tax reserve related adjustments, partially offset by a $30 million reduction in other pre acquisition taxes payable. While we strongly disagree with the IRS over both its transfer pricing methodologies and the amount of the assessment, we have established additional tax reserves for all Veritas pre acquisition years to account for both contingent tax and interest risk. On March 30, 2006, we received notices of proposed adjustment from the IRS with regard to an unrelated audit of Symantec for fiscal years 2003 and 2004. The IRS claimed that we owed an incremental tax liability with regard to this audit of $110 million, excluding penalties and interest. The incremental tax liability primarily relates to transfer pricing matters between Symantec and a foreign subsidiary. On June 2, 2006, we reached an agreement in principle with the IRS to settle the IRS claims relating to this audit for $36 million, excluding interest. The consolidated financial statements presented in this annual report reflect adequate accruals to address this settlement amount. We anticipate that we will finalize this settlement with the IRS before the end of June 2006. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we increased our tax reserves by an additional $64 million in connection with all open Symantec tax years (fiscal 2003 to 2006). Since these reserves relate to licensing arising from acquired technology, the additional accruals are primarily offset by deferred taxes. We are as yet unable to confirm our eligibility to claim a lower tax rate on a distribution made from a Veritas foreign subsidiary prior to the acquisition. The distribution was intended to be made pursuant to the Jobs Act, and therefore eligible for a 5.25% effective U.S. federal rate of tax, in lieu of the 35% statutory rate. We are seeking a ruling from the IRS on the matter. Because we were unable to obtain this ruling prior to filing the Veritas tax return in May 2006, we have paid $130 million of additional U.S. taxes. Since this payment relates to the taxability of foreign earnings that are otherwise the subject of the IRS assessment, this additional payment reduced the amount of taxes payable accrued as part of the purchase accounting for pre acquisition contingent tax risks. For further information, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Critical Accounting Estimates Income Taxes above. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Year Ended March 31, 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used for): Operating activities $ 1,536,896 $ 1,207,459 $ 902,605 Investing activities 3,619,605 (663,159 ) (795,598 ) Financing activities (3,910,064 ) (31,990 ) 129,154 Effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash and cash equivalents (22,248 ) 18,261 30,095 Net change in cash and cash equivalents 1,224,189 530,571 266,256 As of March 31, 2006, our principal source of liquidity was our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments of $2.9 billion, of which 28% was held domestically and the remainder was held outside of the U.S. The remittance back to the U.S. of cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments held by legal entities domiciled outside of the U.S. may result in significant additional income tax expense. Accordingly, we may choose to enhance our domestic cash position through third party financing arrangements. We recently 51 Table of Contents completed the reorganization of certain international subsidiaries acquired as part of the Veritas acquisition. This reorganization is expected to result in a rebalancing of our cash between the U.S. and foreign operations over the next several years. On July 2, 2005, we completed our acquisition of Veritas and acquired its cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments of approximately $2.9 billion and assumed contingently convertible debt with a principal amount of $520 million due August 1, 2013 and a short term loan with a principal amount of EURO 411 million, which was paid in its entirety on July 7, 2005. The convertible debt may be converted by the holders at any time into 24.37288 shares of Symantec common stock per $1,000 principal amount, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $41.03 per share of Symantec common stock. Upon conversion, we would be required to pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of Symantec common stock ($16.83 per share at March 31, 2006), up to the principal amount of the note. Amounts in excess of the principal amount, if any, may be paid in cash or in stock at Symantecs option. Interest payments of 0.25% per annum on the principal amount are payable semi annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year. On or after August 5, 2006, we have the option to redeem all or a portion of the notes at a redemption price equal to the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. On August 1, 2006 and August 1, 2008, or upon a fundamental change involving Symantec, holders have the right to require us to repurchase the notes at a repurchase price equal to the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The notes are classified as a current liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at March 31, 2006. During fiscal 2006, in addition to Veritas, we completed acquisitions of five privately held companies and one public company for $627 million in cash, including acquisition related expenses resulting from financial advisory, legal and accounting services, duplicate sites, and severance costs. During April 2006, we purchased an office building of approximately 236,000 square feet in Cupertino, California for $81 million. This property is currently leased to a third party. We believe that our cash balances, including those assumed in the acquisition of Veritas, as well as cash that we generate over time from our combined operations and our borrowing capacity, will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2006 resulted largely from net income of $157 million, plus an increase in deferred revenue of $683 million, non cash charges, primarily for depreciation and amortization, of $678 million, and the write off of IPR&D of $285 million related to the acquisitions of Veritas and BindView. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in deferred income taxes of $203 million and by an increase in trade accounts receivable of $87 million. We expect operating cash flow to continue to be positive in the future. Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2005 resulted largely from net income of $536 million, plus non cash depreciation and amortization charges of $132 million, the income tax benefit from employee stock plans of $109 million, and deferred income taxes of $61 million. In addition, our deferred revenue increased by $319 million and income taxes payable increased by $56 million. Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2004 resulted largely from net income of $371 million, plus non cash depreciation and amortization charges of $117 million and the income tax benefit from employee stock plans of $67 million. Deferred revenue increased by $345 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $83 million. In addition, income taxes payable increased by $54 million. Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2006 was primarily the result of net sales of available for sale securities of $3.4 billion and cash of $541 million acquired through the acquisition of Veritas, net of cash expenditures for our other acquisitions in fiscal 2006. These amounts were partially offset by capital expenditures of $267 million, including $63 million for the purchase of two buildings in Mountain View, California. 52 Table of Contents Net cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2005 was primarily the result of payments for business acquisitions of $424 million and net purchases of available for sale securities of $143 million. Net cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2004 was primarily the result of net purchases of available for sale securities of $332 million, payments for business acquisitions of $287 million, and capital expenditures of $111 million. We expect to continue our investing activities, including investments in available for sale securities. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used for strategic acquisitions of software companies or technologies that are complementary to our business. Financing Activities We have operated a stock repurchase program since 2001. On March 28, 2005, the Board of Directors increased the dollar amount of authorized stock repurchases by $3 billion, which became effective upon completion of the Veritas acquisition on July 2, 2005. We commenced repurchases under the $3 billion authorization on August 2, 2005 and as of December 31, 2005 all authorized repurchases, including $474 million from prior authorizations, were completed. On January 31, 2006, the Board, through one of its committees, authorized the repurchase of $1 billion of Symantec common stock, without a scheduled expiration date. In connection with this stock repurchase authorization, we entered into Rule 10b5 1 trading plans intended to facilitate stock repurchases of $125 million per quarter during fiscal 2007. We used $154 million of the authorized amount to repurchase shares in the open market in the March 2006 quarter and we intend to use the remaining amount to make stock repurchases under Rule 10b5 1 trading plans and opportunistically in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2006, we repurchased 174 million shares at prices ranging from $15.83 to $23.85 per share for an aggregate amount of $3.6 billion. In fiscal 2005, we repurchased eight million shares at prices ranging from $21.05 to $30.77 per share for an aggregate amount of $192 million. In fiscal 2004, we repurchased three million shares at prices ranging from $19.52 to $20.82 per share for an aggregate amount of $60 million. As of March 31, 2006, $846 million remained authorized for future repurchases. For further information regarding stock repurchases, see Item 5, Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities of this annual report. In fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, we received net proceeds of $210 million, $160 million, and $189 million, respectively, from the sale of our common stock through employee benefit plans. In fiscal 2006, we repaid the entire balance of a short term loan with a principal amount of EURO 411 million that we assumed in connection with our acquisition of Veritas. Contractual Obligations The contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from these estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments related to the contractual obligations set forth 53 Table of Contents in the table below. The following table summarizes our fixed contractual obligations and commitments as of March 31, 2006: Payments Due In Total Payments Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2012 Due Fiscal 2007 and 2009 and 2011 and thereafter (In thousands) Convertible subordinated notes1 $ 520,000 $ 520,000 $ $ $ Purchase obligations2 32,850 32,850 Operating leases3 386,121 91,339 117,100 66,334 111,348 Total contractual obligations $ 938,971 $ 644,189 $ 117,100 $ 66,334 $ 111,348 1 Convertible subordinated notes, due August 1, 2013, assumed in connection with the Veritas acquisition. On or after August 5, 2006, Symantec has the option to redeem all or a portion of the 0.25% Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. On August 1, 2006 and August 1, 2008, or upon the occurrence of a fundamental change involving Symantec, holders of the 0.25% Notes may require Symantec to repurchase their notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. 2 Represents amounts associated with agreements that are enforceable, legally binding, and specify terms. 3 Includes $22 million related to facilities included in our restructuring reserve. Development agreements In the June 2005 quarter, we entered into agreements in connection with the construction of, or refurbishments to, buildings in Springfield, Oregon and Culver City, California. Payment is contingent upon the achievement of certain agreed upon milestones. The remaining commitment is $147 million as of March 31, 2006 which mainly relates to the construction of the Culver City, California facility. Royalties We have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of underlying revenue and has not been included in the table above. Certain royalty commitments have minimum commitment obligations; however, as of March 31, 2006, all such obligations are immaterial. Indemnification As permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at our request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is not limited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion or all of any future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal. Newly Adopted And Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In February 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments, which amends SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. SFAS No. 155 simplifies the accounting for certain derivatives embedded in other financial instruments by allowing them to be accounted for as a whole if the holder elects to account for the entire instrument on a fair value basis. SFAS No. 155 also clarifies and amends certain other provisions of SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 140. SFAS No. 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired, issued or subject to a remeasurement event occurring in fiscal years beginning 54 Table of Contents after September 15, 2006. Earlier adoption is permitted, provided the company has not yet issued financial statements, including for interim periods, for that fiscal year. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 155 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In June 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position, or FSP, FAS 143 1, Accounting for Electronic Equipment Waste Obligations, which provides guidance on the accounting for certain obligations associated with the Directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment, or the Directive, which was adopted by the European Union, or the EU. Under the Directive, the waste management obligation for historical equipment, defined as products put on the market on or prior to August 13, 2005, remains with the commercial user until the equipment is replaced. FSP FAS 143 1 is required to be applied to the later of the first fiscal period ending after June 8, 2005 or the date of the Directives adoption into law by the applicable EU member countries in which we have significant operations. We are currently evaluating the impact of FSP FAS 143 1 on our financial position and results of operations. The effects will depend on the respective laws adopted by the EU member countries. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, which replaces APB No. 20, Accounting Changes, and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 28. SFAS No. 154 provides guidance on accounting for and reporting changes in accounting principle and error corrections. SFAS No. 154 requires that changes in accounting principle be applied retrospectively to prior period financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. When adopted and if used, SFAS No. 154 would have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment, which requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments at fair value. SFAS No. 123R is effective for annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005 and, thus, will be effective for us beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123R is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options and purchases under employee stock purchase plans, to be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure of fair value recognition will no longer be an alternative. See Stock Based Compensation in Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for information related to the pro forma effects on our reported net income and net income per share when applying the fair value recognition provisions of the previous SFAS No. 123 to stock based employee compensation. On April 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective method. We expect the adoption of SFAS No. 123R to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions. SFAS No. 153 eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph 21(b) of APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions, and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance. SFAS No. 153 specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. SFAS No. 153 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 153 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flow. In December 2004, the FASB issued FSP FAS 109 1, Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The American Jobs Creation Act introduces a special tax deduction on qualified production activities. FSP FAS 109 1 clarifies that this tax deduction should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FSP FAS 109 1 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 55 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in market prices, interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates. We use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks. All financial instruments used are in accordance with our global investment policy and global foreign exchange policy. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. We do not anticipate any material changes in our primary market risk exposures in fiscal 2007. We also hold equity interests in several privately held companies. These investments were recorded at cost, and are classified as Other long term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These investments are inherently risky and we could lose our entire investment in these companies. As of March 31, 2006, these investments had an aggregate carrying value of $11 million. Interest Rate Sensitivity We consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. All of our cash equivalents and short term investments are classified as available for sale securities as of the balance sheet dates. Our available for sale securities are reported at fair market value and any unrealized gains and losses are included as a component of Stockholders equity in Accumulated other comprehensive income in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our cash equivalents and short term investments consist primarily of corporate securities, corporate bonds, asset backed securities, U.S. government and government sponsored securities, and money market funds. The following table presents the fair value and hypothetical changes in fair market values of our significant financial instruments, which primarily consist of commercial paper, corporate debt securities, and government and government backed securities, held as of March 31, 2006 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates (in millions): Hypothetical Fair Market Values Given an Interest Rate Increase (Decrease) of X Basis Points (bps) Fair Value 150 bps 100 bps 50 bps (25 bps) (75 bps) Significant financial instruments $ 1,517,037 $ (11,087 ) $ (7,392 ) $ (3,696 ) $ 1,848 $ 5,544 The modeling technique used above measures the change in fair market value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of minus 75 basis points, minus 25 basis points, plus 50 basis points, plus 100 basis points, and plus 150 basis points, which are representative of potential movements in the United States Federal Funds Rate and the Euro Area ECB Rate. Exchange Rate Sensitivity We conduct business in 36 currencies through our worldwide operations. We believe that the use of foreign exchange forward contracts should reduce the risks that arise from conducting business in international markets. We hedge certain risks associated with certain foreign currency cash and cash equivalents, investments, receivables, and payables in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency fluctuations on these assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Foreign exchange forward contracts as of March 31, 2006 were as follows (in millions): Hypothetical Increase (Decrease) in FV of Foreign Forward Exchange Contracts Given X% Appreciation (Devaluation) of Foreign Currency Notional Foreign Forward Exchange Contracts Amount 10% 5% (5)% (10)% Purchased $ 228 $ 21 $ 11 $ (12 ) $ (25 ) Sold $ 446 $ (41 ) $ (21 ) $ 23 $ 50 56 Table of Contents We believe that these foreign exchange forward contracts do not subject us to undue risk from the movement of foreign exchange rates because gains and losses on these contracts are offset by losses and gains on the underlying assets and liabilities. All contracts have a maturity of no more than 35 days. Gains and losses are accounted for as Interest and other income, net each period. We regularly review our hedging program and may make changes as a result of this review.
