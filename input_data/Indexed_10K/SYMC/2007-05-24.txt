Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW Our Business Symantec is a global leader in infrastructure software, enabling businesses and consumers to have confidence in a connected world. We help our customers protect their infrastructure, information, and interactions by delivering software and services that address risks to information security, availability, compliance, and information technology, or IT, systems performance. We strive to help our customers manage compliance, complexity, and cost by protecting their IT infrastructure as they seek to maximize value from their IT investments. We deliver a comprehensive and diverse set of security and availability products and services to a wide range of customers, including large enterprises, governments, small and medium sized businesses, and consumers. Our delivery network includes direct, inside, and channel sales resources which support our ecosystem of more than 50,000 partners across the world, as well as various relationships with original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, Internet service providers, or ISPs, and retail and online stores. Founded in 1982, we have operations in 40 countries. We have a 52/53 week fiscal accounting year. Accordingly, all references as of and for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 reflect amounts as of and for the periods ended March 30, 2007, March 31, 2006, and April 1, 2005, respectively, each of which consisted of 52 weeks. Our operating segments are significant strategic business units that offer different products and services, distinguished by customer needs. In the June 2006 quarter, we consolidated our Enterprise Security, Data Protection, and Storage and Server Management segments into two segments the Security and Data Management segment and the Data Center Management segment. Amounts for the years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 have been reclassified to conform to our current presentation. As of March 31, 2007, we had five operating segments, descriptions of which are provided in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. On July 2, 2005, we completed the acquisition of Veritas, whereby Veritas became a wholly owned subsidiary of Symantec in a transaction accounted for using the purchase method. The results of Veritas operations have been included in our results of operations beginning on July 2, 2005, and have had a significant impact on our revenues, cost of revenues, and operating expenses since the date of acquisition. On April 6, 2007, we completed our acquisition of Altiris, Inc., a leading provider of IT management software that enables businesses to easily manage and service network based endpoints. The aggregate purchase price, excluding acquisition related costs, was approximately $815 million in cash, which amount was net of Altiris cash balance. We believe this acquisition will enable us to help customers better manage and enforce security policies at the endpoint, identify and protect against threats, and repair and service assets. The Altiris business will constitute a new business segment in fiscal 2008. We will also move our Ghost, pcAnywhere, and LiveState Delivery products from the Security and Data Management segment to the Altiris segment. In addition, we will move our Managed Security Services, DeepSight, and Software As A Service products and services from the Security and Data Management segment to the Services segment. Financial Results and Trends Our net income was $404 million for fiscal 2007 as compared to $157 million and $536 million for fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. The higher net income for fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was primarily due to the write off in fiscal 2006 of $284 million of acquired in process research and development, or IPRD, as a result of the Veritas acquisition for which there is no comparable charge in fiscal 2007. This increase was partially offset by $154 million of stock based compensation expense related to our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 123R, Share Based Payment, effective April 1, 2006, higher employee compensation costs resulting from increased employee headcount, and $70 million of restructuring charges. As of March 31, 2007, employee headcount had increased by approximately 8% from March 31, 2006. During fiscal 2007, we delivered revenue growth across all of our geographic regions as compared to fiscal 2006 and 2005. The overall growth is due primarily to the Veritas acquisition, which was included in our results for 32 Table of Contents the full year in fiscal 2007 as compared to only the nine months subsequent to the acquisition date of July 2, 2005 in fiscal 2006. We believe our revenue growth is also partly attributable to increased awareness of Internet related threats around the world and demand for storage solutions. Weakness in the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies positively impacted our international revenue growth by $105 million in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. We are unable to predict the extent to which revenues in future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If international sales become a greater portion of our total sales in the future, changes in foreign exchange rates may have a potentially greater impact on our revenues and operating results. Although revenue for fiscal 2007 was higher than revenue for fiscal 2006 and 2005, certain portions of our business are maturing and our rate of revenue growth is slowing for several reasons. During fiscal 2007, particularly in the December 2006 and March 2007 quarters, we provided more flexibility in our contract terms and in product deployments and provided more services in combination with licenses, we experienced an increase in the value of multi year arrangements compared to prior periods, particularly within our Data Center Management segment, and we had a large number of maintenance renewals. These changes resulted in a greater percentage of revenue being deferred and recognized over an extended period of time. In addition, in the December 2006 quarter we combined the legacy buying programs of Symantec and Veritas into one buying program for all of our enterprise offerings, which resulted in a change in the vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of pricing for our storage and availability offerings. Additional information regarding factors that we believe impacted net revenue during fiscal 2007 is discussed under Total Net Revenues below. In light of the foregoing factors and our slowing rate of revenue growth, we implemented a cost savings initiative in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 to better align our expenses with our new revenue expectations. The cost savings initiative included a workforce reduction of approximately five percent worldwide. Once these cost reductions are fully implemented, we expect to save approximately $200 million in costs on an annualized basis and to have a lower rate of operating expense growth than in recent periods. The cost savings initiative resulted in a restructuring charge of $51 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. We expect that the cost savings initiative will result in an additional restructuring charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 and potentially in other future periods. We expect our gross margins and operating expenses to be affected in future periods as a result of recent changes in the terms of some of our key OEM relationships. We have negotiated new contract terms with some of our OEM partners, which will result in payments to OEM partners being included as Operating expenses rather than Cost of revenues. In general, payments to OEMs made on a placement fee per unit basis will be treated as Operating expenses, while payments based on a revenue sharing model will be amortized as Cost of revenues. As a result, we expect Cost of revenues to decrease and we expect Operating expenses to increase. The increase in Operating expenses will more than offset the decrease in Cost of revenues because placement fee arrangements are expensed on an estimated average cost basis, while revenue sharing arrangements are amortized ratably over a one year period, and because payments to OEMs have increased. Cash flows were strong in fiscal 2007 as we achieved $1.7 billion in operating cash flow. We ended fiscal 2007 with $3.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments. In addition, during fiscal 2007 we repurchased 162 million shares of our common stock at prices ranging from $15.61 to $21.66 per share for an aggregate amount of $2.8 billion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates, which include judgments and assumptions, that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly. Historically, our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results; however, actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions. If actual results differ from these estimates and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Statements of Income, and in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on liquidity and our financial condition. 33 Table of Contents A critical accounting estimate is based on judgments and assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made. Different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in accounting estimates could materially impact the financial statements. We believe that the estimates described below represent our critical accounting estimates, as they have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. We also refer you to our Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software industry. Primarily, we recognize revenue pursuant to the requirements of Statement of Position, or SOP 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition,, issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and any applicable amendments or modifications. Revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and require us to make many estimates. In arrangements that include multiple elements, including perpetual software licenses and maintenance and or services, and packaged products with content updates, we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on VSOE of the fair value of the undelivered elements, and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue. Our deferred revenue consists primarily of the unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance, consumer product content updates, and arrangements where VSOE does not exist. Deferred revenue totaled approximately $2.8 billion as of March 31, 2007, of which $366 million was presented as Long term deferred revenue in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. VSOE of each element is based on the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately. We determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our stand alone sales of these elements to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the undelivered elements. When VSOE does not exist for undelivered items such as maintenance, then the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, changes to a products estimated life cycle, and increasing flexibility in contractual arrangements could materially impact the amount of recognized and deferred revenue. For our consumer products that include content updates, we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the subscription upon sell through to end users. Associated cost of revenues is also recorded ratably. We record as deferred revenue and inventory the respective revenue and cost of revenue amounts of unsold product held by our distributors and resellers. We expect our distributors and resellers to maintain adequate inventory of consumer packaged products to meet future customer demand, which is generally four or six weeks of customer demand based on recent buying trends. We ship product to our distributors and resellers at their request and based on their valid purchase orders. Our distributors and resellers base the quantity of their orders on their estimates to meet future customer demand, which may exceed our expected level of a four or six week supply. We offer limited rights of return if the inventory held by our distributors and resellers is below the expected level of a four or six week supply. We estimate future returns under these limited rights of return in accordance with SFAS No. 48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists. We typically offer liberal rights of return if inventory held by our distributors and resellers exceeds the expected level. Because we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of excess inventory that will be returned, we primarily offset Deferred revenue against Trade accounts receivable for the amount of revenue in excess of the expected inventory levels. If we made different estimates, material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues and cost of revenues for any period presented. Reserves for product returns We reserve for estimated product returns as an offset to revenue based primarily on historical trends. We fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channels as an offset to deferred revenue. If we made different estimates, material differences could result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented. More or less product may be returned than what was estimated and or the amount of inventory in the channel could 34 Table of Contents be different than what was estimated. These factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make actual results differ from our return estimates. Reserves for rebates We estimate and record reserves for channel and end user rebates as an offset to revenue. For consumer products that include content updates, rebates are recorded as a ratable offset to revenue over the term of the subscription. Our estimated reserves for channel volume incentive rebates are based on distributors and resellers actual performance against the terms and conditions of volume incentive rebate programs, which are typically entered into quarterly. Our reserves for end user rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the promotional programs, actual sales during the promotion, amount of actual redemptions received, historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program, and the value of the rebate. We also consider current market conditions and economic trends when estimating our reserves for rebates. If we made different estimates, material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented. Business Combinations When we acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to intangible assets. These estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates. At March 31, 2007, Goodwill was $10.3 billion, Other intangible assets, net were $1.2 billion, and Acquired product rights, net were $910 million. We assess goodwill for impairment within our reporting units annually or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units, which are the same as our operating segments, to its carrying value, including the goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. To determine the reporting units fair value in the current year evaluation, we used the income approach under which we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the estimated discounted future cash flows of that unit. Our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted revenue, operating costs, and other relevant factors. If managements estimates of future operating results change, or if there are changes to other assumptions, the estimate of the fair value of our goodwill could change significantly. Such change could result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods, which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. We assess the impairment of acquired product rights and other identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount. Such impairment loss would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value. Our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted revenue, operating costs, and other relevant factors. If managements estimates of future operating results change, or if there are changes to other assumptions, the estimate of the fair value of our acquired product rights and other identifiable intangible assets could change significantly. Such change could result in impairment charges in future periods, which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. Accounting for Excess Facilities We have estimated expenses for excess facilities related to consolidating, moving, and relocating personnel or sites as a result of restructuring activities and business acquisitions. In determining our estimates, we obtain information from third party leasing agents to calculate anticipated third party sublease income and the vacancy 35 Table of Contents period prior to finding a sub lessee. Market conditions may affect our ability to sublease facilities on terms consistent with our estimates. Our ability to sublease facilities on schedule or to negotiate lease terms resulting in higher or lower sublease income than estimated may affect our accrual for site closures. In addition, differences between estimated and actual related broker commissions, tenant improvements, and related exit costs may increase or decrease our accrual upon final negotiation. If we made different estimates regarding these various components of our excess facilities costs, the amount recorded for any period presented could vary materially from those actually recorded. Stock based Compensation Effective April 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of, and accounted for stock based compensation in accordance with, SFAS No. 123R. Under SFAS No. 123R, we must measure the fair value of all stock based awards, including stock options, restricted stock units, or RSUs, and purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, on the date of grant and amortize the fair value of the award over the requisite service period. We elected the modified prospective application method, under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes. The valuation provisions of SFAS No. 123R apply to new awards and to awards that were outstanding as of the effective date and are subsequently modified. For stock based awards granted on or after April 1, 2006, we recognize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. We also recognize estimated compensation expense for the unvested portion of awards that were outstanding as of the effective date on a straight line basis over the remaining service period using the compensation costs estimated for the SFAS No. 123 pro forma disclosures. We currently use the Black Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The determination of the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk free interest rates, and expected dividends. We estimate the expected life of options granted based on an analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and post vesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the option. Expected volatility is based on the average of historical volatility for the period commensurate with the expected life of the option and the implied volatility of traded options. The risk free interest rate is equal to the U.S. Treasury constant maturity rates for the period equal to the expected life. We do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, our expected dividend yield is zero. We are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We estimate forfeitures of options, RSUs, and ESPP purchase rights at the time of grant based on historical experience and record compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. All stock based awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods. If factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model, the amount of such expense recorded in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period. The Black Scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable, characteristics not present in our option grants. Existing valuation models, including the Black Scholes and lattice binomial models, may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation. Consequently, there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise, expiration, early termination, or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future. Certain stock based payments, such as employee stock options, may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements. Alternatively, value may be realized from these instruments that is significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements. 36 Table of Contents The application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time. There are significant differences among valuation models, and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future. This may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based payments. It may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models, methods, and assumptions. Stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options, RSUs, and employee stock purchases recognized under SFAS No. 123R for the year ended March 31, 2007 was $154 million. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding SFAS No. 123R disclosures. Income Taxes We are required to compute our income taxes in each federal, state, and international jurisdiction in which we operate. This process requires that we estimate the current tax exposure as well as assess temporary differences between the accounting and tax treatment of assets and liabilities, including items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes. The income tax effects of the differences we identify are classified as current or long term deferred tax assets and liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our judgments, assumptions, and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Income. We must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income and, based on this assessment, establish a valuation allowance, if required. Our determination of our valuation allowance is based upon a number of assumptions, judgments, and estimates, including forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the valuation allowance in a period, we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease to our tax provision in our Consolidated Statements of Income, or to goodwill to the extent that the valuation allowance related to tax attributes of the acquired entities. We failed to file in a timely fashion the final pre acquisition tax return for Veritas, and as a result, it is uncertain whether we can claim a lower tax rate on a dividend made from a Veritas foreign subsidiary under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. We are currently petitioning the IRS for relief to allow us to claim the lower rate of tax. Because we were unable to obtain this relief prior to filing the Veritas tax return in May 2006, we have paid $130 million of additional U.S. taxes. The potential outcomes with respect to our payment of this amount include: If we ultimately obtain relief from the IRS on this matter, the $130 million that we paid in May 2006 will be refunded to us and we will use that amount to increase our income tax accrual for the Veritas transfer pricing disputes. For more information see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. If we ultimately do not receive relief from the IRS on this matter, and we otherwise have an adjustment arising from the Veritas transfer pricing disputes, then we would only owe additional tax with regard to such disputes to the extent that such adjustment is in excess of $130 million. If we ultimately do not receive relief from the IRS on this matter, and we otherwise do not have an adjustment arising from the Veritas transfer pricing disputes, then (1) we would be required to adjust the purchase price of Veritas to reflect a reduction in the amount of pre acquisition tax liabilities assumed; and (2) we would be required to recognize an equal amount of income tax expense, up to $130 million. In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Interpretation No., or FIN, 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of SFAS No. 109. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. See Newly Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements under Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report for further discussion. 37 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Total Net Revenues Year Ended March 31, 2007 2006 2005 ($ in thousands) Net revenues $ 5,199,366 $ 4,143,392 $ 2,582,849 Period over period increase 1,055,974 1,560,543 25 % 60 % We were required under purchase accounting rules to reduce the amount of Veritas deferred revenue that we recorded in connection with our July 2005 acquisition of Veritas to an amount equal to the fair value of our contractual obligation related to that deferred revenue. A portion of the increase in revenue related to storage and availability products and services in fiscal 2007 is due to the fact that the amount of revenue recognized in fiscal 2006 was lower as a result of the purchase accounting adjustment relating to deferred revenue. A majority of the increase in such revenue in fiscal 2006 is due to the fact that we had no such comparable revenue in fiscal 2005 for those storage and availability products and services obtained through our acquisition of Veritas. Unless otherwise specified, storage and availability products and services include products and services obtained through our acquisition of Veritas, and complementary products and services obtained or developed subsequent to such acquisition. Several factors have contributed to increased deferred revenue and lower current period revenue in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2007, we began negotiating more transactions that commit customers to multi year periods, offer more flexibility in contractual terms and in product deployments, and provide more services in combination with license and maintenance sales. In the December 2006 quarter, we combined our buying programs for all of our enterprise offerings to provide our customers and partners a single vendor relationship and simplify the way we do business. Previously, our storage and availability products and services were sold under Veritas pre merger buying programs, while our security products and services were sold under our historical buying programs. These factors have resulted in, and will continue to result in, lower near term recognized revenue growth rates. For example, an increase in multi year contracts results in a higher level of revenue attributable to content and or maintenance included in those transactions, which resulted in a larger portion of our revenues being recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement and a smaller portion being recognized in the current period. More flexibility in contractual terms, such as installment payments, increases our deferred revenue as such flexibility may result in ratable recognition or recognition on a due and payable basis. Our customers have also requested increased flexibility in product deployments in site license arrangements. This may result in an increase in deferred revenue and classification of all revenues associated with the specific contract as Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue, which is recognized over time, as VSOE may not exist in certain types of flexible deployment contracts. As a result of our initiative to offer customers a more comprehensive solution to protect and manage a global IT infrastructure, we expect to see an increasing amount of services sold in conjunction with license and maintenance contracts. Inclusion of such services often results in increased deferred revenue and increased classification of revenues as Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue, as VSOE may not exist for some of the services provided. The combination of buying programs resulted in a change in the VSOE for some of our storage and availability products and services. This change, coupled with increased maintenance renewals sold with a license component, resulted in a larger portion of revenues associated with contracts being classified as Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue, which is subject to deferral, instead of Licenses revenue, which is generally recognized immediately. Net revenues increased in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to the inclusion of the storage and availability products and services that were obtained through our acquisition of Veritas for the full twelve months in the 2007 period compared to nine months in the 2006 period. These products and services contributed $518 million of net revenues in the June 2006 quarter for which there was no comparable revenue in the June 2005 quarter. In addition, the purchase accounting adjustment contributed $271 million (cumulatively) in the September 2006, December 2006, and March 2007 quarters as compared to the comparable quarters of the prior year. The 38 Table of Contents remainder of the revenue increase is due to increases in our consumer products revenue and services offerings of $181 million and $83 million, respectively, due to continued growth in demand. The segment discussions that follow further describe the revenue increases. These increases are partially offset by the effects of the increased flexibility in contract terms and the combination of our buying programs discussed above. Net revenues increased in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 primarily due to the inclusion of the storage and availability products and services obtained through our acquisition of Veritas. These products and services contributed $1.4 billion of net revenues in fiscal 2006 for which there was no comparable revenue in fiscal 2005. In addition, revenues from our enterprise security products increased $122 million and revenues from our consumer products increased $67 million in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005. The increased revenues from these products were due primarily to continued growth in demand for our enterprise virus protection and anti spam solutions as well as our consumer security protection products, as described further in the segment discussions that follow. Beginning in the December 2005 quarter, as a result of increases in future subscription pricing for our 2006 consumer products that include content updates, revenue for these products is recognized on a ratable basis over the term of the subscription. Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenues Year Ended March 31, 2007 2006 2005 ($ in thousands) Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenues $ 3,917,572 $ 2,873,211 $ 1,945,310 Percentage of total net revenues 75 % 69 % 75 % Period over period increase $ 1,044,361 $ 927,901 36 % 48 % Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue includes arrangements for software maintenance and technical support for our products, content and subscription services primarily related to our security products, revenue from arrangements where VSOE of the fair value of undelivered elements does not exist, and managed security services. These arrangements are generally offered to our customers over a specified period of time and we recognize the related revenue ratably over the maintenance, subscription, or service period. Beginning with the release of our 2006 consumer products that include content updates in the December 2005 quarter, we recognize revenue related to these products ratably. As a result, this revenue has been classified as Content, subscriptions, and maintenance beginning in the December 2005 quarter. In addition, as noted above, increased flexibility in contract terms and the combination of our buying programs in the December 2006 quarter have impacted revenue recognition. These changes caused a larger portion of revenue associated with contracts to be classified as Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue, which is subject to deferral, instead of Licenses revenue, which is generally recognized immediately, as discussed above in Total Net Revenues. Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue also includes professional services revenue, which consists primarily of the fees we earn related to consulting and educational services. We generally recognize revenue from our professional services as the services are performed or upon written acceptance from customers, if applicable, assuming all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenues increased in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to the inclusion of the storage and availability products and services obtained through our acquisition of Veritas for the full twelve months in the 2007 period compared to nine months in the 2006 period. These products and services contributed $250 million of Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenues in the June 2006 quarter for which there was no comparable revenue in the June 2005 quarter. In addition, in fiscal 2007, Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue related to our enterprise products increased $271 million due to the fact that the amount of revenue recognized in the comparable 2006 period was lower as a result of the purchase accounting adjustment discussed under Total Net Revenues above. Revenue related to our consumer products increased $179 million as compared to the 2006 period due primarily to growth in Norton Internet Security products and online revenues due to growth in the use of the Internet, and increased awareness and sophistication of security threats. Enterprise products and services, excluding Veritas related products and services, increased $309 million as 39 Table of Contents a result of growth in our maintenance renewals due to an increasing installed base, increased demand for our service offerings, other acquisitions, and the combination of our buying programs implemented in the December 2006 quarter, which impacted VSOE methodology and classification of Licenses revenue and Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue, as discussed above under Total Net Revenues. Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenues increased in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 primarily due to the inclusion of the storage and availability products and services obtained through our acquisition of Veritas. These product and services contributed $534 million of Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenues in fiscal 2006 for which there was no comparable revenue in fiscal 2005. In addition, in fiscal 2006, Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenues related to our consumer security products increased $233 million as compared to fiscal 2005 due primarily to the classification of $160 million of consumer revenue as Content, subscriptions, and maintenance (rather than Licenses) in fiscal 2006 as a result of recognizing revenue from sales of consumer products that include content updates ratably beginning in the December 2005 quarter as discussed above. Revenue related to our enterprise security products increased $133 million, primarily due to increased awareness of information security threats. Licenses revenue Year Ended March 31, 2007 2006 2005 ($ in thousands) Licenses revenue $ 1,281,794 $ 1,270,181 $ 637,539 Percentage of total net revenues 25 % 31 % 25 % Period over period increase (decrease) $ 11,613 $ 632,642 1 % 99 % Licenses revenue increased in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to the inclusion of the storage and availability products obtained through our acquisition of Veritas for the full twelve months in the 2007 period compared to nine months in the 2006 period. These products contributed $268 million of Licenses revenues in the June 2006 quarter for which there was no comparable revenue in the June 2006 quarter. Excluding this June 2006 contribution, License revenues were down significantly in both Security and Data Management and Data Center Management segments as a result of the increased flexibility in contract terms and the combination of our buying programs implemented in the December 2006 quarter, both of which caused a larger portion of contracts to be classified as Content, subscriptions, and maintenance, which is subject to deferral, instead of Licenses revenue, which is generally recognized immediately, as discussed above in Total Net Revenues. Licenses revenue increased in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 primarily due to the inclusion of the storage and availability products obtained through our acquisition of Veritas. These products contributed $835 million of Licenses revenue in fiscal 2006 for which there was no comparable revenue in fiscal 2005. Our 2006 consumer products that include content updates were released in the December 2005 quarter, and we recognize revenue related to these products ratably as Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenues, which resulted in a decrease in Licenses revenue of $160 million in fiscal 2006. Competitive pressures, a lack of high profile information security threat activity during fiscal 2006, and to a lesser extent, a decrease in licensing of our enterprise security products, also partially offset the overall increase in Licenses revenue. Net revenues by segment Consumer Products segment Year Ended March 31, 2007 2006 2005 ($ in thousands) Consumer products revenues $ 1,590,529 $ 1,409,582 $ 1,343,059 Percentage of total net revenues 30 % 34 % 52 % Period over period increase $ 180,947 $ 66,523 13 % 5 % 40 Table of Contents Consumer Products revenues increased in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to an increase of $293 million in revenue from our Norton Internet Security products. This increase was partially offset by aggregate decreases in revenue from our Norton AntiVirus and Norton System Workstm products of $100 million. These decreases resulted from our customers continued migration to the Norton Internet Security products, which offer broader protection to address the rapidly changing threat environment. Our electronic orders include OEM subscriptions, upgrades, online sales, and renewals. Revenue from electronic orders (which includes sales of our Norton Internet Security products and our Norton AntiVirus products) grew by $221 million in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. Consumer Products revenues increased in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 primarily due to an increase of $156 million in revenue from our Norton Internet Security products. The majority of the increase in revenue was booked through electronic orders. This increase was partially offset by the change in our consumer product revenue recognition model for our 2006 consumer products that include content updates. Beginning in the December 2005 quarter, as a result of increases in future subscription pricing for our 2006 consumer products that include content updates, revenue for these products is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription upon sell through to end users. This change in our product revenue recognition model resulted in a 7% reduction in Consumer Products revenues for fiscal 2006. In addition, revenue from our Norton AntiVirus products decreased $67 million as our customers migrated to the Norton Internet Security products. Revenue from our electronic distribution channel grew by $168 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. We believe that, in addition to the factors noted above, the lower growth rate in our Consumer Products segment was attributable to a reduced threat environment in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005. In addition, during fiscal 2006, pricing for subscriptions increased while pricing in retail and online stores remained consistent or decreased. Security and Data Management Segment Year Ended March 31, 2007 2006 2005 ($ in thousands) Security and Data Management revenues $ 2,004,690 $ 1,720,646 $ 1,199,406 Percentage of total net revenues 39 % 41 % 46 % Period over period increase 284,044 521,240 17 % 43 % Security and Data Management revenues increased in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to the inclusion of the storage and availability products obtained through our acquisition of Veritas for the full twelve months in the 2007 period compared to nine months in the 2006 period. These products contributed $151 million of Security and Data Management revenue in the June 2006 quarter for which there was no comparable revenue in the June 2005 quarter. In addition the purchase accounting adjustment, discussed under Total Net Revenues above, contributed $88 million (cumulatively) in the September 2006, December 2006, and March 2007 quarters as compared to the comparable quarters of the prior year. In addition, revenues increased $40 million in fiscal 2007 as a result of acquisitions, excluding Veritas, for which there was not a full twelve months of revenue or no comparable revenue in fiscal 2006. Security and Data Management revenues increased in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 primarily due to the inclusion of the storage and availability products obtained through our acquisition of Veritas. These products contributed $410 million of Security and Data Management revenues during fiscal 2006 for which there was no comparable revenue in fiscal 2005. In addition, revenue increased $110 million as a result of growth from our enterprise security products. 41 Table of Contents Data Center Management Segment Year Ended March 31, 2007 2006 2005 ($ in thousands) Data Center Management revenues $ 1,369,287 $ 861,046 $ Percentage of total net revenues 26 % 21 % * % Period over period increase $ 508,241 $ 861,046 59 % * % * Percentage not meaningful The Data Center Management segment is comprised of storage and availability products. The increase in Data Center Management revenue in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was primarily due to the inclusion of storage and availability products obtained through our acquisition of Veritas for the full twelve month period compared to nine months in the fiscal 2006 period. These products contributed $339 million of Data Center Management revenue in the June 2006 quarter for which there was no comparable revenue in the June 2005 quarter. The effect of the purchase accounting adjustment discussed under Total Net Revenues above also contributed $173 million to the increase in revenue in fiscal 2007. Excluding the effects of the aforementioned items, revenue in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was relatively flat due to the combination of the buying programs for all of our enterprise offerings in the December 2006 quarter. This combination resulted in lower recognized revenue and increased deferred revenue as discussed under Total Net Revenues above. In fiscal 2006, the Data Center Management segment was solely comprised of the storage and availability products obtained through our acquisition of Veritas. Revenue from our Data Center Management segment was $861 million in fiscal 2006 and was comprised primarily of revenue related to Storage Foundation and Server Foundation product families and NetBackup products of $501 million and $332 million, respectively. Services Segment Year Ended March 31, 2007 2006 2005 ($ in thousands) Services revenues $ 234,738 $ 152,091 $ 40,261 Percentage of total net revenues 5 % 4 % 2 % Period over period increase $ 82,647 $ 111,830 54 % * % * Percentage not meaningful Revenue from our Services segment increased in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 due to a $58 million increase in security consulting services and the inclusion of the storage and availability services obtained through our acquisition of Veritas for the full twelve months in the 2007 period compared to nine months in the 2006 period. These acquired services offerings contributed $28 million of Services revenues in the June 2006 quarter for which there was no comparable revenue in the June 2005 quarter. The increase in revenue from our Services segment in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to the inclusion of the storage and availability services obtained through our acquisition of Veritas. These services contributed $94 million of services revenues during fiscal 2006 for which there was no comparable revenue in fiscal 2005. In addition, the increase was due to an increase in our security consulting services of $13 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Other segment Our Other segment is comprised primarily of sunset products and products nearing the end of their life cycle. Revenues from the Other segment during fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005 were insignificant. 42 Table of Contents Net revenues by geographic region Year Ended March 31, 2007 2006 2005 ($ in thousands) North America (U.S. and Canada) $ 2,736,558 * $ 2,185,945 ** $ 1,334,707 *** Percentage of total net revenues 53 % 53 % 52 % Period over period increase $ 550,613 $ 851,238 25 % 64 % EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) $ 1,644,177 $ 1,321,968 $ 842,189 Percentage of total net revenues 31 % 32 % 33 % Period over period increase $ 322,209 $ 479,779 24 % 57 % Asia Pacific/Japan $ 714,617 $ 563,487 $ 360,342 Percentage of total net revenues 14 % 13 % 14 % Period over period increase $ 151,130 $ 203,145 27 % 56 % Latin America $ 104,014 $ 71,992 $ 45,611 Percentage of total net revenues 2 % 2 % 2 % Period over period increase $ 32,022 $ 26,381 44 % 58 % Total net revenues $ 5,199,366 $ 4,143,392 $ 2,582,849 * North America includes net revenues from the United States of $2.6 billion and Canada of $176 million during fiscal 2007. ** North America includes net revenues from the United States of $2.0 billion and Canada of $140 million during fiscal 2006. *** North America includes net revenues from the United States of $1.2 billion and Canada of $99 million during fiscal 2005. International revenues increased in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to the inclusion of the storage and availability products and services obtained through our acquisition of Veritas for the full twelve months in the 2007 period compared to nine months in the 2006 period. These products and services contributed $240 million of international revenues in the June 2006 quarter for which there was no comparable revenue in the June 2005 quarter. In North America, these products contributed $277 million in the June 2006 quarter for which there was no comparable revenue in the June 2005 quarter. In addition, a portion of the revenue increase in fiscal 2007 is due to the fact that the amount of revenue recognized in the comparable 2006 period was lower as a result of the purchase accounting adjustment discussed under Total Net Revenues above. The purchase accounting adjustment increased fiscal 2007 revenues by $186 million in North America and $85 million in the international regions compared to fiscal 2006. Growth in our Consumer Products segment, driven by Norton Internet Security, resulted in a $137 million increase in the international regions and a $44 million increase in North America in fiscal 2007 revenues versus fiscal 2006. Both domestic and international revenue from enterprise offerings were negatively impacted primarily due to the increased flexibility in our contract terms and the combination of our buying programs. These changes resulted in a larger portion of contracts being subject to deferral and a correspondingly lower amount of revenue recognized in the current period, as discussed in Total Net Revenues above. Foreign currencies had a favorable impact on net revenues of $105 million in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. International revenues increased in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 primarily due to the inclusion of the storage and availability products and services obtained through our acquisition of Veritas. These product and services contributed $661 million of international revenues for which there was no comparable revenue in fiscal 2005. Increased sales of our Norton Internet Security products in our Consumer Products segment and our antivirus 43 Table of Contents and antispam products in our Security and Data Management segment also contributed to the increase in net revenue in the international regions in fiscal 2006, while the change to ratable revenue recognition with the release of the 2006 consumer products that include content updates partially offset this increase. Weakness in most major foreign currencies negatively impacted our international revenue growth by $48 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. We are unable to predict the extent to which revenues in future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If international sales become a greater portion of our total sales in the future, changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have a potentially greater impact on our revenues and operating results. Cost of Revenues Year Ended March 31, 2007 2006 2005 ($ in thousands) Cost of revenues 1,215,826 $ 981,869 $ 452,109 Gross margin 77 % 76 % 82 % Period over period increase 233,957 $ 529,760 24 % * * Percentage not meaningful Cost of revenues consists primarily of amortization of acquired product rights, fee based technical support costs, costs of billable services, payments to OEMs under revenue sharing arrangements, manufacturing and direct material costs, and royalties paid to third parties under technology licensing agreements. Gross margin increased in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 due primarily to higher revenues more than offsetting year over year increases in services and technical support costs. We anticipate that our net revenues from our Services segment may grow to comprise a higher percentage of our total net revenues, which would have a negative impact on our gross margin, as our services typically have a higher cost of revenues than our software products. Gross margin was also impacted as the terms of several of our OEM arrangements changed from revenue sharing arrangements to placement fee arrangements during fiscal 2007. Placement fee arrangements are expensed on an estimated average cost basis, while revenue sharing arrangements are amortized ratably over a one year period. Gross margin decreased in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 due primarily to increased amortization of acquired product rights resulting from certain identifiable intangible assets acquired through the Veritas acquisition. Costs for services and technical support also increased in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. These increases were partially offset by ratable recognition of costs for 2006 consumer products that include content updates, which are recognized ratably over the term of the license beginning in the December 2005 quarter. Cost of content, subscriptions, and maintenance Year Ended March 31, 2007 2006 2005 ($ in thousands) Cost of content, subscriptions, and maintenance $ 823,525 $ 621,636 $ 351,077 As a % of related revenue 21 % 22 % 18 % Period over period increase $ 201,889 $ 270,559 32 % 77 % Cost of content, subscriptions, and maintenance consists primarily of fee based technical support costs, costs of billable services, and payments to OEMs under revenue sharing agreements. Cost of content, subscriptions, and maintenance remained relatively constant as a percentage of the related revenue in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. The year over year increase in costs is primarily driven by sales of products acquired through the Veritas acquisition, which contributed $98 million of incremental costs in fiscal 2007 44 Table of Contents relative to fiscal 2006 and contributed 28% of the related Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue in fiscal 2007. In addition, costs related to our security services consulting and consumer products increased $34 million and $37 million, respectively. We expect our gross margin and operating expenses to be affected in future periods as a result of recent changes in the terms of some of our key OEM relationships. We have negotiated new contract terms with some of our OEM partners which will have the effect of moving our OEM payments from Cost of revenues to Operating expenses. Our past OEM payments were primarily revenue sharing arrangements, which were amortized to Cost of revenues over a one year period. Several of the arrangements negotiated in late fiscal 2007 are placement fee arrangements, for which the costs are expensed on an estimated average cost basis. Cost of content, subscriptions, and maintenance increased as a percentage of the related revenue in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 due primarily to sales of products acquired through the Veritas acquisition, which contributed $228 million of additional costs and contributed 43% of the related Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue in fiscal 2006. In addition, costs related to our security services consulting segment and enterprise security products increased $21 million and $13 million, respectively. Cost of licenses Year Ended March 31, 2007 2006 2005 ($ in thousands) Cost of licenses $ 49,968 $ 45,943 $ 52,138 As a % of related revenue 4 % 4 % 8 % Period over period increase (decrease) $ 4,025 $ (6,195 ) 9 % (12 )% Cost of licenses consists primarily of royalties paid to third parties under technology licensing agreements and manufacturing and direct material costs. Cost of licenses remained constant as a percentage of the related revenue in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. The year over year increase in absolute dollars is primarily due to amortization of stock based compensation expense, offset in part by lower costs associated with products acquired through the Veritas acquisition, which added $9 million of costs in fiscal 2007 and $13 million in fiscal 2006. Cost of licenses decreased as a percentage of the related revenue in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 due primarily to lower costs associated with products acquired through the Veritas acquisition. The Veritas acquisition added $13 million of costs in fiscal 2006, which was offset by a $17 million decrease in consumer products license costs as compared to fiscal 2005. These costs and the associated revenue are reported as Content, subscriptions, and maintenance beginning with the release of our 2006 consumer products in the December 2005 quarter that include content updates, as we now recognize the revenue and related costs ratably over the content update period. Amortization of acquired product rights Year Ended March 31, 2007 2006 2005 ($ in thousands) Amortization of acquired product rights $ 342,333 $ 314,290 $ 48,894 Percentage of total net revenues 7 % 8 % 2 % Period over period increase $ 28,043 $ 265,396 9 % * * Percentage not meaningful Acquired product rights are comprised of developed technologies, revenue related order backlog and contracts, and patents from acquired companies. The amortization in fiscal 2007 and 2006 is primarily associated with the Veritas acquisition, for which amortization began in July 2005. In connection with the Veritas acquisition, we recorded $1.3 billion in acquired 45 Table of Contents product rights which are being amortized over their expected useful lives of three months to five years. We amortize the fair value of all other acquired product rights over their expected useful lives, generally one to eight years. For further discussion of acquired product rights and related amortization, see Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating Expenses Sales and marketing expense Year Ended March 31, 2007 2006 2005 ($ in thousands) Sales and marketing $ 2,007,651 $ 1,499,904 $ 845,022 Percentage of total net revenues 39 % 36 % 33 % Period over period increase $ 507,747 $ 654,882 34 % 77 % Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenues increased to 39% in fiscal 2007 as compared to 36% in fiscal 2006. The percentage increase and increase in absolute dollars in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 is primarily due to higher employee compensation expense of approximately $335 million resulting from an increase in employee headcount. Higher employee compensation expense includes the effect of adopting of SFAS No. 123R, which added $56 million of stock based compensation expense in fiscal 2007 for which there is no comparable expense in fiscal 2006. In addition, approximately $171 million of the increase is due to an additional three months of sales and marketing expenses related to the Veritas acquisition, which is included for the full year of fiscal 2007 as compared to nine months in fiscal 2006. Advertising expense increased by approximately $129 million in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily as a result of changes in our OEM arrangements discussed below. Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenues increased to 36% in fiscal 2006 as compared to 33% in fiscal 2005. The percentage increase and increase in absolute dollars in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was due primarily to the Veritas acquisition, which contributed $579 million in additional sales and marketing expenses for which there were no comparable expenses in fiscal 2005. The remaining increase in sales and marketing expenses was due primarily to an increase in employee headcount, resulting in additional employee compensation expense. We have negotiated new contract terms with some of our OEM partners which will have the effect of moving our OEM payments from Cost of revenues to Operating expenses, as discussed above under Financial Results and Trends. As a result, we expect our Sales and marketing expenses to increase. Research and development expense Year Ended March 31, 2007 2006 2005 ($ in thousands) Research and development $ 866,882 $ 682,125 $ 334,046 Percentage of total net revenues 17 % 16 % 13 % Period over period increase $ 184,757 $ 348,079 27 % * * Percentage not meaningful Research and development expense as a percentage of total revenues remained relatively constant in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. The increase in absolute dollars in research and development expenses in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was due primarily to higher employee compensation expense of approximately $108 million resulting from an increase in employee headcount. Higher employee compensation expense includes the effect of adopting of SFAS No. 123R, which added $57 million of stock based compensation expense in fiscal 46 Table of Contents 2007 for which there is no comparable expense in fiscal 2006. In addition, approximately $96 million of the increase is due to an additional three months of research and development expenses related to the Veritas acquisition, which is included for the full year of fiscal 2007 as compared to nine months in fiscal 2006. Research and development expense as a percentage of total revenues increased to 16% in fiscal 2006 as compared to 13% in fiscal 2005. The percentage increase and increase in absolute dollars in research and development expenses in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was due primarily to the Veritas acquisition, which contributed $320 million in additional research and development expenses for which there were no comparable expenses in fiscal 2005. General and administrative expense Year Ended March 31, 2007 2006 2005 ($ in thousands) General and administrative $ 316,783 $ 228,563 $ 116,865 Percentage of total net revenues 6 % 6 % 5 % Period over period increase $ 88,220 $ 111,698 39 % 96 % General and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenues was relatively constant in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. The increase in absolute dollars in general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was due primarily to higher employee compensation expense of approximately $73 million resulting from an increase in employee headcount. Higher employee compensation includes the effect of adopting SFAS No. 123R, which added $24 million of stock based compensation expense in fiscal 2007 for which there is no comparable expense in fiscal 2006. In addition, approximately $20 million of the increase is due to an additional three months of general and administrative expenses related to the Veritas acquisition, which are included for the full year in fiscal 2007 as compared to nine months in fiscal 2006. General and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenues increased slightly in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. The increase in absolute dollars in general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was due primarily to the Veritas acquisition, which contributed $81 million in additional general and administrative expenses for which there were no comparable expenses in fiscal 2005. The remaining increase in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to an increase in employee headcount, resulting in additional employee compensation expense. Amortization of other intangible assets Year Ended March 31, 2007 2006 2005 ($ in thousands) Amortization of other intangible assets $ 201,502 $ 148,822 $ 5,416 Percentage of total net revenues 4 % 4 % * Period over period increase $ 52,680 $ 143,406 35 % * * Percentage not meaningful Other intangible assets are comprised of customer base, trade names, partnership agreements, and marketing related assets. The increased amortization in fiscal 2007 is primarily associated with a full year of amortization associated with the Veritas acquisition which occurred in July 2005 and the acquisitions of Company i Limited and 4FrontSecurity, Inc. that occurred during fiscal 2007. We recorded $9 million of other intangible assets associated with the Company i and 4FrontSecurity, acquisitions which will be amortized over their useful lives of one to eight years. 47 Table of Contents The increased amortization in fiscal 2006 is primarily associated with the Veritas acquisition, for which amortization began in July 2005. In connection with the Veritas acquisition, we recorded $1.5 billion in other intangible assets which will be amortized over their useful lives of eight to ten years. For further discussion of other intangible assets from acquisitions and related amortization, see Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Acquired in process research and development (IPRD) Year Ended March 31, 2007 2006 2005 ($ in thousands) Acquired in process research and development $ $ 285,100 $ 3,480 During fiscal 2006, we wrote off IPRD totaling $285 million, of which $284 million was in connection with our acquisition of Veritas. The IPRD was written off because the acquired technologies had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses. Technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to completion of a beta phase working prototype in which there is no remaining risk relating to the development. At the time of the acquisition in July 2005, Veritas was developing new products in multiple product areas that qualify as IPRD. These efforts included NetBackup 6.1, Backup Exec 11.0, Server Management 5.0, and various other projects. At the time of the acquisition, it was estimated that these IPRD development efforts would be completed over the following 12 to 18 months at an estimated total cost of $120 million. As of March 31, 2007, the majority of all IPRD projects had been completed on schedule and within expected costs, except for one small project which is expected to be completed within the next six months. In fiscal 2005, we wrote off $3 million of IPRD in connection with our acquisition of Brightmail. The Brightmail IPRD related to the third generation of Brightmails antispam product offering. Restructuring Year Ended March 31, 2007 2006 2005 ($ in thousands) Restructuring $ 70,236 $ 24,918 $ 2,776 In fiscal 2007, we recorded approximately $70 million of restructuring and employee termination benefit expenses which consist of $19 million related to severance, associated benefits, and outplacement services for the termination of approximately 323 employees located in the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific and $51 million dollars related to the 2007 cost savings initiative announced in January 2007. We implemented the 2007 cost savings initiative to better align our expenses with our new revenue expectations. The costs included in our 2007 cost savings initiative reflect $51 million related to severance, associated benefits, and outplacement services and an insignificant amount related to excess facilities. The restructuring and employee termination benefit costs under the 2007 cost savings initiative reflect the termination of approximately 988 employees located in the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific and the consolidation of certain facilities in Europe and Asia Pacific. We paid $24 million under the restructuring and employee termination benefit reserves established in fiscal 2007. We expect the remainder of the costs to be paid by the end of fiscal 2008. We expect that the 2007 cost savings initiative will result in an additional restructuring charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 and potentially in other future periods. In fiscal 2006, we recorded $25 million of restructuring costs, of which $18 million related to severance, associated benefits, and outplacement services and $7 million related to excess facilities. These restructuring costs reflect the termination of 446 redundant employees located in the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific and the consolidation of certain facilities in Europe and Asia Pacific. At March 31, 2006, $9 million remained related to this reserve. In fiscal 2007, we paid $4 million related to this restructuring reserve. At March 31, 2007, $5 million remained related to this reserve, the majority of which relate to restructured facilities. We expect the remainder of the costs to be paid by the end of fiscal 2018. In fiscal 2005, we recorded $3 million of restructuring charges, of which $2 million was for costs of severance, related benefits, and outplacement services related to the termination of 51 employees located in the U.S. and 48 Table of Contents Europe due to the consolidation and relocation of engineering and development functions. In addition we recorded an increase to the accrual relating to the fiscal 2002 restructuring plan of $1 million due to the termination of a sublease agreement for facilities in Eugene, Oregon. Substantially all of the costs had been paid by March 31, 2005. Integration In fiscal 2007, we recorded $1 million of integration charges in connection with our April 2007 acquisition of Altiris. These integration charges consisted of costs incurred for consulting services and other professional fees. We expect to incur additional integration costs related to Altiris in fiscal 2008. In connection with our acquisition of Veritas, we recorded integration costs of $16 million in fiscal 2006 and $3 million in fiscal 2005, which consisted primarily of costs incurred for consulting services and other professional fees. Patent settlement On May 12, 2005, we resolved patent litigation matters with Altiris, Inc. by entering into a cross licensing agreement that resolved all legal claims between the companies. As part of the settlement, we paid Altiris $10 million for use of the disputed technology. Under the transaction, we expensed $2 million of patent settlement costs in the June 2005 quarter that was related to benefits received in and prior to the June 2005 quarter. The remaining $8 million was recorded as Acquired product rights in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is being amortized to Cost of revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the remaining life of the primary patent, which expires in May 2017. In April 2007, we acquired Altiris. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Non operating Income and Expense Year Ended March 31, 2007 2006 2005 ($ in thousands) Interest income $ 122,043 $ 108,404 $ 50,195 Interest expense (27,233 ) (17,996 ) (12,323 ) Other income (expense), net 17,070 (1,650 ) 990 Total $ 111,880 $ 88,758 $ 38,862 Percentage of total net revenues 2 % 2 % 2 % Period over period increase $ 23,122 $ 49,896 26 % * * Percentage not meaningful The increase in Interest income in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was due primarily to a higher average investment balance and higher average interest rates realized on our invested cash and available for sale securities. The increase in Interest income in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was due primarily to a higher average investment balance, due to the cash acquired through the Veritas acquisition, and higher average interest rates. Interest expense in fiscal 2007 was due primarily to the interest and amortization of issuance costs related to our 0.75% and 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes issued in June 2006. In addition, the period includes interest and accretion related to the 0.25% Convertible Subordinated Notes that we assumed in connection with our acquisition of Veritas. The 0.25% Veritas Convertible Subordinated Notes were paid in full during August 2006. Interest expense in fiscal 2006 was due primarily to the Veritas 0.25% Convertible Subordinated Notes. Interest expense in fiscal 2005 was primarily related to our $600 million 3% convertible subordinated notes issued in October 2001. In November 2004, substantially all of the outstanding convertible subordinated notes were converted into 70.3 million shares of our common stock and the remainder was redeemed for cash. In fiscal 2007, Other income (expense), net includes a gain of $20 million on the sale of our buildings in Milpitas, California, and Maidenhead, United Kingdom. 49 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes Year Ended March 31, 2007 2006 2005 ($ in thousands) Tax provision on earnings $ 227,242 $ 227,068 $ 267,720 Effective tax rate on earnings 36 % 63 % 31 % Tax provision on repatriation $ $ (21,197 ) $ 54,249 Total tax provision $ 227,242 $ 205,871 $ 321,969 Total effective tax rate 36 % 57 % 38 % Our effective tax rate on Income before income taxes was approximately 36%, 57%, and 38% in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 reflects the impact of non deductible stock based compensation and the fiscal 2003 and 2004 Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, audit settlement. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 reflects the impact of the IPRD charges and other acquisition related charges that are nondeductible for tax reporting purposes, partially offset by foreign earnings taxed at a lower rate than the U.S. tax rate, and the effect of the true up of taxes on repatriated earnings. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2005 reflects the additional tax expense attributable to the $500 million of foreign earnings that we repatriated under the American Jobs Creation Act. We believe realization of substantially all of our deferred tax assets as of March 31, 2007 of $578 million, after application of the valuation allowance, is more likely than not based on the future reversal of temporary tax differences. Realization of approximately $43 million of our deferred tax assets as of March 31, 2007 is dependent upon future taxable earnings exclusive of reversing temporary differences in certain foreign jurisdictions. Levels of future taxable income are subject to the various risks and uncertainties discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, set forth in this annual report. An additional valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets may be necessary if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. We will assess the need for an additional valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. Of the $60 million total valuation allowance provided against our deferred tax assets, approximately $54 million is attributable to acquisition related assets, the benefit of which will reduce goodwill when and if realized. The valuation allowance decreased by $6 million in fiscal 2007, all of which was attributable to acquisition related assets, the benefit of which reduced goodwill. The valuation allowance increased by $59 million in fiscal 2006, of which approximately $58 million was attributable to acquisition related assets. American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 Repatriation of foreign earnings In the March 2005 quarter, we repatriated $500 million from certain of our foreign subsidiaries that qualified for the 85% dividends received deduction under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, or the Jobs Act, enacted in October 2004. We recorded a tax charge for this repatriation of $54 million in the March 2005 quarter. In May 2005, clarifying language was issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury and the IRS with respect to the treatment of foreign taxes paid on the earnings repatriated under the Jobs Act and in September 2005, additional clarifying language was issued regarding the treatment of certain deductions attributable to the earnings repatriation. As a result of this clarifying language, we reduced the tax expense attributable to the repatriation by approximately $21 million in fiscal 2006, which reduced the cumulative tax charge on the repatriation to $33 million. Other tax matters On March 29, 2006, we received a Notice of Deficiency from the IRS claiming that we owe additional taxes, plus interest and penalties, for the 2000 and 2001 tax years based on an audit of Veritas, which we acquired in July 2005. The incremental tax liability asserted by the IRS with regard to the Veritas claim was $867 million, excluding penalties and interest. The Notice of Deficiency primarily relates to transfer pricing in connection with a technology license agreement between Veritas and a foreign subsidiary. We do not agree with the IRS position. On June 26, 2006, we filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court to protest a Notice of Deficiency. On August 30, 2006, the IRS 50 Table of Contents answered our petition and the case has been docketed for trial in U.S. Tax Court. In the March 2007 quarter, the IRS agreed to dismiss any penalty assessment, and we have otherwise agreed to settle several of the lesser issues (representing $35 million of the total assessment) for $7 million of tax. As a result, the outstanding issue represents $832 million of tax. No payments will be made on the assessment until the issue is definitively resolved. If, upon resolution, we are required to pay an amount in excess of our provision for this matter, the incremental amounts due would be accounted for principally as additions to the Veritas purchase price as an increase to goodwill. Any incremental interest accrued subsequent to the date of the Veritas acquisition would be recorded as an expense in the period the matter is resolved. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we made $90 million of tax related adjustments to the purchase accounting for Veritas, consisting of $120 million of additional pre acquisition tax reserve related adjustments, partially offset by a $30 million reduction in other pre acquisition taxes payable. While we strongly disagree with the IRS over both its transfer pricing methodologies and the amount of the assessment, we have established additional tax reserves for all Veritas pre acquisition years to account for both contingent tax and interest risk. On March 30, 2006, we received notices of proposed adjustment from the IRS with regard to an unrelated audit of Symantec for fiscal 2003 and 2004. The IRS claimed that we owed an incremental tax liability with regard to this audit of $110 million, excluding penalties and interest. The incremental tax liability primarily relates to transfer pricing matters between Symantec and a foreign subsidiary. On September 5, 2006, we executed a closing agreement with the IRS with respect to the audit of Symantecs fiscal 2003 and 2004 federal income tax returns. The closing agreement represents the final assessment by the IRS of additional tax for these fiscal years of approximately $35 million, including interest. Based on the final settlement, a tax benefit of $8 million was recognized. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we increased our tax reserves by an additional $64 million in connection with all open Symantec tax years (fiscal 2003 to 2006). Since these reserves relate to licensing arising from acquired technology, the additional accruals are primarily offset by deferred taxes. We are as yet unable to confirm our eligibility to claim a lower tax rate on a distribution made from a Veritas foreign subsidiary prior to the acquisition. The distribution was intended to be made pursuant to the Jobs Act, and therefore eligible for a 5.25% effective U.S. federal rate of tax, in lieu of the 35% statutory rate. We are seeking a ruling from the IRS on the matter. Because we were unable to obtain this ruling prior to filing the Veritas tax return in May 2006, we have paid $130 million of additional U.S. taxes. Since this payment relates to the taxability of foreign earnings that are otherwise the subject of the IRS assessment, this additional payment reduced the amount of taxes payable accrued as part of the purchase accounting for pre acquisition contingent tax risks. For further information, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Critical Accounting Estimates Income Taxes above. In connection with the note hedge transactions discussed in Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we established a deferred tax asset of approximately $232 million to account for the book tax basis difference in the convertible notes resulting from note hedge transactions. The deferred tax asset has been accounted for as an increase to Capital in excess of par value. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Year Ended March 31, 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used for): Operating activities $ 1,666,235 $ 1,536,896 $ 1,207,459 Investing activities (222,455 ) 3,619,605 (663,159 ) Financing activities (1,309,567 ) (3,910,064 ) (31,990 ) Effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash and cash equivalents 109,199 (22,248 ) 18,261 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 243,412 $ 1,224,189 $ 530,571 51 Table of Contents As of March 31, 2007, our principal source of liquidity was our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments of $3.0 billion, of which 53% was held domestically and the remainder was held outside of the U.S. In April 2007, we completed our acquisition of Altiris, Inc., a leading provider of IT management software that enables businesses to easily manage and service network based endpoints. We used a portion of our domestic cash balance to fund the aggregate purchase price, excluding acquisition related costs, of approximately $815 million in cash, which amount is net of Altiris cash balance. As a result approximately two thirds of our cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments balance is currently held outside of the U.S. At the beginning of fiscal 2007, we completed the reorganization of certain international subsidiaries acquired as part of the Veritas acquisition. In June 2006, we issued $1.1 billion principal amount of 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2011, and $1.0 billion principal amount of 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2013, to initial purchasers in a private offering for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC Rule 144A. We refer to these Notes collectively as the Senior Notes. Concurrently with the issuance of the Senior Notes, we entered into note hedge transactions with affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers whereby we have the option to purchase up to 110 million shares of our common stock at a price of $19.12 per share. In addition, concurrently with the issuance of the Senior Notes, we also sold warrants to affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers whereby they have the option to purchase up to 110 million shares of our common stock at a price of $27.3175 per share. The warrants expire on various dates from July 2011 through August 2013 and must be settled in net shares. For additional information regarding the Senior Notes and related transactions, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which information is incorporated herein by reference. For information regarding the deferred tax asset established in connection with the note hedge transactions, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which information is incorporated herein by reference. The cost incurred in connection with the note hedge transactions, net of the related tax benefit and the proceeds from the sale of the warrants, is included as a net reduction in Capital in excess of par value in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2007, in accordance with the guidance in Emerging Issues Task Force Issue, or EITF, No. 00 19, Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Companys Own Stock. On August 1, 2006, at the option of certain of the holders, we repurchased for cash $510 million of the Veritas 0.25% Convertible Subordinated Notes, or the 0.25% Notes, that we had assumed in connection with the acquisition of Veritas at a price equal to the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. On August 28, 2006, at our election, we repurchased the remaining $10 million of the Veritas 0.25% Notes at a price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. For additional information regarding the 0.25% Notes, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which information is incorporated herein by reference. In July 2006, we entered into a five year $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in July 2011. Borrowings under the facility will bear interest, at our option, at either a rate equal to the banks base rate or a rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin based on our leverage ratio, as defined in the credit facility agreement. In connection with the credit facility, we must maintain certain covenants, including a specified ratio of debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), as well as various other non financial covenants. At March 31, 2007, we were in compliance with all covenants. We have made no borrowings under the credit facility through the date of filing of this annual report. During April 2006, we purchased two office buildings totaling approximately 236,000 square feet in Cupertino, California for $81 million. Approximately 64,000 square feet is leased to a third party. In September 2006, we sold a building in Milpitas, California for net proceeds of $83 million. In January 2007, we sold a building in Maidenhead, England for net proceeds of $35 million. On January 24, 2007, we announced that the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $1 billion of Symantec common stock without a scheduled expiration date. We believe that our cash balances, cash that we generate over time from operations, and our borrowing capacity will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. 52 Table of Contents Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2007 resulted largely from net income of $404 million, plus non cash depreciation and amortization charges of $811 million, non cash stock based compensation expense of $154 million, and an increase in deferred revenue of $400 million. These amounts were partially offset by a decrease in income taxes payable of $182 million, primarily due to the timing of tax payments. We expect operating cash flow to continue to be positive in the future. Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2006 resulted largely from net income of $157 million, plus an increase in deferred revenue of $683 million, non cash charges, primarily for depreciation and amortization, of $640 million, and the write off of IPRD of $285 million related to the acquisitions of Veritas and BindView. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in deferred income taxes of $203 million and by an increase in trade accounts receivable of $87 million. Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2005 resulted largely from net income of $536 million, plus non cash depreciation and amortization charges of $127 million, the income tax benefit from employee stock plans of $109 million, and deferred income taxes of $61 million. In addition, our deferred revenue increased by $319 million and income taxes payable increased by $56 million. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2007 was primarily the result of capital expenditures of $420 million, including $81 million for the purchase of two office buildings in Cupertino, California, and purchases of available for sale securities of $227 million. These amounts were partially offset by proceeds of $349 million from sales of available for sale securities and net proceeds from the sale of property and equipment, primarily buildings in Milpitas, California and Maidenhead, England, of $121 million. Net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2006 was primarily the result of net sales of available for sale securities of $3.4 billion and cash of $541 million acquired through the acquisition of Veritas, net of cash expenditures for our other acquisitions in fiscal 2006. These amounts were partially offset by capital expenditures of $267 million, including $63 million for the purchase of two buildings in Mountain View, California. Net cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2005 was primarily the result of payments for business acquisitions of $424 million and net purchases of available for sale securities of $143 million. Financing Activities In the June 2006 quarter, we issued the Senior Notes for net proceeds of approximately $2.1 billion. We used $1.5 billion of the proceeds to repurchase shares of our common stock, as discussed below. We also purchased hedges related to the Senior Notes for $592 million and received proceeds of $326 million from the sale of common stock warrants. In addition, we applied the remainder of the proceeds from the Senior Notes to the $520 million used to repurchase the Veritas 0.25% Notes in August 2006. We have operated stock repurchase programs since 2001. As of January 2007, we completed the $1 billion share repurchase program announced in January 2006 as well as the $1.5 billion share repurchase program announced in June 2006. On January 24, 2007, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $1 billion of Symantec common stock, without a scheduled expiration date. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 162 million shares of our common stock at prices ranging from $15.61 to $21.66 per share for an aggregate amount of $2.8 billion. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 174 million shares at prices ranging from $15.83 to $23.85 per share for an aggregate amount of $3.6 billion. During fiscal 2005, we repurchased eight million shares at prices ranging from $21.05 to $30.77 per share, for an aggregate amount of $192 million. As of March 31, 2007, $500 million remained authorized for future repurchases. For further information regarding our stock repurchases, see Item 5, Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, of this annual report. In fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, we received net proceeds of $230 million, $210 million, and $160 million, respectively, from the issuance of our common stock through employee stock plans. 53 Table of Contents In fiscal 2007, we repaid the entire balance of $520 million related to the Veritas 0.25% Convertible Subordinated Notes and in fiscal 2006, we repaid the entire balance of a short term loan with a principal amount of EURO 411 million that we assumed in connection with our acquisition of Veritas. Contractual Obligations The contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from these estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments related to the contractual obligations set forth in the table below. The following table summarizes our fixed contractual obligations and commitments as of March 31, 2007: Payments Due by Period Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2013 Total Fiscal 2008 and 2010 and 2012 and thereafter (In thousands) Convertible senior notes(1) $ 2,100,000 $ $ $ 1,100,000 $ 1,000,000 Purchase obligations(2) 217,691 208,337 9,327 27 Operating leases(3) 415,234 85,481 118,085 73,097 138,571 Total contractual obligations $ 2,732,925 $ 293,818 $ 127,412 $ 1,173,124 $ 1,138,571 (1) Convertible senior notes, due June 15, 2011 and June 15, 2013 collectively referred to as the Senior Notes. Holders of the Senior Notes may convert their Senior Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of Symantec common stock, up to the principal amount of the note. Amounts in excess of the principal amount, if any, may be paid in cash or in stock at our option. As of March 31, 2007, those circumstances had not occurred. (2) Represents amounts associated with agreements that are enforceable, legally binding, and specify terms. (3) Includes $12 million related to facilities included in our restructuring reserve. Purchase price adjustment On December 1, 2006, we completed our acquisition of Company i Limited for $26 million in cash. The purchase price may be increased by up to $11 million in cash if Company i meets certain billings targets by September 30, 2008. Payments of the additional consideration may be accelerated if certain billings targets are met by March 31, 2007 or September 30, 2007. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, Symantec has 90 days from the respective dates to determine whether the billings target for payment of the additional consideration has been met. Any increase in the purchase consideration would result in a corresponding increase in goodwill. We believe that it is not determinable beyond a reasonable doubt that the billing targets are met as of March 31, 2007 and therefore we have not booked an adjustment in accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. Development agreements During fiscal 2006, we entered into agreements in connection with the construction of, or refurbishments to, buildings in Springfield, Oregon, and Culver City, California. Payment is contingent upon the achievement of certain agreed upon milestones. The remaining commitment under the Culver City, California agreement is $91 million as of March 31, 2007. As of March 31, 2007, the Springfield, Oregon project had been completed and there were no remaining commitments under that agreement. Royalties We have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of underlying revenue. Certain 54 Table of Contents royalty commitments have minimum commitment obligations; however, as of March 31, 2007 all such obligations are insignificant. Indemnification As permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at our request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is not limited; however, we have directors and officers insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and may enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal. We provide limited product warranties and the majority of our software license agreements contain provisions that indemnify licensees of our software from damages and costs resulting from claims alleging that our software infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party. Historically, payments made under these provisions have been insignificant. We monitor the conditions that are subject to indemnification to identify if a loss has occurred. Newly Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Recent accounting pronouncements In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, including an amendment of SFAS No. 115. SFAS No. 159 permits companies to choose to measure certain financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and requires unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected to be reported in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 159 on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities. This framework is intended to provide increased consistency in how fair value determinations are made under various existing accounting standards which permit, or in some cases require, estimates of fair market value. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application is encouraged, provided that the reporting entity has not yet issued financial statements for that fiscal year, including any financial statements for an interim period within that fiscal year. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 157 on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force Issue, or EITF, No. 06 1, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Service Provider to a Manufacturer or Reseller of Equipment Necessary for an End Customer to Receive Service from the Service Provider. EITF No. 06 1 requires that we provide disclosures regarding the nature of arrangements in which we provide consideration to manufacturers or resellers of equipment necessary for an end customer to receive service from us, including the amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. EITF 06 1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2007. We do not expect the adoption of EITF No. 06 1 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. The interpretation contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 109. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of FIN 48 on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments, which amends SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. SFAS No. 155 55 Table of Contents simplifies the accounting for certain derivatives embedded in other financial instruments by allowing them to be accounted for as a whole if the holder elects to account for the entire instrument on a fair value basis. SFAS No. 155 also clarifies and amends certain other provisions of SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 140. SFAS No. 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired, issued, or subject to a re measurement event occurring in fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006. Earlier adoption is permitted, provided the company has not yet issued financial statements, including for interim periods, for that fiscal year. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 155 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to various market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity prices. We may use derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain risks in accordance with our investment and foreign exchange policies. We do not use derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio and the potential losses arising from changes in interest rates. Our investment objective is to achieve the maximum return compatible with capital preservation and liquidity requirements. Our strategy is to invest our cash in a manner that preserves capital, maintains sufficient liquidity to meet the cash requirements of the company, maximizes yields consistent with approved credit risk, and limits inappropriate concentrations of investment by sector, credit, or issuer. We classify our cash equivalents and short term investments in accordance with SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. We consider investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. We classify our short term investments as available for sale, and short term investments consist of marketable debt or equity securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days. Our cash equivalents and short term investment portfolios consist primarily of money market funds, commercial paper, corporate debt securities, asset backed debt securities, and U.S. government and government sponsored debt securities. Our short term investments do not include equity investments in privately held companies. Our short term investments are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in Accumulated other comprehensive income within Stockholders equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amortization of premiums and discounts on the investments, realized gains and losses, and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available for sale securities are included in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We use the specific identification method to determine cost in calculating realized gains and losses upon sale of short term investments. The following table presents the fair value and hypothetical changes in fair values on short term investments sensitive to changes in interest rates (in millions): Value of Securities Value of Securities Given an Given an Interest Interest Rate Increase of Fair Value Rate Decrease of X X Basis Points (bps) As of Basis Points (bps) 150 bps 100 bps 50 bps March 31, (25 bps) (75 bps) March 31, 2007 $ 1,770 $ 1,772 $ 1,775 $ 1,778 $ 1,779 $ 1,782 March 31, 2006 $ 1,506 $ 1,510 $ 1,513 $ 1,517 $ 1,519 $ 1,523 The modeling technique used above measures the change in fair market value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus 150 bps, plus 100 bps, plus 50 bps, minus 25 bps, and minus 75 bps. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We conduct business in 38 currencies through our worldwide operations and, as such, we are exposed to foreign currency exposure risk. Foreign currency risks are associated with our cash and cash equivalents, investments, receivables, and payables denominated in foreign currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates will result in foreign exchange gains and losses on these foreign currency assets and liabilities and are included in Other 56 Table of Contents income (expense), net. Our objective in managing foreign exchange activity is to preserve stockholder value by minimizing the risk of foreign currency exchange rate changes. Our strategy is to primarily utilize forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures. Under our program, gains and losses in our foreign currency exposures are offset by losses and gains on our forward contracts. Our forward contracts generally have terms of 35 days or less. At the end of the reporting period, open contracts are marked to market with unrealized gains and losses included in Other income (expense), net. The following table presents a sensitivity analysis on our foreign forward exchange contract portfolio using a statistical model to estimate the potential gain or loss in fair value that could arise from hypothetical appreciation or depreciation of foreign currency (in millions): Value of Value of Contracts Contracts Given X% Given X% Appreciation of Depreciation of Foreign Foreign Currency Notional Currency Foreign Forward Exchange Contracts 10% 5% Amount (5)% (10)% Purchased, March 31, 2007 $ 176 $ 169 $ 161 $ 153 $ 143 Sold, March 31, 2007 $ 258 $ 270 $ 284 $ 299 $ 316 Purchased, March 31, 2006 $ 249 $ 239 $ 228 $ 216 $ 203 Sold, March 31, 2006 $ 405 $ 425 $ 446 $ 469 $ 496 Equity Price Risk In June 2006, we issued $1.1 billion principal amount of 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2011 and $1.0 billion of 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013. Holders may convert their Senior Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of Symantec common stock, up to the principal amount of the note. Amounts in excess of the principal amount, if any, may be paid in cash or in stock at our option. Concurrent with the issuance of the Senior Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions and separately, warrant transactions, to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the Senior Notes and to mitigate any negative effect such conversion may have on the price of our common stock. For business and strategic purposes, we also hold equity interests in several privately held companies, many of which can be considered to be in the start up or development stages. These investments are inherently risky and we could lose a substantial part or our entire investment in these companies. These investments are recorded at cost and classified as Other long term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of March 31, 2007, these investments had an aggregate carrying value of $8 million.
