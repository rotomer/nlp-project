Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW Our Business Symantec is a global leader in providing security, storage and systems management solutions to help businesses and consumers secure and manage their information. We provide customers worldwide with software and services that protect, manage and control information risks related to security, data protection, storage, compliance, and systems management. We help our customers manage cost, complexity and compliance by protecting their IT infrastructure as they seek to maximize value from their IT investments. We have a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Friday closest to March 31. Unless otherwise stated, references to fiscal years in this report relate to fiscal year and periods ended April 3, 2009, March 28, 2008 and March 30, 2007. Fiscal 2008 and 2007 each consisted of 52 weeks while fiscal 2009 consisted of 53 weeks. Our 2010 fiscal year will consist of 52 weeks and will end on April 2, 2010. Our Operating Segments Our operating segments are significant strategic business units that offer different products and services, distinguished by customer needs. Since the March 2008 quarter, we have operated in five operating segments: Consumer, Security and Compliance, Storage and Server Management, Services, and Other. During the June 2008 quarter, we changed our reporting segments to better align our operating structure, resulting in the Altiris services that were formerly included in the Security and Compliance segment being moved to the Services segment. We revised the segment information for the prior year to conform to the new presentation. For further descriptions of our operating segments, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report. Our reportable segments are the same as our operating segments. Financial Results and Trends Revenue for fiscal 2009 was $6.1 billion, or 5% higher than revenue for fiscal 2008. For fiscal 2009, we realized revenue growth in the Americas and Asia Pacific Japan as compared to fiscal 2008 and experienced revenue growth in all of our segments. Revenue growth in our EMEA geography was relatively flat from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009. Foreign currency fluctuations had relatively little overall impact on our international revenue growth for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2008, foreign currency fluctuations positively impacted our revenue growth internationally compared to fiscal 2007. We are unable to predict the extent to which revenues in future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If international sales become a greater portion of our total sales in the future, changes in foreign exchange rates may have a greater impact on our revenues and operating results. In fiscal 2009 the global economic slowdown increased competitive pricing pressures and led to longer lead times in the sales of some of our products and may have otherwise adversely affected purchase decisions in our 28 Table of Contents markets. If the challenging economic conditions affecting global markets continue or deteriorate further, we may experience slower or negative revenue growth and our business and operating results might suffer. For example, our revenue declined slightly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 relative to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, although this was due in part to year over year changes in foreign exchange rates. In light of these economic conditions, we will continue to align our cost structure with our revenue expectations. Employee related costs have been the primary driver of our operating expenses, and we expect this trend to continue. Employee related costs include items such as wages, commissions, bonuses, vacation, benefits, and stock based compensation. We had 17,426, 17,648, and 17,131 employees as of the end of fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease during fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to the impact of our cost and expense discipline, partially offset by employees added through acquisitions. During fiscal 2009, based on a combination of factors, including the current economic environment and a sustained decline in our market capitalization, we concluded that there were sufficient indicators to require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis. As a result of this interim analysis, we recorded a $7.4 billion non cash goodwill impairment during fiscal 2009. Primarily as a result of this charge, our net loss was $6.7 billion for fiscal 2009 as compared to our net income of $464 million and $404 million for fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. On November 14, 2008, we acquired MessageLabs Group Limited (MessageLabs), a nonpublic United Kingdom based provider of managed services to protect, control, encrypt, and archive electronic communications for $630 million, net of cash acquired. We believe this acquisition complements our SaaS business. On October 6, 2008, we acquired PC Tools Pty Ltd. (PC Tools), a nonpublic Australia based provider of security and systems software, for approximately $262 million in cash, net of cash acquired. We believe this acquisition complements our consumer security software business. We completed four other acquisitions during fiscal 2009 for a combined cash consideration of $215 million. See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report for further details. In the face of a challenging economic environment, cash flows remained strong in fiscal 2009 as we achieved $1.7 billion in operating cash flow. We ended fiscal 2009 with nearly $2.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments. In addition, during fiscal 2009 we repurchased 42 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $16.53, for total consideration of $700 million. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in this annual report in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, requires us to make estimates, which include judgments and assumptions, that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly. Historically, our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results; however, actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions. If actual results differ from these estimates and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, and in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on liquidity and our financial condition. A critical accounting estimate is based on judgments and assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made. Different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in accounting estimates could materially impact the operating results or financial condition. We believe that the estimates described below represent our critical accounting estimates, as they have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. See also Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report. 29 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software industry. We recognize revenue primarily pursuant to the requirements of Statement of Position 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, and any applicable amendments or modifications. Revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and require us to make many estimates. In arrangements that include multiple elements, including perpetual software licenses and maintenance and or services, and packaged products with content updates, we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of the fair value of the undelivered elements, and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue. Our deferred revenue consists primarily of the unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance, consumer product content updates, and arrangements where VSOE does not exist. Deferred revenue totaled approximately $3.1 billion as of April 3, 2009, of which $419 million was classified as Long term deferred revenue in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. VSOE of each element is based on the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately. We determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our stand alone sales of these elements to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the undelivered elements. When VSOE does not exist for undelivered items, such as maintenance, then the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and the degree of flexibility in contractual arrangements could materially impact the amount recognized in the current period and deferred over time. For our consumer products that include content updates, we recognize revenue and the associated cost of revenue ratably over the term of the subscription upon sell through to end users, as the subscription period commences upon sale to an end user. We defer revenue and cost of revenue amounts for unsold product held by our distributors and resellers. We expect our distributors and resellers to maintain adequate inventory of consumer packaged products to meet future customer demand, which is generally four or six weeks of customer demand based on recent buying trends. We ship product to our distributors and resellers at their request and based on valid purchase orders. Our distributors and resellers base the quantity of orders on their estimates to meet future customer demand, which may exceed the expected level of a four or six week supply. We offer limited rights of return if the inventory held by our distributors and resellers is below the expected level of a four or six week supply. We estimate future returns under these limited rights of return in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists. We typically offer liberal rights of return if inventory held by our distributors and resellers exceeds the expected level. Because we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of excess inventory that will be returned, we primarily offset deferred revenue against trade accounts receivable for the amount of revenue in excess of the expected inventory levels. Reserves for product returns. We reserve for estimated product returns as an offset to revenue based primarily on historical trends. We fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channels as an offset to deferred revenue for products with content updates and to revenue for all other products. If we made different estimates, material differences could result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented. More or less product may be returned than what was estimated and or the amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what was estimated. These factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make actual results differ from our return estimates. Reserves for rebates. We estimate and record reserves for channel and end user rebates as an offset to revenue. For consumer products that include content updates, rebates are recorded as a ratable offset to revenue over the term of the subscription. Our estimated reserves for channel volume incentive rebates are based on distributors and resellers actual performance against the terms and conditions of volume incentive rebate programs, which are typically entered into quarterly. Our reserves for end user rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the promotional programs, actual sales during the promotion, amount of actual redemptions received, historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program, and the value of the rebate. We also consider current market conditions and economic trends when estimating our reserves for rebates. If actual redemptions 30 Table of Contents differ from our estimates, material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented. Valuation of goodwill, intangible assets and long lived assets When we acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to intangible assets. These estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates. Goodwill. As of April 3, 2009, goodwill was $4.6 billion. We review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS No. 142). The provisions of SFAS No. 142 require that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its allocated carrying value (book value). If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the equity assigned to that unit, there is an indicator of impairment and we must perform the second step of the impairment test, which requires determining the implied fair value of that reporting units goodwill in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. If the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the excess. Our reporting units are identified in accordance with SFAS No. 142 and are either equivalent to, or represent one level below, an operating segment. Each reporting unit constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results. Our operating segments are significant strategic business units that offer different products and services, distinguished by customer needs. Our reporting units are consistent with our operating segments, except for the Services segment, which includes the SaaS and the Services reporting units. The SaaS reporting unit is new for fiscal 2009 and was primarily the result of an acquisition during the year. Prior to performing our second step in the goodwill impairment analysis, we perform an assessment of long lived assets for impairment. Such long lived assets include tangible and intangible assets recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets and SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Software to Be Sold, Leased of Otherwise Marketed. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis. In determining the carrying value of the reporting units, we had to apply judgment to allocate the assets and liabilities, such as accounts receivable and property and equipment, based on specific identification or relevant driver, as they are not held by those reporting units but by functional departments. Goodwill was allocated to the reporting units based on a combination of specific identification and relative fair values, which is consistent with the methodology utilized in the prior year impairment analysis. The use of relative fair values was necessary for certain reporting units due to changes in our operating structure in prior years. Furthermore, to determine the reporting units fair value, we use the income approach under which we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the estimated discounted future cash flows of that unit. The income approach was determined to be the most representative valuation technique that would be utilized by a market participant in an assumed transaction, but the results are corroborated with the market approach which measures the value of an asset through an analysis of recent sales or offerings of comparable property. When applied to the valuation of equity interests, consideration is given to the financial condition and operating performance of the company being appraised relative to those of publicly traded companies operating in the same or similar lines of business, potentially subject to corresponding economic, environmental, and political factors and considered to be reasonable investment alternatives. We also consider our market capitalization on the date we perform our analysis. Significant assumptions are based on 31 Table of Contents historical and forecasted amounts specific to each reporting unit, and consider estimates of cash flows, including revenues, operating costs, growth rates and other relevant factors, as well as discount rates to be applied. Although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying reporting units, there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to these reporting units over their remaining useful lives. Based on a combination of factors, including the current economic environment and a decline in our market capitalization, we concluded that there were sufficient indicators to require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis during the third quarter of fiscal 2009. The analysis was not completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2009 and an estimated impairment charge of $7.0 billion was recorded. The analysis was subsequently finalized and an additional impairment charge of $413 million was included in our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. As a result, we incurred a total impairment charge of $7.4 billion for fiscal 2009. We also performed our annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and determined that no additional impairment charge was necessary. The methodology applied in the current year analyses was consistent with the methodology applied in the prior year analysis, but was based on updated assumptions, as appropriate. As a result of the downturn in the economic environment during the second half of calendar 2008, determining the fair value of the individual reporting units was even more judgmental than in the past. In particular, the global economic recession has reduced our visibility into long term trends and consequently, estimates of future cash flows used in the current year analyses are lower than those used in the prior year analysis. The discount rates utilized in the analysis also reflect market based estimates of the risks associated with the projected cash flows of individual reporting units and were increased from the prior year analysis to reflect increased risk due to current volatility in the economic environment. If there are changes to the methods used to allocate carrying values, if managements estimates of future operating results change, if there are changes in the identified reporting units or if there are changes to other significant assumptions, the estimated carrying values for each reporting unit and the estimated fair value of our goodwill could change significantly, and could result in an impairment charge. Such changes could also result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods, which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition therein. Intangible Assets. We assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets according to SFAS Nos. 142 or 144, as appropriate, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount. Such impairment loss would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value. Our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted revenue, operating costs, and other relevant factors. If managements estimates of future operating results change, or if there are changes to other assumptions, the estimate of the fair value of our acquired product rights and other identifiable intangible assets could change significantly. Such change could result in impairment charges in future periods, which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition. We account for developed technology or acquired product rights in accordance with SFAS No. 86. We record impairment charges on acquired product rights when we determine that the net realizable value of the assets may not be recoverable. To determine the net realizable value of the assets, we use the estimated future gross revenues from each product. Our estimated future gross revenues of each product are based on company forecasts and are subject to change. Long Lived Assets (including Assets Held for Sale). We account for long lived assets in accordance with SFAS No. 144. We record impairment charges on long lived assets to be held and used when we determine that the carrying value of the long lived assets may not be recoverable. Based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment, we measure any impairment of long lived assets based on a projected undiscounted cash flow method using assumptions determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model. Our estimates of cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical results and anticipated results and are subject to many triggering factors which could change and cause a material impact to our operating results or financial condition. We record impairment charges on long lived assets to be held for sale when 32 Table of Contents we determine that the carrying value of the long lived assets may not be recoverable. In determining our fair value, we obtain market value appraisal information from third parties. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Beginning in the first fiscal quarter of 2009, the assessment of fair value for our financial instruments is based on the provisions of SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that is based on three levels of inputs and requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. We use inputs such as actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes and other similar data which are obtained from independent pricing vendors, quoted market prices or other sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and liabilities. We use such pricing data as the primary input, to which we have not made any material adjustments, to make our assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of our investment portfolio, and we are ultimately responsible for the financial statements and underlying estimates. The fair value and inputs are reviewed for reasonableness, may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information that management deems material to their estimate of fair value. As of April 3, 2009, our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included $1.5 billion of assets. Our cash equivalents primarily consist of money market funds, bank securities, and government notes and represent 98% of our total financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis. As of April 3, 2009, $392 million of investments were classified as Level 1, most of which represents investments in money market funds. These were classified as Level 1 because their valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets. Determining fair value for Level 1 instruments generally does not require significant management judgment. As of April 3, 2009, $1.1 billion of investments were classified as Level 2, of which $474 million and $654 million (98% together of total financial instruments fair valued on a recurring basis) represent investments in corporate securities and government securities, respectively. These were classified as Level 2 because either (1) the estimated fair value is based on the fair value of similar securities or (2) their valuations were based on pricing models with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market prices for identical securities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets). Level 2 inputs generally are based on non binding market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data; quoted prices for similar instruments; and or model derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities or quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities. While determining the fair value for Level 2 instruments does not necessarily require significant management judgment, it generally involves the following level of judgment and subjectivity: Determining whether a market is considered active. An assessment of an active market for marketable securities generally takes into consideration trading volume for each instrument type or whether a trading market exists for a given instrument. Our Level 2 financial instruments were so classified due to either low trading activity in active markets or no active market existing. For those securities where no active market existed, amortized cost was used and approximates fair value because of their short maturities. For these financial instruments classified as Level 2 as of April 3, 2009, we used identical securities for determining fair value. Determining which model derived valuations to use in determining fair value. When observable market prices for identical securities or similar securities are not available, we may price marketable securities using: non binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data; or pricing models, such as discounted cash flow approaches, with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data. In addition, the credit ratings for issuers of debt instruments in which we are invested could change, which could lead to lower fair values. As of April 3, 2009, the fair value of 33 Table of Contents $12 million of fixed income securities was determined using benchmark pricing models for identical or similar securities. As of April 3, 2009, we have no financial instruments with unobservable inputs as classified in Level 3 under the SFAS No. 157 hierarchy. Level 3 instruments generally would include unobservable inputs to be used in the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities. The determination of fair value for Level 3 instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity. Stock Based Compensation We account for stock based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, stock based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. Determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The determination of the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise and cancellation behaviors, risk free interest rates, and expected dividends. We estimate the expected life of options granted based on an analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and post vesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the option. Expected volatility is based on the average of historical volatility for the period commensurate with the expected life of the option and the implied volatility of traded options. The risk free interest rate is equal to the U.S. Treasury constant maturity rates for the period equal to the expected life. We do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, our expected dividend yield is zero. In accordance with SFAS No. 123R, we only record stock based compensation expense for awards that are expected to vest. As a result, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited. Although we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience, actual forfeitures may differ. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted when we record a true up for the difference in the period that the awards vest. Contingencies and Litigation We evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. We assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes from a potential claim or legal proceeding, as well as potential ranges of probable losses, when the outcomes of the claims or proceedings are probable and reasonably estimable. A determination of the amount of accrued liabilities required, if any, for these contingencies is made after the analysis of each separate matter. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, we base our estimates on the information available at the time of our assessment. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to its pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Any revisions in the estimates of potential liabilities could have a material impact on our operating results and financial position. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in each jurisdiction in which we operate. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable 34 Table of Contents income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. We are required to compute our income taxes in each federal, state, and international jurisdiction in which we operate. This process requires that we estimate the current tax exposure as well as assess temporary differences between the accounting and tax treatment of assets and liabilities, including items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes. The income tax effects of the differences we identify are classified as current or long term deferred tax assets and liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our judgments, assumptions, and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Operations. We must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income and, based on this assessment, establish a valuation allowance, if required. Our determination of our valuation allowance is based upon a number of assumptions, judgments, and estimates, including forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the valuation allowance in a period, we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease to our tax provision in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, or to goodwill to the extent that the valuation allowance related to tax attributes of the acquired entities. In July 2008, we reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) concerning our eligibility to claim a lower tax rate on a distribution made from a Veritas foreign subsidiary prior to the July 2005 acquisition. The distribution was intended to be made pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and therefore eligible for a 5.25% effective U.S. federal rate of tax, in lieu of the 35% statutory rate. The final impact of this agreement is not yet known since this relates to the taxability of earnings that are otherwise the subject of the tax years 2000 2001 transfer pricing dispute which in turn is being addressed in the U.S. Tax Court. To the extent that we owe taxes as a result of the transfer pricing dispute, we anticipate that the incremental tax due from this negotiated agreement will decrease. We currently estimate that the most probable outcome from this negotiated agreement will be $13 million or less, for which an accrual has already been made. We made a payment of $130 million to the IRS for this matter in May 2006. We applied $110 million of this payment as a deposit on the outstanding transfer pricing matter for the tax years 2000 2001. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Total Net Revenues Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Fiscal 2008 vs. 2007 Fiscal 2009 $ % 2008 $ % 2007 ($ in thousands) Net revenues $ 6,149,854 $ 275,435 5 % $ 5,874,419 $ 675,053 13 % $ 5,199,366 Net revenues increased for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to a $301 million increase in Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenues. This increase was primarily related to increased revenues in our Storage and Server Management and Services segments. In addition, revenues for fiscal 2009 benefited from additional amortization of deferred revenue of approximately $75 million as a result of fiscal 2009 comprising 53 weeks as compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2008. The global economic slowdown has increased competitive pricing pressure and the lead time to close on sales for some of our products. While we cannot predict the intensity or duration of this slowdown, we believe the recurring nature of our business and the mission critical nature of our products position us well in this challenging environment. Net revenues increased for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to a $644 million increase in Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenues coupled with a $31 million increase in Licenses revenues. These increases were primarily related to increased revenues in our Storage and Server Management, Security and Compliance, and Consumer segments as a result of higher beginning deferred revenue balances and increased sales. 35 Table of Contents Included in the increase noted above is $194 million due to the sales of new products and services from our Altiris acquisition for which there is no comparable revenue in the prior period. The increase is also due to a favorable foreign currency impact. We also benefited in fiscal 2008 from a higher deferred revenue balance compared to fiscal 2007. Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenues Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Fiscal 2008 vs. 2007 Fiscal 2009 $ % 2008 $ % 2007 ($ in thousands) Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenues $ 4,862,287 $ 300,721 7 % $ 4,561,566 $ 643,994 16 % $ 3,917,572 Percentage of total revenue 79 % 78 % 75 % Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenues increased for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to an aggregate increase in revenue from the Storage and Server Management and Services segments of $246 million. The increase in these two segments revenue is largely attributable to demand for our Storage and Server Management products and consulting services as a result of increased demand for security and storage solutions. This increased demand was driven by the proliferation of structured and unstructured data, and increasing sales of services in conjunction with our license sales as a result of our focus on offering our customers a more comprehensive IT solution. Furthermore, growth in our customer base through acquisitions and new license sales results in an increase to Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenues because a large number of our customers renew their annual maintenance contracts. Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenues increased in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to an increase of $394 million in revenue related to enterprise products and services, excluding acquired Altiris products. This increase in enterprise product and services revenue was largely attributable to higher amortization of deferred revenue, as a result of our larger deferred revenue balances during fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. In addition, Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenues increased from sales of new products from our Altiris acquisition for which there is no comparable revenue in the prior period. The increase is also due to a favorable foreign currency impact for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. Licenses revenue Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Fiscal 2008 vs. 2007 Fiscal 2009 $ % 2008 $ % 2007 ($ in thousands) Licenses revenues $ 1,287,567 $ (25,286 ) (2 )% $ 1,312,853 $ 31,059 2 % $ 1,281,794 Percentage of total net revenues 21 % 22 % 25 % Licenses revenues decreased slightly for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to a decrease in revenue related to our Security and Compliance products offset by an increase in revenue related to our Storage and Server Management products. The decreases in Security and Compliance license revenues are primarily a result of the challenging economic environment and a decline in demand from small and medium businesses. Offsetting increases in Storage and Server Management license revenues are a result of increased demand for storage solutions driven by the proliferation of structured and unstructured data. Licenses revenue increased in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to an increase from the sales of new products from our Altiris acquisition for which there is no comparable revenue in the prior period and a favorable foreign currency impact. 36 Table of Contents Net revenues and operating income by segment Consumer segment Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Fiscal 2008 vs. 2007 Fiscal 2009 $ % 2008 $ % 2007 ($ in thousands) Consumer revenues $ 1,773,207 $ 27,118 2 % $ 1,746,089 $ 155,584 10 % $ 1,590,505 Percentage of total net revenues 29 % 30 % 30 % Consumer operating income $ 948,090 $ 9,463 1 % $ 938,627 $ 6,638 1 % $ 931,989 Percentage of Consumer revenues 53 % 54 % 59 % Consumer revenues increased for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to an increase from our core consumer security products in our electronic channels, offset by a decrease in our retail channels. Our electronic channels include sales derived from OEMs, subscriptions, upgrades, online sales, and renewals. In addition, Consumer revenues increased from the sale of our consumer services and acquired security products. Consumer revenues increased for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due to an aggregate increase from our core consumer security products in our electronic channels. The increase was also due to a favorable foreign currency impact. Operating income for this segment increased for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008, as the increase in revenue more than offset the increase in expenses. Total expenses for fiscal 2009 increased primarily as a result of the PC Tools acquisition. Operating income for this segment increased for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, as the increase in revenue more than offset the increase in expenses. Total expenses for fiscal 2008 increased primarily as a result of higher OEM placement fees. Security and Compliance Segment Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Fiscal 2008 vs. 2007 Fiscal 2009 $ % 2008 $ % 2007 ($ in thousands) Security and Compliance revenues $ 1,610,835 $ 1,367 0 % $ 1,609,468 $ 200,562 14 % $ 1,408,906 Percentage of total net revenues 26 % 27 % 27 % Security and Compliance operating income $ 520,837 $ 53,988 12 % $ 466,849 $ 97,895 27 % $ 368,954 Percentage of Security and Compliance revenues 32 % 29 % 26 % Security and Compliance revenues were flat for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. Security and Compliance revenues increased for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to sales of new products from our Altiris acquisition for which there is no comparable revenue in the prior period. Included in the total Security and Compliance segment revenue increase for fiscal 2008 is a favorable foreign currencies impact. Operating income for the Security and Compliance segment increased for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008, as expenses decreased while revenue growth remained relatively flat. Total expenses for fiscal 2009 benefited from continued cost containment measures. Operating income for this segment increased for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, as the increase in revenues more than offset the increase in expenses. Total expenses increased primarily as a result of higher salary and commissions which includes the impact of the fiscal 2008 Altiris and Vontu acquisitions. 37 Table of Contents Storage and Server Management Segment Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Fiscal 2008 vs. 2007 Fiscal 2009 $ % 2008 $ % 2007 ($ in thousands) Storage and Server Management revenues $ 2,294,929 $ 158,622 7 % $ 2,136,307 $ 229,700 12 % $ 1,906,607 Percentage of total net revenues 37 % 37 % 37 % Storage and Server Management operating income $ 1,024,393 $ 340,826 50 % $ 683,567 $ 49,574 8 % $ 633,993 Percentage of Storage and Server Management revenues 45 % 32 % 33 % Storage and Server Management revenues increased for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to increased sales of products related to storage management, data protection, disaster recovery and products supporting high availability. The demand for these products is driven by the increase in the proliferation of structured and unstructured data as well as the increasing demand for optimization of storage systems. Storage and Server Management revenues increased for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to increased demand for products related to the standardization and simplification of data center infrastructure and higher amortization of deferred revenue, for the reasons discussed above in Total Net Revenues. Included in the total Storage and Server Management segment revenue increase for fiscal 2008 is a favorable foreign currencies impact. Operating income for the Storage and Server Management segment increased for the fiscal 2009 as compared to the fiscal 2008, as revenue growth was coupled with a decrease in expenses. Total expenses for the fiscal 2009 decreased partly as a result of the fiscal 2008 divestiture of the APM business. Operating income for this segment increased for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, as the increase in revenues more than offset the increase in expenses. Total expenses from our Storage and Server Management segment increased primarily as a result of the impairment of intangible assets related to the APM business of $95 million. Additionally, increases in sales expenses drove costs higher for the Storage and Server Management group. Services Segment Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Fiscal 2008 vs. 2007 Fiscal 2009 $ % 2008 $ % 2007 ($ in thousands) Services revenues $ 469,495 $ 88,875 23 % $ 380,620 $ 87,394 30 % $ 293,226 Percentage of total net revenues 8 % 6 % 6 % Services operating loss $ (442 ) $ 35,659 99 % $ (36,101 ) $ 7,505 17 % $ (43,606 ) Percentage of Services revenues 0 % (9 )% (15 )% Services revenues increased for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to an increase in SaaS revenues as a result of our November 14, 2008 acquisition of MessageLabs. The remaining increase in revenues was in our consulting services and Business Critical Services, as a result of increased demand for more comprehensive software implementation assistance and increased demand for our Business Critical Services. Customers are increasingly purchasing our service offerings in conjunction with the purchase of our products and augmenting the capabilities of their own IT staff with our onsite consultants. Services revenues increased for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to an increase in consulting services as a result of increased demand for a more comprehensive solution by purchasing our service offerings in conjunction with the purchase of our products and the increased desire for customers to augment the capabilities of their own IT staff with our onsite consultants. Services revenues increased as a result of sales of new services from 38 Table of Contents our Altiris acquisition for which there is no comparable revenue in the prior period. In addition, Services revenue increased due to increased demand for our Business Critical Services. The operating loss for the Services segment decreased for the fiscal 2009, as revenue growth exceeded expense growth for the segment. Our focus on margin improvement contributed to the decrease in operating loss. Operating loss for this segment decreased for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, as the increase in revenues more than offset the increase in expenses. Total expenses from our Services segment increased $80 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. The increase is primarily a result of higher salary and wages to support the increase in revenue and includes the impact of the fiscal 2008 Altiris acquisition. Other segment Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Fiscal 2008 vs. 2007 Fiscal 2009 $ % 2008 $ % 2007 ($ in thousands) Other revenues $ 1,388 $ (547 ) (28 )% $ 1,935 $ 1,813 * $ 122 Percentage of total net revenues 0 % 0 % 0 % Other operating loss $ (8,962,788 ) $ (7,512,126 ) * $ (1,450,662 ) $ (79,074 ) 6 % $ (1,371,588 ) Revenue from our Other segment is comprised primarily of sunset products and products nearing the end of their life cycle. Our Other segment also includes general and administrative expenses; amortization of acquired product rights, intangible assets, and other assets; goodwill impairment charges; charges such as stock based compensation and restructuring; and certain indirect costs that are not charged to the other operating segments. The operating loss of our Other segment for fiscal 2009 primarily consists of the $7.4 billion charge related to impairment of goodwill that was recorded during fiscal 2009. Revenues from the Other segment for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 were immaterial. Net revenues by geographic region Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Fiscal 2008 vs. 2007 Fiscal 2009 $ % 2008 $ % 2007 ($ in thousands) Americas (U.S., Canada and Latin America) $ 3,316,132 (1) $ 220,639 7 % $ 3,095,493 (2) $ 254,921 9 % $ 2,840,572(3 ) Percentage of total net revenues 54 % 53 % 55 % EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa) $ 1,957,889 $ (5,430 ) 0 % $ 1,963,319 $ 319,142 19 % $ 1,644,177 Percentage of total net revenues 32 % 33 % 32 % Asia Pacific/Japan $ 875,833 $ 60,226 7 % $ 815,607 $ 100,990 14 % $ 714,617 Percentage of total net revenues 14 % 14 % 14 % Total net revenues $ 6,149,854 $ 5,874,419 $ 5,199,366 (1) Americas includes net revenues from the United States of $3.0 billion, Canada of $176 million, and Latin America of $115 million during fiscal 2009. (2) Americas includes net revenues from the United States of $2.8 billion, Canada of $171 million, and Latin America of $110 million during fiscal 2008. (3) Americas includes net revenues from the United States of $2.6 billion, Canada of $176 million, and Latin America of $104 million during fiscal 2007. Americas revenues increased for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to increased revenues related to our Storage and Server Management and Services segments. In addition, for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008, Americas revenues related to our Consumer segment increased driven by demand for our Consumer segment products suites. 39 Table of Contents EMEA revenues decreased slightly for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to decreased revenues related to our Consumer and Security and Compliance segments as a result of a strengthening U.S. dollar and a decrease in endpoint security product sales to small and medium sized businesses. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenues related to our Storage and Server Management and Services segments. Asia Pacific Japan revenues increased for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to increased revenues related to our Storage and Server Management segment. International revenues increased in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to increased revenues related to our Storage and Server Management and Security and Compliance segments, as a result of increased demand for products related to the standardization and simplification of data center infrastructure and higher amortization of deferred revenue for the reasons described above. These products also contributed to the increased revenues in the Americas in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. Sales of new products from our acquisition of Altiris increased revenues in the international regions and the Americas for which there is no comparable revenue in the prior period. Growth in revenues in international regions and the Americas from sales of our Consumer products was driven by prior period demand for Norton Internet Security products. Foreign currencies had a favorable impact on net revenues in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. Our international sales are and will continue to be a significant portion of our net revenues. As a result, net revenues will continue to be affected by foreign currency exchange rates as compared to the U.S. dollar. While the current global economic slowdown has recently resulted in a strengthening U.S. dollar, we are unable to predict the extent to which revenues in future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If international sales become a greater portion of our total sales in the future, changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have a greater impact on our revenues and operating results. Cost of Revenues Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Fiscal 2008 vs. 2007 Fiscal 2009 $ % 2008 $ % 2007 ($ in thousands) Cost of revenues $ 1,226,927 $ 6,597 1 % $ 1,220,330 $ 4,504 0 % $ 1,215,826 Gross margin 80 % 79 % 77 % Cost of revenues consists primarily of the amortization of acquired product rights, fee based technical support costs, the costs of billable services, payments to OEMs under revenue sharing arrangements, manufacturing and direct material costs, and royalties paid to third parties under technology licensing agreements. Gross margin increased slightly in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to higher revenues and, to a lesser extent, lower OEM royalty payments and distribution costs, partially offset by a year over year increase in technical support costs. Gross margin increased in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 due primarily to an increase in revenue and the fact that the terms of several of our OEM arrangements changed from revenue sharing arrangements to placement fee arrangements in late fiscal 2007. Placement fee arrangements are expensed on an estimated average cost basis, while revenue sharing arrangements are generally amortized ratably over a one year period. In addition, we realized year over year increases in services and technical support costs. Cost of content, subscriptions, and maintenance Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Fiscal 2008 vs. 2007 Fiscal 2009 $ % 2008 $ % 2007 ($ in thousands) Cost of content, subscriptions, and maintenance $ 839,843 $ 13,504 2 % $ 826,339 $ 2,814 0 % $ 823,525 As a percentage of related revenue 17 % 18 % 21 % 40 Table of Contents Cost of content, subscriptions, and maintenance consists primarily of fee based technical support costs, costs of billable services, and payments to OEMs under revenue sharing agreements. Cost of content, subscriptions, and maintenance as a percentage of related revenue for the fiscal 2009 decreased one percentage point as compared to the same period last year. The decrease is primarily driven by higher revenues, lower OEM royalties and distribution costs, partially offset by a year over year increase in technical support costs. Cost of content, subscriptions, and maintenance decreased as a percentage of the related revenue in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. The year over year decrease in cost of content, subscriptions, and maintenance as a percentage of the related revenue is primarily driven by higher revenues and lower OEM royalties as a percentage of revenue more than offsetting increases in Services expenses. Cost of licenses Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Fiscal 2008 vs. 2007 Fiscal 2009 $ % 2008 $ % 2007 ($ in thousands) Cost of licenses $ 34,657 $ (10,007 ) (22 )% $ 44,664 $ (5,304 ) (11 )% $ 49,968 As a percentage of related revenue 3 % 3 % 4 % Cost of licenses consists primarily of royalties paid to third parties under technology licensing agreements and manufacturing and direct material costs. Cost of licenses remained stable as a percentage of the related revenue for the fiscal 2009 as compared to the fiscal 2008. Decreases in manufacturing and site license costs were partially offset by higher royalties. Cost of licenses decreased as a percentage of the related revenue in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. The year over year decrease in Cost of licenses as a percentage of the related revenue is primarily attributable to higher revenues and to a lesser extent due to lower obsolescence reserves. Fiscal 2007 had relatively high obsolescence reserves due to our decision to exit certain aspects of the appliance business. Amortization of acquired product rights Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Fiscal 2008 vs. 2007 Fiscal 2009 $ % 2008 $ % 2007 ($ in thousands) Amortization of acquired product rights $ 352,427 $ 3,100 1 % $ 349,327 $ 6,994 2 % $ 342,333 Percentage of total net revenues 6 % 6 % 7 % Acquired product rights are comprised of developed technologies and patents from acquired companies. The increase in amortization for the fiscal 2009 as compared to the fiscal 2008 is primarily due to amortization associated with SwapDrive, PC Tools and MessageLabs acquisitions during the fiscal 2009 periods offset in part by the APM business divestiture in the fiscal 2008 period. The amortization in fiscal 2008 was higher than fiscal 2007 primarily due to amortization associated with the Altiris acquisition, offset in part by certain acquired product rights becoming fully amortized. For further discussion of acquired product rights and related amortization, see Notes 5 and 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report. Operating Expenses Operating expenses overview As discussed above under Our Business, our operating expenses for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 were adversely impacted by an additional week during fiscal 2009. Our international expenses during the fiscal 41 Table of Contents 2009 were favorably impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies during fiscal 2008 and by the 2009 restructuring plan. In addition, our ongoing cost and expense discipline positively contributed to our increased operating margins for the fiscal 2009 periods. Our operating expenses for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 were adversely impacted by higher international expenses resulting from the U.S. dollar weakening in comparison to foreign currencies coupled with additional headcount resulting from acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by our 2008 restructuring plan initiatives and our ongoing cost and expense discipline. Sales and marketing expense Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Fiscal 2008 vs. 2007 Fiscal 2009 $ % 2008 $ % 2007 ($ in thousands) Sales and marketing $ 2,385,987 $ (29,277 ) (1 )% $ 2,415,264 $ 407,613 20 % $ 2,007,651 Percentage of total net revenues 39 % 41 % 39 % As a percent of net revenues, sales and marketing expenses decreased to 39% for the fiscal 2009 as compared to 41% for the fiscal 2008 as a result of the factors discussed above under Operating expenses overview. Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenues increased to 41% in fiscal 2008 as compared to 39% in fiscal 2007. The percentage increase and increase in absolute dollars in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 is primarily due to higher employee compensation expense as a result of the Altiris and Vontu acquisitions and the OEM placement fees as discussed above under Financial Results and Trends. We negotiated new contract terms with some of our OEM partners in fiscal 2007, for which the expense commenced being recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. In addition, these new contract terms had the effect of moving our OEM payments from Cost of revenues to Operating expenses. Research and development expense Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Fiscal 2008 vs. 2007 Fiscal 2009 $ % 2008 $ % 2007 ($ in thousands) Research and development $ 879,702 $ (15,540 ) (2 )% $ 895,242 $ 28,360 3 % $ 866,882 Percentage of total net revenues 14 % 15 % 17 % As a percent of net revenues, research and development expense has remained relatively constant in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008. Research and development expense as a percentage of total revenues has remained relatively constant in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007. The increase in absolute dollars in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 is attributable to a higher employee compensation expense primarily related to the Altiris and Vontu acquisitions. General and administrative expense Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Fiscal 2008 vs. 2007 Fiscal 2009 $ % 2008 $ % 2007 ($ in thousands) General and administrative $ 342,805 $ (4,837 ) (1 )% $ 347,642 $ 30,859 10 % $ 316,783 Percentage of total net revenues 6 % 6 % 6 % General and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenues has remained relatively constant in fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008, and fiscal 2007. The decrease in general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2009 as compared with the fiscal 2008 is primarily due to items discussed above under Operating expenses overview. The increase in 42 Table of Contents general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2008 as compared with fiscal 2007 is primarily due to higher salaries and wages resulting from the Altiris and Vontu acquisitions offset by a gradual reduction in headcount during fiscal 2008. Amortization of other purchased intangible assets Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Fiscal 2008 vs. 2007 Fiscal 2009 $ % 2008 $ % 2007 ($ in thousands) Amortization of other purchased intangible assets $ 233,461 $ 8,330 4 % $ 225,131 $ 23,629 12 % $ 201,502 Percentage of total net revenues 4 % 4 % 4 % Other purchased intangible assets are comprised of customer base and tradenames. Amortization for the fiscal 2009 compared to the fiscal 2008 remained relatively stable. The increased amortization in fiscal 2008 is primarily associated with a full year of amortization of intangible assets associated with the Altiris purchase which occurred in April 2007. Restructuring Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Fiscal 2008 vs. 2007 Fiscal 2009 $ % 2008 $ % 2007 ($ in thousands) Severance $ 63,776 $ 4,443 $ 59,333 $ (7,660 ) $ 66,993 Facilities and other 10,830 (3,751 ) 14,581 11,338 3,243 Transition, transformation and other costs 21,010 21,010 (744 ) 744 Restructuring $ 95,616 $ 21,702 29 % $ 73,914 $ 2,934 4 % $ 70,980 Percentage of total net revenues 2 % 1 % 1 % In connection with the restructuring plans described in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report, restructuring charges increased to $96 million for fiscal 2009 from $74 million in fiscal 2008. The 2009 restructuring amount primarily consisted of severance charges of $64 million largely related to the 2009 Plan (as defined in Note 9) reduction in force and the 2008 Plan business structure changes, $21 million related to the outsourcing of back office functions to various third party outsourcers and $11 million related to facilities costs associated with earlier acquisitions. The 2008 amount primarily consisted of severance charges of $59 million largely related to the reduction in force actions in both the 2008 Plan and 2007 Plan (each as defined in Note 9) and $15 million related to facilities costs associated with earlier acquisitions. Restructuring charges increased slightly in fiscal 2008 from $71 million in fiscal 2007. The 2007 amount primarily consisted of severance charges related to the 2007 Plan reduction in force. Total remaining costs for the 2008 Plan are estimated to range from $25 million to $55 million. Total remaining costs for the transition activities associated with outsourcing back office functions are estimated to be approximately $40 million. Total remaining costs related to the 2009 Plan and 2007 Plan are not expected to be material. 43 Table of Contents Impairment of goodwill and Impairment of assets held for sale Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Fiscal 2008 vs. 2007 Fiscal 2009 $ % 2008 $ % 2007 ($ in thousands) Impairment of goodwill $ 7,418,574 $ 7,418,574 100 % $ $ 0 % $ Percentage of total net revenues 121 % 0 % 0 % Impairment of assets held for sale $ 46,592 $ (49,224 ) (51 )% $ 95,816 $ 95,816 0 % $ Percentage of total net revenues 1 % 2 % 0 % Based on a combination of factors, including the current economic environment and a decline in our market capitalization, we concluded that there were sufficient indicators to require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis during the third quarter of fiscal 2009. The analysis was not completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2009 and an estimated impairment charge of $7.0 billion was recorded. The analysis was subsequently finalized and an additional impairment charge of $413 million was included in our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. As a result, we incurred a total impairment charge of $7.4 billion for fiscal 2009. We also performed our annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and determined that no additional impairment charge was necessary. For the purposes of this analysis, our estimates of fair value are based on a combination of the income approach, and the market approach. The income approach estimates the fair value of our reporting units based on the future discounted cash flows. We also consider the market approach, which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based on comparable market prices. During the year ended April 3, 2009, we recognized an impairment of $47 million on certain land and buildings classified as held for sale. SFAS No. 144 provides that a long lived asset classified as held for sale should be measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. During the year ended March 28, 2007, we determined that the APM business in the Storage and Server Management segment did not meet the long term strategic objectives of the segment. As such, we recognized an impairment of $96 million, primarily due to sale of the APM business during fiscal 2008. Patent settlement Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Fiscal 2008 vs. 2007 Fiscal 2009 $ % 2008 $ % 2007 ($ in thousands) Patent settlement $ (9,900 ) $ (9,900 ) 100 % $ $ 0 % $ Percentage of total net revenues 0 % 0 % 0 % During the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we settled a patent lawsuit in which the result was a gain of approximately $10 million reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Operations under the caption Patent settlement. 44 Table of Contents Non operating Income and Expense Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Fiscal 2008 vs. 2007 Fiscal 2009 $ % 2008 $ % 2007 ($ in thousands) Interest income $ 37,054 $ 76,896 $ 122,043 Interest expense (29,705 ) (29,480 ) (27,233 ) Impairment of marketable securities (3,658 ) Settlements of litigation, net 58,500 Other income, net 12,041 4,327 17,070 Total $ 15,732 $ (94,511 ) (86 )% $ 110,243 $ (1,637 ) (1 )% $ 111,880 Interest income decreased during fiscal years 2009 and 2008 primarily due to lower average cash balances outstanding and lower average yields on our invested cash and short term investment balances. We expect that our interest expense will increase with the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) FSP APB No. 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement). Please see Newly Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements below. Interest expense is primarily related to the interest and amortization of issuance costs related to our 0.75% and 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes issued in June 2006. Fiscal 2007 also includes interest and accretion related to the 0.25% Convertible Subordinated Notes that we assumed in connection with our acquisition of Veritas, which were paid in full during August 2006. In fiscal 2008, we recorded a net gain from Settlements of litigation. Other income, net includes a net gain of foreign currency for fiscal 2009, while fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 include net foreign currency losses. In fiscal 2007, Other income, net includes a gain of $20 million on the sale of our buildings in Milpitas, California, and Maidenhead, United Kingdom. Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal 2009 2008 2007 ($ in thousands) Provision for income taxes $ 221,630 $ 248,673 $ 227,242 Effective tax rate on earnings (3 )% 35 % 36 % Our effective tax rate was approximately (3)%, 35%, and 36% in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The tax provision for fiscal 2009 includes a $56 million net tax benefit associated with the impairment of goodwill charge of $7.4 billion, materially impacting the overall effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 otherwise reflects the benefits of lower taxed foreign earnings and losses from the joint venture, domestic manufacturing tax incentives, and research and development credits. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 reflects the impact of non deductible stock based compensation offset by U.S. tax benefits from domestic manufacturing deductions. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 reflects the impact of non deductible stock based compensation offset by foreign earnings taxed at a lower rate than the U.S. tax rate. The $56 million net tax benefit arising from the impairment of goodwill during the year consists of a $112 million tax benefit from elements of tax deductible goodwill, net of a $56 million tax provision to increase our valuation allowances for certain deferred tax assets in a foreign jurisdiction that will require an extended period of time to realize. The valuation allowance increased by $63 million in total in fiscal 2009 and totals $101 million as of April 3, 2009. As a result of the impairment of goodwill, we have cumulative pre tax book losses, as measured by the current and prior two years. We considered the negative evidence of this cumulative pre tax book loss position on our ability to continue to recognize deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income for realization. Levels of 45 Table of Contents future taxable income are subject to the various risks and uncertainties discussed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, set forth in this annual report. We considered the following as positive evidence: the vast majority of the goodwill impairment is not deductible for tax purposes and thus will not result in tax losses; we have a strong, consistent taxpaying history; we have substantial U.S. federal income tax carryback potential; and we have substantial amounts of scheduled future reversals of taxable temporary differences from our deferred tax liabilities. We have concluded that this positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence and, thus, that the deferred tax assets as of April 3, 2009 of $702 million, after application of the valuation allowances, are realizable on a more likely than not basis. Other tax matters On March 29, 2006, we received a Notice of Deficiency from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) claiming that we owe $867 million of additional taxes, excluding interest and penalties, for the 2000 and 2001 tax years based on an audit of Veritas. On June 26, 2006, we filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court protesting the IRS claim for such additional taxes. In the March 2007 quarter, we agreed to pay $7 million out of $35 million originally assessed by the IRS in connection with several of the lesser issues covered in the assessment. The IRS agreed to waive the assessment of penalties. During July 2008, we completed the trial phase of the Tax Court case, which dealt with the remaining issue covered in the assessment. At trial, the IRS changed its position with respect to this remaining issue, decreasing the remaining amount at issue from $832 million to $545 million, excluding interest. We filed our post trial briefs in October 2008 and rebuttal briefs in November 2008 with the U.S. Tax Court. We strongly believe the IRS position with regard to this matter is inconsistent with applicable tax laws and existing Treasury regulations, and that our previously reported income tax provision for the years in question is appropriate. If, upon resolution, the final assessment differs from our tax provision the adjustment, including interest, would be accounted for through income tax expense in the period the matter is resolved, with the application of SFAS No. 141(Revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141(R)) effective in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2010. On March 30, 2006, we received notices of proposed adjustments from the IRS with regard to an unrelated audit of Symantec for fiscal 2003 and 2004. The IRS claimed that we owed an incremental tax liability with regard to this audit of $110 million, excluding penalties and interest. The incremental tax liability primarily relates to transfer pricing matters between Symantec and a foreign subsidiary. On September 5, 2006, we executed a closing agreement with the IRS with respect to the audit of Symantecs fiscal 2003 and 2004 federal income tax returns. The closing agreement represents the final assessment by the IRS of additional tax for these fiscal years of approximately $35 million, including interest. Based on the final settlement, a tax benefit of $8 million was recognized. In July 2008, we reached an agreement with the IRS concerning our eligibility to claim a lower tax rate on a distribution made from a Veritas foreign subsidiary prior to the July 2005 acquisition. The distribution was intended to be made pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and therefore eligible for a 5.25% effective U.S. federal rate of tax, in lieu of the 35% statutory rate. The final impact of this agreement is not yet known since this relates to the taxability of earnings that are otherwise the subject of the tax years 2000 2001 transfer pricing dispute which in turn is being addressed in the U.S. Tax Court. To the extent that we owe taxes as a result of the transfer pricing dispute, we anticipate that the incremental tax due from this negotiated agreement will decrease. We currently estimate that the most probable outcome from this negotiated agreement will be $13 million or less, for which an accrual has already been made. We made a payment of $130 million to the IRS for this matter in May 2006. We have applied $110 million of this payment as a deposit on the outstanding transfer pricing matter for the tax years 2000 2001. In connection with the note hedge transactions discussed in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report, we established a deferred tax asset of approximately $232 million to account for the book tax basis difference in the convertible notes resulting from note hedge transactions. The establishment of the deferred tax asset has been accounted for as an increase to additional paid in capital. As a result of the adoption of FSP APB No. 14 1 in the June 2009 quarter, book and tax basis in the convertible notes will be comparable, and as a result, this deferred tax asset will be adjusted through additional paid in capital, as part of the adoption. 46 Table of Contents The Company adopted the provisions of FASB FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, effective March 31, 2007. FIN 48 addresses the accounting for and disclosure of uncertainty in income tax positions, by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to satisfy before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 was a decrease in tax reserves of $16 million, resulting in a decrease in Veritas goodwill of $10 million, an increase of $5 million to Accumulated earnings balance, and a $1 million increase in Additional paid in capital. Upon adoption, the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits as of March 31, 2007 was $456 million, exclusive of interest and penalties. Loss from joint venture Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Fiscal 2008 vs. 2007 Fiscal 2009 $ % 2008 $ % 2007 ($ in thousands) Loss from joint venture $ 53,062 $ 53,062 100 % $ $ 0 % $ Percentage of total net revenues 1 % 0 % 0 % On February 5, 2008, Symantec formed Huawei Symantec, Inc. (joint venture) with a subsidiary of Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. (Huawei). The joint venture is domiciled in Hong Kong with principal operations in Chengdu, China. The joint venture develops, manufactures, markets and supports security and storage appliances to global telecommunications carriers and enterprise customers. As described further in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report, we account for our investment in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting. Under this method, we record our proportionate share of the joint ventures net income or loss based on the quarterly financial statements of the joint venture. We record our proportionate share of net income or loss one quarter in arrears. For the fiscal 2009, we recorded a loss of approximately $53 million related to our share of the joint ventures net loss incurred for the period from February 5, 2008 (its date of inception) to December 31, 2008. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Sources of Cash We have historically relied primarily on cash flows from operations, borrowings under a credit facility, issuances of convertible notes and equity securities for our liquidity needs. Key sources of cash include earnings from operations and existing cash, cash equivalents, short term investments, and our revolving credit facility. In fiscal 2007, we entered into a five year $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in July 2011. During fiscal 2008, we borrowed $200 million under the credit facility. In order to be able to draw on the credit facility, we must maintain certain covenants, including a specified ratio of debt to earnings (before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and impairments) as well as various other non financial covenants. As of April 3, 2009, we were in compliance with all required covenants, and there was no outstanding balance on the credit facility. As of April 3, 2009, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.8 billion and short term investments of $199 million resulting in a net liquidity position, defined as unused availability of the credit facility, cash and cash equivalents and short term investments, of approximately $3.0 billion. We believe that our existing cash balances, cash that we generate over time from operations, and our borrowing capacity will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. 47 Table of Contents Uses of Cash Our principal cash requirements include working capital, capital expenditures, payments of principal and interest on our debt and payments of taxes. In addition, we regularly evaluate our ability to repurchase stock, pay debts and acquire other businesses. Revolving credit facility. In early fiscal 2009, we repaid the entire $200 million principal amount, plus $3 million of accrued interest, that we borrowed during fiscal 2008 under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Acquisition Related. We generally use cash to fund the acquisition of other businesses and from time to time use our revolving credit facility when necessary. We acquired six companies for cash totaling $1.1 billion in fiscal 2009, three companies for approximately $1.4 billion in fiscal 2008 and two companies for approximately $46 million in fiscal 2007. Also in fiscal 2008, we entered into a joint venture with Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. and contributed $150 million in cash. Convertible Senior Notes. In June 2006, we issued $1.1 billion principal amount of 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2011, and $1.0 billion principal amount of 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes (collectively the Senior Notes) due June 15, 2013, to initial purchasers in a private offering for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC Rule 144A. Concurrently with the issuance of the Senior Notes, we entered into note hedge transactions for $592 million with affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers whereby we have the option to purchase up to 110 million shares of our common stock at a price of $19.12 per share. Stock Repurchases. During fiscal 2009, we repurchased 42 million shares, or $700 million, of our common stock. As of April 3, 2009, we have $300 million remaining under the plan authorized by the Board of Directors in June 2007. During fiscal 2008, we repurchased a total of 81 million shares, or $1.5 billion, of our common stock. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 162 million shares, or $2.8 billion, of our common stock. Cash Flows The following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, selected items in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: Fiscal 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in) Operating activities $ 1,670,598 $ 1,818,653 $ 1,666,235 Investing activities (961,937 ) (1,526,218 ) (222,455 ) Financing activities (676,107 ) (1,065,553 ) (1,309,567 ) Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities of $1.7 billion during fiscal 2009 primarily resulted from non cash charges related to depreciation and amortization expenses of $837 million and the $7.4 billion goodwill impairment charge offset by the net loss of $6.7 billion. Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2008 resulted largely from net income of $464 million adjusted for non cash items depreciation and amortization charges of $824 million, stock based compensation expense of $164 million, income taxes payable of $197 million and an increase in deferred revenue of $127 million. These 2008 amounts were partially offset by a decrease in non cash deferred income taxes of $180 million. Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2007 resulted largely from net income of $404 million adjusted for non cash items depreciation and amortization of $811 million, stock based compensation expense of $154 million and an increase in deferred revenue of $400 million. These 2007 amounts were partially offset by a decrease in income taxes payable of $182 million, primarily due to the timing of tax payments. 48 Table of Contents Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities of $1.0 billion in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to an aggregate payment of $1.1 billion in cash payments for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and $272 million paid for capital expenditures, partially offset by net proceeds of $336 million from the sale of short term investments which were used to partially fund acquisitions. Net cash used in investing activities of $1.5 billion for 2008 was primarily related to an aggregate payment of $1.2 billion in cash paid for acquisitions and the joint venture, net of cash acquired. Net cash used in investing activities of $222 million in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to a net increase in capital expenditures of $298 million and $46 million in cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, partially offset by the net proceeds from sales of short term investments of $123 million. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities of $676 million in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to stock repurchases of 42 million shares of our common stock for $700 million and the repayment of $200 million on our revolving credit facility, partially offset by net proceeds of $229 million received from the issuance of our common stock through employee stock plans. Net cash used in financing activities of $1.1 billion in fiscal 2008 was primarily related to the repurchase of 81 million shares of our common stock for $1.5 billion, partially offset by the net proceeds of $224 million received from the issuance of our common stock through employee stock plans and a borrowing of $200 million on our revolving credit facility. Net cash used in financing activities of $1.3 billion in fiscal 2007 was primarily related to the repurchase of 162 million shares of our common stock for $2.8 billion, the purchase of note hedges for $592 million and repayment of the Veritas notes for $520 million; partially offset by $2.1 billion proceeds from the issuance of our Senior Notes, proceeds from the sale of common stock warrants of $326 million and $230 million proceeds from the issuance of our common stock through employee stock plans. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of April 3, 2009: Payments Due by Period Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2015 Total Fiscal 2010 and 2012 and 2014 and Thereafter Other (In thousands) Convertible Senior Notes(1) $ 2,100,000 $ $ 1,100,000 $ 1,000,000 $ $ Interest payments on Convertible Senior Notes(1) 59,959 18,250 29,814 11,895 Purchase obligations(2) 443,880 394,848 48,865 167 Operating leases(3) 426,609 93,203 128,580 90,394 114,432 Norton royalty agreement(4) 10,830 5,311 5,033 186 300 Uncertain tax positions(5) 522,384 522,384 Total contractual obligations $ 3,563,662 $ 511,612 $ 1,312,292 $ 1,102,642 $ 114,732 $ 522,384 (1) Senior Notes are due in fiscal 2012 and 2014. Holders of the Senior Notes may convert their Senior Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of our common stock, up to the principal amount of the note. Amounts in excess of the principal amount, if any, may be paid in cash or in stock at our option. As of April 3, 2009, the conditions to conversion had not been met. Interest payments were calculated based on terms of the related notes. 49 Table of Contents (2) These amounts are associated with agreements for purchases of goods or services generally including agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The table above also includes agreements to purchase goods or services that have cancellation provisions requiring little or no payment. The amounts under such contracts are included in the table above because management believes that cancellation of these contracts is unlikely and the Company expects to make future cash payments according to the contract terms or in similar amounts for similar materials. (3) We have entered into various non cancelable operating lease agreements that expire on various dates through 2029. The amounts in the table above include $27 million related to exited or excess facility costs related to restructuring activities. (4) In June 2007, we amended an existing royalty agreement with Peter Norton for the licensing of certain publicity rights. As a result, we recorded a long term liability reflecting the net present value of expected future royalty payments due to Mr. Norton. (5) As of April 3, 2009, we reflected $522 million in long term taxes payable related to uncertain tax benefits. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond the next twelve months due to uncertainties in the timing of the commencement and settlement of potential tax audits and controversies. Indemnifications As permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at our request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is not limited; however, we have directors and officers insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and may enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal. We provide limited product warranties and the majority of our software license agreements contain provisions that indemnify licensees of our software from damages and costs resulting from claims alleging that our software infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party. Historically, payments made under these provisions have been immaterial. We monitor the conditions that are subject to indemnification to identify if a loss has occurred. Newly Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In April 2009, the FASB issued (1) FSP FAS 115 2 and FSP FAS 124 2, which provides guidance on determining other than temporary impairments for debt securities; and (2) FSP FAS 107 1 and FSP APB 28 1, which provides additional fair value disclosures for financial instruments in interim periods. Each of these FSPs are effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. We do not expect the adoption of these FSPs to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2008, the FASB issued EITF Issue No. 07 5, Determining Whether an Instrument (or an Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entitys Own Stock. EITF Issue No. 07 5 provides guidance on evaluating whether an equity linked financial instrument (or embedded feature) is indexed to a companys own stock, including evaluating the instruments contingent exercise and settlement provisions. EITF Issue No. 07 5 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. We are currently assessing the impact of EITF Issue No. 07 5 on our consolidated financial statements. In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP APB No. 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement). The FSP will require the issuer of convertible debt instruments with cash settlement features to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument. The debt will be recognized at the present value of its cash flows discounted using the issuers nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the time of issuance. The equity component will be recognized as the difference between the proceeds from the issuance of the note and the fair value of the liability. The FSP will also require interest to be accreted as interest expense of the resultant debt discount over the expected life of the debt. 50 Table of Contents The transition guidance requires retrospective application to all periods presented, and does not grandfather existing instruments. The guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those years. As such, we will adopt the FSP in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. Our 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2011, and our 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2013 (collectively the Senior Notes), each issued in June 2006, are subject to the FSP. Upon adoption, we will record a debt discount, which will be amortized to interest expense through maturity of the Senior Notes. Although we have not completed our evaluation of the impact of adoption, we expect to retrospectively adjust the original carrying amount of the Senior Notes as of June 2006 to reflect a discount of approximately $586 million on the date of issuance, with an offsetting increase in additional paid in capital of approximately $354 million and a decrease in deferred tax assets of approximately $232 million. Excluding the corresponding impact of income taxes, we expect to retrospectively record an increase in non cash interest expense of approximately $91 million in fiscal 2008 and approximately $97 million in fiscal 2009. As a result of applying the FSP, we also expect non cash interest expense in fiscal 2010 to increase by approximately $104 million, excluding the corresponding impact of income taxes. The additional non cash interest expense will have no impact on the total operating, investing and financing cash flows in prior periods or in future consolidated statements of cash flows. If future interpretations of, or changes to, the FSP necessitate a further change in these reporting practices, our previously reported and future results of operations could be adversely affected. In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. SFAS No. 162 defines the order in which accounting principles that are generally accepted should be followed. SFAS No. 162 is effective 60 days following the SECs approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) amendments to AU Section 411, The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 162 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In April 2008, the FASB finalized FSP No. 142 3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets. The position amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under FASB SFAS No. 142. The position applies to intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets and both intangible assets acquired in business combinations and asset acquisitions. FSP 142 3 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of FSP 142 3 on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51. The standard changes the accounting for noncontrolling (minority) interests in consolidated financial statements including the requirements to classify noncontrolling interests as a component of consolidated stockholders equity, to identify earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests reported as part of consolidated earnings, and to measure gain or loss on the deconsolidated subsidiary using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment. Additionally, SFAS No. 160 revises the accounting for both increases and decreases in a parents controlling ownership interest. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, with early adoption prohibited. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 160 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R). This standard changes the accounting for business combinations by requiring that an acquiring entity measures and recognizes identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions. The changes include the treatment of acquisition related transaction costs, the valuation of any noncontrolling interest at acquisition date fair value, the recording of acquired contingent liabilities at acquisition date fair value and the subsequent re measurement of such liabilities after acquisition date, the recognition of capitalized in process research and development, the accounting for acquisition related restructuring cost accruals subsequent to the acquisition date, and the recognition of changes in the acquirers income tax valuation allowance. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, with early adoption prohibited. We are currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) on our consolidated financial statements. The accounting treatment related to pre acquisition uncertain tax positions will change when SFAS No. 141(R) becomes effective, which will be in the first quarter of 51 Table of Contents our fiscal year 2010. At such time, any changes to the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions related to pre acquisition periods will be recorded through income tax expense, where currently the accounting treatment would require any adjustment to be recognized through the purchase price. In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 141(R) 1, Accounting for Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination That Arise from Contingencies. FSP No. FAS 141(R) 1 provides guidance on the accounting and disclosure of contingencies acquired or assumed in a business combination. FSP No. FAS 141(R) 1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of FSP No. FAS 141(R) 1 on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 14 for further details. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, including an amendment of SFAS No. 115. SFAS No. 159 permits companies to choose to measure certain financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and requires unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected to be reported in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Effective March 29, 2008, we adopted SFAS 159, but we have not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments as of April 3, 2009. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. 157 2, The Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, which delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually), until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. These nonfinancial items include assets and liabilities such as reporting units measured at fair value in a goodwill impairment test and nonfinancial assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Effective March 29, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157 for financial assets and liabilities recognized at fair value on a recurring basis. The partial adoption of SFAS No. 157 for financial assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 157 3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active. FSP No. FAS 157 3 provides examples to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active. FSP No. FAS 157 3 is effective upon issuance. The adoption of the FSP did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 157 4, Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly. FSP No. FAS 157 4 provides guidance on estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased and determining when a transaction is not orderly. FSP No. FAS 157 4 is effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. We do not expect adoption of the FSP to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 2 for information and related disclosures regarding our fair value measurements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to various market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity prices. We may use derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain risks in accordance with our investment and foreign exchange policies. We do not use derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio and the potential losses arising from changes in interest rates. Our investment objective is to achieve the maximum return compatible with capital preservation and our liquidity requirements. Our strategy is to invest our cash in a manner that preserves capital, maintains sufficient liquidity to meet our cash requirements, maximizes yields consistent with approved credit risk, and limits inappropriate concentrations of investment by sector, credit, or issuer. We classify our cash equivalents and short term investments in accordance with SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in 52 Table of Contents Debt and Equity Securities. We consider investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. We classify our short term investments as available for sale, and short term investments consist of marketable debt or equity securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days. Our cash equivalents and short term investment portfolios consist primarily of money market funds, commercial paper, corporate debt securities, and U.S. government and government sponsored debt securities. Our short term investments do not include equity investments in privately held companies. Our short term investments are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in Accumulated other comprehensive income within Stockholders equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amortization of premiums and discounts on the investments, realized gains and losses, and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available for sale securities are included in Other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We use the specific identification method to determine cost in calculating realized gains and losses upon sale of short term investments. The following table presents the fair value and hypothetical changes in fair values on short term investments sensitive to changes in interest rates (in millions): Value of Securities Given an Value of Securities Given an Interest Interest Rate Increase of Rate Decrease of X X Basis Points (bps) Fair Value Basis Points (bps) 150 bps 100 bps 50 bps As of (25 bps) (75 bps) April 3, 2009 $ 680 $ 680 $ 680 $ 680 $ 681 $ 681 March 28, 2008 $ 1,301 $ 1,302 $ 1,304 $ 1,305 $ 1,305 $ 1,306 The modeling technique used above measures the change in fair market value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus 150 bps, plus 100 bps, plus 50 bps, minus 25 bps, and minus 75 bps. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We conduct business in 40 currencies through our worldwide operations and, as such, we are exposed to foreign currency exposure risk. Foreign currency risks are associated with our cash and cash equivalents, investments, receivables, and payables denominated in foreign currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates will result in foreign exchange gains and losses on these foreign currency assets and liabilities and are included in Other income, net. Our objective in managing foreign exchange activity is to preserve stockholder value by minimizing the risk of foreign currency exchange rate changes. Our strategy is to primarily utilize forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures. Under our program, gains and losses in our foreign currency exposures are offset by losses and gains on our forward contracts. Our forward contracts generally have terms of one to six months. At the end of the reporting period, open contracts are marked to market with unrealized gains and losses included in Other income, net. The following table presents a sensitivity analysis on our foreign forward exchange contract portfolio using a statistical model to estimate the potential gain or loss in fair value that could arise from hypothetical appreciation or depreciation of foreign currency (in millions): Value of Value of Contracts Contracts Given X% Given X% Appreciation of Depreciation of Foreign Foreign Currency Notional Currency Foreign Forward Exchange Contracts 10% 5% Amount (5)% (10)% Purchased, April 3, 2009 $ 264 $ 252 $ 240 $ 228 $ 216 Sold, April 3, 2009 $ 320 $ 337 $ 355 $ 373 $ 391 Purchased, March 28, 2008 $ 196 $ 189 $ 180 $ 171 $ 160 Sold, March 28, 2008 $ 352 $ 369 $ 387 $ 407 $ 430 53 Table of Contents Equity Price Risk In June 2006, we issued $1.1 billion principal amount of 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2011 and $1.0 billion of 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013. Holders may convert their Senior Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of Symantec common stock, up to the principal amount of the note. Amounts in excess of the principal amount, if any, may be paid in cash or in stock at our option. Concurrent with the issuance of the Senior Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions and separately, warrant transactions, to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the Senior Notes and to mitigate any negative effect such conversion may have on the price of our common stock. For business and strategic purposes, we also hold equity interests in several privately held companies, many of which can be considered to be in the start up or development stages. These investments are inherently risky and we could lose a substantial part or our entire investment in these companies. These investments are recorded at cost and classified as Other long term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of April 3, 2009, these investments had an aggregate carrying value of $3 million.
