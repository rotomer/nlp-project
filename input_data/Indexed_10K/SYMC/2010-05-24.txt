Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW Our Business Symantec is a global provider of security, storage and systems management solutions that help businesses and consumers secure and manage their information. We provide customers worldwide with software and services that protect, manage and control information risks related to security, data protection, storage, compliance, and systems management. We help our customers manage cost, complexity and compliance by protecting their IT infrastructure as they seek to maximize value from their IT investments. Fiscal Calendar We have a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Friday closest to March 31. Unless otherwise stated, references to fiscal years in this report relate to fiscal year and periods ended April 2, 2010, April 3, 2009 and March 28, 2008. Fiscal 2010 and 2008 each consisted of 52 weeks, while fiscal 2009 consisted of 53 weeks. Our 2011 fiscal year will consist of 52 weeks and will end on April 1, 2011. Our Operating Segments Our operating segments are significant strategic business units that offer different products and services, distinguished by customer needs. Since the March 2008 quarter, we have operated in five operating segments: Consumer, Security and Compliance, Storage and Server Management, Services, and Other. During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we changed our reporting segments to better align to our operating structure, resulting in the Enterprise Vault products that were formerly included in the Security and Compliance segment being moved to the Storage and Server Management segment. Also, our SaaS offerings moved to either the Security and Compliance segment or the Storage and Server Management segment from the Services segment, based on the nature of the service delivered. As a result, the revenue contribution from our SaaS offering primarily benefited our Security and Compliance segment following the move. We revised the segment information for the prior year to conform to the new presentation. For further descriptions of our operating segments, see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report. Our reportable segments are the same as our operating segments. Financial Results and Trends Revenue decreased for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The challenging economic environment resulted in corporate IT budgets being reduced and spending has slowed from previous levels. Smaller IT budgets have led some of our corporate customers to purchase smaller volumes of our products, particularly in the Storage and Server Management segment. In addition, our storage business within the Storage and Server Management segment has 28 Table of Contents been adversely affected for the last several quarters by the deceleration of demand in the server market. Additionally, we were also particularly affected by lower new license sales of our storage products on the Solaris platform. If the economic conditions affecting global markets continue or IT spending remains tight, we may continue to experience slower or negative revenue growth and our business and operating results might suffer. In light of these economic conditions, we will continue to align our cost structure with our revenue expectations. During fiscal 2010, we experienced significantly higher year over year OEM placement fee payments resulting from an increase in PC unit shipments on which our products were bundled. These increased payments had an adverse impact on our operating income and operating margins during the fiscal 2010 periods, particularly for our Consumer segment. We expect to see the revenue benefit from these increased placement fees in future periods. We launched a new, internally developed and operated eCommerce platform during fiscal 2010 that will replace the current online store for the companys Norton branded consumer products worldwide, excluding Japan. We believe this will improve our ability to identify and capitalize on emerging customer needs and market trends and enhance the end to end experience our customers have with us. We have been transitioning customers to the new online store in a phased approach. The new online store is gradually ramping up worldwide coverage and is expected to reach full capacity by June 30, 2010. The development and roll out of our new eCommerce platform adversely affected the operating margins for our Consumer segment during fiscal 2010. The fees we have paid to Digital River have historically been recorded as an offset to revenue. As a result of bringing the eCommerce business in house, our consumer revenue is expected to increase due to the elimination of this offset to revenue. We expect revenue to increase in the range of $80 to $100 million in fiscal 2011 from this change. Conversely, the cost of running our own eCommerce platform will be classified primarily in operating expenses with some amounts flowing through cost of revenue. Therefore, operating expenses and cost of goods sold will both rise by a corresponding amount in 2011 and we believe the net impact to earnings per share for 2011 will be neutral. Over time, we expect our new eCommerce strategy to increase consumer operating margins. We expect to capture the differential between what we have traditionally paid Digital River and the ongoing cost of operating our own eCommerce platform. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies favorably impacted our international revenue by approximately $14 million for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Foreign currency fluctuations had relatively little overall impact on our international revenue growth for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. We are unable to predict the extent to which revenue in future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If our level of international sales and expenses increase in the future, changes in foreign exchange rates may have a potentially greater impact on our revenue and operating results. As discussed above under Fiscal Calendar, fiscal 2010 and 2008 consisted of 52 weeks, whereas fiscal 2009 consisted of 53 weeks. The extra week contributed to additional amortization of deferred revenue of approximately $75 million in fiscal 2009. Our net income was $714 million for fiscal 2010 and was positively impacted by a decrease of $128 million in cost of revenue related to certain acquired product rights from our acquisition of Veritas becoming fully amortized during the first quarter of our fiscal 2010. Net income was also positively impacted by a $78.5 million tax benefit in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 resulting from the December 2009 Veritas v. Commissioner U.S. Tax Court decision relating to the Veritas 2000 and 2001 tax years. In addition, net income for fiscal 2010 was positively impacted by $47 million of net gain from the liquidation of certain foreign legal entities. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in this annual report in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, requires us to make estimates, which include judgments and assumptions, that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly. Historically, our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results; however, actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions. If 29 Table of Contents actual results differ from these estimates and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, and in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on liquidity and our financial condition. A critical accounting estimate is based on judgments and assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made. Different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in accounting estimates could materially impact the operating results or financial condition. We believe that the estimates described below represent our critical accounting estimates, as they have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. See also Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software industry. We recognize revenue primarily pursuant to the requirements under the authoritative guidance on software revenue recognition, and any applicable amendments or modifications. Revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and require us to make many estimates. For arrangements that include multiple elements, including perpetual software licenses and maintenance and or services, packaged products with content updates, managed security services, and subscriptions, we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of the fair value of the undelivered elements, and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue. Our deferred revenue consists primarily of the unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance, consumer product content updates, and arrangements where VSOE does not exist, such as managed security services and subscriptions. Deferred revenue totaled approximately $3.2 billion as of April 2, 2010, of which $371 million was classified as Long term deferred revenue in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. VSOE of each element is based on the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately. We determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our stand alone sales of these elements to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the undelivered elements. When VSOE does not exist for undelivered items, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and increasing flexibility in contractual arrangements could materially impact the amount recognized in the current period and deferred over time. For arrangements that include both software and non software elements that are within the scope of the newly adopted accounting standards, further described below under Recently Adopted Authoritative Guidance, we allocate revenue to the software deliverables as a group and non software deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the new accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows: (i) VSOE, (ii) third party evidence of selling price (TPE) and (iii) best estimate of the selling price (ESP). When we are unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE, we use ESP to allocate the arrangement fees to the deliverables. For our consumer products that include content updates, we recognize revenue and the associated cost of revenue ratably over the term of the subscription upon sell through to end users, as the subscription period commences on the date of sale to the end user. We defer revenue and cost of revenue amounts for unsold product held by our distributors and resellers. We expect our distributors and resellers to maintain adequate inventory of consumer packaged products to meet future customer demand, which is generally four or six weeks of customer demand based on recent buying trends. We ship product to our distributors and resellers at their request and based on valid purchase orders. Our distributors and resellers base the quantity of orders on their estimates to meet future customer demand, which may exceed the expected level of a four or six week supply. We offer limited rights of return if the inventory held by our distributors and resellers is below the expected level of a four or six week supply. We estimate future returns under these limited rights of return in accordance with the authoritative guidance on revenue recognition. We typically offer liberal rights of return if inventory held by our distributors and resellers exceeds the expected level. Because 30 Table of Contents we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of excess inventory that will be returned, we primarily offset deferred revenue against trade accounts receivable for the amount of revenue in excess of the expected inventory levels. Arrangements for managed security services and SaaS offerings are generally offered to our customers over a specified period of time, and we recognize the related revenue ratably over the maintenance, subscription, or service period. Reserves for product returns. We reserve for estimated product returns as an offset to revenue based primarily on historical trends. We fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channels as an offset to deferred revenue. If we made different estimates, material differences could result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented. More or less product may be returned than what was estimated and or the amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what was estimated. These factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make actual results differ from our return estimates. Reserves for rebates. We estimate and record reserves for channel and end user rebates as an offset to revenue. For consumer products that include content updates, rebates are recorded as a ratable offset to revenue over the term of the subscription. Our estimated reserves for channel volume incentive rebates are based on distributors and resellers actual performance against the terms and conditions of volume incentive rebate programs, which are typically entered into quarterly. Our reserves for end user rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the promotional programs, actual sales during the promotion, amount of actual redemptions received, historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program, and the value of the rebate. We also consider current market conditions and economic trends when estimating our reserves for rebates. If actual redemptions differ from our estimates, material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented. Valuation of goodwill, intangible assets and long lived assets When we acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to intangible assets. These estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies and historical experience. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates, and if such events occur we may be required to record a charge against the value ascribed to an acquired asset or an increase in the amounts recorded for assumed liabilities. Goodwill. We review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on the first day of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, at the reporting unit level. Our reporting units are consistent with our operating segments. Before performing the goodwill impairment test, we first assess the value of long lived assets in each reporting unit, including tangible and intangible assets. We then perform a two step impairment test on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the estimated fair value of equity of each reporting unit to its allocated carrying value (book value) of equity. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the equity associated with that unit, there is an indicator of impairment and we must perform the second step of the impairment test. This second step involves determining the implied fair value of that reporting units goodwill in a manner similar to the purchase price allocation for an acquired business, using the reporting units calculated fair value as an assumed purchase price. If the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the excess. The process of estimating the fair value and carrying value of our reporting units equity requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis. Many assets and liabilities, such as accounts receivable and property and equipment, are not specifically allocated to an individual reporting unit, and therefore, we apply judgment to 31 Table of Contents allocate the assets and liabilities, and this allocation affects the carrying value of the respective reporting units. Similarly, we use judgment to allocate goodwill to the reporting units based on relative fair values. The use of relative fair values has been necessary for certain reporting units due to changes in our operating structure in prior years. To determine a reporting units fair value, we use the income approach under which we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the estimated discounted future cash flows of that unit. We evaluate the reasonableness of this approach with the market approach, which involves a review of the carrying value of our assets relative to our market capitalization and to the valuation of publicly traded companies operating in the same or similar lines of business. Applying the income approach requires that we make a number of important estimates and assumptions. We estimate the future cash flows of each reporting unit based on historical and forecasted revenue and operating costs. This, in turn, involves further estimates, such as estimates of future revenue and expense growth rates and foreign exchange rates. In addition, we apply a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows for the purpose of the valuation. This discount rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital for each reporting unit and may change from year to year. For example, in our valuation process in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 we used a lower discount rate than in the prior year due to stabilized risk associated with the global economic conditions. Changes in these key estimates and assumptions, or in other assumptions used in this process, could materially affect our impairment analysis for a given year. As of April 2, 2010, our goodwill balance was $4.6 billion. Based on the impairment analysis performed on January 2, 2010, we determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value of the unit by more than 20% of the carrying value. While discount rates are only one of several important estimates used in the analysis, we determined that an increase of one percentage point in the discount rate used for each respective reporting unit would not have resulted in an impairment indicator for any unit at the time of this analysis. A number of factors, many of which we have no ability to control, could affect our financial condition, operating results and business prospects and could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed. These factors include: a prolonged global economic crisis; a significant decrease in the demand for our products; the inability to develop new and enhanced products and services in a timely manner; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; successful efforts by our competitors to gain market share in our markets; a loss of key personnel; our determination to dispose of one or more of our reporting units; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and recognition of a goodwill impairment loss Intangible Assets. We assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset groups carrying amount may not be recoverable. In addition, for intangible assets with indefinite lives, we review such assets for impairment on an annual basis consistent with the timing of the annual evaluation for goodwill. An impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount. Such impairment loss would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset group and its fair value. Our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted revenue, operating costs, and other relevant factors. If managements estimates of future operating results change, or if there are changes to other assumptions, the estimate of the fair value of our identifiable intangible assets could change significantly. Such change could result in impairment charges in future periods, which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition. 32 Table of Contents We record impairment charges on developed technology or acquired product rights when we determine that the net realizable value of the assets may not be recoverable. To determine the net realizable value of the assets, we use the estimated future gross revenue from each product. Our estimated future gross revenue of each product is based on company forecasts and is subject to change. Long Lived Assets (including Assets Held for Sale). We assess long lived assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the long lived assets may not be recoverable. Based on the existence of one or more indicators of impairment, we measure any impairment of long lived assets based on a projected undiscounted cash flow method using assumptions determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model. Our estimates of cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many factors which could change and cause a material impact to our operating results or financial condition. We record impairment charges on long lived assets held for sale when we determine that the carrying value of the long lived assets may not be recoverable. In determining our fair value, we obtain and consider market value appraisal information from third parties. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The assessment of fair value for our financial instruments is based on the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements which establishes a fair value hierarchy that is based on three levels of inputs and requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. We use inputs such as actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes and other similar data which are obtained from independent pricing vendors, quoted market prices or other sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and liabilities. We use such pricing data as the primary input, to which we have not made any material adjustments, to make our assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of our investment portfolio, and we are ultimately responsible for the financial statements and underlying estimates. The fair value and inputs are reviewed for reasonableness, may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information that management deems material to their estimate of fair value. As of April 2, 2010, our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included $2.4 billion of assets. Our cash equivalents primarily consist of money market funds, bank securities, and government securities and represent 99% of our total financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis. As of April 2, 2010, $2.1 billion of investments were classified as Level 1, most of which represents investments in money market funds. These were classified as Level 1 because their valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets. Determining fair value for Level 1 instruments generally does not require significant management judgment. As of April 2, 2010, $342 million of investments were classified as Level 2, of which $216 million and $116 million (representing a combined 97% of Level 2 financial instruments) represent investments in bank securities and government securities, respectively. These were classified as Level 2 because either (1) the estimated fair value is based on the fair value of similar securities or (2) their valuations were based on pricing models with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market prices for identical securities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets). Level 2 inputs generally are based on non binding market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data; quoted prices for similar instruments; and or model derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities or quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities. While determining the fair value for Level 2 instruments does not necessarily require significant management judgment, it generally involves the following level of judgment and subjectivity: Determining whether a market is considered active An assessment of an active market for marketable securities generally takes into consideration whether a trading market exists for a given instrument or trading volume for each instrument type. Our Level 2 financial instruments were classified due to either low trading 33 Table of Contents activity in active markets or no active market existing. For those securities where no active market existed, amortized cost was used and approximates fair value because of their short maturities. For certain financial instruments classified as Level 2 as of April 2, 2010, we used identical securities for determining fair value. Determining which model derived valuations to use in determining fair value When observable market prices for identical securities or similar securities are not available, we may price marketable securities using: non binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data; or pricing models, such as discounted cash flow approaches, with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data. In addition, the credit ratings for issuers of debt instruments in which we are invested could change, which could lead to lower fair values. As of April 2, 2010, the fair value of $6 million of fixed income securities was determined using benchmark pricing models for identical or similar securities. As of April 2, 2010, we have no financial instruments with unobservable inputs classified in Level 3 under the hierarchy set forth under the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements. Level 3 instruments generally would include unobservable inputs to be used in the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities. The determination of fair value for Level 3 instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity. Stock based Compensation We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this guidance, stock based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. Determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the options, actual and projected employee stock option exercise and cancellation behaviors, risk free interest rates, and expected dividends. We estimate the expected life of options granted based on an analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and post vesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the option. Expected volatility is based on the average of historical volatility for the period commensurate with the expected life of the option and the implied volatility of traded options. The risk free interest rate is equal to the U.S. Treasury constant maturity rates for the period equal to the expected life. We do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, our expected dividend yield is zero. In accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock compensation, we only record stock based compensation expense for awards that are expected to vest. As a result, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited. Although we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience, actual forfeitures may differ. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted when we record a true up for the difference in the period that the awards vest. Contingencies and Litigation We evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with the authoritative guidance on contingencies. We assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes from a potential claim or legal proceeding, as well as potential ranges of probable losses, when the outcomes of the claims or proceedings are probable and reasonably estimable. A determination of the amount of accrued liabilities required, if any, for these contingencies is made after the analysis of each separate matter. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, we base our estimates on the information available at the time of our assessment. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to its pending claims and litigation and 34 Table of Contents may revise our estimates. Any revisions in the estimates of potential liabilities could have a material impact on our operating results and financial position. Income Taxes We are required to compute our income taxes in each federal, state, and international jurisdiction in which we operate. This process requires that we estimate the current tax exposure as well as assess temporary differences between the accounting and tax treatment of assets and liabilities, including items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes. The income tax effects of the differences we identify are classified as current or long term deferred tax assets and liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our judgments, assumptions, and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Operations. We account for uncertain tax issues pursuant to authoritative guidance based on a two step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, refinement of estimates, or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact our tax provision in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period in which such determination is made. We must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income and, based on this assessment establish a valuation allowance, if required. Our determination of our valuation allowance is based upon a number of assumptions, judgments, and estimates, including forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the valuation allowance in a period, we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease to our tax provision in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. In July 2008, we reached an agreement with the IRS concerning our eligibility to claim a lower tax rate on a distribution made from a Veritas foreign subsidiary prior to the July 2005 acquisition. The distribution was intended to be made pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and therefore eligible for a 5.25% effective U.S. federal rate of tax, in lieu of the 35% statutory rate. The final impact of this agreement is not yet known since this relates to the taxability of earnings that are otherwise the subject of the tax years 2000 2001 transfer pricing dispute which in turn is being addressed in the U.S. Tax Court. To the extent that we owe taxes as a result of the transfer pricing dispute, we anticipate that the incremental tax due from this negotiated agreement will decrease. We currently estimate that the most probable outcome from this negotiated agreement will be that we will owe $13 million or less, for which an accrual has already been made. We made a payment of $130 million to the IRS for this matter in May 2006. We applied $110 million of this payment as a deposit on the outstanding transfer pricing matter for the tax years 2000 2004. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Total Net Revenue Fiscal 2010 vs. 2009 Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Fiscal 2010 $ % 2009 $ % 2008 ($ in millions) Net revenue $ 5,985 $ (165 ) (3 )% $ 6,150 $ 276 5 % $ 5,874 35 Table of Contents Net revenue decreased for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, primarily due to a $336 million decrease in License revenue partially offset by a $171 million increase in Content, subscription, and maintenance revenue. The net decrease was primarily due to decreased license revenue from our Storage and Server Management segment as a result of the overall market weakness in server sales and tight IT spending due to the global economic slowdown and the uncertainty surrounding the acquisition of Sun Microsystems, Inc. by Oracle Corporation. This decrease was partially offset by strength in our Consumer segment and the items discussed above under Financial Results and Trends. Net revenue increased for fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to a $302 million increase in Content, subscription, and maintenance revenue. This increase was primarily related to increased revenue in our Storage and Server Management and Services segments and the items discussed above under Financial Results and Trends. Content, subscription, and maintenance revenue Fiscal 2010 vs. 2009 Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Fiscal 2010 $ % 2009 $ % 2008 ($ in millions) Content, subscription, and maintenance revenue $ 5,034 $ 171 4 % $ 4,863 $ 302 7 % $ 4,561 Percentage of total net revenue 84 % 79 % 78 % Content, subscription, and maintenance revenue increased for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, as a result of strength in our Consumer segment primarily due to increases in revenue from acquired security products and the gradual global ramp up of our eCommerce platform, as well as revenue from our fiscal 2009 acquisitions of MessageLabs and PC Tools, and the items discussed above under Financial Results and Trends. Content, subscription, and maintenance revenue increased for fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to an aggregate increase in content, subscription and maintenance revenue from the Storage and Server Management and Services segments of $237 million. The increase in these two segments revenue was largely attributable to demand for our Storage and Server Management products and consulting services as a result of increased demand for security and storage solutions. This increased demand was driven by the proliferation of structured and unstructured data and increasing sales of services in conjunction with our license sales. The increased demand was also a result of our focus on offering our customers a more comprehensive IT solution. Furthermore, growth in our customer base through acquisitions and new license sales resulted in an increase to Content, subscription, and maintenance revenue because a large number of our customers renew their annual maintenance contracts. License revenue Fiscal 2010 vs. 2009 Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Fiscal 2010 $ % 2009 $ % 2008 ($ in millions) License revenue $ 951 $ (336 ) (26 )% $ 1,287 $ (26 ) (2 )% $ 1,313 Percentage of total net revenue 16 % 21 % 22 % License revenue decreased for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, primarily due to the global economic slowdown and customers emphasizing purchases of smaller volumes of new licenses consistent with their near term needs during the periods presented, as well as for the items discussed above under Financial Results and Trends. License revenue decreased slightly for fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to a decrease in revenue related to our Security and Compliance products, offset by an increase in revenue related to our Storage and Server Management products. The decreases in Security and Compliance license revenue was primarily a result of the challenging economic environment and a decline in demand from small and medium businesses. The offsetting increases in Storage and Server Management license revenue are a result of increased demand for storage solutions driven by the proliferation of structured and unstructured data. 36 Table of Contents Net revenue and operating income by segment Consumer Segment Fiscal 2010 vs. 2009 Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Fiscal 2010 $ % 2009 $ % 2008 ($ in millions) Consumer revenue $ 1,871 $ 98 6 % $ 1,773 $ 27 2 % $ 1,746 Percentage of total net revenue 31 % 29 % 30 % Consumer operating income $ 860 $ (88 ) (9 )% $ 948 $ 9 1 % $ 939 Percentage of Consumer revenue 46 % 53 % 54 % Consumer revenue increased for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, primarily due to increases in revenue from acquired security products, our core consumer products in the electronic channel, and the items discussed above under Financial Results and Trends. Our electronic channel sales are derived from OEMs, subscriptions, upgrades, online sales, and renewals. Electronic channel revenue has increased year over year since fiscal 2008. Electronic sales accounted for approximately 81%, 78%, and 73% of Consumer revenue for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Operating income for the Consumer segment decreased for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, as expense growth outpaced revenue growth. Total expenses for the segment increased primarily as a result of the higher OEM placement fees and costs associated with our development and operation of our new proprietary eCommerce platform, both discussed above under Financial Results and Trends. Consumer revenue increased for fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to an increase from our core consumer security products in our electronic channels, partially offset by a decrease in our retail channels. In addition, Consumer revenue increased from the sale of our consumer services and acquired security products. Operating income for this segment increased for fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, as the increase in revenue more than offset the increase in expenses. Total expenses for fiscal 2009 increased primarily as a result of the PC Tools acquisition. Security and Compliance Segment Fiscal 2010 vs. 2009 Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Fiscal 2010 $ % 2009 $ % 2008 ($ in millions) Security and Compliance revenue $ 1,411 $ (39 ) (3 )% $ 1,450 $ 8 1 % $ 1,442 Percentage of total net revenue 24 % 24 % 25 % Security and Compliance operating income $ 371 $ (69 ) (16 )% $ 440 $ 21 5 % $ 419 Percentage of Security and Compliance revenue 26 % 30 % 29 % Security and Compliance revenue decreased for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, as a result of the items discussed above under Financial Results and Trends, partially offset by increases in revenue from acquired security products. Operating income for the segment decreased for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, as revenue decreased while expenses increased as a result of our fiscal 2009 acquisitions, partially offset by our cost containment measures. Security and Compliance revenue was relatively consistent for fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008. Operating income for the Security and Compliance segment increased for fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, as expenses decreased while revenue growth remained relatively consistent. Total expenses for fiscal 2009 benefited from our ongoing focus on cost efficiency. 37 Table of Contents Storage and Server Management Segment Fiscal 2010 vs. 2009 Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Fiscal 2010 $ % 2009 $ % 2008 ($ in millions) Storage and Server Management segment $ 2,287 $ (206 ) (8 )% $ 2,493 $ 190 8 % $ 2,303 Percentage of total net revenue 38 % 40 % 39 % Storage and Server Management operating income $ 1,097 $ 16 1 % $ 1,081 $ 361 50 % $ 720 Percentage of Storage and Server Management revenue 48 % 43 % 31 % Storage and Server Management revenue decreased for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, primarily due to the overall market weakness in server sales and our customers buying smaller volumes of new licenses consistent with their near term needs, particularly with respect to our storage management products, as well as the items discussed above under Financial Results and Trends. Operating income for the Storage and Server Management segment increased for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, as the decrease in expenses more than offset the decrease in revenue due to our ongoing focus on cost efficiency. Storage and Server Management revenue increased for fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to increased sales of products related to storage management, data protection, disaster recovery and products supporting high availability. The demand for these products was driven by the increase in the proliferation of structured and unstructured data, as well as the increasing demand for optimization of storage systems. Operating income for the Storage and Server Management segment increased for fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, as the growth in revenue was coupled with a decrease in expenses. Total expenses for fiscal 2009 decreased partly as a result of fiscal 2008 divestiture of a business. Services Segment Fiscal 2010 vs. 2009 Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Fiscal 2010 $ % 2009 $ % 2008 ($ in millions) Services segment $ 416 $ (17 ) (4 )% $ 433 $ 52 14 % $ 381 Percentage of total net revenue 7 % 7 % 6 % Services operating income (loss) $ 42 $ 9 27 % $ 33 $ 56 243 % $ (23 ) Percentage of Services revenue 10 % 8 % (6 )% Services revenue decreased for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, primarily due to a reduction in consulting revenue associated with new license sales, in addition to the items discussed above under Financial Results and Trends. Operating income for the Services segment increased for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, as various cost control initiatives led to better margins. Services revenue increased for fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to an increase in revenue in our consulting services and Business Critical Services, as a result of increased demand for more comprehensive software implementation assistance and increased demand for our Business Critical Services. Customers purchased our service offerings in conjunction with the purchase of our products and augmented the capabilities of their own IT staff with our onsite consultants. The operating loss for the Services segment decreased for fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, as revenue growth exceeded expense growth for the segment. Our focus on margin improvement contributed to the decrease in operating loss. 38 Table of Contents Other segment Fiscal 2010 vs. 2009 Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Fiscal 2010 $ % 2009 $ % 2008 ($ in millions) Other segment $ $ (1 ) (100 )% $ 1 $ (1 ) (50 )% $ 2 Percentage of total net revenue 0 % 0 % 0 % Other operating loss $ (1,437 ) $ 7,535 * $ (8,972 ) $ (7,519 ) * $ (1,453 ) Percentage of Other revenue * * * * Percentage not meaningful Revenue from our Other segment consists primarily of sunset products and products nearing the end of their life cycle.

EMEA revenue decreased for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to decreased revenue across all of our segments, particularly Storage and Server Management. Asia Pacific Japan revenue increased for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to increased revenue related to our Consumer and Security and Compliance segments, partially offset by decreased revenue in our Storage and Server Management segment. Americas revenue increased for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to increased revenue related to our Storage and Server Management and Services segments. In addition, for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008, Americas revenue related to our Consumer segment increased driven by demand for our Consumer segment products suites. EMEA revenue decreased slightly for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to decreased revenue related to our Consumer and Security and Compliance segments as a result of a strengthening U.S. dollar and a decrease in endpoint security product sales to small and medium sized businesses. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenue related to our Storage and Server Management and Services segments. Asia Pacific Japan revenue increased for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to increased revenue related to our Storage and Server Management segment. Our international sales are and will continue to be a significant portion of our net revenue. As a result, net revenue will continue to be affected by foreign currency exchange rates as compared to the U.S. dollar. We are 39 Table of Contents unable to predict the extent to which revenue in future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If international sales become a greater portion of our total sales in the future, changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have a potentially greater impact on our revenue and operating results. Cost of Revenue Fiscal 2010 vs. 2009 Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Fiscal 2010 $ % 2009 $ % 2008 ($ in millions) Cost of revenue $ 1,105 $ (122 ) (10 )% $ 1,227 $ 7 1 % $ 1,220 Gross margin 82 % 80 % 79 % Cost of revenue consists primarily of the amortization of acquired product rights, fee based technical support costs, costs of billable services, payments to OEMs under revenue sharing arrangements, manufacturing and direct material costs, and royalties paid to third parties under technology licensing agreements. Gross margin increased in fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, primarily due to a decrease in amortization of acquired product rights related to our acquisition of Veritas. Gross margin increased slightly in fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to higher revenue and, to a lesser extent, lower OEM royalty payments and distribution costs, partially offset by a year over year increase in technical support costs. Cost of content, subscription, and maintenance Fiscal 2010 vs. 2009 Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Fiscal 2010 $ % 2009 $ % 2008 ($ in millions) Cost of content, subscription, and maintenance $ 849 $ 9 1 % $ 840 $ 14 2 % $ 826 As a percentage of related revenue 17 % 17 % 18 % Cost of content, subscription, and maintenance consists primarily of fee based technical support costs, costs of billable services, and payments to OEMs under revenue sharing agreements. Cost of content, subscription, and maintenance as a percentage of related revenue remained relatively consistent for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, as increases in royalty and technical support costs were partially offset by decreases in services and distribution costs for the respective periods. Cost of content, subscription, and maintenance as a percentage of related revenue for fiscal 2009 decreased slightly as compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease was primarily driven by higher revenue, lower OEM royalties and distribution costs, partially offset by a year over year increase in technical support costs. Cost of license Fiscal 2010 vs. 2009 Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Fiscal 2010 $ % 2009 $ % 2008 ($ in millions) Cost of license $ 22 $ (13 ) (37 )% $ 35 $ (10 ) (22 )% $ 45 As a percentage of related revenue 2 % 3 % 3 % Cost of license consists primarily of royalties paid to third parties under technology licensing agreements and manufacturing and direct material costs. Cost of license remained relatively consistent as a percentage of the related revenue for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009. Cost of license remained consistent as a percentage of the related revenue for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. Decreases in manufacturing and site license costs were partially offset by higher royalties. 40 Table of Contents Amortization of acquired product rights Fiscal 2010 vs. 2009 Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Fiscal 2010 $ % 2009 $ % 2008 ($ in millions) Amortization of acquired product rights $ 234 $ (118 ) (34 )% $ 352 $ 3 1 % $ 349 Percentage of total net revenue 4 % 6 % 6 % Acquired product rights are comprised of developed technologies and patents from acquired companies. The decrease in amortization for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, was primarily due to certain acquired product rights from our acquisition of Veritas becoming fully amortized during the first quarter of our fiscal 2010. This decrease was partially offset by additional amortization from product rights acquired from SwapDrive, PC Tools and MessageLabs during fiscal 2009. The increase in amortization for fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, was primarily due to amortization associated with our SwapDrive, PC Tools and MessageLabs acquisitions during fiscal 2009, offset in part by the APM business divestiture in fiscal 2008. Operating Expenses Operating expenses overview As discussed above under Financial Results and Trends, our operating expenses for fiscal 2010 include 52 weeks of activity as compared to 53 weeks for fiscal 2009, which had a favorable impact on the year over year comparison of our operating expenses. Our operating expenses for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, were not materially impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates. Our operating expenses for fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, increased as a result of an additional week during fiscal 2009, which was partially offset by a stronger U.S. dollar in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. Our operating expenses for Fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 were favorably impacted by the restructuring plans discussed below. Sales and marketing expense Fiscal 2010 vs. 2009 Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Fiscal 2010 $ % 2009 $ % 2008 ($ in millions) Sales and marketing expense $ 2,367 $ (19 ) (1 )% $ 2,386 $ (29 ) (1 )% $ 2,415 Percentage of total net revenue 40 % 39 % 41 % Sales and marketing expense remained relatively flat during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2010 sales and marketing expense reflects the impact of our prior year restructuring plan, partially offset by increases in headcount related expenses from our fiscal 2009 acquisitions and increases in Consumer OEM fees and costs associated with the development and operations of our new proprietary eCommerce platform. As a percent of net revenue, sales and marketing expense increased as a result of these factors coupled with the decrease in total net revenue. Sales and marketing expense decreased during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, as a result of favorable foreign exchange rates and our restructuring plans, partially offset by an additional week of operations for fiscal 2009.

The restructuring charges for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, primarily consisted of severance charges related to the 2008 Plan and prior plans and acquisition related plans. Total remaining severance charges are estimated to range from $50 million to $80 million, primarily for the 2010 Plan. Total remaining facilities charges are estimated to range from $35 million to $45 million related to the 2010 Plan. Total remaining costs for the transition and transformation activities associated with outsourcing back office functions are estimated to be approximately $10 million to $20 million.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we performed our annual impairment analysis and determined that goodwill was not impaired. During the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we concluded that there were impairment indicators, including the challenging economic environment and a decline in our market capitalization, which required us to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis. The analysis was not completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2009 and an estimated impairment charge of $7.0 billion was recorded. The analysis was subsequently finalized and an additional impairment charge of $413 million was included in our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. As a result, we incurred a total impairment charge of $7.4 billion for fiscal 2009. We also performed our annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and determined that no additional impairment charge was necessary. For the purposes of this analysis, our estimates of fair value are based on a combination of the income approach, and the market approach. The income approach estimates the fair value of our reporting units based on the future discounted cash flows. We also consider the market approach, which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based on comparable market prices. During fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recognized impairments of $20 million, $46 million, and $93 million, respectively, on certain land and buildings classified as held for sale. The impairments were recorded in accordance with the authoritative guidance that requires a long lived asset classified as held for sale to be measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value, less cost to sell. Also, in fiscal 2010 and 2008, we sold assets for $42 million and $98 million, which resulted in losses of $10 million and $2 million, respectively. We sold properties in fiscal 2009 for $40 million with an immaterial loss. Non operating income and expense Fiscal 2010 vs. 2009 Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Fiscal 2010 $ % 2009 $ % 2008 ($ in millions) Interest income $ 6 $ 37 $ 77 Interest expense (129 ) (125 ) (119 ) Other income, net 55 8 63 Total $ (68 ) $ 12 (15 )% $ (80 ) $ (101 ) (481 )% $ 21 Percentage of total net revenue (1 )% (1 )% 0 % The decrease in interest income during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, is due to a lower average yield on our invested cash and short term investment balances. Interest expense for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, remained relatively consistent. Other income, net for fiscal 2010 includes net gains of $47 million from the liquidation of certain foreign legal entities. The liquidations resulted in the release of cumulative translation adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income related to these entities. 43 Table of Contents Interest income decreased during fiscal 2009 and 2008 primarily due to lower average cash balances outstanding and lower average yields on our invested cash and short term investment balances. Interest expense for fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2010, remained relatively consistent. Other income, net for fiscal 2008 includes a net gain from settlements of litigation of approximately $59 million. Provision for income taxes Fiscal 2010 2009 2008 ($ in millions) Provision for income taxes $ 112 $ 183 $ 213 Effective tax rate on earnings 13 % (3 )% 34 % Our effective tax rate was approximately 13%, (3)% and 34% in fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. The tax expense in fiscal 2010 was significantly reduced by the following benefits recognized in the year: (1) $78.5 million tax benefit arising from the Veritas v. Commissioner Tax Court decision (see further discussion below), (2) $11 million tax benefit from the reduction of our valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets, (3) $17 million tax benefit from lapses of statutes of limitation, (4) $9 million tax benefit from the conclusion of U.S. and foreign audits, (5) $7 million tax benefit to adjust taxes provided in prior periods, and (6) $6.5 million tax benefit from current year discrete events. The change in the valuation allowance follows discussions with Irish Revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2010, the result of which accelerates the timing of the use of certain Irish tax loss carryforwards in the future. The tax expense in fiscal 2009 was materially impacted by the inclusion of a $56 million tax benefit associated with the $7.0 billion impairment of goodwill in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. The effective tax rates for all periods presented otherwise reflects the benefits of lower taxed foreign earnings and losses from our joint venture with Huawei (joint venture) (fiscal 2010 and 2009 only), domestic manufacturing incentives, and research and development credits, partially offset by state income taxes. As a result of the impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2009, we have cumulative pre tax book losses, as measured by the current and prior two years. We considered the negative evidence of this cumulative pre tax book loss position on our ability to continue to recognize deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income for realization. Levels of future taxable income are subject to the various risks and uncertainties discussed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, set forth in this annual report. We considered the following as positive evidence: the vast majority of the goodwill impairment is not deductible for tax purposes and thus will not result in tax losses; we have a strong, consistent taxpaying history; we have substantial U.S. federal income tax carryback potential; and we have substantial amounts of scheduled future reversals of taxable temporary differences from our deferred tax liabilities. We have concluded that this positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence and, thus, that the deferred tax assets as of April 2, 2010 of $519 million, after application of the valuation allowances, are realizable on a more likely than not basis. On May 27, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overturned a 2005 U.S. Tax Court ruling in Xilinx v. Commissioner, holding that stock based compensation related RD must be shared by the participants of a RD cost sharing arrangement. The Ninth Circuit held that related parties to such an arrangement must share stock option costs, notwithstanding the U.S. Tax Courts finding that unrelated parties in such an arrangement would not share such costs. Symantec has a similar RD cost sharing arrangement in place. The Ninth Circuits reversal of the U.S. Tax Courts decision changed our estimate of stock option related tax benefits previously recognized under the authoritative guidance on income taxes. As a result of the Ninth Circuits ruling, we increased our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, recording a tax expense of approximately $7 million and a reduction of additional paid in capital of approximately $30 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. On January 13, 2010, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals withdrew its issued opinion. On March 22, 2010, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a revised decision affirming the decision of the Tax Court. The Ninth Circuits decision agreed with the Tax Courts finding that related companies are not required to share such costs. As a result of the Ninth Circuits revised ruling, we released the liability established in our first quarter of fiscal 2010, which resulted in a $7 million tax benefit and increase of additional paid in capital of approximately $30 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. For fiscal 2010, there was no net income tax expense impact. 44 Table of Contents On March 29, 2006, we received a Notice of Deficiency from the IRS claiming that we owe $867 million of additional taxes, excluding interest and penalties, for the 2000 and 2001 tax years based on an audit of Veritas. On June 26, 2006, we filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court protesting the IRS claim for such additional taxes. During July 2008, we completed the trial phase of the Tax Court case, which dealt with the remaining issue covered in the assessment. At trial, the IRS changed its position with respect to this remaining issue, which decreased the remaining amount at issue from $832 million to $545 million, excluding interest. We filed our post trial briefs in October 2008 and rebuttal briefs in November 2008 with the U.S. Tax Court. On December 10, 2009, the U.S. Tax Court issued its opinion, finding that our transfer pricing methodology, with appropriate adjustments, was the best method for assessing the value of the transaction at issue between Veritas and its offshore subsidiary. The Tax Court judge provided guidance as to how adjustments would be made to correct the application of the method used by Veritas. We remeasured and decreased our liability for unrecognized tax benefits accordingly, resulting in a $78.5 million tax benefit in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Final computations as directed by the Ruling are not complete and, accordingly, we may make further adjustments to our tax liability in the future. The Tax Court ruling is subject to appeal. We have $110 million on deposit with the IRS pertaining to this matter. We do not anticipate making any further federal tax payments for these years. On December 2, 2009, we received a Revenue Agents Report from the IRS for the Veritas 2002 through 2005 tax years assessing additional taxes due. We agree with $30 million of the tax assessment, excluding interest, but will contest the other $80 million of tax assessed and all penalties. The unagreed issues concern transfer pricing matters comparable to the one that was resolved in our favor in the Veritas v. Commissioner Tax Court decision. On January 15, 2010 we filed a protest with the IRS in connection with the $80 million of tax assessed. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing tax controversies and the impact, if any, of the expected tolling of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions. Loss from joint venture Fiscal 2010 vs. 2009 Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Fiscal 2010 $ % 2009 $ % 2008 ($ in millions) Loss from joint venture $ 39 $ (14 ) (26 )% $ 53 $ 53 100 % $ Percentage of total net revenue 1 % 1 % 0 % On February 5, 2008, Symantec formed a joint venture with a subsidiary of Huawei Technologies Co., Limited (Huawei). The joint venture is domiciled in Hong Kong with principal operations in Chengdu, China. The joint venture develops, manufactures, markets and supports security and storage appliances for global telecommunications carriers and enterprise customers. As described in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report, the joint venture adopted new authoritative guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables during its period ended December 31, 2009, which was applied to the beginning of its fiscal year. As a result of the joint ventures adoption of the guidance, our net income was $12 million higher for fiscal 2010 than it would have been under the pre existing accounting guidance. We account for our investment in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting. Under this method, we record our proportionate share of the joint ventures net income or loss based on the quarterly financial statements of the joint venture. We record our proportionate share of net income or loss one quarter in arrears. For fiscal 2010, we recorded a loss of approximately $39 million related to our share of the joint ventures net loss incurred for the period from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2009. For fiscal 2009, we recorded a loss of approximately $53 million related to our share of the joint ventures net loss incurred for the period from February 5, 2008 (its date of inception) to December 31, 2008. 45 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Sources of Cash We have historically relied on cash flow from operations, borrowings under a credit facility and issuances of convertible notes and equity securities for our liquidity needs. In fiscal 2007, we entered into a five year $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in July 2011. In order to be able to draw on the credit facility, we must maintain certain covenants, including a specified ratio of debt to earnings (before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairment) as well as certain other non financial covenants. As of April 2, 2010, we were in compliance with all required covenants and there was no outstanding balance on the credit facility. As of April 2, 2010, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.0 billion and short term investments of $15 million resulting in a net liquidity position of approximately $4.0 billion, which is defined as unused availability of the credit facility, cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. We believe that our existing cash and investment balances, our borrowing capacity, our ability to issue new debt instruments, and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures requirements for at least the next 12 months. Uses of Cash Our principal cash requirements include working capital, capital expenditures, payments of principal and interest on our debt and payments of taxes. In addition, we regularly evaluate our ability to repurchase stock, pay debts and acquire other businesses. Line of Credit. There were no borrowings under our credit facility for the fiscal year ended April 2, 2010. For the fiscal year ended April 3, 2009, we repaid the entire $200 million principal amount, plus $3 million of accrued interest, that we borrowed during fiscal 2008 under the credit facility. Acquisition related. For fiscal 2010, we acquired two companies for an aggregate payment of $31 million, net of cash acquired. For fiscal 2009, we acquired MessageLabs, PC Tools, SwapDrive and several other companies for an aggregate payment of $1.1 billion, net of cash acquired. For fiscal 2008, we acquired Altiris and two other companies for an aggregate payment of $1.2 billion, net of cash acquired. Also, in fiscal 2008, we entered into a joint venture with Huawei Technologies Co., Limited and contributed $150 million in cash. Convertible Senior Notes. In June 2006, we issued $1.1 billion principal amount of 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2011, and $1.0 billion principal amount of 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes (collectively the Senior Notes) due June 15, 2013. Concurrently with the issuance of the Senior Notes, we entered into note hedge transactions for $592 million with affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers whereby we have the option to purchase up to 110 million shares of our common stock at a price of $19.12 per share. For the fiscal years ended April 2, 2010, April 3, 2009 and March 28, 2008, we have not repaid any of this debt other than the related interest costs. Stock Repurchases. We repurchased 34 million, 42 million and 81 million shares for $553 million, $700 million and $1.5 billion during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. As of April 2, 2010, we had $747 million remaining under the plan authorized for future repurchases. 46 Table of Contents Cash Flows The following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, selected items in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: Fiscal 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) Net cash provided by (used in) Operating activities $ 1,693 $ 1,671 $ 1,819 Investing activities (65 ) (961 ) (1,526 ) Financing activities (441 ) (677 ) (1,066 ) Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion for fiscal 2010, which resulted from net income of $714 million adjusted for non cash items, including depreciation and amortization charges of $837 million and stock based compensation expense of $155 million. These amounts were partially offset by a decrease in income taxes payable of $105 million primarily related to the outcome of the Veritas v. Commissioner Tax Court decision (see Note 13). Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion for fiscal 2009, which resulted from non cash charges related to depreciation and amortization expenses of $933 million and the $7.4 billion goodwill impairment charge offset by the net loss of $6.8 billion. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.8 billion for fiscal 2008, which resulted from net income of $410 million adjusted for non cash items, including depreciation and amortization charges of $915 million, stock based compensation expense of $164 million, income taxes payable of $196 million and an increase in deferred revenue of $127 million. These amounts were partially offset by a decrease in non cash deferred income taxes of $216 million. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $65 million for fiscal 2010 and was primarily due to $248 million paid for capital expenditures, partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities of $190 million. Net cash used in investing activities was $1.0 billion for fiscal 2009 and was primarily due to an aggregate payment of $1.1 billion in cash payments for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and $272 million paid for capital expenditures, partially offset by net proceeds of $336 million from the sale of short term investments which were used to partially fund acquisitions. Net cash used in investing activities was $1.5 billion for fiscal 2008 and was primarily due to an aggregate payment of $1.3 billion in cash paid for acquisitions and the joint venture, net of cash acquired. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities of $441 million for fiscal 2010 was due to repurchases of common stock of $553 million, partially offset by net proceeds from sales of common stock through employee stock plans of $124 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $677 million for fiscal 2009 and was primarily due to repurchases of common stock of $700 million and the repayment of $200 million on our revolving credit facility, partially offset by net proceeds from sales of common stock through employee stock plans of $229 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $1.1 billion for fiscal 2008 and was primarily due to repurchases of common stock of $1.5 billion, partially offset by the net proceeds from sales of common stock through employee stock plans of $224 million and a borrowing on our revolving credit facility of $200 million. 47 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of April 2, 2010: Payments Due by Period Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2014 Fiscal 2016 Total Fiscal 2011 and 2013 and 2015 and Thereafter Other (In millions) Convertible Senior Notes(1) $ 2,100 $ $ 1,100 $ 1,000 $ $ Interest payments on Convertible Senior Notes(1) 42 18 22 2 Purchase obligations(2) 421 334 85 2 Operating leases(3) 392 90 133 87 82 Norton royalty agreement(4) 5 3 2 Uncertain tax positions(5) 426 426 Total contractual obligations $ 3,386 $ 445 $ 1,342 $ 1,091 $ 82 $ 426 (1) Senior Notes are due in fiscal 2012 and 2014. Holders of the Senior Notes may convert their Senior Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of our common stock, up to the principal amount of the note. Amounts in excess of the principal amount, if any, may be paid in cash or in stock at our option. As of April 2, 2010, the conditions to conversion had not been met. Interest payments were calculated based on terms of the related notes. (2) These amounts are associated with agreements for purchases of goods or services generally including agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The table above also includes agreements to purchase goods or services that have cancellation provisions requiring little or no payment. The amounts under such contracts are included in the table above because management believes that cancellation of these contracts is unlikely and the Company expects to make future cash payments according to the contract terms or in similar amounts for similar materials. (3) We have entered into various non cancellable operating lease agreements that expire on various dates through 2029. The amounts in the table above include $21 million related to exited or excess facility costs related to restructuring activities. (4) In June 2007, we amended an existing royalty agreement with Peter Norton for the licensing of certain publicity rights. As a result, we recorded a long term liability reflecting the net present value of expected future royalty payments due to Mr. Norton. (5) As of April 2, 2010, we reflected $426 million in long term taxes payable related to uncertain tax positions. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond the next twelve months due to uncertainties in the timing of the commencement and settlement of potential tax audits and controversies. Indemnifications As permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at our request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is not limited; however, we have directors and officers insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and may enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal. We provide limited product warranties and the majority of our software license agreements contain provisions that indemnify licensees of our software from damages and costs resulting from claims alleging that our software 48 Table of Contents infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party. Historically, payments made under these provisions have been immaterial. We monitor the conditions that are subject to indemnification to identify if a loss has occurred. Recently Adopted Authoritative Guidance In the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we adopted new authoritative guidance on convertible debt instruments that requires the issuer of convertible debt instruments with cash settlement features to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument. The debt is recognized at the present value of its cash flows discounted using the issuers nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the time of issuance. The equity component is recognized as the difference between the proceeds from the issuance of the note and the fair value of the liability. This guidance also requires interest to be accreted as interest expense of the resultant debt discount over the expected life of the debt. This guidance applies to the 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2011 and the 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2013, collectively referred to as the Senior Notes. Prior to the adoption of this guidance, the liability of the Senior Notes was carried at its principal value and only the contractual interest expense was recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Because this guidance requires retrospective adoption, we were required to adjust all periods for which the Senior Notes were outstanding before the date of adoption. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report for additional information on the adoption. In the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we adopted new authoritative guidance on business combinations that requires an acquiring entity to measure and recognize identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions. The changes include the treatment of acquisition related transaction costs, the valuation of any noncontrolling interest at acquisition date fair value, the recording of acquired contingent liabilities at acquisition date fair value and the subsequent re measurement of such liabilities after the acquisition date, the recognition of capitalized in process research and development, the accounting for acquisition related restructuring cost accruals subsequent to the acquisition date, and the recognition of changes in the acquirers income tax valuation allowance. Our acquisitions during fiscal 2010 have been accounted for using this new authoritative guidance. See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report for information on our business combinations. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, however, it could have a material impact on future periods. In the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we adopted new authoritative guidance on the recognition and measurement of other than temporary impairments for debt securities that replaced the pre existing intent and ability indicator. This guidance specifies that if the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost basis, an other than temporary impairment is triggered in circumstances in which (1) an entity has an intent to sell the security, (2) it is more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or (3) the entity does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security (that is, a credit loss exists). Other than temporary impairments are separated into amounts representing credit losses, which are recognized in earnings, and amounts related to all other factors, which are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we adopted new authoritative guidance on noncontrolling (minority) interests in consolidated financial statements, which includes requiring noncontrolling interests be classified as a component of consolidated stockholders equity and to identify earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests reported as part of consolidated earnings. The guidance also requires the gain or loss on the deconsolidated subsidiary be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we adopted new authoritative guidance that specifies the way in which fair value measurements should be made for non financial assets and liabilities that are not measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, and specifies additional disclosures related to these fair value measurements. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we adopted new authoritative guidance on revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements. The new standard changes the requirements for establishing separate units of 49 Table of Contents accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable to be based on the relative selling price. The new standard establishes a selling price hierarchy that allows for the use of an estimated selling price to determine the allocation of arrangement consideration to a deliverable in a multiple element arrangement where neither VSOE nor TPE is available for that deliverable. Concurrently to issuing the new standard, the FASB also issued new authoritative guidance that excludes tangible products that contain software and non software elements that function together to provide the tangible products essential functionality from the scope of software revenue guidance. We have elected to adopt the new accounting standards as of the beginning of fiscal 2010 for applicable transactions originating from or materially modified after April 2, 2009. Our adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Our joint venture also adopted the accounting standards during its period ended December 31, 2009, which was applied to the beginning of its fiscal year. As a result of the joint ventures adoption of the accounting standards, our Loss from joint venture decreased by $12 million during our fiscal 2010. See Note 6 for further details regarding the impact of this guidance on our joint venture. Recently Issued Authoritative Guidance In June 2009, the FASB issued revised guidance which changes the model for determining whether an entity should consolidate a variable interest entity (VIE). The standard replaces the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a VIE with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a VIE and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive the entitys residual returns. The statement is effective as of the first quarter of our fiscal 2011, and early adoption is prohibited. We do not expect the adoption of this new authoritative guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to various market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity prices. We may use derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain risks in accordance with our investment and foreign exchange policies. We do not use derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio and the potential losses arising from changes in interest rates. Our investment objective is to achieve the maximum return compatible with capital preservation and our liquidity requirements. Our strategy is to invest our cash in a manner that preserves capital, maintains sufficient liquidity to meet our cash requirements, maximizes yields consistent with approved credit risk, and limits inappropriate concentrations of investment by sector, credit, or issuer. We classify our cash equivalents and short term investments in accordance with the authoritative guidance on investments. We consider investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. We classify our short term investments as available for sale. Short term investments consist of marketable debt or equity securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days. Our cash equivalents and short term investment portfolios consist primarily of money market funds, commercial paper, corporate debt securities, and U.S. government and government sponsored debt securities. Our short term investments do not include equity investments in privately held companies. Our short term investments are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in Accumulated other comprehensive income within Stockholders equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amortization of premiums and discounts on the investments, realized gains and losses, and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available for sale securities are included in Other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We use the specific identification method to determine cost in calculating realized gains and losses upon sale of short term investments. 50 Table of Contents The following table presents the fair value and hypothetical changes in fair values on short term investments sensitive to changes in interest rates (in millions): Value of Securities Value of Securities Given an Given an Interest Interest Rate Increase of Rate Decrease of X X Basis Points (bps) Fair Value Basis Points (bps) 150 bps 100 bps 50 bps As of (25 bps) (75 bps) April 2, 2010 $ 10 $ 10 $ 10 $ 10 $ 10 * April 3, 2009 $ 680 $ 680 $ 680 $ 680 $ 681 $ 681 * Amount not meaningful The modeling technique used above measures the change in fair market value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus 150 bps, plus 100 bps, plus 50 bps, minus 25 bps, and minus 75 bps. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We conduct business in 44 currencies through our worldwide operations and, as such, we are exposed to foreign currency risk. Foreign currency risks are associated with our cash and cash equivalents, investments, receivables, and payables denominated in foreign currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates will result in foreign exchange gains and losses on these foreign currency assets and liabilities and are included in Other income, net. Our objective in managing foreign exchange activity is to preserve stockholder value by minimizing the risk of foreign currency exchange rate changes. Our strategy is to primarily utilize forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures. Under our program, gains and losses in our foreign currency exposures are offset by losses and gains on our forward contracts. Our forward contracts generally have terms of one to six months. At the end of the reporting period, open contracts are marked to market with unrealized gains and losses included in Other income, net. The following table presents a sensitivity analysis on our foreign forward exchange contract portfolio using a statistical model to estimate the potential gain or loss in fair value that could arise from hypothetical appreciation or depreciation of foreign currency (in millions): Value of Contracts Value of Contracts Given X% Given X% Appreciation of Depreciation of Foreign Foreign Currency Notional Currency Foreign Forward Exchange Contracts 10% 5% Amount (5)% (10)% Purchased, April 2, 2010 $ 217 $ 209 $ 199 $ 189 $ 177 Sold, April 2, 2010 $ 236 $ 248 $ 260 $ 274 $ 289 Purchased, April 3, 2009 $ 264 $ 252 $ 240 $ 228 $ 216 Sold, April 3, 2009 $ 320 $ 337 $ 355 $ 373 $ 391 Equity Price Risk In June 2006, we issued $1.1 billion principal amount of 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2011 and $1.0 billion of 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013. Holders may convert their Senior Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of Symantec common stock, up to the principal amount of the note. Amounts in excess of the principal amount, if any, may be paid in cash or in stock at our option. Concurrent with the issuance of the Senior Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions and separately, warrant transactions, to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the Senior Notes and to mitigate any negative effect such conversion may have on the price of our common stock. For business and strategic purposes, we also hold equity interests in several privately held companies, many of which can be considered to be in the start up or development stages. These investments are inherently risky and we could lose a substantial part or our entire investment in these companies. These investments are recorded at cost and 51 Table of Contents classified as Other long term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of April 2, 2010, these investments had an aggregate carrying value of $22 million.
