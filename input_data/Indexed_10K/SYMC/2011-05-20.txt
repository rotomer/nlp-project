Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW Our Business Symantec is a global provider of security, storage and systems management solutions that help businesses and consumers secure and manage their information and identities. Fiscal Calendar We have a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Friday closest to March 31. Unless otherwise stated, references to fiscal years in this report relate to fiscal year and periods ended April 1, 2011, April 2, 2010 and April 3, 2009. Fiscal 2011 and 2010 each consisted of 52 weeks, while fiscal 2009 consisted of 53 weeks. Our 2012 fiscal year will consist of 52 weeks and will end on March 30, 2012. Our Operating Segments Our operating segments are significant strategic business units that offer different products and services, distinguished by customer needs. Since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we have operated in five operating segments: Consumer, Security and Compliance, Storage and Server Management, Services, and Other. For further descriptions of our operating segments, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report. Our reportable segments are the same as our operating segments. Financial Results and Trends Revenue increased by $205 million for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2011, we experienced growth in our Security and Compliance segment primarily as a result of revenue associated with our fiscal 2011 acquisitions. During fiscal 2011, we acquired the identity and authentication business of VeriSign, Inc (VeriSign), PGP Corporation (PGP), and GuardianEdge Technologies, Inc. (GuardianEdge) for an aggregate amount of approximately $1.5 billion, net of cash acquired. We expect that these acquisitions will continue to contribute positively to our revenue in future periods in the Security and Compliance segment. Within our Storage and Server Management segment, sales of our information management products experienced growth while we experienced weakness in our storage management solutions. Consumer segment revenues for fiscal 2011 benefited from the completion of our transition to an internally developed eCommerce platform for our Norton branded consumer products worldwide, excluding Japan, during the first quarter of fiscal 2011. The fees we had previously paid to Digital River for operating our online store for these products were recorded as an offset to revenue; however, we 28 Table of Contents incur expenses resulting from our eCommerce platform, components of which are recorded as a cost of revenue and an operating expense. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies unfavorably impacted our international revenue by approximately $53 million for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 and favorably impacted our international revenue by approximately $14 million for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. We are unable to predict the extent to which revenue in future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If our level of international sales and expenses increase in the future, changes in foreign exchange rates may have a potentially greater impact on our revenue and operating results. Our net income attributable to Symantec Corporation stockholders was $597 million for fiscal 2011 and $714 million for 2010. Our net income for fiscal 2011 was negatively impacted by a loss of $21 million from the liquidation of certain foreign entities and $27 million from the impairment of intangible assets, while net income for fiscal 2010 was positively affected by a gain of $47 million from the liquidation of certain foreign entities. Our fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 net income were positively impacted relative to the preceding year by a decrease of $119 million and $128 million, respectively, in cost of revenue primarily related to certain acquired product rights becoming fully amortized. Net income for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 was also positively impacted by tax benefits resulting from the reversal of accrued liabilities and correlative benefits related to the Veritas Software tax assessment for 2000 and 2001 of $49 million and $79 million, respectively. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in this annual report in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, requires us to make estimates, which include judgments and assumptions, that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly. Historically, our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results; however, actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions. If actual results differ from these estimates and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, and in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on liquidity and our financial condition. A critical accounting estimate is based on judgments and assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made. Different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in accounting estimates could materially impact the operating results or financial condition. We believe that the estimates described below represent our critical accounting estimates, as they have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. See also Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue primarily pursuant to the requirements under the authoritative guidance on software revenue recognition, and any applicable amendments or modifications. Revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and require us to make many estimates. For software arrangements that include multiple elements, including perpetual software licenses and maintenance and or services, packaged products with content updates, managed security services, and subscriptions, we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of the fair value of the undelivered elements, and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue. VSOE of each element is based on the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately. We determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our stand alone sales of these elements to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the undelivered elements. When VSOE does not exist for undelivered items, the entire arrangement fee is recognized 29 Table of Contents ratably over the performance period. Our deferred revenue consists primarily of the unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance, consumer product content updates, managed security services, subscriptions, and arrangements where VSOE does not exist. Deferred revenue totaled approximately $3.8 billion as of April 1, 2011, of which $498 million was classified as Long term deferred revenue in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and increasing flexibility in contractual arrangements could materially impact the amount recognized in the current period and deferred over time. For arrangements that include both software and non software elements, we allocate revenue to the software deliverables as a group and non software deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows: (i) VSOE, (ii) third party evidence of selling price (TPE) and (iii) best estimate of the selling price (ESP). When we are unable to establish a selling price using VSOE or TPE, we use ESP to allocate the arrangement fees to the deliverables. For our consumer products that include content updates, we recognize revenue and the associated cost of revenue ratably over the term of the subscription upon sell through to end users, as the subscription period commences on the date of sale to the end user. We defer revenue and cost of revenue amounts for unsold product held by our distributors and resellers. We expect our distributors and resellers to maintain adequate inventory of consumer packaged products to meet future customer demand, which is generally four or six weeks of customer demand based on recent buying trends. We ship product to our distributors and resellers at their request and based on valid purchase orders. Our distributors and resellers base the quantity of orders on their estimates to meet future customer demand, which may exceed the expected level of a four or six week supply. We offer limited rights of return if the inventory held by our distributors and resellers is below the expected level of a four or six week supply. We estimate reserves for product returns as described below. We typically offer liberal rights of return if inventory held by our distributors and resellers exceeds the expected level. Because we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of excess inventory that will be returned, we primarily offset deferred revenue against trade accounts receivable for the amount of revenue in excess of the expected inventory levels. Arrangements for managed security services and SaaS offerings are generally offered to our customers over a specified period of time, and we recognize the related revenue ratably over the maintenance, subscription, or service period. Reserves for product returns. We reserve for estimated product returns as an offset to revenue based primarily on historical trends. We fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channels as an offset to deferred revenue. Actual product returns may be different than what was estimated. These factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make actual results differ from our return estimates. Reserves for rebates. We estimate and record reserves for channel and end user rebates as an offset to revenue. For consumer products that include content updates, rebates are recorded as a ratable offset to revenue over the term of the subscription. Our estimated reserves for channel volume incentive rebates are based on distributors and resellers actual performance against the terms and conditions of volume incentive rebate programs, which are typically entered into quarterly. Our reserves for end user rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the promotional programs, actual sales during the promotion, the amount of actual redemptions received, historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program, and the value of the rebate. We also consider current market conditions and economic trends when estimating our reserves for rebates. If actual redemptions differ from our estimates, material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented. Valuation of goodwill, intangible assets and long lived assets Business Combination Valuations. When we acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair 30 Table of Contents values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to intangible assets. These estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies and historical experience. These estimates can include, but are not limited to: cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future; expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; the acquired companys brand and competitive position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined companys product portfolio; cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset; and discount rates. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates, and if such events occur we may be required to record a charge against the value ascribed to an acquired asset or an increase in the amounts recorded for assumed liabilities. Goodwill Impairment. We review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on the first day of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, at the reporting unit level. Our reporting units are the same as our operating segments. Before performing the goodwill impairment test, we first assess the value of long lived assets in each reporting unit, including tangible and intangible assets. We then perform a two step impairment test on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the estimated fair value of equity of each reporting unit to its allocated carrying value (book value) of equity. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the equity associated with that unit, there is an indicator of impairment and we must perform the second step of the impairment test. This second step involves determining the implied fair value of that reporting units goodwill in a manner similar to the purchase price allocation for an acquired business, using the reporting units calculated fair value as an assumed purchase price. If the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the excess. The process of estimating the fair value and carrying value of our reporting units equity requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis. Many assets and liabilities, such as accounts receivable and property and equipment, are not specifically allocated to an individual reporting unit, and therefore, we apply judgment to allocate the assets and liabilities, and this allocation affects the carrying value of the respective reporting units. Similarly, we use judgment to allocate goodwill to the reporting units based on relative fair values. The use of relative fair values has been necessary for certain reporting units due to changes in our operating structure in prior years. To determine a reporting units fair value, we use the income approach under which we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the estimated discounted future cash flows of that unit. We evaluate the reasonableness of this approach by comparing it with the market approach, which involves a review of the carrying value of our assets relative to our market capitalization and to the valuation of publicly traded companies operating in the same or similar lines of business. Applying the income approach requires that we make a number of important estimates and assumptions. We estimate the future cash flows of each reporting unit based on historical and forecasted revenue and operating costs. This, in turn, involves further estimates, such as estimates of future revenue and expense growth rates and foreign exchange rates. In addition, we apply a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows for the purpose of the valuation. This discount rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital for each reporting unit and may change from year to year. For example, in our valuation process in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 we used a lower discount rate than in the prior year due to stabilized risk associated with the global economic conditions. Changes in these key estimates and assumptions, or in other assumptions used in this process, could materially affect our impairment analysis for a given year. 31 Table of Contents As of April 1, 2011, our goodwill balance was $5 billion. Based on the impairment analysis performed on January 4, 2011, we determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value of the unit by more than 10% of the carrying value. While discount rates are only one of several important estimates used in the analysis, we determined that an increase of one percentage point in the discount rate used for each respective reporting unit would not have resulted in an impairment indicator for any unit at the time of this analysis, except for the Security and Compliance reporting unit which would have had a fair value 5% below carrying value. However, we believe that the discount rate applied to the Security and Compliance reporting unit is appropriate and we applied the same discount rate for this reporting unit in fiscal 2011 as we used in fiscal 2010. In addition to the discount rate, the impairment test includes the consideration of a number of estimates, including growth rates, operating margins and cost forecasts, foreign exchange rates and the allocation of certain tangible assets to the reporting units. Based on the results of our impairment test, we do not believe that an impairment indicator exists as of our annual impairment test date. A number of factors, many of which we have no ability to control, could affect our financial condition, operating results and business prospects and could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed. These factors include: a prolonged global economic crisis; a significant decrease in the demand for our products; the inability to develop new and enhanced products and services in a timely manner; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; successful efforts by our competitors to gain market share in our markets; a loss of key personnel; our determination to dispose of one or more of our reporting units; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and recognition of a goodwill impairment loss. Intangible Asset Impairment. We assess the impairment of identifiable finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset groups carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of certain finite lived intangible assets, particularly customer relationships and finite lived tradenames, would be measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of the asset group to which the assets are assigned to the sum of the undiscounted estimated future cash flows the asset group is expected to generate. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of such impairment would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value. Recoverability and impairment of other finite lived intangible assets, particularly developed technology and patents, would be measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the sum of undiscounted estimated future product revenues offset by estimated future costs to dispose of the product to which the asset relates. For indefinite lived intangible assets, we review impairment on an annual basis consistent with the timing of the annual evaluation for goodwill. These assets generally include tradenames, trademarks and in process research and development. Recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets would be measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the sum of the discounted estimated future cash flows the asset is expected to generate plus expected royalties. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of such impairment would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value. Our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted future revenue, operating costs, and other relevant factors. Assumptions and estimates about the remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are subjective and are affected by changes to our business strategies. If managements estimates of future operating results change, or if there are changes to other assumptions, the estimate of the fair value of our identifiable intangible assets could change significantly. Such change could result in impairment charges in future periods, which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition. 32 Table of Contents Long Lived Assets (including Assets Held for Sale). We assess long lived assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the long lived assets may not be recoverable. Based on the existence of one or more indicators of impairment, we assess recoverability of long lived assets based on a projected undiscounted cash flow method using assumptions determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model. If an asset is not recoverable, impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and its fair value. Our estimates of cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many factors which could change and cause a material impact to our operating results or financial condition. We record impairment charges on long lived assets held for sale when we determine that the carrying value of the long lived assets may not be recoverable. In determining fair value, we obtain and consider market value appraisal information from third parties. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The assessment of fair value for our financial instruments is based on the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements which establishes a fair value hierarchy that is based on three levels of inputs and requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. We use inputs such as actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes and other similar data which are obtained from independent pricing vendors, quoted market prices or other sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and liabilities. We use such pricing data as the primary input, to which we have not made any material adjustments, to make our assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of our investment portfolio, and we are ultimately responsible for the financial statements and underlying estimates. The fair value and inputs are reviewed for reasonableness, may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information that we deem material to the estimated fair value of our investment portfolio. As of April 1, 2011, our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included $2.0 billion of assets which consists of cash equivalents invested in money market funds and bank securities. Investments totalling $1.9 billion were classified as Level 1 and $204 million were classified as Level 2, which are comprised solely of money market funds and bank securities, respectively. Valuations for Level 1 securities were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets. Determining fair value for Level 1 instruments generally does not require significant management judgment. Valuations for Level 2 securities were based on either (1) the fair value of similar securities or (2) pricing models with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market prices for identical securities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets). While determining the fair value for Level 2 instruments does not necessarily require significant management judgment, it generally involves the following degree of judgment and subjectivity: (1) an assessment of an active market for marketable securities generally takes into consideration whether a trading market exists for a given instrument or the level of trading volume for each instrument type and (2) when observable market prices for identical securities or similar securities are not available, we may price marketable securities using: non binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data; or pricing models, such as discounted cash flow approaches, with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data. The majority of our Level 2 financial instruments were classified as such due to either low trading activity in active markets or no active market existing. For certain financial instruments, identical securities were used to determine fair value. For those securities where no active market existed, amortized cost was used as it approximates their fair value because of their short maturities. As of April 1, 2011, we had no financial instruments with unobservable inputs classified in Level 3 under the hierarchy set forth under the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements. Level 3 instruments generally would include those for which unobservable inputs used in the valuation methodology are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities. The determination of fair value for Level 3 instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity. 33 Table of Contents Stock based Compensation We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this guidance, stock based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. Determining the fair value of stock based awards, primarily stock options, at the grant date requires judgment. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected life of the options, actual and projected employee stock option exercise and cancellation behaviors, risk free interest rates, and expected dividends. We estimate the expected life of options granted based on an analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and post vesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the option. Expected volatility is based on the average of historical volatility for the period commensurate with the expected life of the option and the implied volatility of traded options. The risk free interest rate is equal to the U.S. Treasury constant maturity rates for the period equal to the expected life. We do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, our expected dividend yield is zero. In accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock compensation, we only record stock based compensation expense for awards that are expected to vest. As a result, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited. Although we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience, actual forfeitures may differ. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted when we record an adjustment for the difference in the period that the awards vest or are forfeited. Contingencies and Litigation We evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with the authoritative guidance on contingencies. We assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes from a potential claim or legal proceeding, as well as potential ranges of probable losses, when the outcomes of the claims or proceedings are probable and reasonably estimable. A determination of the amount of accrued liabilities required, if any, for these contingencies is made after the analysis of each separate matter. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, we base our estimates on the information available at the time of our assessment. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Any revisions in the estimates of potential liabilities could have a material impact on our operating results and financial position. Income Taxes We are required to compute our income taxes in each federal, state, and international jurisdiction in which we operate. This process requires that we estimate the current tax exposure as well as assess temporary differences between the accounting and tax treatment of assets and liabilities, including items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes. The income tax effects of the differences we identify are classified as current or long term deferred tax assets and liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our judgments, assumptions, and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Operations. We account for uncertain tax issues pursuant to authoritative guidance based on a two step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be 34 Table of Contents sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, refinement of estimates, or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact our tax provision in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period in which such determination is made. We must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income and, based on this assessment establish a valuation allowance, if required. Our determination of our valuation allowance is based upon a number of assumptions, judgments, and estimates, including forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the valuation allowance in a period, we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease to our tax provision in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. In July 2008, we reached an agreement with the IRS concerning our eligibility to claim a lower tax rate on a distribution made from a Veritas foreign subsidiary prior to the July 2005 acquisition. The distribution was intended to be made pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and therefore eligible for a 5.25% effective U.S. federal rate of tax, in lieu of the 35% statutory rate. The final impact of this agreement remains uncertain since this relates to the taxability of earnings that are otherwise the subject of the transfer pricing matters at issue in the IRS examination of Veritas tax years 2002 through 2005. To the extent that we owe taxes as a result of these transfer pricing matters in years prior to the distribution, we anticipate that the incremental tax due from this negotiated agreement will decrease. We currently estimate that the most probable outcome from this negotiated agreement will be that we will owe $13 million or less, for which an accrual has already been made. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Total Net Revenue Fiscal 2011 vs. 2010 Fiscal 2010 vs. 2009 Fiscal 2011 $ % 2010 $ % 2009 ($ in millions) Net revenue $ 6,190 $ 205 3 % $ 5,985 $ (165 ) (3 )% $ 6,150 Net revenue increased for fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to an increase in Content, subscription, and maintenance revenue for the reasons discussed above under Financial Results and Trends, partially offset by a slight decline in License revenue. Net revenue decreased for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, primarily due to a decrease in License revenue partially offset by an increase in Content, subscription, and maintenance revenue. The net decrease was primarily due to decreased license revenue as a result of the overall market weakness in server sales and tight IT spending due to the global economic slowdown and the uncertainty surrounding the acquisition of Sun Microsystems, Inc. by Oracle Corporation. Content, subscription, and maintenance revenue Fiscal 2011 vs. 2010 Fiscal 2010 vs. 2009 Fiscal 2011 $ % 2010 $ % 2009 ($ in millions) Content, subscription, and maintenance revenue $ 5,266 $ 232 5 % $ 5,034 $ 171 4 % $ 4,863 Percentage of total net revenue 85 % 84 % 79 % Content, subscription, and maintenance revenue increased for fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to sales increases in our Consumer, Security and Compliance, and Storage and Server Management 35 Table of Contents segments for the reasons discussed above under Financial Results and Trends, partially offset by foreign exchange effects. Content, subscription, and maintenance revenue increased for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, as a result of strength in our Consumer segment primarily due to increases in revenue from acquired security products and the gradual global ramp up of our eCommerce platform. License revenue Fiscal 2011 vs. 2010 Fiscal 2010 vs. 2009 Fiscal 2011 $ % 2010 $ % 2009 ($ in millions) License revenue $ 924 $ (27 ) (3 )% $ 951 $ (336 ) (26 )% $ 1,287 Percentage of total net revenue 15 % 16 % 21 % License revenue decreased for fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to a decline in revenue from our Storage and Server Management segment, partially offset by an increase in revenue from our Security and Compliance segment. License revenue decreased for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, primarily due to the global economic slowdown and customers emphasizing purchases of smaller volumes of new licenses consistent with their near term needs. Net revenue and operating income by segment Consumer Segment Fiscal 2011 vs. 2010 Fiscal 2010 vs. 2009 Fiscal 2011 $ % 2010 $ % 2009 ($ in millions) Consumer revenue $ 1,953 $ 82 4 % $ 1,871 $ 98 6 % $ 1,773 Percentage of total net revenue 32 % 31 % 29 % Consumer operating income $ 899 $ 39 5 % $ 860 $ (88 ) (9 )% $ 948 Percentage of Consumer revenue 46 % 46 % 53 % Consumer revenue increased for fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to the reasons discussed above under Financial Results and Trends as well as increased sales of our premium security suite. Our electronic channel sales are derived from online sales (which include new subscriptions, renewals, and upgrades), OEMs, and ISPs. For fiscal 2011, electronic channel revenue increased as compared to fiscal 2010. Operating income for the Consumer segment increased for fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, due to increased revenue, partially offset by costs associated with the deployment of our new proprietary eCommerce platform. Consumer revenue increased for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, primarily due to increases in revenue from acquired security products and our core consumer products in the electronic channel. Operating income for the Consumer segment decreased for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, as expense growth outpaced revenue growth. Total expenses for the segment increased primarily as a result of the higher OEM placement fees and costs associated with our development and operation of our new proprietary eCommerce platform. 36 Table of Contents Security and Compliance Segment Fiscal 2011 vs. 2010 Fiscal 2010 vs. 2009 Fiscal 2011 $ % 2010 $ % 2009 ($ in millions) Security and Compliance revenue $ 1,566 $ 155 11 % $ 1,411 $ (39 ) (3 )% $ 1,450 Percentage of total net revenue 25 % 24 % 24 % Security and Compliance operating income $ 243 $ (128 ) (35 )% $ 371 $ (69 ) (16 )% $ 440 Percentage of Security and Compliance revenue 16 % 26 % 30 % Security and Compliance revenue increased for fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, due to increases in revenue from our 2011 acquisitions. Security and Compliance operating income decreased for fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, due to increased expenses related to our fiscal 2011 acquisitions and higher sales commissions associated with the increase in deferred revenue in 2011. Our operating margins were adversely impacted by our fiscal 2011 acquisitions, largely because we were required under the purchase accounting rules to reduce the amount of deferred revenue that we recorded in connection with these acquisitions to an amount equal to the fair value of our estimated cost to fulfill the contractual obligations related to that deferred revenue. This deferred revenue adjustment negatively affected our operating margins because we recognized a lower portion of the revenue from these acquisitions (representing our estimated cost to fulfill the contractual obligations plus a normal margin), but we incurred all of the revenue related expenses. Security and Compliance revenue decreased for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, as a result of decreased demand due to reduced corporate IT budgets and slowed spending, partially offset by increases in revenue from acquired security products. Operating income for the segment decreased for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, as revenue decreased while expenses increased as a result of our fiscal 2009 acquisitions, partially offset by our cost containment measures. Storage and Server Management Segment Fiscal 2011 vs. 2010 Fiscal 2010 vs. 2009 Fiscal 2011 $ % 2010 $ % 2009 ($ in millions) Storage and Server Management segment $ 2,307 $ 20 1 % $ 2,287 $ (206 ) (8 )% $ 2,493 Percentage of total net revenue 37 % 38 % 40 % Storage and Server Management operating income $ 1,063 $ (34 ) (3 )% $ 1,097 $ 16 1 % $ 1,081 Percentage of Storage and Server Management revenue 46 % 48 % 43 % Storage and Server Management revenue increased for fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, due to an increase in revenue from the information management group, partially offset by a decrease in storage management revenue. Storage and Server Management operating income decreased for fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, due to the reasons discussed above under Financial Results and Trends. Storage and Server Management revenue decreased for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, primarily due to the overall market weakness in server sales and our customers buying smaller volumes of new licenses consistent with their near term needs, particularly with respect to our storage management products. Operating income for the Storage and Server Management segment increased for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, as the decrease in expenses more than offset the decrease in revenue due to our ongoing focus on cost efficiency. 37 Table of Contents Services Segment Fiscal 2011 vs. 2010 Fiscal 2010 vs. 2009 Fiscal 2011 $ % 2010 $ % 2009 ($ in millions) Services segment $ 364 $ (52 ) (13 )% $ 416 $ (17 ) (4 )% $ 433 Percentage of total net revenue 6 % 7 % 7 % Services operating income (loss) $ 24 $ (18 ) (43 )% $ 42 $ 9 27 % $ 33 Percentage of Services revenue 7 % 10 % 8 % Services revenue and operating income decreased for fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, as we continue to support the transition to our partner led consulting program while we focus on our core software business. Services revenue decreased for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, primarily due to a reduction in consulting revenue associated with new license sales. Operating income for the Services segment increased for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, as various cost control initiatives led to better margins. Other segment Fiscal 2011 vs. 2010 Fiscal 2010 vs. 2009 Fiscal 2011 $ % 2010 $ % 2009 ($ in millions) Other segment $ $ NA $ $ (1 ) (100 )% $ 1 Percentage of total net revenue 0 % 0 % 0 % Other operating loss $ (1,349 ) $ 88 * $ (1,437 ) $ 7,535 * $ (8,972 ) Percentage of Other revenue * * * * Percentage not meaningful The Other segment includes general and administrative expenses; amortization of acquired product rights, intangible assets, and other assets; goodwill and intangible impairment charges; charges such as stock based compensation, restructuring and transition; and certain indirect costs that are not charged to the other operating segments. The improvement of the operating loss for the Other segment for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to the items discussed above under Financial Results and Trends. The operating loss of our Other segment for fiscal 2009 primarily consisted of a non cash goodwill impairment charge of $7.4 billion. Net revenue by geographic region Fiscal 2011 vs. 2010 Fiscal 2010 vs. 2009 Fiscal 2011 $ % 2010 $ % 2009 ($ in millions) Americas (U.S., Canada and Latin America) $ 3,388 $ 147 5 % $ 3,241 $ (75 ) (2 )% $ 3,316 Percentage of total net revenue 55 % 54 % 54 % EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa) $ 1,773 $ (65 ) (4 )% $ 1,838 $ (120 ) (6 )% $ 1,958 Percentage of total net revenue 29 % 31 % 32 % Asia Pacific/Japan $ 1,029 $ 123 14 % $ 906 $ 30 3 % $ 876 Percentage of total net revenue 16 % 15 % 14 % Total net revenue $ 6,190 $ 5,985 $ 6,150 Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies unfavorably impacted our international revenue by approximately $53 million for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 and favorably impacted our international revenue by approximately $14 million for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. 38 Table of Contents Americas revenue increased for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to increased revenue from our Consumer and Security and Compliance segments, partially offset by decreased revenue from our Services segment. EMEA revenue decreased for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to an unfavorable impact of the change in foreign currency exchange rates in the EMEA region relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by increased revenue from our Security and Compliance segment. Asia Pacific/Japan revenue increased for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to a favorable impact of the change in foreign currency exchange rates in the Asia Pacific/Japan region relative to the U.S. dollar, and strength in sales in our Security and Compliance and Storage and Server Management segments. Americas revenue decreased for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to decreased revenue related to our Storage and Server Management, Security and Compliance and Services segments, partially offset by increased revenue related to our Consumer segment. EMEA revenue decreased for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to decreased revenue across all of our segments, particularly Storage and Server Management. Asia Pacific Japan revenue increased for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to increased revenue related to our Consumer and Security and Compliance segments, partially offset by decreased revenue in our Storage and Server Management segment. Our international sales are and will continue to be a significant portion of our net revenue. As a result, net revenue will continue to be affected by foreign currency exchange rates as compared to the U.S. dollar. We are unable to predict the extent to which revenue in future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If international sales become a greater portion of our total sales in the future, changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have a potentially greater impact on our revenue and operating results. Cost of Revenue Fiscal 2011 vs. 2010 Fiscal 2010 vs. 2009 Fiscal 2011 $ % 2010 $ % 2009 ($ in millions) Cost of revenue $ 1,045 $ (60 ) (5 )% $ 1,105 $ (122 ) (10 )% $ 1,227 Gross margin 83 % 82 % 80 % Cost of revenue consists primarily of the amortization of acquired product rights, fee based technical support costs, fulfillment costs, costs of billable services, payments to OEMs under revenue sharing arrangements, manufacturing, direct material costs, and royalties paid to third parties under technology licensing agreements. Cost of revenue decreased for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010, and for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009, primarily due to a decrease in amortization of certain acquired product rights related to our acquisition of Veritas in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011. The decrease for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was partially offset by increases in costs related to our fiscal 2011 acquisitions, fee based technical support, and fulfillment costs. Cost of content, subscription, and maintenance Fiscal 2011 vs. 2010 Fiscal 2010 vs. 2009 Fiscal 2011 $ % 2010 $ % 2009 ($ in millions) Cost of content, subscription, and maintenance $ 903 $ 54 6 % $ 849 $ 9 1 % $ 840 As a percentage of related revenue 17 % 17 % 17 % Cost of content, subscription, and maintenance consists primarily of fee based technical support costs, costs of billable services, and payments to OEMs under revenue sharing agreements. 39 Table of Contents Cost of content, subscription, and maintenance increased for fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, due to increases in fee based technical support and fulfillment costs. Cost of content, subscription, and maintenance as a percentage of related revenue remained consistent for fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010. Cost of content, subscription, and maintenance as a percentage of related revenue remained relatively consistent for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, as increases in royalty, technical support and fulfillment costs were partially offset by decreases in services and distribution costs for the respective periods.

Amortization of acquired product rights Fiscal 2011 vs. 2010 Fiscal 2010 vs. 2009 Fiscal 2011 $ % 2010 $ % 2009 ($ in millions) Amortization of acquired product rights $ 115 $ (119 ) (51 )% $ 234 $ (118 ) (34 )% $ 352 Percentage of total net revenue 2 % 4 % 6 % Acquired product rights are comprised of developed technologies and patents from acquired companies. The decrease in amortization for fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, was primarily due to certain acquired product rights related to our acquisition of Veritas becoming fully amortized during the first quarters of fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011. This decrease was partially offset by additional amortization from product rights acquired from VeriSign, PGP, and GuardianEdge during fiscal 2011. The decrease in amortization for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, was primarily due to certain acquired product rights from our acquisition of Veritas becoming fully amortized during the first quarter of our fiscal 2010. This decrease was partially offset by additional amortization from product rights acquired from SwapDrive, PC Tools, and MessageLabs during fiscal 2009. Operating Expenses Operating expenses overview Fiscal 2011 vs. 2010 Fiscal 2010 vs. 2009 Fiscal 2011 $ % 2010 $ % 2009 ($ in millions) Sales and marketing expense $ 2,622 $ 255 11 % $ 2,367 $ (19 ) (1 )% $ 2,386 Percentage of total net revenue 42 % 40 % 39 % Research and development expense $ 862 $ 5 1 % $ 857 $ (13 ) (1 )% $ 870 Percentage of total net revenue 14 % 14 % 14 % General and administrative expense $ 390 $ 38 11 % $ 352 $ 9 3 % $ 343 Percentage of total net revenue 6 % 6 % 6 % Sales and marketing expense increased for fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to our fiscal 2011 acquisitions, higher sales commissions associated with increased deferred revenue in fiscal 2011, and increased costs associated with the deployment of our new proprietary eCommerce platform. 40 Table of Contents Sales and marketing expense remained relatively flat during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2010 sales and marketing expense reflects the impact of our prior year restructuring plan, partially offset by increases in headcount related expenses from our fiscal 2009 acquisitions and increases in Consumer OEM placement fees and costs associated with the development and operations of our new proprietary eCommerce platform. Research and development expense remained relatively flat as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009. General and administrative expense increased for fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to our fiscal 2011 acquisitions. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expense remained flat in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009.

The increase in amortization of other purchased intangible assets for fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, was primarily due to our acquisition of VeriSigns identity and authentication business. As a percentage of net revenue, amortization of other purchased intangible assets remained relatively consistent for fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010. Amortization for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, increased as a result of our fiscal 2009 acquisitions. As a percentage of net revenue, amortization of other purchased intangible assets remained relatively consistent for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009.

Total remaining costs are estimated to range from $10 million to $18 million, primarily for the 2011 Plan and 2010 Plan. For further information on restructuring, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 Table of Contents Impairment of intangible assets and goodwill and Loss and impairment of assets held for sale Fiscal 2011 vs. 2010 Fiscal 2010 vs. 2009 Fiscal 2011 $ % 2010 $ % 2009 ($ in millions) Impairment of intangible assets and goodwill $ 27 $ 27 NA $ $ (7,419 ) 100 % $ 7,419 Percentage of total net revenue 0 % 0 % 121 % Loss and impairment of assets held for sale $ 2 $ (28 ) (93 )% $ 30 $ (16 ) (35 )% $ 46 Percentage of total net revenue 0 % 1 % 1 % During fiscal 2011, we recorded an impairment of $27 million which reduced the gross carrying value of indefinite lived tradenames. This impairment charge was due to reductions in expected future cash flows for certain indefinite lived tradenames related to the Consumer segment. This impairment charge was recorded within Impairment of intangible assets and goodwill on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During fiscal 2010 and 2009, we recognized impairments of $20 million and $46 million, respectively, on certain land and buildings classified as held for sale. The impairments were recorded in accordance with the authoritative guidance that requires a long lived asset classified as held for sale to be measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value, less cost to sell. Also, in fiscal 2010, we sold assets for $42 million which resulted in losses of $10 million. We sold properties in fiscal 2009 for $40 million with an immaterial loss. During fiscal 2009, we concluded that there were impairment indicators, including the challenging economic environment and a decline in our market capitalization, which required us to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis. As a result, we incurred a total impairment charge of $7.4 billion for fiscal 2009. Non operating income and expense Fiscal 2011 vs. 2010 Fiscal 2010 vs. 2009 Fiscal 2011 $ % 2010 $ % 2009 ($ in millions) Interest income $ 10 $ 6 $ 37 Interest expense (143 ) (129 ) (125 ) Other (expense) income, net (2 ) 55 8 Loss on early extinguishment of debt (16 ) Total $ (151 ) $ (83 ) 122 % $ (68 ) $ 12 (15 )% $ (80 ) Percentage of total net revenue (2 )% (1 )% (1 )% The increase in interest expense during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, is due to the Senior Notes issued in the second quarter of fiscal 2011. Other (expense) income, net for fiscal 2011 includes a $21 million loss from the liquidation of certain foreign legal entities, partially offset by a realized gain on marketable securities. Other (expense) income, net for fiscal 2010 included net gains of $47 million from the liquidation of certain foreign legal entities. The Loss on early extinguishment of debt of $16 million was due to the repurchase of $500 million of aggregate principal amount of the 0.75% Notes due on June 15, 2011. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The decrease in interest income during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, was due to a lower average yield on our invested cash and short term investment balances. Interest expense for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, remained relatively consistent. Other (expense) income, net for fiscal 2010 included net gains of $47 million from the liquidation of certain foreign legal entities. The liquidations resulted in the release of cumulative translation adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income related to these entities. 42 Table of Contents Provision for income taxes Fiscal 2011 2010 2009 ($ in millions) Provision for income taxes $ 105 $ 112 $ 183 Effective tax rate on earnings 14 % 13 % (3 )% Our effective tax rate was approximately 14%, 13%, and (3)% in fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010, and 2009, respectively. The tax expense in fiscal 2011 was reduced by the following benefits: (1) $49 million arising from the Veritas v Commissioner Tax Court decision further discussed below, (2) $15 million from the reduction of our valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets, and (3) $21 million tax benefit from lapses of statutes of limitation, and (4) $7 million tax benefit from the conclusion of U.S. and foreign audits. The tax expense in fiscal 2010 was significantly reduced by the following benefits: (1) $79 million tax benefit arising from the Veritas v. Commissioner Tax Court decision, (2) $11 million tax benefit from the reduction of our valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets, (3) $17 million tax benefit from lapses of statutes of limitation, (4) $9 million tax benefit from the conclusion of U.S. and foreign audits, (5) $7 million tax benefit to adjust taxes provided in prior periods, and (6) $6 million tax benefit from current year discrete events. The change in the valuation allowance follows discussions with Irish Revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2010, the result of which accelerates the timing of the use of certain Irish tax loss carryforwards in the future. The tax expense in fiscal 2009 was materially impacted by the inclusion of a $56 million tax benefit associated with the $7.0 billion impairment of goodwill in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. The effective tax rates for all periods presented otherwise reflects the benefits of lower taxed foreign earnings and losses from our joint venture with Huawei Technologies Co., Limited, domestic manufacturing incentives, and research and development credits, partially offset by state income taxes. Substantially all of the foreign earnings were generated by subsidiaries in Ireland and Singapore. As a result of the impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2009, we have cumulative pre tax book losses, as measured by the current and prior two years. We considered the negative evidence of this cumulative pre tax book loss position on our ability to continue to recognize deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income for realization. Levels of future taxable income are subject to the various risks and uncertainties discussed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, set forth in this annual report. We considered the following as positive evidences: the vast majority of the goodwill impairment is not deductible for tax purposes and thus will not result in tax losses; we have a strong, consistent taxpaying history; we have substantial U.S. federal income tax carryback potential; and we have substantial amounts of scheduled future reversals of taxable temporary differences from our deferred tax liabilities. We have concluded that these positive evidences outweigh the negative evidence and, thus, that the deferred tax assets as of April 1, 2011of $536 million, after application of the valuation allowances, are realizable on a more likely than not basis. On March 29, 2006, we received a Notice of Deficiency from the IRS claiming that we owe $867 million of additional taxes, excluding interest and penalties, for the 2000 and 2001 tax years based on an audit of Veritas. On June 26, 2006, we filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court, Veritas v Commissioner, protesting the IRS claim for such additional taxes. During July 2008, we completed the trial phase of the Tax Court case, which dealt with the remaining issue covered in the assessment. At trial, the IRS changed its position with respect to this remaining issue, which decreased the remaining amount at issue from $832 million to $545 million, excluding interest. On December 10, 2009, the U.S. Tax Court issued its opinion, finding that our transfer pricing methodology, with appropriate adjustments, was the best method for assessing the value of the transaction at issue between Veritas and its offshore subsidiary. The Tax Court judge provided guidance as to how adjustments would be made to correct the application of the method used by Veritas. We remeasured and decreased our liability for unrecognized tax benefits accordingly, resulting in a $79 million tax benefit in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. In June 2010, we reached an agreement with the IRS concerning the amount of the adjustment related to the U.S. Tax Court decision. As a result of the agreement, we further reduced our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, resulting in an additional 43 Table of Contents $39 million tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. In March 2011, we reached agreement with Irish Revenue concerning compensating adjustments arising from this matter, resulting in an additional $10 million tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. This matter has now been closed and no further adjustments to the accrued liability are warranted. On December 2, 2009, we received a Revenue Agents Report from the IRS for the Veritas 2002 through 2005 tax years assessing additional taxes due. We agree with $30 million of the tax assessment, excluding interest, but will contest the other $80 million of tax assessed and all penalties. The unagreed issues concern transfer pricing matters comparable to the one that was resolved in our favor in the Veritas v. Commissioner Tax Court decision. On January 15, 2010 we filed a protest with the IRS in connection with the $80 million of tax assessed. On September 28, 2010, the case was formally accepted into the IRS Appeals process for consideration. This matter remains outstanding. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing tax controversies and the impact, if any, of the expected tolling of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions. Loss from joint venture Fiscal 2011 vs. 2010 Fiscal 2010 vs. 2009 Fiscal 2011 $ % 2010 $ % 2009 ($ in millions) Loss from joint venture $ 31 $ (8 ) (21 )% $ 39 $ (14 ) (26 )% $ 53 Percentage of total net revenue 1 % 1 % 1 % On February 5, 2008, Symantec formed Huawei Symantec, Technologies Co., Limited (joint venture) with a subsidiary of Huawei Technologies Co., Limited (Huawei). The joint venture is domiciled in Hong Kong with principal operations in Chengdu, China. The joint venture develops, manufactures, markets and supports security and storage appliances for global telecommunications carriers and enterprise customers. For fiscal 2011, we recorded a loss of approximately $31 million related to our share of the joint ventures net loss incurred for the period from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010. For fiscal 2010, we recorded a loss of approximately $39 million related to our share of the joint ventures net loss incurred for the period from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2009. For fiscal 2009, we recorded a loss of approximately $53 million related to our share of the joint ventures net loss incurred for the period from February 5, 2008 (its date of inception) to December 31, 2008. Loss attributable to noncontrolling interest In fiscal 2011, we completed the acquisition of the identity and authentication business of VeriSign, Inc. (VeriSign), including a controlling interest in its subsidiary VeriSign Japan K.K. (VeriSign Japan), a publicly traded company on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Given the Companys majority ownership interest of approximately 54% in VeriSign Japan, the accounts of VeriSign Japan have been consolidated with the accounts of the Company, and a noncontrolling interest has been recorded for the noncontrolling investors interests in the equity and operations of VeriSign Japan. For fiscal 2011, the loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest in VeriSign Japan was $4 million. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Sources of Cash We have historically relied on cash flow from operations, borrowings under a credit facility, and issuances of debt and equity securities for our liquidity needs. As of April 1, 2011, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3 billion resulting in a net liquidity position of approximately $4 billion, which is defined as cash and cash equivalents and unused availability of the credit facility. 44 Table of Contents Senior Notes. In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we issued $350 million in principal amount of 2.75% Notes due September 15, 2015 and $750 million in principal amount of 4.20% Notes due September 15, 2020, for an aggregate principal amount of $1.1 billion. Revolving Credit Facility. In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we also entered into a $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in September 2014. Under the terms of this credit facility, we must comply with certain financial and non financial covenants, including a covenant to maintain a specified ratio of debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). As of April 1, 2011, we were in compliance with all required covenants, and there was no outstanding balance on the credit facility. In addition, in the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we terminated our previous $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility that we entered into in July 2006. At the time of termination, there was no outstanding balance on the credit facility. The original expiration date for this credit facility was July 2011. We believe that our existing cash and investment balances, our borrowing capacity, our ability to issue new debt instruments, and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures requirements for at least the next 12 months. Uses of Cash Our principal cash requirements include working capital, capital expenditures and payments of principal and interest on our debt and taxes. In addition, we regularly evaluate our ability to repurchase stock and acquire other businesses. Acquisition related. In fiscal 2011, we acquired the identity and authentication business of VeriSign, as well as PGP, GuardianEdge and two other companies for an aggregate amount of $1.5 billion, net of cash acquired. In fiscal 2010, we acquired two companies for an aggregate payment of $31 million, net of cash acquired. For fiscal 2009, we acquired MessageLabs, PC Tools, SwapDrive, and several other companies for an aggregate payment of $1.1 billion, net of cash acquired. Convertible Senior Notes. In June 2006, we issued $1.1 billion principal amount of 0.75% Notes due June 15, 2011, and $1.0 billion principal amount of 1.00% Notes due June 15, 2013, to initial purchasers in a private offering for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC Rule 144A. In fiscal 2011, we repurchased $500 million of aggregate principal amount of our 0.75% Notes in privately negotiated transactions for approximately $510 million. Concurrently with the repurchase, we sold a proportionate share of the note hedges that we entered into at the time of the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes back to the note hedge counterparties for approximately $13 million. The net cost of the repurchase of the 0.75% Notes and the concurrent sale of the note hedges was $497 million in cash. We did not pay any amount of the 0.75% Notes or the 1.00% Notes other than the related interest costs in either of fiscal 2010 or 2009. Stock Repurchases. We repurchased 57 million, 34 million, and 42 million shares for $872 million, $553 million, and $700 million during fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. As of April 1, 2011, we had $877 million remaining under the plan authorized for future repurchases. Cash Flows The following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, selected items in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: Fiscal 2011 2010 2009 (In millions) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,794 $ 1,693 $ 1,671 Investing activities (1,760 ) (65 ) (961 ) Financing activities (184 ) (441 ) (677 ) 45 Table of Contents Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.8 billion for fiscal 2011, which resulted from net income of $593 million adjusted for non cash items, including depreciation and amortization charges of $743 million and stock based compensation expense of $145 million, and an increase in deferred revenue of $442 million. These amounts were partially offset by a decrease in income taxes payable of $128 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion for fiscal 2010, which resulted from net income of $714 million adjusted for non cash items, including depreciation and amortization charges of $837 million and stock based compensation expense of $155 million. These amounts were partially offset by a decrease in income taxes payable of $95 million primarily related to the outcome of the Veritas v. Commissioner Tax Court decision; see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion for fiscal 2009, which resulted from non cash charges related to depreciation and amortization expenses of $933 million and the $7.4 billion goodwill impairment charge offset by the net loss of $6.8 billion. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities of $1.8 billion for fiscal 2011 was due to $1.5 billion of payments for our fiscal 2011 acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and $268 million paid for capital expenditures. Net cash used in investing activities was $65 million for fiscal 2010 and was primarily due to $248 million paid for capital expenditures, partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities of $190 million. Net cash used in investing activities was $1.0 billion for fiscal 2009 and was primarily due to an aggregate payment of $1.1 billion in cash for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and $272 million paid for capital expenditures, partially offset by net proceeds of $336 million from the sale of short term investments which were used to partially fund acquisitions. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities of $184 million for fiscal 2011 was primarily due to repurchases of common stock of $872 million and repurchases of long term debt of $510 million, partially offset by proceeds from debt issuance, net of discount, of $1.1 billion and net proceeds from sales of common stock through employee stock plans of $122 million. Net cash used in financing activities of $441 million for fiscal 2010 was due to repurchases of common stock of $553 million, partially offset by net proceeds from sales of common stock through employee stock plans of $124 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $677 million for fiscal 2009 and was primarily due to repurchases of common stock of $700 million and the repayment of $200 million on our revolving credit facility, partially offset by net proceeds from sales of common stock through employee stock plans of $229 million. As of April 1, 2011, $1.6 billion of the $3 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. We have provided U.S. deferred taxes on a portion of our undistributed foreign earnings sufficient to address the incremental U.S. tax that would be due if we needed these funds for our operations in the U.S. 46 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following is a schedule by years of our significant contractual obligations as of April 1, 2011: Payments Due by Period Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2015 Fiscal 2017 Total Fiscal 2012 and 2014 and 2016 and Thereafter Other (In millions) Senior Notes(1) $ 1,100 $ $ $ 350 $ 750 $ Interest payments on Senior Notes(1) 342 41 82 77 142 Convertible Senior Notes(2) 1,600 600 1,000 Interest payments on Convertible Senior Notes(2) 27 12 15 Purchase obligations(3) 373 334 39 Operating leases(4) 408 94 145 79 90 Norton royalty agreement(5) 2 2 Uncertain tax positions(6) 361 361 Total contractual obligations $ 4,213 $ 1,083 $ 1,281 $ 506 $ 982 $ 361 (1) In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we issued $350 million in principal amount of 2.75% Notes due September 15, 2015 and $750 million in principal amount of 4.20% Notes due September 15, 2020. Interest payments were calculated based on terms of the related notes. For further information on the Senior Notes, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) In the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we issued $1.1 billion in principal amount of 0.75% Notes due June 15, 2011 and $1.0 billion in principal amount of 1.00% Notes due June 15, 2013. In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we repurchased $500 million of aggregate principal amount of our 0.75% Notes. Interest payments were calculated based on terms of the related notes. For further information on the Convertible Senior Notes, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) These amounts are associated with agreements for purchases of goods or services generally including agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The table above also includes agreements to purchase goods or services that have cancellation provisions requiring little or no payment. The amounts under such contracts are included in the table above because management believes that cancellation of these contracts is unlikely and we expect to make future cash payments according to the contract terms or in similar amounts for similar materials. (4) We have entered into various noncancelable operating lease agreements that expire on various dates through 2029. The amounts in the table above include $32 million in exited or excess facility costs related to restructuring activities, excluding expected sublease income. (5) In June 2007, we amended an existing royalty agreement with Peter Norton for the licensing of certain publicity rights. As a result, we recorded a long term liability reflecting the net present value of expected future royalty payments due to Mr. Norton. (6) As of April 1, 2011, we reflected $361 million in long term taxes payable related to uncertain tax positions. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond the next twelve months due to uncertainties in the timing of the commencement and settlement of potential tax audits and controversies. Indemnifications As permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at our request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is not limited; however, we have directors and officers insurance coverage that reduces our exposure 47 Table of Contents and may enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal. We provide limited product warranties and the majority of our software license agreements contain provisions that indemnify licensees of our software from damages and costs resulting from claims alleging that our software infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party. Historically, payments made under these provisions have been immaterial. We monitor the conditions that are subject to indemnification to identify if a loss has occurred. Recently Issued and Adopted Authoritative Guidance In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we adopted new authoritative guidance which changes the model for determining whether an entity should consolidate a variable interest entity (VIE). The standard replaces the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a VIE with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a VIE and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive the entitys residual returns. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2011. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, updated authoritative guidance was issued to modify Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. For those reporting units, an entity is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. In determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists, we will need to consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist. The adoption of this guidance will be effective beginning April 2, 2011, the first quarter of our fiscal 2012. The updated guidance may require us to perform the Step 2 for our Services reporting unit upon adoption. The adoption of this guidance could potentially result in an impairment of the goodwill recorded in the Services reporting unit of up to $19 million. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to various market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity prices. We may use derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain risks in accordance with our investment and foreign exchange policies. We do not use derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio and the potential losses arising from changes in interest rates. Our investment objective is to achieve the maximum return compatible with capital preservation and our liquidity requirements. Our strategy is to invest our cash in a manner that preserves capital, maintains sufficient liquidity to meet our cash requirements, maximizes yields consistent with approved credit risk, and limits inappropriate concentrations of investment by sector, credit, or issuer. We classify our cash equivalents and short term investments in accordance with the authoritative guidance on investments. We consider investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. We classify our short term investments as available for sale. Short term investments consist of marketable debt or equity securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days. Our cash equivalents and short term investment portfolios consist primarily of money market funds, commercial paper, corporate debt securities, and U.S. government and government sponsored debt securities. Our short term investments do not include equity investments in privately held companies. Our short term investments are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in Accumulated other comprehensive income within Stockholders equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amortization of premiums and discounts on the investments, realized gains and losses, and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available for sale securities are included in Other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We use the specific identification method to determine cost in calculating realized gains and losses upon the sale of short term investments. 48 Table of Contents The following table presents the fair value and hypothetical changes in fair values on short term investments sensitive to changes in interest rates: Value of Securities Value of Securities Given an Given an Interest Interest Rate Increase of Rate Decrease of X X Basis Points (bps) Fair Value Basis Points (bps) 150 bps 100 bps 50 bps As of (25 bps) (75 bps) (In millions) April 1, 2011 $ 5 $ 5 $ 5 $ 5 $ 5 * April 2, 2010 $ 10 $ 10 $ 10 $ 10 $ 10 * * Amount not applicable The modeling technique used above measures the change in fair market value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus 150 bps, plus 100 bps, plus 50 bps, and minus 25 bps. As of April 1, 2011, we had $1.1 billion in principal amount of fixed rate Senior Notes outstanding, with a carrying amount of $1.1 billion and a fair value of $1.05 billion, which fair value is based on market prices. As of April 1, 2011, a hypothetical 50 BPS increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixed rate debt by a decrease of approximately $34 million and an increase of approximately $35 million, respectively. However, this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixed rate debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We conduct business in 43 currencies through our worldwide operations and, as such, we are exposed to foreign currency risk. Foreign currency risks are associated with our cash and cash equivalents, investments, receivables, and payables denominated in foreign currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates will result in foreign exchange gains and losses on these foreign currency assets and liabilities and are included in Other income, net. Our objective in managing foreign exchange activity is to preserve stockholder value by minimizing the risk of foreign currency exchange rate changes. Our strategy is to primarily utilize forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures. Under our program, gains and losses in our foreign currency exposures are offset by losses and gains on our forward contracts. Our forward contracts generally have terms of one to six months. At the end of the reporting period, open contracts are marked to market with unrealized gains and losses included in Other income, net. The following table presents a sensitivity analysis on our foreign forward exchange contract portfolio using a statistical model to estimate the potential gain or loss in fair value that could arise from hypothetical appreciation or depreciation of foreign currency: Value of Contracts Value of Contracts Given X% Given X% Appreciation of Depreciation of Foreign Foreign Currency Notional Currency Foreign Forward Exchange Contracts 10% 5% Amount (5)% (10)% (In millions) Purchased, April 1, 2011 $ 217 $ 208 $ 199 $ 188 $ 177 Sold, April 1, 2011 $ 271 $ 283 $ 298 $ 313 $ 331 Purchased, April 2, 2010 $ 217 $ 209 $ 199 $ 189 $ 177 Sold, April 2, 2010 $ 236 $ 248 $ 260 $ 274 $ 289 Equity Price Risk In June 2006, we issued $1.1 billion in principal amount of 0.75% Notes and $1.0 billion in principal amount of 1.00% Notes. We received proceeds of $2.1 billion from the 0.75% Notes and 1.00% Notes and incurred net transaction costs of approximately $33 million, of which $9 million was allocated to equity and the remainder 49 Table of Contents allocated proportionately to the 0.75% Notes and 1.00% Notes. The 0.75% Notes and 1.00% Notes were each issued at par and bear interest at 0.75% and 1.00% per annum, respectively. Interest is payable semiannually in arrears on June 15 and December 15. Concurrent with the issuance of the 0.75% Notes and 1.00% Notes, the Company entered into note hedge transactions with affiliates of certain initial purchasers whereby the Company has the option to purchase up to 110 million shares of Symantec common stock at a price of $19.12 per share. The cost of the note hedge transactions was approximately $592 million. In September 2010, we repurchased $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 0.75% Notes. Concurrently with this repurchase, we sold a proportionate share of the initial note hedges back to the note hedge counterparties for approximately $13 million. These transactions resulted in a loss from extinguishment of debt of approximately $16 million, which represents the difference between book value of the notes net of the remaining unamortized discount prior to repurchase and the fair value of the liability component of the notes upon repurchase. The net cost of the repurchase of the 0.75% Notes and the concurrent sale of the note hedges was $497 million in cash. The Convertible Senior Notes have a fixed annual interest rate and therefore, we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the Convertible Senior Notes. However, the values of the Convertible Senior Notes are exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of our fixed interest rate Convertible Senior Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair values of our Convertible Senior Notes are affected by our stock price. The carrying value of the 0.75% Notes was $596 million as of April 1, 2011. This represents the liability component of the $600 million principal balance as of April 1, 2011. The total estimated fair value of our 0.75% Notes at April 1, 2011 was $618 million and the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the 0.75% Notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, which was $103.00. The carrying value of the 1.00% Notes was $890 million as of April 1, 2011. This represents the liability component of the $1.0 billion principal balance as of April 1, 2011. The total estimated fair value of our 1.00% Notes at April 1, 2011 was $1.2 billion and the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the 1.00% Notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, which was $120.81. For business and strategic purposes, we also hold equity interests in several privately held companies, many of which can be considered to be in the start up or development stages. These investments are inherently risky and we could lose a substantial part or our entire investment in these companies. These investments are recorded at cost and classified as Other long term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of April 1, 2011, these investments had an aggregate carrying value of $30 million. 50 Table of Contents
