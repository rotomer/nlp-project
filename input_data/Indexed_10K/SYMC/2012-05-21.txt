Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW Our business Symantec is a global provider of security, storage, and systems management solutions that help organizations and consumers secure and manage their information driven world. Our software and services protect against advanced threats enabling confidence wherever information is used or stored. Fiscal calendar We have a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Friday closest to March 31. Unless otherwise stated, references to years in this report relate to fiscal year and periods ended March 30, 2012, April 1, 2011 and April 2, 2010. Fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010 each consisted of 52 weeks. Our 2013 fiscal year will consist of 52 weeks and will end on March 29, 2013. Our operating segments Our operating segments are significant strategic business units that offer different products and services, distinguished by customer needs. Since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we have operated in five operating segments: Consumer, Security and Compliance, Storage and Server Management, Services, and Other. During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we modified our segment reporting structure to more readily match our operating structure, resulting in the movement of managed security services revenue and expenses from the Services segment to the Security and Compliance segment. For further description of our operating segments, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report. Our reportable segments are the same as our operating segments. Financial results and trends Revenue increased by $540 million for fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily driven by growth in our Security and Compliance segment, Consumer segment, and Storage and Server Management segment. Our 30 Table of Contents strategic acquisitions have continued to contribute positively to our revenue in fiscal 2012. Of the total increase in revenue, approximately $486 million was due to the growth from our existing products and services and $54 million from our fiscal 2012 acquisitions. We expect that our acquisitions will continue to contribute positively to our revenue in future periods. Our revenue grew both domestically and internationally in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies favorably impacted our international revenue by $145 million for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 and unfavorably by $53 million for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. For fiscal 2012, we experienced the highest growth in revenue, on a percentage basis, in the Asia Pacific and Japan region followed by the Americas. We also experienced increases in revenue from the EMEA region despite overall weakness in the European economies. Our revenue mix has gradually shifted to a greater proportion of Content, subscription, and maintenance revenue, particularly revenue derived from subscription arrangements. This shift in our revenue mix is indicative of our success in achieving a more subscription based revenue model and a greater mix of subscription sales as a percentage of total sales. Revenue derived from subscription arrangements is recognized ratably over the subscription period. We recognized fewer license sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, which are generally recognized upon delivery of the product. Our operating expenses increased for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 by $304 million, due to an increase in the compensation expenses of $273 million and an adverse impact of the change in foreign currency exchange rates of $68 million. Compensation expense increased primarily due to an increase in headcount due to the overall growth of our business. Our operating expenses increased for similar reasons in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. Our non operating income in fiscal 2012 increased by $573 million over fiscal 2011 primarily due to the gain from the sale to Huawei of our ownership interest in the Huawei Symantec joint venture of $526 million. See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in this annual report in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, requires us to make estimates, including judgments and assumptions, that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly. Historically, our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results; however, actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions. If actual results differ from these estimates and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Statements of Income, and in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition. A critical accounting estimate is based on judgments and assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made. Different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in accounting estimates could materially impact the operating results or financial condition. We believe that the estimates described below represent our critical accounting estimates, as they have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report. 31 Table of Contents Revenue recognition We recognize revenue primarily pursuant to the requirements under the authoritative guidance on software revenue recognition, and any applicable amendments or modifications. Revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and require us to make many estimates. For software arrangements that include multiple elements, including perpetual software licenses and maintenance or services, packaged products with content updates, managed security services, and subscriptions, we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of the fair value of the undelivered elements, and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue. VSOE of each element is based on the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately. We determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our stand alone sales of these elements to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the undelivered elements. When VSOE does not exist for undelivered items, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. Our deferred revenue consists primarily of the unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance, consumer product content updates, managed security services, subscriptions, and arrangements where VSOE does not exist. Deferred revenue totaled approximately $4.0 billion as of March 30, 2012, of which $529 million was classified as Long term deferred revenue in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and increasing flexibility in contractual arrangements could materially impact the amount recognized in the current period and deferred over time. For arrangements that include both software and non software elements, we allocate revenue to the software deliverables as a group and non software deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows: (i) VSOE, (ii) third party evidence of selling price (TPE) and (iii) best estimate of the selling price (ESP). When we are unable to establish a selling price using VSOE or TPE, we use ESP to allocate the arrangement fees to the deliverables. For our consumer products that include content updates, we recognize revenue and the associated cost of revenue ratably over the term of the subscription upon sell through to end users, as the subscription period commences on the date of sale to the end user. We defer revenue and cost of revenue amounts for unsold product held by our distributors and resellers. We expect our distributors and resellers to maintain adequate inventory of consumer packaged products to meet future customer demand, which is generally four or six weeks of customer demand based on recent buying trends. We ship product to our distributors and resellers at their request and based on valid purchase orders. Our distributors and resellers base the quantity of orders on their estimates to meet future customer demand, which may exceed the expected level of a four or six week supply. We offer limited rights of return if the inventory held by our distributors and resellers is below the expected level of a four or six week supply. We estimate reserves for product returns as described below. We typically offer liberal rights of return if inventory held by our distributors and resellers exceeds the expected level. Because we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of excess inventory that will be returned, we primarily offset deferred revenue against trade accounts receivable for the amount of revenue in excess of the expected inventory levels. Arrangements for managed security services and SaaS offerings are generally offered to our customers over a specified period of time, and we recognize the related revenue ratably over the maintenance, subscription, or service period. Reserves for product returns. We reserve for estimated product returns as an offset to revenue based primarily on historical trends. We fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channels as an offset to deferred revenue. Actual product returns may be different than what was estimated. These factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make actual results differ from our return estimates. 32 Table of Contents Reserves for rebates. We estimate and record reserves for channel and end user rebates as an offset to revenue. For consumer products that include content updates, rebates are recorded as a ratable offset to revenue over the term of the subscription. Our estimated reserves for channel volume incentive rebates are based on distributors and resellers actual performance against the terms and conditions of volume incentive rebate programs, which are typically entered into quarterly. Our reserves for end user rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the promotional programs, actual sales during the promotion, the amount of actual redemptions received, historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program, and the value of the rebate. We also consider current market conditions and economic trends when estimating our reserves for rebates. If actual redemptions differ from our estimates, material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented. Valuation of goodwill, intangible assets and long lived assets Business combination valuations. When we acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to intangible assets. These estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies and historical experience. These estimates can include, but are not limited to: cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future; expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; the acquired companys brand and competitive position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined companys product portfolio; cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset; and discount rates. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates, and if such events occur we may be required to record a charge against the value ascribed to an acquired asset or an increase in the amounts recorded for assumed liabilities. Goodwill impairment. We review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on the first day of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, at the reporting unit level. Our reporting units are the same as our operating segments. Before performing the goodwill impairment test, we first assess the value of long lived assets in each reporting unit, including tangible and intangible assets. We then perform a two step impairment test on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the estimated fair value of equity of each reporting unit to its allocated carrying value (book value) of equity. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the equity associated with that unit, there is an indicator of impairment and we must perform the second step of the impairment test. This second step involves determining the implied fair value of that reporting units goodwill in a manner similar to the purchase price allocation for an acquired business, using the reporting units calculated fair value as an assumed purchase price. If the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the excess. The process of estimating the fair value and carrying value of our reporting units equity requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis. Many assets and liabilities, such as accounts receivable and property and equipment, are not specifically allocated to an individual reporting unit, and therefore, we apply 33 Table of Contents judgment to allocate the assets and liabilities, and this allocation affects the carrying value of the respective reporting units. Similarly, we use judgment to allocate goodwill to the reporting units based on relative fair values. The use of relative fair values has been necessary for certain reporting units due to changes in our operating structure in prior years. To determine a reporting units fair value, we use the income approach under which we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the estimated discounted future cash flows of that unit. We evaluate the reasonableness of this approach by comparing it with the market approach, which involves a review of the carrying value of our assets relative to our market capitalization and to the valuation of publicly traded companies operating in the same or similar lines of business. Applying the income approach requires that we make a number of important estimates and assumptions. We estimate the future cash flows of each reporting unit based on historical and forecasted revenue and operating costs. This, in turn, involves further estimates, such as estimates of future revenue and expense growth rates and foreign exchange rates. In addition, we apply a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows for the purpose of the valuation. This discount rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital for each reporting unit and may change from year to year. Changes in these key estimates and assumptions, or in other assumptions used in this process, could materially affect our impairment analysis for a given year. As of March 30, 2012, our goodwill balance was $5.8 billion. Based on the impairment analysis performed on December 31, 2011, we determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value of the unit by more than 10% of the carrying value. While discount rates are only one of several important estimates used in the analysis, we determined that an increase of one percentage point in the discount rate used for each respective reporting unit would not have resulted in an impairment indicator for any unit at the time of this analysis. In addition to the discount rate, the impairment test includes the consideration of a number of estimates, including growth rates, operating margins and cost forecasts, foreign exchange rates and the allocation of certain tangible assets to the reporting units. Based on the results of our impairment test, we do not believe that an impairment indicator exists as of our annual impairment test date. A number of factors, many of which we have no ability to control, could affect our financial condition, operating results and business prospects and could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed. These factors include: a prolonged global economic crisis; a significant decrease in the demand for our products; the inability to develop new and enhanced products and services in a timely manner; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; successful efforts by our competitors to gain market share in our markets; a loss of key personnel; our determination to dispose of one or more of our reporting units; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and recognition of a goodwill impairment loss. Intangible asset impairment. We assess the impairment of identifiable finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset groups carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of certain finite lived intangible assets, particularly customer relationships and finite lived tradenames, would be measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of the asset group to which the assets are assigned to the sum of the undiscounted estimated future cash flows the asset group is expected to 34 Table of Contents generate. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of such impairment would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value. Recoverability and impairment of other finite lived intangible assets, particularly developed technology and patents, would be measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the sum of undiscounted estimated future product revenues offset by estimated future costs to dispose of the product to which the asset relates. For indefinite lived intangible assets, we review impairment on an annual basis consistent with the timing of the annual evaluation for goodwill. These assets generally include tradenames, trademarks and in process research and development. Recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets would be measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the sum of the discounted estimated future cash flows the asset is expected to generate plus expected royalties. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of such impairment would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value. Our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted future revenue, operating costs, and other relevant factors. Assumptions and estimates about the remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are subjective and are affected by changes to our business strategies. If managements estimates of future operating results change, or if there are changes to other assumptions, the estimate of the fair value of our identifiable intangible assets could change significantly. Such change could result in impairment charges in future periods, which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition. Long lived assets (including assets held for sale). We assess long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the long lived assets may not be recoverable. Based on the existence of one or more indicators of impairment, we assess recoverability of long lived assets based on a projected undiscounted cash flow method using assumptions determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model. If an asset is not recoverable, impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and its fair value. Our estimates of cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many factors which could change and cause a material impact to our operating results or financial condition. We record impairment charges on long lived assets held for sale when we determine that the carrying value of the long lived assets may not be recoverable. In determining fair value, we obtain and consider market value appraisal information from third parties. Stock based compensation We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this guidance, stock based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense ratably on a straight line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. Determining the fair value of stock based awards, primarily stock options, at the grant date requires judgment. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected life of the options, actual and projected employee stock option exercise and cancellation behaviors, risk free interest rates, and expected dividends. We estimate the expected life of options granted based on an analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and post vesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the option. Expected volatility is based on the average of historical volatility for the period commensurate with the expected life of the option and the implied volatility of traded options. The risk free interest rate is equal to the U.S. Treasury constant maturity rates for the period equal to the expected life. We do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, our expected dividend yield is zero. 35 Table of Contents We issue performance based restricted stock units (PRU) representing hypothetical shares of our common stock. Each PRU grant reflects a target number of shares that may be issued to the award recipient. We determine the actual number of shares the recipient receives at the end of a three year performance period as follows: (1) our achievement of an annual target earnings per share for the first fiscal year of grant and (2) our two and three year cumulative relative total shareholder return ranked against that of other companies that are included in the Standard & Poors 500 Index. We estimate the fair value of PRUs using the Monte Carlo simulation model, as the total shareholder return (TSR) modifier contains a market condition. In accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock compensation, we record stock based compensation expense for awards that are expected to vest. As a result, judgment is required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited. Although we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience, actual forfeitures may differ. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted when we record an adjustment for the difference in the period that the awards vest or are forfeited. Contingencies and litigation We evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with the authoritative guidance on contingencies. We assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes from potential claims or legal proceedings, as well as potential ranges of probable losses, when the outcomes of the claims or proceedings are probable and reasonably estimable. A determination of the amount of accrued liabilities required, if any, for these contingencies is made after the analysis of each separate matter. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, we base our estimates on the information available at the time of our assessment. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Any revisions in the estimates of potential liabilities could have a material impact on our operating results and financial position. Income taxes We are required to compute our income taxes in each federal, state, and international jurisdiction in which we operate. This process requires that we estimate the current tax exposure as well as assess temporary differences between the accounting and tax treatment of assets and liabilities, including items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes. The income tax effects of the differences we identify are classified as current or long term deferred tax assets and liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our judgments, assumptions, and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Income. We account for uncertain tax positions pursuant to authoritative guidance based on a two step approach to recognize and measure those positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, the refinement of estimates, or the realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact our tax provision in our Consolidated Statements of Income in the period in which such determination is made. We must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income and, based on this assessment establish a valuation allowance, if required. The determination of our valuation 36 Table of Contents allowance involves assumptions, judgments, and estimates, including forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the valuation allowance in a period, we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease to our tax provision in our Consolidated Statements of Income. In July 2008, we reached an agreement with the IRS concerning our eligibility to claim a lower tax rate on a distribution made from a Veritas foreign subsidiary prior to the July 2005 acquisition. The distribution was intended to be made pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and therefore eligible for a 5.25% effective U.S. federal rate of tax, in lieu of the 35% statutory rate. The final impact of this agreement remains uncertain since this relates to the taxability of earnings that are otherwise the subject of the transfer pricing matters at issue in the IRS examination of Veritas tax years 2002 through 2005. To the extent that we owe taxes as a result of these transfer pricing matters in years prior to the distribution, we anticipate that the incremental tax due from this negotiated agreement will decrease. We currently estimate that the most probable outcome from this negotiated agreement will be that we will owe $13 million or less, for which an accrual has already been made.

Content, subscription, and maintenance revenue increased for fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, due to growth in revenue from our Security and Compliance segment of $139 million, Consumer segment of $70 million, and Storage and Server Management segment of $61 million, offset by a decrease in our Services segment of $52 million. License revenue includes revenue from software licenses, appliances, and certain revenue sharing arrangements. License revenue decreased for fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to decreases from our Storage and Server Management segment of $29 million and Security and Compliance segment of $12 million. License revenue decreased for fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to decreases in revenue from our Storage and Server Management segment of $41 million, partially offset by increases in revenues from the Security and Compliance segment of $17 million and from the Consumer segment of $13 million. 37 Table of Contents Net revenue and operating income by segment Consumer segment 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 Fiscal2012 $ % Fiscal2011 $ % Fiscal2010 ($ in millions) Consumer revenue $ 2,104 $ 151 8 % $ 1,953 $ 82 4 % $ 1,871 Percentage of total net revenue 31 % 32 % 31 % Consumer operating income $ 1,013 $ 114 13 % $ 899 $ 39 5 % $ 860 Percentage of Consumer revenue 48 % 46 % 46 % Consumer revenue increased for fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to continued growth in our premium internet and security products of $156 million, which included a favorable foreign currency exchange effect of $39 million. Of the total Consumer revenue recognized in fiscal 2012, 86% was generated from our electronic channel sales, which are derived from online sales (including new subscriptions, renewals and upgrades). Consumer revenue increased for fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to an increase in sales of our premium internet and security products of $91 million, which included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange effect of $10 million. Of the total Consumer revenue recognized in fiscal 2011, 84% was generated from our electronic channel sales, which are derived from online sales (including new subscriptions, renewals and upgrades). Consumer operating income increased for fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to higher revenue of $151 million and lower advertising and promotion expenses of $22 million, partially offset by increased salaries and wages of $41 million and higher cost of revenue of $17 million. The increased salaries and wages expense was due to higher headcount compared to fiscal 2011. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily associated with the increased product revenue. The increase in operating income included a favorable foreign currency exchange effect of $28 million. Consumer operating income increased for fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to increased revenue of $83 million, partially offset by increases in advertising and promotion expenses of $22 million, equipment costs of $11 million, and costs associated with the deployment of our new proprietary eCommerce platform. The increase in operating income included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange effect of $7 million.

The total increase included a favorable foreign currency exchange effect of $43 million. 38 Table of Contents Security and Compliance revenue increased for fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to increased sales of our information security products of $209 million, which included additional revenue of $124 million from our user authentication and trust products. The increase was partially offset by decreases in enterprise security products revenue by $68 million. The total increase included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange effect of $5 million. Security and Compliance operating income increased for fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to increased revenue of $327 million, partially offset by increased salaries and wages of $71 million and higher cost of revenue of $54 million. The increased salaries and wages expense was due to higher headcount compared to fiscal 2011. The higher cost of revenue was associated with revenue growth. The increase in operating income included a favorable foreign currency exchange effect of $23 million. Security and Compliance operating income decreased for fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to expenses related to our fiscal 2011 acquisitions and higher sales commissions associated with the increase in deferred revenue in fiscal 2011. Our operating margins were adversely impacted by our fiscal 2011 acquisitions, largely because we were required under the purchase accounting rules to reduce the amount of deferred revenue that we recorded in connection with these acquisitions to an amount equal to the fair value of our estimated cost to fulfill the contractual obligations related to that deferred revenue. This deferred revenue adjustment negatively affected our operating margins because we recognized a lower portion of the revenue from these acquisitions, but we incurred all of the revenue related expenses. The decrease in operating income included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange effect of $11 million.

Storage and Server Management revenue increased for fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to higher sales of our information management products of $94 million, partially offset by lower sales of our storage management products of $67 million. The total increase included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange effect of $33 million. Storage and Server Management operating income decreased for fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to higher salaries and wages of $139 million and higher cost of revenue of $59 million, partially offset by the increase in overall revenue. The increased salaries and wages expense was due to increased headcount over fiscal 2011, which was attributable to our Clearwell acquisition and growth in the business. The total decrease in operating income included a favorable foreign currency exchange effect of $48 million.

For fiscal 2011 as compared 2010, we had an unfavorable foreign currency exchange effect of $53 million. Our international revenue is and will continue to be a significant portion of our net revenue. As a result, net revenue will continue to be affected by foreign currency exchange rates as compared to the U.S. dollar.

Cost of content, subscription, and maintenance increased for fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to higher royalty and fee based technical support costs, which were partially offset by lower services costs. The increased royalty costs were mainly associated with increased revenue related to the authentication services and hosted services. The lower services cost in fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, was primarily due to our transitioning of our consulting services to specialized partners. Cost of content, subscription, and maintenance decreased for fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, due to lower fee based technical support and fulfillment costs. Cost of content, subscription, and maintenance as a percentage of related revenue remained consistent for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011, and for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. Cost of license consists primarily of royalties paid to third parties under technology licensing agreements, appliances manufacturing costs and other direct material costs. Cost of license increased for fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to increased costs associated with appliances manufacturing and royalties. Cost of license as a percentage of related revenue increased for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 due to relatively lower revenue in the Storage and Server Management segment as discussed above and higher associated costs for appliances manufacturing and royalties. Cost of license increased for fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, due to higher costs associated with appliances manufacturing. Cost of license as a percentage of related revenue remained consistent for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. Acquired intangible assets are comprised of developed technologies and patents from acquired companies. The decrease in amortization for fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, was primarily due to certain acquired intangible assets from our prior acquisitions becoming fully amortized, partially offset by additional amortization related to acquired intangibles from our Clearwell acquisition and a full year impact associated with the fiscal 2011 acquisitions of VeriSign, PGP, and GuardianEdge. The decrease in amortization for fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, was primarily due to certain acquired intangible assets from our Veritas acquisition becoming fully amortized during fiscal 2011, partially offset by additional amortization from acquired intangible assets from our fiscal 2011 acquisitions. 42 Table of Contents Operating expenses Our operating expenses increased for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 and for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to higher salary and wages and the adverse impact of the change in foreign currency exchange rates, offset by cost savings generated from our restructuring plans discussed below.

The increase from compensation expenses was mainly due to increased headcount to support the growth of our business. The total increase in sales and marketing expense also included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange effect of $52 million. Sales and marketing expense increased for fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to increased compensation expenses of $166 million and increases in advertising expenses of $54 million. The increase from compensation expenses was mainly due to increased headcount from our acquisitions in fiscal 2011. Research and development expense increased for fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to increased compensation expenses of $104 million. The increase from compensation expenses was mainly due to increased headcount to support our continued investment in product development and absorption of the Clearwell acquisition into our operations. The total increase in research and development expense included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange effect of $9 million. Research and development expense remained consistent for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. General and administrative expense increased for fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, due to higher compensation expense, external professional services and equipment of $45 million. General and administrative expense increased for fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to higher compensation expenses of $11 million and increased external professional services of $38 million. The increase from compensation expenses in fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, was mainly due to increased headcount from our fiscal 2011 acquisitions. Other intangible assets are comprised of customer relationships and tradenames. The increase in amortization of other intangible assets for fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, was primarily attributed to the acquisition of Clearwell. For fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010, the increase in amortization of other intangible assets was due to our fiscal 2011 acquisitions. Restructuring and transition costs consist of severance, facilities, transition and other related costs. For fiscal 2012, we recognized $29 million of severance, $8 million of facilities costs, and $19 million of transition and 43 Table of Contents other related costs. The transition charges incurred were primarily due to the planning and design phase of implementing a new enterprise resource planning system. For fiscal 2011, we recognized $47 million of severance, $27 million of facilities costs, and $18 million of transition and other related costs. For fiscal 2010, we recognized $56 million of severance, $10 million of facilities costs, and $28 million of transition and other related costs. For further information on restructuring and transition, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For fiscal 2012, we recorded an impairment of $4 million which reduced the gross carrying value of indefinite lived tradenames. During fiscal 2011, we recorded an impairment of $27 million which reduced the gross carrying value of indefinite lived tradenames. During fiscal 2010, we recognized impairments of $20 million on certain land and buildings classified as held for sale. The impairments were recorded in accordance with the authoritative guidance that requires a long lived asset classified as held for sale to be measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value, less cost to sell. Also, in fiscal 2010, we sold assets for $42 million which resulted in losses of $10 million.

In fiscal 2012, we had a gain of $526 million from the sale of our joint venture interest described below, and also had lower interest expense from our repayment of the $1.1 billion convertible senior notes that we issued in fiscal 2007. In the second quarter of fiscal 2011 and the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we made payments of $500 million and $600 million, respectively, to retire the notes. In fiscal 2011, we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $16 million due to the repurchase of $500 million of aggregate principal amount of the 0.75% Notes due on June 15, 2011. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our debt. Non operating expense increased for fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, due in part to the interest expense on the Senior Notes of $1.1 billion issued in the second quarter of fiscal 2011. For fiscal 2011, other (expense) income, net included a $21 million loss from the liquidation of certain foreign legal entities, partially offset by a realized gain on the sale of marketable securities, compared to fiscal 2010 in which we recorded a $47 million gain from the liquidation of certain foreign legal entities. On February 5, 2008, Symantec formed Huawei Symantec, Inc. (joint venture) with a subsidiary of Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. (Huawei). The joint venture was domiciled in Hong Kong with principal operations in Chengdu, China. The joint venture developed, manufactured, marketed, and supported security and storage appliances on behalf of global telecommunications carriers and enterprise customers. As discussed in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we sold our 49% ownership interest in the joint venture to Huawei on March 30, 2012 for $526 million, net. 44 Table of Contents Provision for income taxes Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 ($ in millions) Provision for income taxes $ 298 $ 105 $ 112 Effective tax rate on earnings 20 % 15 % 14 % Our effective tax rate was approximately 20%, 15%, and 14% in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. The tax expense in fiscal 2012 was reduced by the following benefits: (1) $52 million tax benefit arising from the Veritas 2002 through 2005 IRS Appeals matters, (2) $14 million from lapses of statutes of limitation, (3) $17 million from settlements and effective settlements with tax authorities and related remeasurements, and (4) $5 million tax benefit from adjustments related to prior year items. This benefit was partially offset by a $5 million tax expense resulting from a change in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets. The tax expense in fiscal 2011 was reduced by the following benefits: (1) $49 million arising from the Veritas v Commissioner Tax Court decision further discussed below, (2) $15 million from the reduction of our valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets, and (3) $21 million tax benefit from lapses of statutes of limitation, and (4) $7 million tax benefit from the conclusion of U.S. and foreign audits. The tax expense in fiscal 2010 was significantly reduced by the following benefits: (1) $79 million tax benefit arising from the Veritas v. Commissioner Tax Court decision, (2) $11 million tax benefit from the reduction of our valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets, (3) $17 million tax benefit from lapses of statutes of limitation, (4) $9 million tax benefit from the conclusion of U.S. and foreign audits, (5) $7 million tax benefit to adjust taxes provided in prior periods, and (6) $6 million tax benefit from current year discrete events. The change in the valuation allowance follows discussions with Irish Revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2010, the result of which accelerates the timing of the use of certain Irish tax loss carryforwards in the future. The effective tax rates for all periods presented otherwise reflects the benefits of lower taxed international earnings and losses from our joint venture with Huawei Technologies Co., Limited, domestic manufacturing incentives, and research and development credits (the U.S. federal R&D tax credit expired on December 31, 2011), partially offset by state income taxes. Pretax income from international operations increased significantly due to the sale of our 49% ownership interest in the joint venture to Huawei on March 30, 2012 for $526 million. A significant portion of the sale proceeds was attributable to international tax jurisdictions resulting in a 20% tax rate on the sale of the joint venture reducing the overall tax rate by 3%. We are a U.S. based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and international tax jurisdictions. Substantially all of our international earnings were generated by subsidiaries in Ireland and Singapore. Our results of operations would be adversely affected to the extent that our geographical mix of income becomes more weighted toward jurisdictions with higher tax rates and would be favorably affected to the extent the relative geographic mix shifts to lower tax jurisdictions. Any change in our mix of earnings is dependent upon many factors and is therefore difficult to predict. For further information on the impact of foreign earnings on our effective tax rate, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. See Critical Accounting Estimates above for additional information about our provision for income taxes. In assessing the ability to realize our deferred tax assets, we considered whether it was more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We considered the following: we have historical cumulative book income, as measured by the current and prior two years, we have strong, consistent taxpaying history, we have substantial U.S. federal income tax carryback potential; and we have substantial amounts of scheduled future reversals of taxable temporary differences from our deferred tax liabilities. Levels of future taxable income are subject to the various risks and uncertainties discussed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, 45 Table of Contents set forth in this annual report. We have concluded that this positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence and, thus, that the deferred tax assets as of March 30, 2012 of $528 million, after application of the valuation allowances described above, are realizable on a more likely than not basis. On December 10, 2009, the U.S. Tax Court issued its opinion in Veritas v. Commissioner, finding that our transfer pricing methodology, with appropriate adjustments, was the best method for assessing the value of the transaction at issue between Veritas and its international subsidiary in the 2000 to 2001 tax years. In June 2010, we reached an agreement with the IRS concerning the amount of the adjustment based on the U.S. Tax Court decision. As a result of the agreement, we reduced our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, resulting in a $39 million tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. In March 2011, we reached agreement with Irish Revenue concerning compensating adjustments arising from this matter, resulting in an additional $10 million tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. This matter has now been closed and no further adjustments to the accrued liability are expected. On December 2, 2009, we received a Revenue Agents Report from the IRS for the Veritas 2002 through 2005 tax years assessing additional taxes due. We have contested $80 million of the tax assessed and all penalties. As a result of negotiations with IRS Appeals in the three months ended December 30, 2011, we have remeasured our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, resulting in a tax benefit of $52 million. The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year. Although potential resolution of uncertain tax positions involve multiple tax periods and jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that a reduction of up to $21 million of the reserves for unrecognized tax benefits may occur within the next 12 months, some of which, depending on the nature of the settlement or expiration of statutes of limitations, may affect our income tax provision and therefore benefit the resulting effective tax rate. The actual amount could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlements. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing tax controversies and the impact, if any, of the expected tolling of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions. Loss attributable to noncontrolling interest In fiscal 2011, we completed the acquisition of the identity and authentication business of VeriSign, Inc. (VeriSign), including a controlling interest in its subsidiary VeriSign Japan K.K. (VeriSign Japan), a publicly traded company on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Given our majority ownership interest of approximately 54% in VeriSign Japan, the accounts of VeriSign Japan have been consolidated with our accounts, and a noncontrolling interest has been recorded for the noncontrolling investors interests in the equity and operations of VeriSign Japan. For fiscal 2012 and 2011, the loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest in VeriSign Japan was approximately $0 million and $4 million, respectively. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Sources of cash We have historically relied on cash flow from operations, borrowings under a credit facility, and issuances of debt and equity securities for our liquidity needs. As of March 30, 2012, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.2 billion. Senior notes: In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we issued $350 million in principal amount of 2.75% notes due September 15, 2015 and $750 million in principal amount of 4.20% notes due September 15, 2020, for an aggregate principal amount of $1.1 billion. 46 Table of Contents Revolving credit facility: In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we also entered into a $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in December 2014. Under the terms of this credit facility, we must comply with certain financial and non financial covenants, including a covenant to maintain a specified ratio of debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). As of March 30, 2012, we were in compliance with all required covenants, and there was no outstanding balance on the credit facility. We believe that our existing cash and investment balances, our borrowing capacity, our ability to issue new debt instruments, and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures requirements for at least the next 12 months. Uses of cash Our principal cash requirements include working capital, capital expenditures, taxes, and payments of principal and interest on our debt. In addition, we regularly evaluate our ability to repurchase stock and acquire other businesses. Acquisitions: In fiscal 2012, we acquired Clearwell, LiveOffice and another company for an aggregate amount of $508 million, net of cash acquired. In fiscal 2011, we acquired the identity and authentication business of VeriSign, as well as PGP, GuardianEdge and two other companies for an aggregate amount of $1.5 billion, net of cash acquired. In fiscal 2010, we acquired two companies for an aggregate amount of $31 million, net of cash acquired. Convertible senior notes: In June 2006, we issued $1.1 billion principal amount of 0.75% Notes due June 15, 2011, and $1.0 billion principal amount of 1.00% Notes due June 15, 2013, to initial purchasers in a private offering for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC Rule 144A. In fiscal 2011, we repurchased $500 million of aggregate principal amount of our 0.75% Notes in privately negotiated transactions for approximately $510 million. Concurrently with the repurchase, we sold a proportionate share of the note hedges that we entered into at the time of the issuance of the convertible notes back to the note hedge counterparties for approximately $13 million. The net cost of the repurchase of the 0.75% Notes and the concurrent sale of the note hedges was $497 million in cash. We repaid the $600 million balance under our 0.75% Notes upon maturity in fiscal 2012. Stock repurchases: We repurchased 51 million, 57 million, and 34 million shares for $893 million, $872 million, and $553 million during fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. As of March 30, 2012, we had $984 million remaining under the plan authorized for future repurchases. U.S. tax: As of March 30, 2012, $2.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries. We have provided U.S. deferred taxes on a portion of our undistributed foreign earnings sufficient to address the incremental U.S. tax that would be due if we needed these funds to support our operations in the U.S. Cash Flows The following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, selected items in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 (In millions) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,901 $ 1,794 $ 1,693 Investing activities (318 ) (1,760 ) (65 ) Financing activities (1,386 ) (184 ) (441 ) 47 Table of Contents Operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.9 billion for fiscal 2012, which resulted from net income of $1.2 billion adjusted for non cash items, which largely included depreciation and amortization charges of $712 million, stock based compensation expense of $164 million, an increase in deferred revenue of $177 million, an increase in trade accounts receivable, net of $89 million, and an increase in account payable and accrued liabilities of $77 million. Additionally, net income was adjusted for the net gain from the sale of the joint venture of $526 million, as the gross proceeds were included as a cash inflow provided by investing activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.8 billion for fiscal 2011, which resulted from net income of $593 million adjusted for non cash items, including depreciation and amortization charges of $743 million and stock based compensation expense of $145 million, and an increase in deferred revenue of $442 million. These amounts were partially offset by a decrease in income taxes payable of $128 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion for fiscal 2010, which resulted from net income of $714 million adjusted for non cash items, including depreciation and amortization charges of $837 million and stock based compensation expense of $155 million. These amounts were partially offset by a decrease in income taxes payable of $95 million primarily related to the outcome of the Veritas v. Commissioner Tax Court decision; see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Investing activities Net cash used in investing activities was $318 million for fiscal 2012, which was used to pay for fiscal 2012 acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $508 million, payments of $286 million for capital expenditures, and $47 million in purchases of held to maturity securities, partially offset by the gross proceeds from the sale of the joint venture of $530 million. Net cash used in investing activities of $1.8 billion for fiscal 2011 was due to $1.5 billion of payments for our fiscal 2011 acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and $268 million paid for capital expenditures. Net cash used in investing activities was $65 million for fiscal 2010 and was primarily due to payments of $248 million for capital expenditures, partially offset by $190 million in net proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities. Financing activities Net cash used in financing activities was $1.4 billion for fiscal 2012, which was due to the repurchases of our common stock of $893 million and repayment of our outstanding balance of $600 million under the 0.75% Notes, partially offset by net proceeds from sales of common stock through employee stock plans of $147 million. Net cash used in financing activities of $184 million for fiscal 2011 was primarily due to repurchases of common stock of $872 million and repurchases of long term debt of $510 million, partially offset by proceeds from debt issuance, net of discount, of $1.1 billion and net proceeds from sales of common stock through employee stock plans of $122 million. Net cash used in financing activities of $441 million for fiscal 2010 were due to repurchases of common stock of $553 million, partially offset by net proceeds from sales of common stock through employee stock plans of $124 million. 48 Table of Contents Contractual obligations The following is a schedule by years of our significant contractual obligations as of March 30, 2012: Payments Due by Period Total Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2014and 2015 Fiscal 2016and 2017 Fiscal 2018and Thereafter Other (In millions) Senior Notes(1) $ 1,100 $ $ $ 350 $ 750 $ Interest payments on Senior Notes(1) 300 41 82 67 110 Convertible Senior Notes(2) 1,000 1,000 Interest payments on Convertible Senior Notes(2) 12 10 2 Purchase obligations(3) 473 420 51 2 Operating leases(4) 457 99 149 84 125 Uncertain tax positions(5) 393 393 Total $ 3,735 $ 570 $ 1,284 $ 503 $ 985 $ 393 (1) In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we issued $350 million in principal amount of 2.75% notes due September 15, 2015 and $750 million in principal amount of 4.20% notes due September 15, 2020. Interest payments were calculated based on terms of the related notes. For further information on the notes, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The table above also includes agreements to purchase goods or services that have cancellation provisions requiring little or no payment. The amounts under such contracts are included in the table above because management believes that cancellation of these contracts is unlikely and we expect to make future cash payments according to the contract terms or in similar amounts for similar materials. (4) We have entered into various noncancelable operating lease agreements that expire on various dates beyond fiscal 2018. The amounts in the table above include $24 million in exited or excess facility costs related to restructuring activities, excluding expected sublease income. (5) As of March 30, 2012, we reflected $393 million in long term taxes payable related to uncertain tax positions. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond the next twelve months due to uncertainties in the timing of the commencement and settlement of potential tax audits and controversies. Indemnifications As permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at our request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is not limited; however, we have directors and officers insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and may enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal. We provide limited product warranties and the majority of our software license agreements contain provisions that indemnify licensees of our software from damages and costs resulting from claims alleging that 49 Table of Contents our software infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party. Historically, payments made under these provisions have been immaterial. We monitor the conditions that are subject to indemnification to identify if a loss has occurred. Recently issued and adopted authoritative guidance In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standards update that provided guidance on achieving a consistent definition of and common requirements for measurement and disclosure of fair values in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The guidance expanded disclosures relating to fair value measurements that are estimated using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs. The guidance also required categorization by level of the fair value hierarchy for items that are not measured at fair value but for which fair value is required to be disclosed. We adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In June 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of stockholders equity and requires that all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In December 2011, the FASB issued another accounting standards update that defers the requirement to present reclassification adjustments for each component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) in both Other comprehensive income and Net income on the face of the financial statements. The amended guidance will be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, on a retrospective basis, and will result only in changes in our financial statement presentation. In September 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test. This new guidance will be adopted by us in fiscal 2013 on a prospective basis, and will be applied in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 at the time we perform our annual goodwill test. We do not expect that this guidance will materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that will require us to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements associated with certain financial and derivative instruments to enable users of our financial statements to better understand the effect of those arrangements on our financial position. The new guidance will be applicable to us on a retrospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. We do not expect that this guidance will materially impact our disclosures included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to various market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity prices. We may use derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain risks in accordance with our investment and foreign exchange policies. We do not use derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Interest rate risk As of March 30, 2012, we had $1.1 billion in principal amount of fixed rate Senior Notes outstanding, with a carrying amount of $1.1 billion and a fair value of $1.13 billion, which fair value is based on Level 2 inputs of market prices for similar convertible debt instruments and resulting yields. On March 30, 2012, a hypothetical 50 bps increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixed rate debt by a decrease 50 Table of Contents of approximately $22 million and an increase of approximately $45 million, respectively. However, this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixed rate debt. Foreign currency exchange rate risk We conduct business in 38 currencies through our worldwide operations and, as such, we are exposed to foreign currency risk. Foreign currency risks are associated with our cash and cash equivalents, investments, receivables, and payables denominated in foreign currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates will result in foreign exchange gains and losses on these foreign currency assets and liabilities and are included in Other (expense) income, net. Our objective in managing foreign exchange activity is to preserve stockholder value by minimizing the risk of foreign currency exchange rate changes. Our strategy is to primarily utilize forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures. Under our program, gains and losses in our foreign currency exposures are offset by losses and gains on our forward contracts. Our forward contracts generally have terms of one to six months. At the end of the reporting period, open contracts are marked to market with unrealized gains and losses included in Other (expense) income, net. The following table presents a sensitivity analysis on our foreign forward exchange contract portfolio using a statistical model to estimate the potential gain or loss in fair value that could arise from hypothetical appreciation or depreciation of foreign currency: Value ofContractsGiven X%Appreciation ofForeignCurrency NotionalAmount Value ofContractsGiven X%Depreciation ofForeignCurrency Foreign Forward Exchange Contracts 10% 5% (5)% (10)% (In millions) Purchased, March 30, 2012 $ 353 $ 339 $ 323 $ 306 $ 287 Sold, March 30, 2012 $ 267 $ 280 $ 294 $ 309 $ 327 Purchased, April 1, 2011 $ 217 $ 208 $ 199 $ 188 $ 177 Sold, April 1, 2011 $ 271 $ 283 $ 298 $ 313 $ 331 Equity price risk In June 2006, we issued $1.1 billion in principal amount of 0.75% notes and $1.0 billion in principal amount of 1.00% notes. We received proceeds of $2.1 billion from the 0.75% notes and 1.00% notes and incurred net transaction costs of approximately $33 million, of which $9 million was allocated to equity and the remainder allocated proportionately to the 0.75% notes and 1.00% notes. The 0.75% notes and 1.00% notes were each issued at par and bear interest at 0.75% and 1.00% per annum, respectively. Interest is payable semiannually in arrears on June 15 and December 15. Concurrent with the issuance of the 0.75% notes and 1.00% notes, the Company entered into note hedge transactions with affiliates of certain initial purchasers whereby the Company has the option to purchase up to 110 million shares of Symantec common stock at a price of $19.12 per share. The cost of the note hedge transactions was approximately $592 million. In September 2010, we repurchased $500 million of aggregate principal amount of our 0.75% convertible senior notes in privately negotiated transactions for approximately $510 million. Concurrently with the repurchase, we sold a proportionate share of the note hedges that we entered into at the time of the issuance of the convertible senior notes back to the note hedge counterparties for approximately $13 million. The net cost of the repurchase and the concurrent sale of the note hedges was $497 million in cash. On June 15, 2011, we repaid the remaining principal balance of $600 million under our 0.75% convertible senior notes upon maturity. Concurrent with the maturity, the remaining related note hedges and warrants expired. No portion of these hedges and warrants was converted into our common shares upon maturity. 51 Table of Contents The convertible senior notes have a fixed annual interest rate and therefore, we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the convertible senior notes. However, the values of the convertible senior notes are exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of our fixed interest rate convertible senior notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair values of our convertible senior notes are affected by our stock price. The carrying value of the 1.00% notes was $941 million as of March 30, 2012 which represents the liability component of the $1.0 billion principal balance. The total estimated fair value of our 1.00% notes at March 30, 2012 was $1.1 billion and the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the 1.00% notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, which was $111.50. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For business and strategic purposes, we also hold equity interests in several privately held companies, many of which can be considered to be in the start up or development stages. These investments are inherently risky and we could lose a substantial part or our entire investment in these companies. These investments are recorded at cost and classified as Other long term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of March 30, 2012, we held equity investments in privately held companies of $40 million.
