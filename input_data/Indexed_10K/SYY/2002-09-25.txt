ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES SYSCO provides marketing and distribution services to foodservice customers throughout the United States and Canada. The company intends to continue to expand its market share through profitable sales growth, foldouts, acquisitions, and constant emphasis on the development of its consolidated buying programs. The company also strives to increase the effectiveness of its marketing associates and the productivity of its warehousing and distribution activities. These objectives require continuing investment. SYSCOs resources include cash provided by operations and access to capital from financial markets. SYSCOs operations historically have produced significant cash flow. Cash generated from operations is first allocated to working capital requirements; investments in facilities, fleet and other equipment required to meet customers needs; cash dividends; and acquisitions fitting within the companys overall growth strategy. Any remaining cash generated from operations may, at the discretion of management, be applied toward a portion of the cost of the share repurchase program, while the remainder of the cost may be financed with additional long term debt. SYSCOs share repurchase program is used primarily to offset shares issued under various employee benefit and compensation plans, for acquisitions and to reduce shares outstanding, all of which may have the net effect of increasing earnings per share. Management targets a long term debt to total capitalization ratio between 35% to 40%. The ratio may exceed the target range from time to time due to borrowings incurred in order to fund acquisitions and internal growth opportunities and due to fluctuations in the timing and amount of share repurchases. The ratio may also fall below the target range due to strong cash flow from operations and fluctuations in the timing and amount of share repurchases. This ratio was 35.6% and 31.4% at June 29, 2002 and June 30, 2001, respectively. The company generated net cash from operations of $1,084,980,000 in fiscal 2002, $955,224,000 in fiscal 2001 and $708,726,000 in fiscal 2000. The overall increases in operating results contributed to the annual increases in cash flows from operations. In addition, during the second quarter of fiscal 2002, the company began reorganizing its supply chain to maximize consolidated efficiencies and increase the effectiveness of the merchandising and procurement functions performed for the benefit of our customers. The new structure resulted in the deferral of certain federal and state income tax payments which amounted to $266,673,000 for fiscal 2002 and was reflected in the increase in the deferred tax provision. The company expects the positive cash flow effect of the deferral in fiscal 2003 to increase from fiscal 2002 levels. The company expects the cash flow impact of deferrals in fiscal 2004 and beyond to be less than fiscal 2003 levels, as it expects to begin making payments related to these deferrals in fiscal 2004. The company expects the cash flow impact of deferrals in fiscal 2004 and beyond to be incrementally positive when compared to what would have been paid on an annual basis without the deferral. In addition, a federal tax payment of $75,000,000 normally due in the fourth quarter of 2001 was deferred until the first quarter of 2002 as allowed by the Internal Revenue Service due to the Texas tropical storm Allison disaster and is reflected in the decrease of accrued income taxes in fiscal 2002. Cash used for investing activities was $630,300,000 in fiscal 2002, $338,751,000 in fiscal 2001 and $459,392,000 in fiscal 2000. Expenditures for facilities, fleet and other equipment were $416,393,000 in fiscal 2002, $341,138,000 in fiscal 2001 and $266,413,000 in fiscal 2000. The increase in fiscal 2002 over prior years is primarily due to the construction and completion of new fold out facilities located in Sacramento, California and Columbia, South Carolina and the ongoing construction of the fold out facility in Las Vegas, Nevada. Fiscal 2002 expenditures also included costs incurred on the construction or expansion of facilities in Lewisville, Texas; Norman, Oklahoma; Baraboo, Wisconsin and Jersey City, New Jersey. Total expenditures in fiscal 2003 are expected to increase to the range of $450,000,000 to $500,000,000 due to the continuation of the fold out program; facility, fleet and other equipment replacements and expansions; and the companys supply chain initiatives. Expenditures for acquisitions of businesses were $234,618,000 in fiscal 2002, $10,363,000 in fiscal 2001, and $211,901,000 in fiscal 2000. In February 2000, the company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement covering 5,700,000 shares of common stock to be offered from time to time in connection with 9 acquisitions. This registration statement was amended in January 2001 to include an additional 1,100,000 shares. No additional shares may be issued under this registration statement. In November 2000, the company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement covering 30,000,000 shares of common stock to be offered from time to time in connection with acquisitions. As of June 29, 2002, 29,477,835 shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement. Cash used for financing activities was $359,984,000 in fiscal 2002, $639,858,000 in fiscal 2001 and $239,509,000 in fiscal 2000. In September 2001, the Board authorized the repurchase of an additional 16,000,000 shares. Under this authorization, 5,563,200 shares remained available for repurchase at June 29, 2002. In July 2002, the Board authorized the repurchase of an additional 20,000,000 shares. The number of shares acquired and their cost for the past three years were 18,000,000 shares for $473,558,000 in fiscal 2002, 16,000,000 shares for $428,196,000 in fiscal 2001 and 11,320,800 shares for $186,296,000 in fiscal 2000. Dividends paid were $213,275,000 in fiscal 2002, $173,701,000 in fiscal 2001 and $145,418,000 in fiscal 2000. SYSCO began paying the current quarterly dividend rate of $0.09 per share in January 2002, an increase from the $0.07 per share that became effective in February 2001. In April 2002, SYSCO issued $200,000,000 principal amount of 4.75% notes due July 30, 2005 under a shelf registration statement filed in June 1998. These notes, which were priced at 99.8% of par, are unsecured and are not subject to any sinking fund requirement. They include a redemption provision which allows SYSCO to retire the notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued interest or an amount designed to insure that the note holders are not penalized by early redemption. Proceeds from the notes were used to pay down borrowings under the companys commercial paper program. As of August 24, 2002, there was $425,000,000 in principal amount outstanding under the previously filed registration statement, leaving $75,000,000 available for issuance. Concurrent with the issuance of these notes, SYSCO entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $200,000,000 whereby SYSCO receives a fixed rate equal to 4.75% per anum and pays a benchmark interest rate of six month LIBOR in arrears less 84.5 basis points. In May 2002, SYSCO International, Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of SYSCO, issued $200,000,000 principal amount of 6.10% notes due June 1, 2012 in a private offering. These notes, which were priced at 99.7% of par, are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by SYSCO Corporation and are not subject to any sinking fund requirement. They include registration rights and a redemption provision which allows SYSCO International, Co. to retire the notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued interest or an amount designed to insure that the note holders are not penalized by the early redemption. SYSCO International, Co. and SYSCO have filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission covering an identical series of notes to be issued in exchange for the unregistered notes outstanding. The proceeds from the 6.10% notes were utilized to repay commercial paper borrowings issued by SYSCO International, Co. to fund the acquisition of a Canadian broadline foodservice business. SYSCO has uncommitted bank lines of credit, which provide for unsecured borrowings for working capital up to $125,000,000, of which none was outstanding at June 29, 2002 and $30,640,000 was outstanding at June 30, 2001. SYSCO has a commercial paper program in the United States which was supported by a bank credit facility in the amount of $300,000,000 as of June 29, 2002 maturing in fiscal 2004. In September, the company entered into a new revolving loan agreement in the amount of $450,000,000 maturing in fiscal 2008. SYSCO also has a commercial paper program in Canada which is supported by a bank credit facility in the amount of $100,000,000 in Canadian dollars maturing in fiscal 2003. During fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, commercial paper and short term bank borrowings ranged from approximately $51,472,000 to $538,362,000, $157,631,000 to $411,790,000, and $199,028,000 to $469,094,000, respectively. Commercial paper borrowings were $63,293,000 as of June 29, 2002 and $54,040,000 as of August 24, 2002. The company intends to settle outstanding commercial paper borrowings when they come due by issuing additional commercial paper or retiring them utilizing cash generated from operations. 10 The net cash provided by operations less cash utilized for capital expenditures, the stock repurchase program, cash dividends and other uses resulted in net long term debt of $1,176,307,000 at June 29, 2002. After adjusting for the interest rate swap, approximately 82% of the long term debt is at fixed rates averaging 6.61% and the remainder is at floating rates averaging 1.3%. SYSCO continues to have borrowing capacity available and alternative financing arrangements are evaluated as appropriate. In summary, SYSCO believes that through continual monitoring and management of assets together with the availability of additional capital in the financial markets, it will meet its cash requirements while maintaining proper liquidity for normal operating purposes. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS The following table sets forth certain information concerning SYSCOs obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, such as debt and lease agreements, and under contingent commitments.

The annual sales increases were attributable to a variety of factors, including the progress of our Customers Are Really Everything to SYSCO (C.A.R.E.S.) customer relationship initiatives, a persistent focus on increasing sales to marketing associate served customers, the continuing recognition by customers of the quality and value of SYSCO Brand products, the overall growth in the foodservice industry and acquisitions. After adjusting for food cost increases and acquisitions, real sales growth was approximately 2.7% in 2002. Acquisitions represented 3.4% of sales increases for fiscal 2002 and food cost inflation was 1.1%. After adjusting for food cost increases and acquisitions, real sales growth was approximately 5.8% in fiscal 2001. Acquisitions represented 4.5% of total sales in fiscal 2001 and food cost inflation was approximately 2.5%. After adjusting for food cost increases, acquisitions and adjusting for the extra week in fiscal 1999, real sales growth was approximately 9% in fiscal 2000. Acquisitions represented 3.5% of sales increases in fiscal 2000 and food cost inflation was approximately 0.4% for fiscal 2000. The lower sales growth in 2002 was attributable to the overall softness in the economy and comparisons to sales increases in fiscal 2001 which were among the highest in SYSCOs history. The quarterly real sales growth trends experienced by the company were 1.7%, 0.7%, 2.7% and 5.2% for the first, second, third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, respectively, over comparable quarters in fiscal 2001. Industry sources estimate the total foodservice market experienced real growth of approximately 0.5% in calendar year 2001 and 2.9% in calendar year 2000. 11 Sales for fiscal 2000 through 2002 were as follows: FISCAL YEAR SALES % INCREASE 2002.............................................. $23,350,504,000 7.2% 2001.............................................. 21,784,497,000 12.8 2000.............................................. 19,303,268,000 10.8 A comparison of the sales mix in the principal product categories during the last three years is presented below: 2002 2001 2000 Canned and dry products..................................... 19% 19% 21% Fresh and frozen meats...................................... 18 18 17 Frozen fruits, vegetables, bakery and other................. 13 13 14 Poultry..................................................... 10 10 10 Dairy products.............................................. 9 9 9 Fresh produce............................................... 9 9 7 Paper and disposables....................................... 8 8 8 Seafoods.................................................... 6 6 6 Beverage products........................................... 3 3 3 Janitorial products......................................... 2 2 2 Equipment and smallwares.................................... 2 2 2 Medical supplies............................................ 1 1 1 100% 100% 100% A comparison of sales by type of customer during the last three years is presented below: 2002 2001 2000 Restaurants................................................. 63% 64% 65% Hospitals and nursing homes................................. 10 11 10 Schools and colleges........................................ 6 6 6 Hotels and motels........................................... 6 5 5 All other................................................... 15 14 14 100% 100% 100% COST OF SALES Cost of sales increased approximately 6.9% in fiscal 2002, 11.9% in fiscal 2001 and 10.1% in fiscal 2000. The rate of increases were less than the rate of sales increases leading to improved gross margins. The rate of increase is influenced by SYSCOs overall customer and product mix, economies realized in purchasing and higher sales of SYSCO Brand products. OPERATING EXPENSES Operating expenses include the costs of warehousing and delivering products as well as selling and administrative expenses. These expenses as a percent of sales were 14.8% for fiscal 2002 and 2001 and 14.7% for fiscal 2000. Changes in the percentage relationship of operating expenses to sales result from an interplay of several economic influences, including customer mix. Inflationary increases in operating costs generally have been offset through improved productivity. Operating expenses in fiscal 2002 were negatively impacted by increased costs realized during the initial operating periods of fold outs in Sacramento, California; Columbia, South Carolina and Las Vegas, Nevada. 12 In addition, the increase in marketing associate served sales is accompanied by higher expenses to serve these customers. In fiscal 2000, expenses were incurred in connection with the closing of a facility and one time non recurring costs associated with the completion of the SYSCO Uniform Systems implementation. The sum of the costs related to fiscal 2000 were approximately $13,000,000. INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense for the year decreased $8,879,000 or approximately 12.4% below fiscal 2001, which had increased $944,000 or approximately 1.3% over fiscal 2000. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2002 was primarily due to decreases in interest rates for short term and commercial paper borrowings. Interest expense in fiscal 2000 included interest income in the amount of $3,000,000 related to a Federal income tax refund on an amended return. After adjusting for the refund, interest expense in the fiscal 2001 period decreased $2,056,000 or approximately 2.8%. This decrease was due primarily to decreased borrowings. Interest capitalized during construction periods for the past three years was $3,746,000 in fiscal 2002, $2,995,000 in fiscal 2001 and $964,000 in fiscal 2000. OTHER, NET Other, net was $2,805,000 income in fiscal 2002, an increase of $2,906,000 from the $101,000 expense in fiscal 2001. Fiscal 2001s expense of $101,000 decreased $1,421,000 from the $1,522,000 expense in fiscal 2000. Changes between the years result from fluctuations in miscellaneous activities, primarily gains and losses on the sale of surplus facilities. EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES Earnings before income taxes rose $134,215,000, or approximately 13.9% above fiscal 2001 which had increased $229,047,000, or approximately 31.1%, over fiscal 2000. Fiscal 2000 increased $143,721,000, or approximately 24.2% over fiscal 1999. Additional sales and realization of operating efficiencies contributed to the increases as well as the companys success in its continued efforts to increase sales to the companys higher margin territorial street customers and increasingly higher sales of SYSCO Brand products, both of which generally yield higher margins. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES The effective tax rate was 38.25% in fiscal 2002 and 2001 and 38.5% in fiscal 2000. EARNINGS BEFORE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE Fiscal 2002 represents the twenty sixth consecutive year of increased earnings before the cumulative effect of an accounting change. Earnings before cumulative effect of an accounting change rose $82,878,000 or approximately 13.9% above fiscal 2001, which had increased $143,280,000 or approximately 31.6% over fiscal 2000. Fiscal 2000 increased $91,358,000 or approximately 25.2% over fiscal 1999. The increases were caused by additional sales, operating efficiencies and other factors discussed above. CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE In the first quarter of fiscal 2000, SYSCO recorded a one time, after tax, non cash charge of $8,041,000 to comply with the required adoption of AICPA Statement of Position 98 5 (SOP 98 5), "Reporting on the Costs of Start up Activities." SOP 98 5 required the writeoff of any unamortized costs of start up activities and organization costs. NET EARNINGS Net earnings for the year increased $82,878,000 or approximately 13.9% above fiscal 2001, which had increased $151,321,000 or approximately 34.0% over fiscal 2000. Fiscal 2000 increased $83,317,000 or approximately 23.0% over fiscal 1999. 13 RETURN ON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY The return on average shareholders equity was approximately 31% in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 and 30% in fiscal 2000. Since its inception SYSCO has averaged in excess of an 18% return on shareholders equity before the cumulative effect of accounting changes. BROADLINE SEGMENT Broadline segment sales increased by 5.8% in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 and by 8.8% in fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000. The fiscal 2002 and 2001 sales growth was due primarily to increased sales to marketing associate served customers as well as increased sales of SYSCO Brand products. Broadline segment sales as a percentage of total SYSCO sales decreased from 83.1% in fiscal 2001 to 82.1% in fiscal 2002 and from 86.2% in fiscal 2000 to 83.1% in fiscal 2001. The decreases in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 were due primarily to acquisitions of specialty meat, lodging industry product and produce companies in the Other segments and greater percentage growth of specialty meat, lodging industry companies and SYGMA segment as a percentage of overall SYSCO sales. Earnings before income taxes from the Broadline segment increased by 12.4% in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 and by 25.6% in fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000. The increases in earnings before income taxes for fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 were driven by increased sales to marketing associate served customers as well as increases in sales of SYSCO Brand products, both of which generally yield higher margins. Completion of the installation of SYSCO Uniform Systems in the second quarter of fiscal 2000 also impacted pretax earnings with increased efficiencies and productivity. SYGMA SEGMENT SYGMA segment sales increased by 10.6% in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 and 12.2% in fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000. The fiscal 2002 and 2001 sales growth was due primarily to sales growth in SYGMAs existing customer base. SYGMA segment sales as a percentage of total SYSCO sales increased from 11.1% in fiscal 2001 to 11.4% in fiscal 2002 and decreased from 11.2% in fiscal 2000 to 11.1% in fiscal 2001. The decrease in fiscal 2001 was due to the acquisition of specialty meat, lodging industry product and produce companies in the Other segments. Earnings before income taxes for the segment increased by 41.2% in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 and 213.3% in fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000. The increases in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 were due to operating efficiencies and improved labor costs realized during the current fiscal year. OTHER SEGMENTS The Other segment sales increased by 23.9% in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 and 157.7% in fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000. Other Segment sales as a percentage of total SYSCO sales increased from 6.3% in fiscal 2001 to 7.3% in fiscal 2002 and from 2.8% in fiscal 2000 to 6.3% in fiscal 2001. The increases were due primarily to the timing of acquisitions made during the periods presented. Earnings before income taxes increased by 15.5% in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 and 98.7% in fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000. The increases were due primarily to the timing of acquisitions made during the periods presented. In fiscal 2002, earnings were negatively impacted by the downturn in demand in travel and resort destination cities which are serviced by certain of the specialty companies. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements. Significant accounting polices employed by SYSCO are presented in the notes to the financial statements. 14 Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations. These policies require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. SYSCOs most critical accounting policies pertain to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, self insurance programs, pension plans and accounting for business combinations. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable SYSCO evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and determines the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors. In circumstances where we are aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligation to us, we record a specific reserve for bad debts to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably expect to collect and write off such amounts at the end of each fiscal year. In addition, we recognize reserves for all other receivables based on analysis of historical trends of write offs and recoveries. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, additional reserves may be required. Self Insurance Program SYSCO maintains a self insurance program covering portions of workers compensation, group medical, general liability and vehicle liability costs. The amounts in excess of the self insured levels are fully insured. Self insurance accruals are based on claims filed and include an estimate for significant claims incurred but not reported. Projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. In an attempt to mitigate our risks of workers compensation, vehicle and general liability claims, we have implemented safety procedures and awareness programs. Pension Plans SYSCO maintains defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans for its employees. The company also contributes to various multi employer plans under collective bargaining agreements. The defined benefit pension plans pay benefits to employees at retirement using formulas based on a participants years of service and compensation. SYSCO also maintains a non qualified, unfunded Supplementary Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) for key employees. In order to meet its obligations under the SERP, the company maintains life insurance policies on the lives of participants. SYSCO is the sole owner and beneficiary of such policies, which are excluded from plan assets in arriving at prepaid (accrued) benefit cost. Cash surrender values of such policies were $71,418,000 at June 29, 2002 and $79,083,000 at June 30, 2001. SYSCO accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions" as amended by SFAS No. 132, "Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, and 106." These statements require that the amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis which include assumptions regarding the expected rate of return on plan assets, a discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits, and the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels, as well as other assumptions. For guidance in determining the discount rate, SYSCO looks at rates of return on high quality fixed income investments. This rate was 7.25% and 7.50% as of June 29, 2002 and June 30, 2001, respectively. SYSCO looks to actual plan experience in determining the rates of increase in compensation levels. SYSCO used a plan specific age related set of rates (equivalent to a single rate of 5.89%), as of June 29, 2002 and June 30, 2001. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets was 9.50% and 10.50% as of June 29, 2002 and June 30, 2001, respectively. Management believes that this assumption is reasonable based on the investment policy and expectations of future returns for the various asset classes in which trust assets are invested. Although not determinative of future returns, the effective annual rate of return on plan assets was 9.9%, 9.3% and a negative 2.2% over the ten year, five year and one year periods ended December 31, 2001, respectively. The rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate. 15 The performance of the stock market in 2002 and 2001 resulted in a decline in the value of the assets held by the pension plans. As a result, the company was required to reflect a minimum pension liability of $65,435,000, net of tax, as of June 29, 2002 and $5,624,000, net of tax, as of June 30, 2001. Minimum pension liability adjustments are non cash adjustments that are reflected as an increase in the pension liability and on offsetting charge to shareholders equity, net of tax, through comprehensive loss rather than net income. The companys prepaid benefit cost prior to the recognition of the additional minimum pension liability was $1,063,000 at June 29, 2002 and its accrued benefit cost prior to the recognition of the additional minimum pension liability was $30,736,000 at June 30, 2001. Included in arriving at accrued benefit cost are $236,852,000 in deferred net actuarial losses resulting from the variance of actual experience from that projected by actuarial assumptions. A portion of this unrecognized loss is amortized and recognized in accordance with SFAS No. 87 in pension expense over time. The company recognized net pension costs of $51,336,000 and $30,359,000 for fiscal years 2002 and 2001, respectively. Accounting for Business Combinations Goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired. Certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired including goodwill and other intangible assets as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit. In addition, SYSCO assesses the recoverability of these intangibles by determining whether the amortization of these intangibles over their remaining lives can be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows of the acquired operations. The amount of impairment, if any, is measured by the amount in which the carrying amounts exceed the projected discounted future operating cash flows. SYSCO will adopt SFAS No. 142, "Accounting for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" in fiscal year 2003 which discontinues the amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangibles and requires an annual test of impairment based on a comparison of fair value to carrying values. The evaluation of impairment under both the existing rules and SFAS No. 142 requires the use of projections, estimates and assumptions as to the future performance of the operations. Actual results could differ from projections resulting in the company revising its assumptions and, if required, recognizing an impairment loss. Based on a preliminary assessment, SYSCO does not believe its goodwill is impaired and does not expect to record a charge from the adoption of SFAS No. 142. New Accounting Standards In fiscal 2000, SYSCO adopted the AICPA Statement of Position 98 1 (SOP 98 1), "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use." SOP 98 1 provides guidance with respect to accounting for the various types of costs incurred for computer software developed or obtained for SYSCOs use. The adoption of SOP 98 1 did not have a significant effect on SYSCOs consolidated results of operations or financial position. In fiscal 2001, SYSCO adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," SFAS No. 137, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Deferral of the Effective Date of SFAS No. 133," and SFAS No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities an amendment of SFAS No. 133." These statements outline the accounting treatment for all derivative activity and their adoption did not have a significant effect on SYSCOs consolidated results of operations or financial position. In fiscal 2001, SYSCO adopted the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 (SAB 101), "Revenue Recognition." SAB 101 provides guidance on the recognition, presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements. The adoption of SAB 101 had no effect on SYSCOs consolidated results of operations or financial position. In June 2001, SYSCO adopted SFAS No. 141, "Accounting for Business Combinations." SFAS No. 141 requires that all business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and prohibits the pooling of interests method for business combinations initiated after June 20, 2001. SYSCO is 16 adopting the provisions of SFAS No. 142, "Accounting for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" effective with the beginning of fiscal year 2003. As a result, the amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangibles will be discontinued. Goodwill and indefinite life intangibles arising from business combinations after June 30, 2001 are also not amortized. The recoverability of goodwill and intangibles will be assessed annually or as needed by determining whether the fair value of the applicable reporting units exceed their carrying values. SYSCO has six months from the date it adopts SFAS No. 142 to test for cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Thereafter, any impairment losses will be included, net of tax, within the results of continuing operations. Management has completed its preliminary assessment of the impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 142 will have on the companys consolidated financial statements and believes that goodwill is not impaired. Goodwill amortization, after tax, recognized by SYSCO was $14,533,000 in 2002, $12,089,000 in 2001 and $7,812,000 in 2000. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." SFAS 144 supersedes SFAS 121 and the portion of the Accounting Principle Board Opinion No. 30 that deals with disposal of a business segment. Management does not expect SFAS 144, which is effective for fiscal 2003, to have a material effect on the results of operations. RISK FACTORS Low Margin Business; Economic Sensitivity The foodservice distribution industry is characterized by relatively high inventory turnover with relatively low profit margins. SYSCO makes a significant portion of its sales at prices that are based on the cost of products it sells plus a percentage markup. As a result, SYSCOs profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of food price deflation, even though SYSCOs gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant. The foodservice industry is sensitive to national and regional economic conditions. SYSCOs operating results are also sensitive to, and may be adversely affected by, other factors, including difficulties with the collectability of accounts receivable, inventory control, competitive price pressures, severe weather conditions and unexpected increases in fuel or other transportation related costs. Although these factors have not had a material adverse impact on SYSCOs past operations, there can be no assurance that one or more of these factors will not adversely affect future operating results. Leverage and Debt Service Because historically a substantial part of SYSCOs growth has been the result of acquisitions and capital expansion, SYSCOs continued growth depends, in large part, on its ability to continue this expansion. As a result, its inability to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures through borrowed funds could restrict its ability to expand. Moreover, any default under the documents governing the indebtedness of SYSCO could have a significant adverse effect on the market value of SYSCOs common stock. Further, SYSCOs leveraged position may also increase its vulnerability to competitive pressures. Product Liability Claims SYSCO, like any other seller of food, faces the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of products sold by the company causes injury or illness. With respect to product liability claims, SYSCO believes it has sufficient primary or excess umbrella liability insurance. However, this insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost, or, if available, may not be adequate to cover all of SYSCOs liabilities. SYSCO generally seeks contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying its products, but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited, as a practical matter, to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers. If SYSCO does not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available, product liability relating to defective products could materially reduce SYSCOs net income and earnings per share. 17 Interruption of Supplies SYSCO obtains substantially all of its foodservice products from third party suppliers. For the most part, SYSCO does not have long term contracts with its suppliers committing them to provide products to SYSCO. Although SYSCOs purchasing volume can provide leverage when dealing with suppliers, suppliers may not provide the foodservice products and supplies needed by SYSCO in the quantities requested. Because SYSCO does not control the actual production of the products it sells, it is also subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside its control. These conditions include job actions or strikes by employees of suppliers, weather, crop conditions, transportation interruptions, and natural disasters or other catastrophic events. SYSCOs inability to obtain adequate supplies of its foodservice products as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise, could mean that SYSCO could not fulfill its obligations to customers, and customers may turn to other distributors. Labor Relations As of June 29, 2002, approximately 9,700 employees at 50 operating companies were members of 59 different local unions associated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and other labor organizations. In fiscal 2003, 14 agreements covering approximately 2,130 employees will expire. Failure of the operating companies to effectively renegotiate these contracts could result in work stoppages. Although SYSCOs operating subsidiaries have not experienced any significant labor disputes or work stoppages to date, and SYSCO believes they have satisfactory relationships with their unions, a work stoppage due to failure of one or more operating subsidiaries to renegotiate a union contract, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on SYSCO. Integration of Acquired Companies If SYSCO is unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, its profitability may decrease. Integration of an acquired business may be more difficult when SYSCO acquires a business in a market in which it has limited or no expertise, or with a corporate culture different from SYSCOs. If SYSCO is unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully, it may incur substantial costs and delays in increasing its customer base. In addition, the failure to integrate acquisitions successfully may divert managements attention from SYSCOs existing business and may damage SYSCOs relationships with its key customers and suppliers. Charter and Stockholder Rights Plan Under its Restated Certificate of Incorporation, SYSCOs Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to 1.5 million shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval. Issuance of these shares could make it more difficult for anyone to acquire SYSCO without approval of the Board of Directors, depending on the rights and preferences of the stock issued. In addition, if anyone attempts to acquire SYSCO without approval of the Board of Directors of SYSCO, the stockholders of SYSCO have the right to purchase preferred stock of SYSCO pursuant to its Stockholder Rights Plan, which could result in substantial dilution to a potential acquiror. The existence of either of these provisions could deter hostile takeover attempts that might result in an acquisition of SYSCO that could otherwise have been financially beneficial to SYSCOs stockholders. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements made herein that look forward in time or express managements expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future events are forward looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. They include statements about SYSCOs ability to increase its market share and sales, long term debt to capitalization target ratios, anticipated capital expenditures, and SYSCOs ability to meet future cash requirements and remain profitable. These statements are based on managements current expectations and estimates; actual results may differ materially due in part to the risk factors discussed above. In addition, SYSCOs ability to increase its market share and sales, meet future cash requirements and remain profitable could be affected by conditions 18 in the economy and the industry and internal factors such as the ability to control expenses. The ability to meet long term debt to capitalization target ratios may also be affected by share repurchases, cash flow, acquisitions and internal growth. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK SYSCO does not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes. SYSCOs use of debt directly exposes the company to interest rate risk. Floating rate debt, where the interest rate fluctuates periodically, exposes the company to short term changes in market interest rates. Fixed rate debt, where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument, exposes the company to changes in the market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt. SYSCO manages its debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that goal. The major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments, potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions. At June 29, 2002, the company had outstanding one interest rate swap agreement whereby SYSCO exchanged the fixed interest payments on the $200,000,000 principal amount of 4.75% notes for floating interest payments. At June 29, 2002 the company had outstanding $63,293,000 of commercial paper at variable rates of interest with maturities through September 3, 2002. The companys long term debt obligations of $1,190,061,000 were primarily at fixed rates of interest except for $200,000,000 in fixed rate debt swapped to a floating rate of interest as discussed above. 19
