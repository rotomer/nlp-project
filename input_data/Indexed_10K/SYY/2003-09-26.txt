ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES SYSCO provides marketing and distribution services to foodservice customers throughout the United States and Canada. The company intends to continue to expand its market share through profitable sales growth, foldouts and acquisitions. The company also strives to increase the effectiveness of its marketing associates, its consolidated buying programs and the productivity of its warehousing and distribution activities. These objectives require continuing investment. SYSCOs resources include cash provided by operations and access to capital from financial markets. SYSCOs operations historically have produced significant cash flow. Cash generated from operations is first allocated to working capital requirements; investments in facilities, fleet and other equipment required to meet customers needs; cash dividends; and acquisitions compatible with the companys overall growth strategy. Any remaining cash generated from operations may, at the discretion of management, be applied toward a portion of the cost of the share repurchase program, while the remainder of the cost may be financed with additional long term debt. SYSCOs share repurchase program is used primarily to offset shares issued under various employee benefit and compensation plans, for acquisitions and to reduce shares outstanding, which may have the net effect of increasing earnings per share. Management targets a long term debt to total capitalization ratio between 35% and 40%. The ratio may exceed the target range from time to time due to borrowings incurred in order to fund acquisitions and internal growth opportunities and due to fluctuations in the timing and amount of share repurchases. The ratio also may fall below the target range due to strong cash flow from operations and fluctuations in the timing and amount of share repurchases. This ratio was 36.2% and 35.6% at June 28, 2003 and June 29, 2002, respectively. The company generated net cash from operations of $1,372,840,000 in fiscal 2003, $1,084,980,000 in fiscal 2002, and $955,224,000 in fiscal 2001. The overall increases in operating results contributed to the annual increases in cash flows from operations. In addition, several factors also contributed to the increase in cash flow from operations. During the second quarter of fiscal 2002, the company began reorganizing its supply chain to maximize consolidated efficiencies and increase the effectiveness of the merchandising and procurement functions performed for the benefit of customers. The new structure results in the deferral of certain federal and state income tax payments and is reflected in the increase in net deferred taxes. Tax payments made during the year of $28,747,000 were $211,045,000 less than tax payments made in the prior year. This decrease is primarily due to the deferrals discussed above as well as the impact of other temporary differences and the timing and amount of tax payments. The company estimates the cash flow savings from this deferral in fiscal 2003 to be approximately $410,000,000 as compared to approximately $267,000,000 in fiscal 2002. The company expects the positive cash flow impact of deferrals in fiscal 2004 and beyond to be less than fiscal 2003 levels, as it will begin making payments related to these deferrals in fiscal 2004. The company expects the net cash flow impact of deferrals in fiscal 2004 and beyond to be incrementally positive when compared to what would have been paid on an annual basis without the deferral due to the companys belief that its volume through the new structure will continue to grow. In addition, a federal tax payment of $75,000,000 normally due in the fourth quarter of 2001 was deferred until the first quarter of 2002 as allowed by the Internal Revenue Service, due to the Texas tropical storm Allison disaster, and is reflected in the decrease of accrued income taxes in fiscal 2002. Cash flow from operations for fiscal 2003 was positively impacted by increases in accounts payable balances offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances and decreases in accrued expenses and other liabilities. Increased sales volumes over the comparable periods contributed to the increase in accounts receivable balances. SYSCO has also experienced sales increases with national contract customers that have outpaced the sales increases from marketing associate served customers. National contract customers payment terms are traditionally longer than the SYSCO average. In addition, SYSCO had approximately $37,000,000 in receivables past due at year end from a U.S. military contractor that have since been paid. The increased sales volumes also contributed to the increase in inventory balances. The increase in accounts payable balances was partially due to the increased inventory balances and was significantly aided by an increase in accounts payable days outstanding over the comparable period. A contributor to the decrease in 11 accrued expenses and other liabilities was the increase in pension contributions from $83,136,000 in fiscal 2002 to $164,565,000 in fiscal 2003. Cash used for investing activities was $681,825,000 in fiscal 2003, $662,300,000 in fiscal 2002, and $338,751,000 in fiscal 2001. Expenditures for facilities, fleet and other equipment were $435,637,000 in fiscal 2003, $416,393,000 in fiscal 2002, and $341,138,000 in fiscal 2001. The increase in fiscal 2003 over fiscal 2002 was primarily due to the construction of fold out facilities in Las Vegas, Nevada and Ventura, California, replacement facilities in Cleveland, Ohio; Dallas, Texas; and Miami, Florida and the Northeast Redistribution Center in Front Royal, Virginia (first phase of the National Supply Chain initiative). The increase in fiscal 2002 over fiscal 2001 was primarily due to the construction of fold out facilities located in Sacramento, California; Columbia, South Carolina; and Las Vegas, Nevada. Fiscal 2002 expenditures also included costs incurred on the construction or expansion of facilities in Dallas, Texas; Norman, Oklahoma; Baraboo, Wisconsin; and Jersey City, New Jersey. Total expenditures in fiscal 2004 are expected to increase to the range of $490,000,000 to $510,000,000 due to the continuation of the fold out program; facility, fleet and other equipment replacements and expansions; the companys supply chain initiatives; and investments in technology. Expenditures for acquisitions of businesses were $209,010,000 in fiscal 2003, $234,618,000 in fiscal 2002, and $10,363,000 in fiscal 2001. The National Supply Chain project is expected to create a more efficient and effective supply chain infrastructure for SYSCO, its suppliers and its customers. The project entails the implementation of regional distribution centers, which will aggregate inventory demand to optimize the supply chain activities for certain products from all SYSCO operating companies in the region. The project is expected to achieve lower costs of inventory, transportation, product handling and transaction processing in addition to lowering working capital and future facility expansion needs at the operating companies. The Northeast Redistribution Center is expected to be operational in the summer of 2004. The center will receive and distribute food and food related products to SYSCO operating companies in the Northeast, creating benefits for customers and suppliers, as well as for SYSCO. In November 2000, the company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement covering 30,000,000 shares of common stock to be offered from time to time in connection with acquisitions. As of June 28, 2003, 29,477,835 shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement. Cash used for financing activities was $550,528,000 in fiscal 2003, $359,984,000 in fiscal 2002, and $639,858,000 in fiscal 2001. In September 2001, the Board authorized the repurchase of an additional 16,000,000 shares, which was completed during fiscal 2003. In July 2002, the Board authorized the repurchase of an additional 20,000,000 shares. Under this authorization, 9,063,200 shares remained available for purchase at June 28, 2003. In September 2003, the Board authorized the repurchase of an additional 20,000,000 shares. The number of shares acquired and their cost during the past three fiscal years was 16,500,000 shares for $478,471,000 in fiscal 2003, 18,000,000 shares for $473,558,000 in fiscal 2002, and 16,000,000 shares for $428,196,000 in fiscal 2001. Dividends paid were $261,854,000 in fiscal 2003, $213,275,000 in fiscal 2002, and $173,701,000 in fiscal 2001. SYSCO began paying the current quarterly dividend rate of $0.11 per share in January 2003, an increase from the $0.09 per share that became effective in January 2002. In May 2003, SYSCO declared its regular quarterly dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 of $0.11 per share, which was paid in July 2003. In September 2003, SYSCO also declared its regular quarterly dividend for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 of $0.11 per share, payable in October 2003. In April 2002, SYSCO issued $200,000,000 principal amount of 4.75% notes due July 30, 2005 under a shelf registration statement filed in June 1998. These notes, which were priced at 99.8% of par, are unsecured and are not subject to any sinking fund requirement. They include a redemption provision which allows SYSCO to retire the notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued interest or an amount designed to insure that the note holders are not penalized by early redemption. Proceeds from the notes were used to pay down borrowings under the companys commercial paper program. As of August 29, 12 2003, there was $425,000,000 in principal amount outstanding under the previously filed registration statement, leaving $75,000,000 available for issuance. Concurrent with the issuance of these notes, SYSCO entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $200,000,000 whereby SYSCO received a fixed rate equal to 4.75% per annum and paid a benchmark interest rate of six month LIBOR in arrears less 84.5 basis points. In June 2003, SYSCO terminated this swap agreement and received approximately $15,359,000 representing the fair value of the swap agreement at the time of termination. A corresponding amount is reflected as an increase in the carrying value of the related debt to reflect its fair value at termination. This increase in the carrying value of the debt is being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining term of the debt. In May 2002, SYSCO International, Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of SYSCO, issued 6.10% notes totaling $200,000,000 due June 1, 2012 in a private offering. These notes, which were priced at 99.7% of par, were fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Sysco Corporation, were not subject to any sinking fund requirement, included registration rights for the note holders, and included a redemption provision which allowed SYSCO International, Co. to retire the notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued interest or an amount designed to insure that the note holders were not penalized by the early redemption. In December 2002, SYSCO International, Co. completed a registered exchange offer for these notes. In the exchange offer, all of the outstanding $200,000,000 notes were exchanged for new notes which are identical in all respects to the outstanding notes except that the new notes are registered under the Securities Act of 1933. The new notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Sysco Corporation. The proceeds from these notes were utilized to repay commercial paper borrowings issued by SYSCO International, Co. to fund the acquisition of a Canadian broadline foodservice business. SYSCO has uncommitted bank lines of credit, which provided for unsecured borrowings for working capital of up to $95,000,000 at June 28, 2003 and up to $125,000,000 at June 29, 2002. There were no borrowings outstanding under these lines of credit as of June 28, 2003 or August 29, 2003. SYSCO has a commercial paper program in the United States which was supported by a bank credit facility in the amount of $450,000,000 as of June 28, 2003 maturing in fiscal 2008. SYSCO also has a commercial paper program in Canada which is supported by a bank credit facility in the amount of $100,000,000 in Canadian dollars maturing in fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, commercial paper and short term bank borrowings ranged from approximately $55,813,000 to $495,703,000, $51,472,000 to $538,362,000, and $157,631,000 to $411,790,000, respectively. Commercial paper borrowings were $151,748,000 as of June 28, 2003 and $92,755,000 as of August 29, 2003. The company intends to settle outstanding commercial paper borrowings when they come due by issuing additional debt or retiring them utilizing cash generated from operations. Total debt at June 28, 2003 was $1,372,236,000, of which approximately 88% was at fixed rates averaging 5.7% and the remainder was at floating rates averaging 2.5%. SYSCO continues to have borrowing capacity available and alternative financing arrangements are evaluated as appropriate. In summary, SYSCO believes that through continual monitoring and management of assets together with the availability of additional capital in the financial markets, it will meet its cash requirements while maintaining proper liquidity for normal operating purposes. 13 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table sets forth certain information concerning SYSCOs obligations to make future payments under contracts, such as debt and lease agreements: PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD TOTAL OVER OBLIGATIONS 0 1 YEAR 1 2 YEARS 2 3 YEARS 3 4 YEARS 4 5 YEARS 5 YEARS (IN THOUSANDS) Short term debt and commercial paper.......... $ 151,748 $101,822 $ $ $ $ 49,926 $ Long term debt.............. 1,186,960 15,514 152,881 418,103 102,913 4,094 493,455 Capital lease obligations... 33,528 5,433 4,733 2,664 942 433 19,323 Long term non capitalized leases.................... 270,288 53,673 45,706 38,041 27,317 20,830 84,721 Total contractual cash obligations............... $1,642,524 $176,442 $203,320 $458,808 $131,172 $ 75,283 $597,499 Included in other long term liabilities of $289,998,000 as of June 28, 2003 are Syscos obligations related to pension and deferred compensation plans. SALES Sales increased 11.9% in fiscal 2003, 7.2% in fiscal 2002 and 12.8% in fiscal 2001. The annual sales increases were attributable to a variety of factors, including the progress of SYSCOs Customers Are Really Everything to SYSCO (C.A.R.E.S.) customer relationship initiatives, a persistent focus on increasing sales to marketing associate served customers, the continuing recognition by customers of the quality and value of SYSCO Brand products, the overall growth in the foodservice industry and acquisitions. Real sales growth, calculated as total sales growth less non comparable acquisitions and adjusted for internally estimated product cost inflation or deflation, was approximately 6.7% in fiscal 2003. Acquisitions represented 5.2% of sales increases for fiscal 2003 and there was no inflation or deflation. Product costs trended upward during the last half of the fiscal year, reversing the deflationary pressures experienced during the first half of the year, resulting in a flat rate for the entire year. Real sales growth is a non GAAP financial measure as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management believes it is a useful indicator of the companys organic growth without regard to acquisitions and inflation. After adjusting for acquisitions and inflation, real sales growth was approximately 2.7% in 2002. Acquisitions represented 3.4% of sales increases for fiscal 2002 and inflation was 1.1%. After adjusting for acquisitions and inflation, real sales growth was approximately 5.8% in fiscal 2001. Acquisitions represented 4.5% of total sales in fiscal 2001 and inflation was approximately 2.5%. The lower sales growth in 2002 was attributable to the overall softness in the economy and comparisons to sales increases in fiscal 2001. Industry sources estimate the total foodservice market experienced a real sales decline of approximately 0.3% in calendar year 2002 and zero real sales growth in calendar year 2001. SYSCOs sales for fiscal 2001 through 2003 were as follows: FISCAL YEAR SALES % INCREASE 2003.............................................. $26,140,337,000 11.9% 2002.............................................. 23,350,504,000 7.2 2001.............................................. 21,784,497,000 12.8 14 A comparison of the sales mix in the principal product categories during the last three years is presented below: 2003 2002 2001 Canned and dry products..................................... 19% 19% 19% Fresh and frozen meats...................................... 18 18 18 Frozen fruits, vegetables, bakery and other................. 14 13 13 Poultry..................................................... 10 10 10 Dairy products.............................................. 9 9 9 Fresh produce............................................... 8 9 9 Paper and disposables....................................... 8 8 8 Seafoods.................................................... 6 6 6 Beverage products........................................... 3 3 3 Janitorial products......................................... 2 2 2 Equipment and smallwares.................................... 2 2 2 Medical supplies............................................ 1 1 1 100% 100% 100% A comparison of sales by type of customer during the last three years is presented below: 2003 2002 2001 Restaurants................................................. 63% 63% 64% Hospitals and nursing homes................................. 10 10 11 Schools and colleges........................................ 6 6 6 Hotels and motels........................................... 6 6 5 All other................................................... 15 15 14 100% 100% 100% COST OF SALES Cost of sales increased approximately 12.1% in fiscal 2003, 6.9% in fiscal 2002 and 11.9% in fiscal 2001. In fiscal 2003, the increase in cost of sales resulted in gross margins as a percent of sales decreasing 0.08 percentage points compared to the prior year. This decrease was primarily attributable to two factors. First, multi unit sales growth of 13.3% was greater than marketing associate served sales growth of 10.5%. Multi unit sales tend to have lower gross margins (coupled with lower expenses) than marketing associate served sales. Secondly, fresh cut meat sales grew as a percentage of overall sales. As these are higher price and lower gross margin percentage products, this had the effect of decreasing overall gross margins as a percent of sales even as gross margin dollars increased. In 2002 and 2001, the rate of increase in cost of sales was less than the rate of sales increase leading to improved gross margins. The rate of increase in gross margins is influenced by SYSCOs overall customer and product mix, economies realized in purchasing and higher sales of SYSCO Brand products. OPERATING EXPENSES Operating expenses include the costs of warehousing and delivering products as well as selling and administrative expenses. These expenses as a percent of sales were 14.7% for fiscal 2003 and 14.8% for fiscal 2002 and 2001. Changes in the percentage relationship of operating expenses to sales result from an interplay of several factors, including customer mix. Inflationary increases in operating costs generally have been offset through improved productivity. 15 The decrease in expenses in fiscal 2003 was primarily attributable to improved operating efficiencies as demonstrated by improving trends in key expense metrics including pieces sold per delivery and product line items sold per delivery. These operating expense improvements were partially offset by increases in net pension costs of $22,952,000 and by increases in expenses incurred in connection with the National Supply Chain initiative of $5,996,000. Operating expenses in fiscal 2002 were negatively impacted by increased costs realized during the initial operating periods of fold outs in Sacramento, California; Columbia, South Carolina; and Las Vegas, Nevada. In addition, the increase in marketing associate served sales is accompanied by higher expenses to serve these customers. INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense for fiscal 2003 increased $9,337,000, or approximately 14.8% over fiscal 2002, which had decreased $8,879,000, or approximately 12.4% below fiscal 2001. The increase in interest expense in fiscal 2003 was primarily due to increased borrowings, partially offset by decreases in interest rate levels. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2002 was primarily due to decreases in interest rates for short term and commercial paper borrowings. Interest capitalized during construction periods for the past three years was $5,244,000 in fiscal 2003, $3,746,000 in fiscal 2002 and $2,995,000 in fiscal 2001. OTHER, NET Other, net was income of $8,347,000 in fiscal 2003, an increase of $5,542,000 from the income of $2,805,000 in fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2002s income of $2,805,000 increased $2,906,000 from the $101,000 expense in fiscal 2001. Changes between the years result from fluctuations in miscellaneous activities, primarily gains and losses on the sale of surplus facilities. EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES Earnings before income taxes in fiscal 2003 rose $159,517,000, or approximately 14.5% above fiscal 2002 which had increased $134,215,000, or approximately 13.9%, over fiscal 2001. Additional sales and realization of operating efficiencies contributed to the increases. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES The effective tax rate was 38.25% in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001. SYSCO anticipates an effective tax rate of 38.50% in fiscal 2004. The increase is attributable to the increasing effective rates of state income taxes. NET EARNINGS Fiscal 2003 represents the twenty seventh consecutive year of increased net earnings. Net earnings rose $98,501,000 or approximately 14.5% above fiscal 2002, which had increased $82,878,000 or approximately 13.9% over fiscal 2001. The increases were caused by additional sales, operating efficiencies and other factors discussed above. RETURN ON AVERAGE SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY The return on average shareholders equity was approximately 36% in fiscal 2003 and 31% in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001. Since its inception, SYSCO has averaged in excess of an 18% return on average shareholders equity before the cumulative effect of accounting changes. BROADLINE SEGMENT Broadline segment sales increased by 12.1% in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 and by 5.8% in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001. The fiscal 2003 and 2002 sales growth was due primarily to increased sales to marketing associate served and multi unit customers, including increased sales of SYSCO Brand products, as well as the acquisition of a Canadian broadline foodservice operation. The sales growth was obtained through 16 increased sales to the existing customer base as well as the acquisition of new customers. Broadline segment sales as a percentage of total SYSCO sales increased to 82.2% in fiscal 2003 from 82.1% in fiscal 2002 which decreased from 83.1% in fiscal 2001. The increase in fiscal 2003 was due primarily to the acquisition of a Canadian broadline foodservice operation. The decrease in fiscal 2002 was due primarily to acquisitions of specialty meat, lodging industry product and produce companies in the Other segments and greater percentage growth of specialty meat, lodging industry companies and SYGMA segment as a percentage of overall SYSCO sales. Earnings before income taxes for the Broadline segment increased by 12.8% in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 and by 12.4% in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001. The increases in earnings before income taxes for fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 were driven by improved operating efficiencies as well as increased sales to multi unit and marketing associate served customers and increases in sales of SYSCO Brand products. SYGMA SEGMENT SYGMA segment sales increased by 9.2% in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 and 10.6% in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001. The fiscal 2003 sales growth was primarily due to sales growth in SYGMAs existing customer base as well as the acquisition of two quickservice operations. Sales growth in fiscal 2002 was due primarily to sales growth in SYGMAs existing customer base. SYGMA segment sales as a percentage of total SYSCO sales decreased to 11.2% in fiscal 2003 from 11.4% in fiscal 2002 which increased from 11.1% in fiscal 2001. The decrease in fiscal 2003 was due to the sales growth in the Broadline and Other segments. Earnings before income taxes for the SYGMA segment increased by 3.4% in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 and 41.2% in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001. The increase in fiscal 2003 was primarily due to increased sales. The increase in fiscal 2002 was due to operating efficiencies and improved labor productivity realized during the fiscal year. OTHER SEGMENTS Other segment sales increased by 17.3% in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 and 23.9% in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001. Other segment sales as a percentage of total SYSCO sales increased to 7.7% in fiscal 2003 from 7.3% in fiscal 2002 which increased from 6.3% in fiscal 2001. The increase in fiscal 2003 was primarily attributable to sales growth in our custom meat cutting operations as well as the timing of acquisitions made during the year. The increase in fiscal 2002 was due primarily to the timing of acquisitions made during the year. Earnings before income taxes for the Other segment increased by 4.8% in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 and 15.5% in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001. The increase in fiscal 2003 was due primarily to the acquisition of a specialty distributor of products to the Asian foodservice market, increased earnings from increased gross margins and operating efficiencies at the companys specialty produce operations, and increased earnings from increased sales and gross margins at the companys specialty lodging industry products operations. These were offset by expenses incurred on a start up operation supplying the health care industry and decreased earnings at the companys specialty meat cutting operations. This decrease was primarily attributable to decreased gross margins as meat costs increased in a highly inflationary period. Gross margin percentages on products priced on a mark up per pound basis are difficult to maintain during inflationary periods. The increase in fiscal 2002 was due primarily to the timing of acquisitions made during the periods presented but was offset by a decrease due to the downturn in demand in travel and resort destination cities which are serviced by certain of the specialty companies. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements. Significant accounting polices employed by SYSCO are presented in the notes to the financial statements. 17 Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations. These policies require managements most subjective or complex judgments, often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Senior management has reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates and this related disclosure. SYSCOs most critical accounting policies pertain to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, self insurance programs, pension plans and accounting for business combinations. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable SYSCO evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and determines the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors. In circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligation, a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected. In addition, allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on analysis of historical trends of write offs and recoveries. The company utilizes specific criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be written off including bankruptcy, accounts referred to outside parties for collection and accounts past due over specified periods. If the financial condition of SYSCOs customers were to deteriorate, additional allowances may be required. Self Insurance Program SYSCO maintains a self insurance program covering portions of workers compensation, group medical, general liability and vehicle liability costs. The amounts in excess of the self insured levels are fully insured. Liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. In an attempt to mitigate the risks of workers compensation, vehicle and general liability claims, safety procedures and awareness programs have been implemented. Pension Plans SYSCO maintains defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans for its employees. The company also contributes to various multi employer plans under collective bargaining agreements. The defined benefit pension plans pay benefits to employees at retirement using formulas based on a participants years of service and compensation. SYSCO also maintains a non qualified, unfunded Supplementary Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) for key employees. In order to meet its obligations under the SERP, the company maintains life insurance policies on the lives of participants. SYSCO is the sole owner and beneficiary of such policies, which are excluded from plan assets in arriving at prepaid (accrued) benefit cost. Cash surrender values of such policies were $74,730,000 at June 28, 2003 and $71,418,000 at June 29, 2002. SYSCO accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions," as amended by SFAS No. 132, "Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, and 106." These statements require that the amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. Three of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits, the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets. For guidance in determining the discount rate, SYSCO refers to rates of return on high quality fixed income investments, including, among other items, Moodys long term AA corporate bond yields. The discount rate utilized by SYSCO was 6.00% and 7.25% as of June 28, 2003 and June 29, 2002, respectively. The discount rate assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate, as it was at June 28, 18 2003, when the discount rate was reduced to 6.00% from 7.25% and at June 29, 2002 when the discount rate was reduced to 7.25% from 7.50%. The discount rate assumption utilized impacts the recorded amount of pension expense. The 0.25% decrease in the discount rate used at June 29, 2002 increased SYSCOs net pension expense for fiscal 2003 by approximately $5,500,000. The decrease in the discount rate of 1.25% at June 28, 2003 will increase SYSCOs pension expense for fiscal 2004 by approximately $35,300,000. SYSCO looks to actual plan experience in determining the rates of increase in compensation levels. SYSCO used a plan specific age related set of rates (equivalent to a single rate of 5.89%), as of June 28, 2003 and June 29, 2002. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets was 9.00% and 9.50% as of June 28, 2003 and June 29, 2002, respectively. The expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns, reflecting a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and the forward looking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on long term bonds and the historical returns of the major stock markets. Although not determinative of future returns, the effective annual rate of return on plan assets, developed using geometric/compound averaging, was 12.1%, 7.5%, 2.7% and a negative 14.3% over the twenty year, ten year, five year and one year periods ended December 31, 2002, respectively. In addition, in nine of the last fifteen years, the actual return on plan assets has exceeded 9.50%. The rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate as it was at June 28, 2003 when the expected return was reduced to 9.00% from 9.50% and at June 29, 2002 when the expected return was reduced to 9.50% from 10.50%. The expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of pension expense. The 1% decrease in the assumed rate of return increased SYSCOs net pension expense for fiscal 2003 by approximately $4,900,000. The decrease in the expected return of 0.50% at June 28, 2003 will increase SYSCOs net pension expense for fiscal 2004 by approximately $3,400,000. Amortization of unrecognized net asset losses increased pension expense for fiscal year 2003 by approximately $5,800,000 and is expected to further increase pension expense for fiscal year 2004 by approximately $4,200,000. Changes in assumptions regarding the discount rate together with actual returns on plan assets below the expected return assumptions resulted in the company being required to reflect a cumulative adjustment to other comprehensive income with respect to minimum pension liability of $185,118,000, net of tax, as of June 28, 2003 and $65,435,000, net of tax, as of June 29, 2002. Minimum pension liability adjustments are non cash adjustments that are reflected as an increase in the pension liability and an offsetting charge to shareholders equity, net of tax, through comprehensive loss rather than net income. The companys prepaid pension cost prior to the recognition of the additional minimum pension liability was $91,340,000 and $1,063,000 at June 28, 2003 and June 29, 2002, respectively. Included in arriving at accrued benefit cost as of June 28, 2003 and June 29, 2002, respectively, are $493,829,000 and $236,852,000 in deferred net actuarial losses resulting from the variance of actual experience from that projected by actuarial assumptions. A portion of this unrecognized loss is amortized and recognized in accordance with SFAS No. 87 in pension expense over time. The company recognized net pension costs of $74,288,000, net of an expected asset return of $44,061,000, and $51,336,000, net of an expected asset return of $42,039,000, for fiscal years 2003 and 2002, respectively. Changes in the assumptions together with the normal growth of the plan and the impact of losses from prior periods, increased net pension cost $22,952,000 in fiscal 2003 and is expected to increase fiscal 2004 by $39,900,000. The companys cash contributions to its pension plans were $164,565,000 and $83,136,000 in fiscal years 2003 and 2002, respectively. For the past several years no contributions have been required to be made to the qualified pension trust, as determined by government regulations; however, SYSCO has chosen to voluntarily 19 make contributions. In fiscal 2004, contributions to the qualified pension trust will also not be required as determined by government regulations. Accounting for Business Combinations Goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired. Certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired, including goodwill and other intangible assets, as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit. In addition, SYSCO assesses the recoverability of these intangibles by determining whether the fair values of the applicable reporting units exceed their carrying values. The evaluation of fair value requires the use of projections, estimates and assumptions as to the future performance of the operations in performing a discounted cash flow analysis as well as assumptions regarding sales and earnings multiples that would be applied in comparable acquisitions in the industry. Actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections resulting in the company revising its assumptions and, if required, recognizing an impairment loss. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS SYSCO adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142, "Accounting for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," effective at the beginning of fiscal 2003. As a result, the amortization of goodwill was discontinued. Management completed its assessment of the impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 142 had on the companys consolidated financial statements and determined that there was no impairment to the carrying value of goodwill. Had goodwill amortization been discontinued for all the fiscal years reported, SYSCOs pro forma net earnings and diluted earnings per share were $778,288,000 and $1.18 in fiscal 2003, $694,320,000 and $1.03 in fiscal 2002 and $608,998,000 and $0.90 in fiscal 2001. SYSCO adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," effective in fiscal 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 has not had a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements. SYSCO has adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." This interpretation requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value and also requires a guarantor to make certain disclosures regarding guarantees. This interpretations initial recognition and initial measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements became effective for SYSCOs financial statements for the third quarter of fiscal 2003. The adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on SYSCOs consolidated financial statements or disclosures. SYSCO adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure," in the third quarter of fiscal 2003. SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition to SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation if a company elects to adopt these provisions. SFAS No. 148 also specifies required disclosures of an entitys accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements. SYSCO has adopted the provisions of the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 02 16, "Accounting by a Customer (including a Reseller) for Cash Consideration Received from a Vendor." The provisions of EITF No. 02 16 are effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2002 with certain provisions effective for arrangements entered into after November 21, 2002. SYSCOs historical accounting policies are consistent with the provisions of EITF No. 02 16 and thus SYSCO chose to adopt this accounting policy during the third quarter of fiscal 2003. EITF No. 02 16 provides guidance as to the recognition and classification of monies received from vendors. The adoption of this consensus did not have an impact on SYSCOs consolidated financial statements. 20 SYSCO adopted the provisions of the EITF Issue 02 17, "Recognition of Customer Relationship Intangible Assets Acquired in a Business Combination," effective October 2002. EITF No. 02 17 addresses the intangible asset recognition criteria of SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations," and provides that an intangible asset related to customer relationship intangibles may exist even though the relationship is not evidenced by a contract. The adoption of this consensus did not have a material impact on SYSCOs consolidated financial statements. In November 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 00 21, "Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements." EITF No. 00 21 addresses how to account for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and provides guidance relating to when such arrangements should be divided into components for revenue recognition purposes. The consensus will be effective for agreements entered into in fiscal 2004 with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this consensus will not have a material impact on SYSCOs consolidated financial statements. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51." This interpretation introduces a new consolidation model, the variable interests model, which determines control (and consolidation) based on potential variability in gains and losses of the entity being evaluated for consolidation. The interpretations consolidation provisions apply immediately to variable interests in variable interest entities (VIEs) created after January 31, 2003 and apply in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003 to VIEs acquired before February 1, 2003. The adoption of this interpretation will not have a material impact on SYSCOs consolidated financial statements. RISK FACTORS Low Margin Business; Economic Sensitivity The foodservice distribution industry is characterized by relatively high inventory turnover with relatively low profit margins. SYSCO makes a significant portion of its sales at prices that are based on the cost of products it sells plus a percentage markup. As a result, SYSCOs profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of product cost deflation, even though SYSCOs gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant. Product cost inflation could also have a negative impact on profit margins if SYSCO is unable to raise prices to its customers at the same rate its costs increase. The foodservice industry is sensitive to national and regional economic conditions. SYSCOs operating results are also sensitive to, and may be adversely affected by, other factors, including difficulties with the collectability of accounts receivable, inventory control, competitive price pressures, severe weather conditions and unexpected increases in fuel or other transportation related costs. Although these factors have not had a material adverse impact on SYSCOs past operations, there can be no assurance that one or more of these factors will not adversely affect future operating results. Leverage and Debt Service Because historically a substantial part of SYSCOs growth has been the result of acquisitions and capital expansion, SYSCOs continued growth depends, in large part, on its ability to continue this expansion. As a result, its inability to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures through borrowed funds could restrict its ability to expand. Moreover, any default under the documents governing the indebtedness of SYSCO could have a significant adverse effect on the market value of SYSCOs common stock. Further, SYSCOs leveraged position may also increase its vulnerability to competitive pressures. Product Liability Claims SYSCO, like any other seller of food, faces the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of products sold by the company causes injury or illness. With respect to product liability claims, SYSCO believes it has sufficient primary or excess umbrella liability insurance. However, this insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost, or, if available, may not be adequate to cover all of SYSCOs liabilities. SYSCO generally seeks contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying 21 its products, but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited, as a practical matter, to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers. If SYSCO does not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available, product liability relating to defective products could materially reduce SYSCOs net earnings and earnings per share. Interruption of Supplies SYSCO obtains substantially all of its foodservice products from third party suppliers. For the most part, SYSCO does not have long term contracts with its suppliers committing them to provide products to SYSCO. Although SYSCOs purchasing volume can provide leverage when dealing with suppliers, suppliers may not provide the foodservice products and supplies needed by SYSCO in the quantities requested. Because SYSCO does not control the actual production of the products it sells, it is also subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside its control. These conditions include job actions or strikes by employees of suppliers, weather, crop conditions, transportation interruptions, and natural disasters or other catastrophic events. SYSCOs inability to obtain adequate supplies of its foodservice products as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise, could mean that SYSCO could not fulfill its obligations to customers, and customers may turn to other distributors. Labor Relations As of June 28, 2003, approximately 9,500 employees at 49 operating companies were members of 58 different local unions associated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and other labor organizations. In fiscal 2004, 10 agreements covering approximately 1,070 employees will expire. Failure of the operating companies to effectively renegotiate these contracts could result in work stoppages. Although SYSCOs operating subsidiaries have not experienced any significant labor disputes or work stoppages to date, and SYSCO believes they have satisfactory relationships with their unions, a work stoppage due to failure of one or more operating subsidiaries to renegotiate a union contract, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on SYSCO. Integration of Acquired Companies If SYSCO is unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, its profitability may decrease. Integration of an acquired business may be more difficult when SYSCO acquires a business in a market in which it has limited or no expertise, or with a corporate culture different from SYSCOs. If SYSCO is unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully, it may incur substantial costs and delays in increasing its customer base. In addition, the failure to integrate acquisitions successfully may divert managements attention from SYSCOs existing business and may damage SYSCOs relationships with its key customers and suppliers. Charter and Stockholder Rights Plan Under its Restated Certificate of Incorporation, SYSCOs Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to 1.5 million shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval. Issuance of these shares could make it more difficult for anyone to acquire SYSCO without approval of the Board of Directors, depending on the rights and preferences of the stock issued. In addition, if anyone attempts to acquire SYSCO without approval of the Board of Directors of SYSCO, the stockholders of SYSCO have the right to purchase preferred stock of SYSCO pursuant to its Stockholder Rights Plan, which could result in substantial dilution to a potential acquiror. The existence of either of these provisions could deter hostile takeover attempts that might result in an acquisition of SYSCO that could otherwise have been financially beneficial to SYSCOs stockholders. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements made herein that look forward in time or express managements expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future events are forward looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. They include statements about SYSCOs ability to increase its 22 market share and sales, long term debt to capitalization target ratios, anticipated capital expenditures, timing and expected benefits of the National Supply Chain initiative and related regional distribution centers, and SYSCOs ability to meet future cash requirements and remain profitable. These statements are based on managements current expectations and estimates; actual results may differ materially due in part to the risk factors discussed above. In addition, SYSCOs ability to increase its market share and sales, meet future cash requirements and remain profitable could be affected by conditions in the economy and the industry and internal factors such as the ability to control expenses. The ability to meet long term debt to capitalization target ratios may also be affected by share repurchases, cash flow, acquisitions and internal growth. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK SYSCO does not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes. SYSCOs use of debt directly exposes the company to interest rate risk. Floating rate debt, where the interest rate fluctuates periodically, exposes the company to short term changes in market interest rates. Fixed rate debt, where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument, exposes the company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate. SYSCO manages its debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that goal. The major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments, potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions. At June 28, 2003, the company had no interest rate swap agreements outstanding. At June 28, 2003 the company had outstanding $151,748,000 of commercial paper at variable rates of interest with maturities through October 2, 2003. The companys long term debt obligations of $1,249,467,000 were primarily at fixed rates of interest. The following table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. All amounts are stated in U.S. dollar equivalents.
