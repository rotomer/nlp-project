ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HIGHLIGHTS Sales increased 12.2% in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2004 included 53 weeks which represented an additional week over the 52 weeks in fiscal 2003. This additional week represented an estimated 2.2% of the sales increase in fiscal 2004. Gross margins as a percent of sales for fiscal 2004 decreased from the prior year due to the impact of product cost increases and changes in customer mix, segment mix and product mix. Operating expenses as a percent of sales for fiscal 2004 decreased from the prior year due to operating efficiencies and operating costs increasing at lower rates than the sales price increases driven by product cost increases. Operating expenses were negatively impacted by increased net pension costs and expenses incurred in connection with the National Supply Chain project and were favorably impacted by gains recorded related to the cash surrender value of life insurance assets. Primarily as a result of these factors, net earnings increased 16.6% in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003. The earnings increases in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 also include the impact of the additional week in fiscal 2004. The impact on our customers of a prolonged period of rising product costs, internally estimated at 6.3% for the fiscal year and 8.0% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, has contributed to a softer foodservice market. Management believes that the softness in the foodservice market together with general economic conditions contributed to a slowing of sales growth for the company in the latter half of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 which is continuing in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. The company has renewed its focus on expense controls in fiscal 2005, including managing labor costs and productivity and ongoing benchmarking and sharing of best practices at the operating companies. OVERVIEW SYSCO distributes food and related products to the foodservice industry, including restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments and other foodservice customers. SYSCOs operations are located throughout the United States and Canada and include broadline companies, specialty produce companies, custom cut meat operations, Asian cuisine foodservice, hotel supply operations, SYGMA, the companys chain restaurant distribution subsidiary, and a company that distributes to internationally located chain restaurants. The company estimates that it serves more than 14% of an approximately $207 billion annual foodservice market that includes the North American foodservice, non food and hotel amenity, furniture and textile markets. The foodservice, or food prepared away from home, market represents approximately one half of the total food purchases made at the consumer level. This share has grown from about 37% in 1972, since food purchases in the foodservice industry have grown more rapidly than food purchases in the retail grocery industry over most of that time period. Factors influencing this trend, and therefore SYSCOs growth, include increases in dual worker and single parent families; busier lifestyles; the general aging of the population; growing affluence; and the increasing demand for the variety, convenience and entertainment afforded by the proliferation of restaurants and other foodservice operations. Industry statisticians and demographers expect most of these general trends to continue, although they may not continue at the same pace. General economic conditions and consumer confidence can have an effect on the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home and therefore on SYSCO. However, we have consistently grown at a faster rate than the overall industry and have grown our market share in this fragmented industry. The company intends to continue to expand its market share and grow earnings through strategies which include: Profitable sales growth: In addition to expansion through foldouts (new operating companies created in established markets previously served by other SYSCO operating companies) and a disciplined acquisition program, refining the use of customer purchasing potential and profitability data in targeting new customers, deepening relationships with existing customers, tailoring products and 11 services and allocating associated resources by customer, and managing the profitability of, or exiting, low profit or unprofitable customers. Brand management: Leveraging brand strength to grow sales and profitability while ensuring strict quality control processes and providing greater value to customers. Productivity: Deploying the latest technology and leveraging best business practices to improve operating efficiencies and leverage expenses to sales growth. Sales force effectiveness: Targeted recruiting, training and compensation of marketing associates. Expanding the business development and business review functions to further strengthen our marketing associate customer relationships. Supply chain optimization: Creating a more efficient and effective supply chain infrastructure through the National Supply Chain project. The companys National Supply Chain project is intended to optimize the supply chain activities for certain products from SYSCOs operating companies in each respective region and as a result, reduce inventory and operating costs, working capital requirements and future facility expansion needs at SYSCOs operating companies while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers. The company expects to build from five to ten regional distribution centers over a period of ten years. The first regional distribution center in the Northeast is expected to be operational during the third quarter of fiscal 2005. 12 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth the components of the Results of Operations expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated: 2004 2003 2002 Sales....................................................... 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Costs and Expenses Cost of sales............................................. 80.7 80.3 80.2 Operating expenses........................................ 14.1 14.7 14.9 Interest expense.......................................... 0.2 0.2 0.2 Other, net................................................ 0.0 0.0 0.0 Total costs and expenses.................................... 95.0 95.2 95.3 Earnings before income taxes................................ 5.0 4.8 4.7 Income taxes................................................ 1.9 1.8 1.8 Net earnings................................................ 3.1% 3.0% 2.9% The following table sets forth the change in the components of the Results of Operations expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year: 2004 2003 Sales....................................................... 12.2% 11.9% Costs and Expenses Cost of sales............................................. 12.8 12.1 Operating expenses........................................ 7.9 10.6 Interest expense..........................................

(1.2) (1.7) Diluted shares outstanding.................................. 0.1 (1.8) Sales Sales increased 12.2% in fiscal 2004 and 11.9% in fiscal 2003 over the prior years. The additional week contributed approximately 2.2% to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2004. Because the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 contained an additional week as compared to fiscal 2003, sales growth for fiscal 2004 is not directly comparable to the prior year. In order to provide a more comparable picture of sales growth during fiscal 2004, management believes that it is appropriate to adjust the sales figures for fiscal 2004 by the estimated impact of the additional week. As a result, sales for fiscal 2004 presented in the table below are adjusted by one fourteenth of total sales for the fourth quarter. Failure to make these adjustments might cause investors to 13 overstate the amount of actual sales growth due to the additional week of sales included in fiscal 2004. Set forth below is a reconciliation of actual sales growth to adjusted sales growth for the periods presented: 2004 2003 Sales for the 53/52 week periods............................ $29,335,403,000 $26,140,337,000 Estimated sales for the additional week..................... 581,358,000 Adjusted Sales.............................................. $28,754,045,000 $26,140,337,000 Actual percentage increase.................................. 12.2% 11.9% Adjusted percentage increase................................ 10.0% 11.9% Acquisitions contributed 0.9% to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2004 and 5.2% for fiscal 2003. Estimated product cost increases, an internal measure of inflation, were 6.3% during fiscal 2004 as compared to a flat rate during fiscal 2003. SYSCO generally expects to pass product cost increases to its customers; however, the actual amount of inflation reflected as sales price increases is difficult to quantify. Management believes that SYSCOs restaurant operator customers have experienced softness in their rate of sales growth as cost and price increases impact customer spending. Product cost increases in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 reached 8.0%. Management believes that the softness in the foodservice market together with general economic conditions contributed to a slowing of SYSCOs sales growth in the latter half of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 which is continuing in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. Industry sources estimate the total foodservice market experienced a real sales decline of approximately 0.7% in calendar year 2003 and real sales growth of 0.5% in calendar year 2002. A comparison of the sales mix in the principal product categories during the last three years is presented below: 2004 2003 2002 Fresh and frozen meats...................................... 19% 18% 18% Canned and dry products..................................... 18 19 19 Frozen fruits, vegetables, bakery and other................. 14 14 13 Poultry..................................................... 11 10 10 Dairy products.............................................. 9 9 9 Fresh produce............................................... 8 8 9 Paper and disposables....................................... 8 8 8 Seafood..................................................... 5 6 6 Beverage products........................................... 3 3 3 Equipment and smallwares.................................... 2 2 2 Janitorial products......................................... 2 2 2 Medical supplies............................................ 1 1 1 100% 100% 100% A comparison of sales by type of customer during the last three years is presented below: 2004 2003 2002 Restaurants................................................. 64% 63% 63% Hospitals and nursing homes................................. 10 10 10 Schools and colleges........................................ 5 6 6 Hotels and motels........................................... 6 6 6 All other................................................... 15 15 15 100% 100% 100% 14 Cost of Sales Cost of sales as a percentage of sales was 80.7% in fiscal 2004, 80.3% in fiscal 2003 and 80.2% in fiscal 2002. Management believes that cost of sales as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2004 was impacted by several factors, including product cost increases and changes in customer mix, segment mix and product mix; however, the specific impact of each factor is difficult to quantify. Product cost increases in substantially all product categories also had the impact of reducing gross margins as a percentage of sales, as gross profit dollars are earned on a higher sales dollar base. Dairy and meat products, which are especially affected by product cost increases since they are often sold on a cost per pound plus a fee basis rather than a percentage markup, experienced the highest rates of inflation. The result was a higher sales price but a lower gross margin as a percentage of sales even as gross margin dollars were maintained or even increased. Multi unit customer sales in the Broadline segment, which traditionally yield lower gross margins and lower expenses than marketing associate served customer sales, grew faster than sales to marketing associate served customer sales. Sales at the SYGMA and the Other segments, which traditionally have lower margins than the Broadline segment, grew faster than sales at the Broadline segment. In the area of product mix, meat sales continued to grow as a percentage of overall sales and also experienced a high rate of cost increases. Meat products typically generate higher prices and higher gross margin dollars per case than the average of other products, but lower gross margins as a percentage of sales. Therefore, increased sales of these products had the effect of decreasing overall gross margins as a percentage of sales even as gross margin dollars were maintained or increased. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2003 was primarily a result of two factors. First, multi unit sales growth was greater than marketing associate served sales growth. Second, fresh cut meat sales grew as a percentage of overall sales. In fiscal 2002, cost of sales was influenced by SYSCOs overall customer and product mix, economies realized in purchasing and increased sales of SYSCO Brand products. Operating Expenses Operating expenses include the costs of warehousing and delivering products as well as selling, administrative and occupancy expenses. These expenses as a percent of sales were 14.1% for fiscal 2004, 14.7% for fiscal 2003 and 14.9% for fiscal 2002. Changes in the percentage relationship of operating expenses to sales result from an interplay of several factors, including improved efficiencies, customer mix, and product cost increases. The decrease in expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 was attributable to several factors including improved operating efficiencies as demonstrated by improving trends in key expense metrics tracked at the broadline operating companies, including pieces sold per delivery, product line items sold per delivery, pieces per trip and pieces per error. Increases in product costs and the resulting increased average sales price per item also favorably impacted expenses as a percentage of sales as operating costs increased at a lower rate. Operating expenses were negatively impacted by increases in net pension costs of $39,944,000 and by increases in expenses related to the National Supply Chain project of $5,584,000 over fiscal 2003. Management estimates that the company will incur an additional $40,000,000 to $50,000,000 in expenses related to the National Supply Chain project in fiscal 2005 over what was incurred in fiscal 2004, including depreciation of the first redistribution center. Operating expenses were also favorably impacted by the recognition of income in fiscal 2004 of $19,124,000 to adjust the carrying value of life insurance assets to their cash surrender value. The gains in fiscal 2004 were recognized in the first 39 weeks with a modest loss of $97,000 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. This contrasted with fiscal 2003 where a gain of $13,000,000 was recognized in the fourth quarter reversing the majority of prior losses recognized in the first 39 weeks and resulting in a net loss of $156,000 for the fiscal year. The company has renewed its focus on expense controls in fiscal 2005, including managing labor costs and productivity and ongoing benchmarking and sharing of best practices at the operating companies. 15 The decrease in expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily attributable to improved operating efficiencies, as demonstrated by improving trends in key expense metrics, including pieces sold per delivery and product line items sold per delivery. These operating expense improvements were partially offset by increases in net pension costs of $22,952,000 and by increases in expenses incurred in connection with the National Supply Chain project of $5,996,000 over fiscal 2002. Operating expenses in fiscal 2002 were negatively impacted by increases in marketing associate served sales, for which higher expenses are incurred to serve these customers. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased 3.3% in fiscal 2004 and increased 14.8% in fiscal 2003 over the prior years. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to lower borrowing rates offsetting moderately higher borrowing levels. The lower average borrowing rates of the company in fiscal 2004 were due to lower short term market interest rates and the use of interest rate swaps which converted the fixed rates of interest on a portion of SYSCOs long term debt to lower variable rates of interest. The increase in interest expense in fiscal 2003 was primarily due to increased borrowings, partially offset by decreases in interest rate levels. Other, Net Other, net was income of $12,365,000 in fiscal 2004, $8,347,000 in fiscal 2003 and $2,805,000 in fiscal 2002. Changes between the years result from fluctuations in miscellaneous activities, primarily gains and losses on the sale of surplus facilities. Earnings Before Income Taxes Earnings before income taxes increased 17.0% in fiscal 2004 and 14.5% in fiscal 2003 over the prior years. The increases were due to the factors discussed above. The additional week also contributed to the earnings growth in fiscal 2004. Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 38.50% in fiscal 2004 and 38.25% in fiscal 2003 and 2002. Net Earnings Fiscal 2004 represents the twenty eighth consecutive year of increased earnings before the cumulative effect of accounting changes. Net earnings increased 16.6% in fiscal 2004 and 14.5% in fiscal 2003 over the prior periods. The increases were due to the factors discussed above. Return on Average Shareholders Equity The return on average shareholders equity was approximately 39% in fiscal 2004, 36% in fiscal 2003 and 31% in fiscal 2002. The increase in net earnings and share repurchases in fiscal 2004, reduced by the reversal of a portion of minimum pension liability, contributed to the increase in fiscal 2004. Since its inception, SYSCO has averaged approximately 19% return on average shareholders equity. 16 SEGMENT RESULTS The following table sets forth the change in the selected financial data of each of the companys reportable segments expressed as a percentage increase over the prior year and should be read in conjunction with Business Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements: 2004 2003 EARNINGS EARNINGS SALES BEFORE TAXES SALES BEFORE TAXES Broadline...................................... 10.4% 14.4% 12.1% 12.8% SYGMA.......................................... 21.7 7.2 9.2 3.4 Other.......................................... 19.0 55.4 17.3 4.8 The following table sets forth sales and earnings before taxes of each of the companys reportable segments expressed as a percentage of the respective consolidated total and should be read in conjunction with Business Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements: 2004 2003 2002 EARNINGS EARNINGS EARNINGS SALES BEFORE TAXES SALES BEFORE TAXES SALES BEFORE TAXES Broadline................. 80.9% 99.0% 82.2% 101.2% 82.1% 102.7% SYGMA..................... 12.1 1.7 11.2 1.9 11.4 2.1 Other..................... 8.1 5.4 7.7 4.1 7.3 4.4 Intersegment sales........

(6.1) (7.2) (9.2) Total..................... 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Broadline Segment Broadline segment sales increased 10.4% in fiscal 2004 and 12.1% in fiscal 2003 over the prior years. Acquisitions contributed 0.2% to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2004 and 5.6% in fiscal 2003. The fiscal 2004 sales growth was due to increased sales to marketing associate served customers and multi unit customers, including increased sales of SYSCO Brand products, and price increases resulting from higher product costs. The additional week also contributed to the sales growth in fiscal 2004. The fiscal 2003 sales growth was due primarily to increased sales to marketing associate served and multi unit customers, including increased sales of SYSCO Brand products, as well as the acquisition of a Canadian broadline foodservice operation. The sales growth in both years was obtained through increased sales to the existing customer base as well as the acquisition of new customers. Broadline segment sales as a percentage of total SYSCO sales were 80.9% in fiscal 2004, 82.2% in fiscal 2003 and 82.1% in fiscal 2002. The decrease in fiscal 2004 was due primarily to strong sales growth in the custom cut meat, SYGMA and lodging industry product segments outpacing the broadline sales growth, as well as the acquisition of the Asian cuisine foodservice operations during fiscal 2003. The increase in fiscal 2003 was due primarily to the acquisition of a Canadian broadline foodservice operation. Marketing associate served sales as a percentage of broadline sales in the U.S. decreased to 54.3% in fiscal 2004 as compared to 54.6% in fiscal 2003. The decrease in fiscal 2004 was due to the rate of sales increase to multi unit customers exceeding the rate of sales increase to marketing associate served customers. The growth in sales to multi unit customers was fueled by increased sales to existing locations and the addition of new locations. SYSCO Brand sales as a percentage of broadline sales in the U.S. increased to 49.1% for fiscal 2004 as compared to 48.7% in fiscal 2003. Earnings before income taxes for the Broadline segment increased 14.4% in fiscal 2004 and 12.8% in fiscal 2003 over the prior years. The increase in earnings before income taxes for fiscal year 2004 was primarily due to increased sales and reduced expenses as a percentage of sales, which more than offset reduced margins as a 17 percentage of sales. Reduced expenses as a percentage of sales is attributable to several factors including improved operating efficiencies. The decrease in margins and expenses as a percentage of sales was also impacted by increases in product costs and the resulting increase in the average sales price per item. The additional week also contributed to the earnings growth in fiscal 2004. The increases in earnings before income taxes for fiscal years 2003 and 2002 were primarily due to increases in sales and lower expenses as a percentage of sales. SYGMA Segment SYGMA segment sales increased 21.7% in fiscal 2004 and 9.2% in fiscal 2003 over the prior years. Acquisitions contributed 1.9% to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2004 and 2.8% in fiscal 2003. The fiscal 2004 sales growth was due primarily to sales to new customers, sales growth in SYGMAs existing customer base related to new locations added by those customers, as well as increases in sales to existing locations, price increases resulting from higher product costs and sales from acquisitions. The additional week also contributed to the sales growth in fiscal 2004. The fiscal 2003 sales growth was primarily due to sales growth in SYGMAs existing customer base as well as the acquisition of two quickservice operations. SYGMA segment sales as a percentage of total SYSCO sales were 12.1% in fiscal 2004, 11.2% in fiscal 2003 and 11.4% in fiscal 2002. Earnings before income taxes for the SYGMA segment increased 7.2% in fiscal 2004 and 3.4% in fiscal 2003 over the prior years. The increase in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to the increased sales offset by increased expenses incurred related to implementation of new systems, severance payments related to certain personnel changes, costs related to workers compensation insurance claims and pension costs. The additional week also contributed to the earnings growth in fiscal 2004. The increase in fiscal 2003 was primarily due to increased sales. During fiscal 2004 and continuing in the first quarter of fiscal 2005, SYGMA is discontinuing servicing a portion of its largest customers locations due to that customers geographic supply chain realignment. SYGMA expects to offset these lost sales by obtaining sales from additional locations from this customer and obtaining new business from other customers. In many cases, this new business will be served out of different SYGMA locations than those that served the business that was discontinued. As a result, during fiscal 2004, SYGMA incurred additional expenses including severance payments and equipment moving costs as it transitioned its operations to serve these new customers. SYGMA expects to incur similar expenses during the first and second quarter of fiscal 2005 as it continues to transition to serve these new customers. Any net lost sales and the related additional expenses are not expected to be material to SYSCO overall, and we expect SYGMA to continue to be a profitable segment. Other Segments Other segment sales increased 19.0% in fiscal 2004 and 17.3% in fiscal 2003 over the prior years. Acquisitions contributed 6.2% to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2004 and 4.9% in fiscal 2003. The increase in fiscal 2004 was primarily attributable to increased sales to the existing customer base, sales to new customers, price increases resulting from higher product costs and sales from acquisitions. The additional week also contributed to the sales growth in fiscal 2004. The increase in fiscal 2003 was primarily attributable to sales growth in our custom meat cutting operations as well as the timing of acquisitions made during the year. Other segment sales as a percentage of total SYSCO sales were 8.1% in fiscal 2004, 7.7% in fiscal 2003 and 7.3% in fiscal 2002. Earnings before income taxes for the Other segment increased 55.4% in fiscal 2004 and 4.8% in fiscal 2003 over the prior years. The increase in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to increases in sales, acquisitions and reduced expenses as a percentage of sales, which more than offset reduced gross margins as a percentage of sales. The additional week also contributed to the earnings growth in fiscal 2004. The increase in fiscal 2003 was due primarily to acquisitions, increased earnings from increased gross margins and operating efficiencies at our specialty produce operations, and increased earnings from increased sales and gross margins at the companys specialty lodging industry products operations. These were offset by expenses incurred on a start up operation supplying the health care industry and decreased earnings at the companys specialty meat cutting operations. 18 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES SYSCO provides marketing and distribution services to foodservice customers primarily throughout the United States and Canada. The company intends to continue to expand its market share through profitable sales growth, foldouts and acquisitions. The company also strives to increase the effectiveness of its marketing associates, its consolidated buying programs and the productivity of its warehousing and distribution activities. These objectives require continuing investment. SYSCOs resources include cash provided by operations and access to capital from financial markets. SYSCOs operations historically have produced significant cash flow. Cash generated from operations is first allocated to working capital requirements; investments in facilities, fleet and other equipment required to meet customers needs; cash dividends; and acquisitions compatible with the companys overall growth strategy. Any remaining cash generated from operations may, at the discretion of management, be applied toward a portion of the cost of the share repurchase program, while the remainder of the cost may be financed with additional long term debt. SYSCOs share repurchase program is used primarily to offset shares issued under various employee benefit and compensation plans, for acquisitions, to reduce shares outstanding, which may have the net effect of increasing earnings per share, and to aid in managing the ratio of long term debt to total capitalization. Management targets a long term debt to total capitalization ratio between 35% and 40%. The ratio may exceed the target range from time to time, due to borrowings incurred in order to fund acquisitions and internal growth opportunities, and due to fluctuations in the timing and amount of share repurchases. The ratio also may fall below the target range due to strong cash flow from operations and fluctuations in the timing and amount of share repurchases. This ratio was 32.4% and 36.2% at July 3, 2004 and June 28, 2003, respectively. The reversal of a portion of the minimum pension liability adjustments in other comprehensive income contributed to the decrease in the ratio at July 3, 2004. The company generated net cash from operations of $1,189,522,000 in fiscal 2004, $1,372,840,000 in fiscal 2003, and $1,084,980,000 in fiscal 2002. Several factors contributed to the decrease in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2004. During the second quarter of fiscal 2002, the company began reorganizing its supply chain to maximize consolidated efficiencies and increase the effectiveness of the merchandising and procurement functions performed for the benefit of customers. The structure results in the deferral of certain federal and state income tax payments, as supply chain distributions are not included in taxable income until distributed in periods subsequent to when they are recognized in book income. Fiscal 2004 is the first period that supply chain distributions were included in taxable income since the company began deferring these items for tax purposes in fiscal 2002. As a result of the impact of these items and other temporary differences, including the utilization of U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards, excess tax depreciation and pension contributions, taxes paid during fiscal 2004 increased to $344,414,000 as compared to $28,747,000 in fiscal 2003. The company expects the net cash flow impact of deferrals in fiscal 2005 and beyond to be incrementally positive when compared to what would have been paid on an annual basis without the deferral, due to the companys belief that its volume through the new structure will continue to grow. Cash flow from operations for fiscal 2004 was negatively impacted by increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances, partially offset by increases in accounts payable balances and increases in accrued expenses and other liabilities. Increased sales volumes over the prior periods partially contributed to the increase in accounts receivable balances. SYSCO has also experienced sales increases with multi unit customers that have outpaced the sales increases from marketing associate served customers. Multi unit customers payment terms are traditionally longer than the SYSCO average. Inventory levels also increased over prior year levels, partially due to the increased sales volumes. In addition, inventory levels at the end of fiscal 2004, measured as a function of average days sales outstanding, exceeded the levels at the end of fiscal 2003, which in turn were lower than those at the end of fiscal 2002. This relative increase in inventory levels negatively impacted cash flow from operations for fiscal 2004. The increase in accounts payable balances was partially due to the increased inventory balances but was also negatively impacted by decreases in accounts payable days outstanding over the prior periods. A significant reason for the decrease in accrued expenses and other long term liabilities in fiscal 2003 was the increase in pension contributions from $83,136,000 in fiscal 2002 to $164,565,000 in fiscal 2003. Pension contributions in fiscal 2004 were $165,512,000. The company anticipates pension contributions in fiscal 2005 will be approximately $86,294,000. 19 Cash used for investing activities was $683,811,000 in fiscal 2004, $681,825,000 in fiscal 2003, and $662,300,000 in fiscal 2002. Expenditures for facilities, fleet and other equipment were $530,086,000 in fiscal 2004, $435,637,000 in fiscal 2003, and $416,393,000 in fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2004 capital expenditures included the construction of fold out facilities in Oxnard, California and Fargo, North Dakota, replacement or significant expansion of facilities in Billings, Montana; Cleveland, Ohio; Jacksonville, Florida; Miami, Florida; and San Antonio, Texas, and continued expenditures related to the National Supply Chain project. The capital expenditures in fiscal 2003 included the construction of fold out facilities in Las Vegas, Nevada and Oxnard, California, replacement facilities in Cleveland, Ohio; Dallas, Texas; and Miami, Florida and the Northeast Redistribution Center in Front Royal, Virginia (first phase of the National Supply Chain project). Fiscal 2002 expenditures included construction of fold out facilities located in Sacramento, California; Columbia, South Carolina; and Las Vegas, Nevada, as well as costs incurred on the construction or expansion of facilities in Dallas, Texas; Norman, Oklahoma; Baraboo, Wisconsin; and Jersey City, New Jersey. Total expenditures in fiscal 2005 are expected to decrease slightly to the range of $475,000,000 to $500,000,000 due to completion of several major replacements and fold outs in fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2005 expenditures will include the continuation of the fold out program; facility, fleet and other equipment replacements and expansions; the companys National Supply Chain project; and investments in technology. Cash expenditures for acquisitions of businesses were $79,247,000 in fiscal 2004, $209,010,000 in fiscal 2003 and $234,618,000 in fiscal 2002. The National Supply Chain project is expected to create a more efficient and effective supply chain infrastructure for SYSCO, its suppliers and its customers. The project entails the implementation of regional distribution centers, which will aggregate inventory demand to optimize the supply chain activities for certain products from all SYSCO operating companies in the region. The project is expected to achieve lower costs of inventory, transportation, product handling and transaction processing in addition to lowering working capital and future facility expansion needs at the operating companies. The Northeast Redistribution Center is expected to be operational in the third quarter of fiscal 2005. The center will receive and distribute food and food related products to SYSCO operating companies in the Northeast, creating benefits for customers and suppliers, as well as for SYSCO. Fiscal 2004 capital expenditures related to the National Supply Chain project were $107,822,000, bringing the total amount of capital expenditures on the project since inception to $152,254,000. Cash used for financing activities was $641,851,000 in fiscal 2004, $550,528,000 in fiscal 2003, and $359,984,000 in fiscal 2002. In July 2002, the Board authorized the repurchase of an additional 20,000,000 shares, which was completed during fiscal 2004. In September 2003, the Board authorized the repurchase of an additional 20,000,000 shares. The number of shares acquired and their cost during the past three fiscal years was 16,454,300 shares for $608,506,000 in fiscal 2004, 16,500,000 shares for $478,471,000 in fiscal 2003, and 18,000,000 shares for $473,558,000 in fiscal 2002. An additional 670,000 shares have been purchased at a cost of $22,770,000 through August 20, 2004, resulting in 11,938,900 shares remaining available for repurchase as authorized by the Board as of that date. Dividends paid were $309,540,000 in fiscal 2004, $261,854,000 in fiscal 2003, and $213,275,000 in fiscal 2002. SYSCO began paying the current quarterly dividend rate of $0.13 per share in January 2004, an increase from the $0.11 per share that became effective in January 2003. In May 2004, SYSCO declared its regular quarterly dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 of $0.13 per share, which was paid in July 2004. In September 2004, SYSCO also declared its regular quarterly dividend for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 of $0.13 per share, payable in October 2004. In November 2000, the company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement covering 30,000,000 shares of common stock to be offered from time to time in connection with acquisitions. As of August 20, 2004, 29,447,835 shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement. In June 1998, the company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement covering $500,000,000 in debt securities. As of August 20, 2004, there was $425,000,000 in principal amount outstanding under the registration statement, leaving $75,000,000 available for issuance. 20 In March 2004, SYSCO issued 4.60% notes totaling $200,000,000 due March 15, 2014 in a private offering. Proceeds from the notes were utilized to retire commercial paper borrowings. The fixed rate of interest on these notes was effectively converted to variable rates of interest through the interest rate swap agreements entered into in April and May of 2004. SYSCO has uncommitted bank lines of credit, which provided for unsecured borrowings for working capital of up to $95,000,000, of which none was outstanding as of July 3, 2004 and $17,000,000 was outstanding as of August 20, 2004. SYSCO has a commercial paper program in the United States which is supported by a bank credit facility in the amount of $450,000,000, maturing in fiscal 2008. SYSCO also has a commercial paper program in Canada which is supported by a bank credit facility in the amount of CAD $100,000,000, maturing in fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, aggregate commercial paper and short term bank borrowings ranged from approximately $73,102,000 to $478,114,000, $55,813,000 to $495,703,000, and $51,472,000 to $538,362,000, respectively. Commercial paper borrowings were $73,834,000 as of July 3, 2004 and $48,503,000 as of August 20, 2004. The company intends to settle outstanding commercial paper borrowings when they come due by issuing additional debt or retiring them utilizing cash generated from operations. Total debt at July 3, 2004 was $1,468,160,000, of which approximately 60% was at fixed rates averaging 5.2% and the remainder was at floating rates averaging 4.0%, as adjusted for the effect of the interest rate swaps outstanding as of July 3, 2004. SYSCO continues to have borrowing capacity available and alternative financing arrangements are evaluated as appropriate. As part of normal business activities, SYSCO issues letters of credit through major banking institutions as required by certain vendor and insurance agreements. As of July 3, 2004 and June 28, 2003, letters of credit outstanding were $11,001,000 and $14,610,000, respectively. In summary, SYSCO believes that through continual monitoring and management of assets, together with the availability of additional capital in the financial markets, it will meet its cash requirements while maintaining proper liquidity for normal operating purposes. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table sets forth certain information concerning SYSCOs obligations and commitments to make contractual future payments: PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD TOTAL OVER OBLIGATIONS 0 1 YEAR 1 3 YEARS 3 5 YEARS 5 YEARS (IN THOUSANDS) Short term debt and commercial paper.... $ 73,834 $ 73,834 $ $ $ Long term debt.......................... 1,363,193 157,845 511,738 3,578 690,032 Capital lease obligations............... 31,133 4,988 5,936 1,756 18,453 Long term non capitalized leases........ 257,083 56,750 80,934 43,854 75,545 Deferred compensation................... 73,159 4,383 9,405 7,174 52,197 Purchase obligations.................... 637,179 637,179 Total contractual cash obligations...... $2,435,581 $934,979 $608,013 $56,362 $836,227 The estimate of the timing of future payments under the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan involves the use of certain assumptions, including retirement ages and payout periods. For purposes of this table, purchase obligations include agreements for purchases of product in the normal course of business, for which all significant terms have been confirmed. Such amounts included in the table above are based on estimates. Certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration, typically payable only in the event that certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved. Aggregate contingent 21 consideration amounts outstanding as of July 3, 2004 included approximately 1,273,000 shares of SYSCOs common stock and $61,614,000 in cash. These amounts are not included in the table above. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements. Significant accounting policies employed by SYSCO are presented in the notes to the financial statements. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations. These policies require managements most subjective or complex judgments, often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Senior management has reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates and this related disclosure. SYSCOs most critical accounting policies pertain to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, self insurance programs, pension plans and accounting for business combinations. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts SYSCO evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and determines the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors. In circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligation, a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected. In addition, allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on analysis of historical trends of write offs and recoveries. The company utilizes specific criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be written off, including bankruptcy, accounts referred to outside parties for collection and accounts past due over specified periods. If the financial condition of SYSCOs customers were to deteriorate, additional allowances may be required. Self Insurance Program SYSCO maintains a self insurance program covering portions of workers compensation, group medical, general liability and vehicle liability costs. The amounts in excess of the self insured levels are fully insured by third party insurers. Liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. In an attempt to mitigate the risks of workers compensation, vehicle and general liability claims, safety procedures and awareness programs have been implemented. Pension Plans SYSCO maintains defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans for its employees. The company also contributes to various multi employer plans under collective bargaining agreements. SYSCO maintains a qualified retirement plan (Retirement Plan) for its employees which pays benefits to employees at retirement, using formulas based on a participants years of service and compensation. SYSCO also maintains a non qualified, unfunded Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) which provides additional retirement benefits to certain key employees. In order to meet its obligations under the SERP, the company maintains life insurance policies on the lives of participants. SYSCO is the sole owner and beneficiary of such policies, which are excluded from plan assets in arriving at prepaid (accrued) benefit cost. Cash surrender values of such policies were $87,104,000 at July 3, 2004 and $74,730,000 at June 28, 2003. SYSCO accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions," as amended by SFAS No. 132, "Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits an amendment 22 of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, and 106." These statements require that the amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. Three of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits, the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets. For guidance in determining the discount rate, SYSCO refers to rates of return on high quality fixed income investments, including, among other items, Moodys long term AA corporate bond yields. The discount rate utilized by SYSCO was 6.25% and 6.00% as of July 3, 2004 and June 28, 2003, respectively. The discount rate assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate, as it was at July 3, 2004, when the discount rate was increased to 6.25% from 6.00% and at June 28, 2003 when the discount rate was reduced to 6.00% from 7.25%. The discount rate assumption utilized impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs. The 1.25% decrease in the discount rate used at June 28, 2003 increased SYSCOs net pension costs for fiscal 2004 by approximately $37,000,000. The increase in the discount rate of 0.25% at July 3, 2004 will decrease SYSCOs net pension costs for fiscal 2005 by approximately $9,500,000. SYSCO looks to actual plan experience in determining the rates of increase in compensation levels. SYSCO used a plan specific age related set of rates (equivalent to a single rate of 5.89%) for the Retirement Plan, as of July 3, 2004 and June 28, 2003. The SERP assumes annual salary increases of 10% through fiscal 2007 and 7% thereafter as of July 3, 2004 and annual salary increases of 8% through fiscal 2005 and 7% thereafter as of June 28, 2003. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets of the Retirement Plan was 9.00% and 9.50% as of July 3, 2004 and June 28, 2003, respectively. The expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns, reflecting a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and the forward looking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on long term bonds and the historical returns of the major stock markets. Although not determinative of future returns, the effective annual rate of return on plan assets, developed using geometric/compound averaging, was approximately 10.6%, 8.5%, 3.6% and 21.9% over the 20 year, 10 year, 5 year and 1 year periods ended December 31, 2003, respectively. In addition, in nine of the last fifteen years, the actual return on plan assets has exceeded 9.00%. The rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate, as it was for fiscal 2004 when the expected return was reduced to 9.00% from 9.50%. The expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs. The 0.50% decrease in the assumed rate of return in fiscal 2004 increased SYSCOs net pension costs for fiscal 2004 by approximately $3,400,000. A 1.0% increase (decrease) in the assumed rate of return for fiscal 2005 would decrease (increase) SYSCOs net pension costs for fiscal 2005 by approximately $9,200,000. Minimum pension liability adjustments are recorded so that the recorded pension liability is at least equal to the accumulated benefit obligation. Minimum pension liability adjustments are non cash adjustments that are reflected as an increase (or decrease) in the pension liability and an offsetting charge to shareholders equity, net of tax, through comprehensive income (or loss). During fiscal 2004, a minimum pension liability adjustment of $266,075,000 was recorded as a debit to the companys net pension balance as of July 3, 2004. Of this adjustment, $267,535,000 was recorded to reverse all minimum pension liability adjustments recorded in prior years related to the Retirement Plan. At July 3, 2004, the fair value of plan assets of the Retirement Plan exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation, eliminating the need for a minimum pension liability adjustment. The change in the companys funded position related to the Retirement Plan was due primarily to the better than expected return on plan assets in fiscal 2004 of approximately $111,127,000 as compared to an expected return of approximately $61,148,000, voluntary contribution to the qualified pension trust in fiscal 2004 of $160,000,000 and the increase in the discount rate at July 3, 2004 to 6.25%. At July 3, 2004, the accumulated benefit obligation of the SERP continued to exceed the fair value of plan assets and required an additional minimum pension liability adjustment of $1,460,000 during fiscal 2004 to increase the accrued pension cost related to the SERP. 23 During fiscal 2003, a minimum pension liability adjustment of $193,819,000 was recorded as a credit to the companys net pension balance as of June 28, 2003. This adjustment was due to the companys accumulated benefit obligations exceeding the fair value of plan assets for both the Retirement Plan and the SERP and was due to lower than expected returns on plan assets and the decrease in the discount rate at June 28, 2003 to 6.00%. Amounts reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to minimum pension liability, net of tax, were ($20,733,000) as of July 3, 2004, and ($185,118,000) as of June 28, 2003. The companys prepaid pension cost prior to the recognition of the additional minimum pension liability was $142,620,000 and $91,340,000 at July 3, 2004 and June 28, 2003, respectively. Included in arriving at accrued benefit cost as of July 3, 2004 and June 28, 2003, respectively, are $454,468,000 and $493,829,000 in deferred net actuarial losses resulting from the variance of actual experience from that projected by actuarial assumptions. A portion of this unrecognized loss is amortized and recognized in accordance with SFAS No. 87 in net pension costs over time. The company recognized net pension costs of $114,232,000, net of an expected asset return of $61,148,000, $74,288,000, net of an expected asset return of $46,462,000, and $51,336,000, net of an expected asset return of $43,053,000 for fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Changes in the assumptions together with the normal growth of the plan and the impact of actuarial losses from prior periods, increased net pension costs $39,944,000 in fiscal 2004 and is expected to decrease net pension costs in fiscal 2005 by approximately $7,374,000. The company made cash contributions to its pension plans of $165,512,000 and $164,565,000 in fiscal years 2004 and 2003, respectively, including voluntary contributions to the Retirement Plan of $160,000,000 in each of fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2005, as in the previous years, contributions to the Retirement Plan will not be required to meet ERISA minimum funding requirements but the company anticipates that it will make voluntary contributions of approximately $80,000,000. The estimated fiscal 2005 contributions to fund benefit payments for the SERP and other post retirement plans are $6,294,000 and $362,000, respectively. Accounting for Business Combinations Goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired. Certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired, including goodwill and other intangible assets, as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit. In addition, SYSCO assesses the recoverability of these intangibles by determining whether the fair values of the applicable reporting units exceed their carrying values. The evaluation of fair value requires the use of projections, estimates and assumptions as to the future performance of the operations in performing a discounted cash flow analysis, as well as assumptions regarding sales and earnings multiples that would be applied in comparable acquisitions in the industry. Actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections, resulting in the company revising its assumptions and, if required, recognizing an impairment loss. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS SYSCO adopted the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00 21, "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables," effective at the beginning of fiscal 2004. EITF 00 21 addresses how to account for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and provides guidance relating to when such arrangements should be divided into components for revenue recognition purposes. The adoption of this consensus did not have a material impact on SYSCOs consolidated financial statements. SYSCO adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51," effective at the beginning of fiscal 2004. This interpretation introduces a new consolidation model, the variable interests model, which determines control (and consolidation) based on potential variability in gains and losses of the entity being 24 evaluated for consolidation. The adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on SYSCOs consolidated financial statements. SYSCO adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity," effective at the beginning of fiscal 2004. SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on SYSCOs consolidated financial statements. SYSCO adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003), "Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits," in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. The standard requires that companies provide additional financial statement disclosures for defined benefit plans in annual and interim financial statements, which are found under the discussion of "Employee Benefit Plans" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In March 2004, the FASB issued an Exposure Draft, "Share Based Payment, an Amendment of Statements No. 123 and 95." The proposed change in accounting would replace existing requirements under SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation" and APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." Under the proposal, all forms of share based payments to employees, including employee stock options, would be expensed, recognizing the cost in the income statement. The expense of each award would generally be measured at fair value at the grant date. As proposed, SYSCO would have to adopt the new statement beginning in Fiscal 2006. The adoption of this proposed standard is expected to have a material impact on SYSCOs consolidated financial statements, as the company currently accounts for its stock compensation plans using the intrinsic value method provided by APB No. 25 and thus has not recorded any compensation expense with respect to stock option grants to date. RISK FACTORS Low Margin Business; Inflation and Economic Sensitivity The foodservice distribution industry is characterized by relatively high inventory turnover with relatively low profit margins. SYSCO makes a significant portion of its sales at prices that are based on the cost of products it sells plus a percentage markup. As a result, SYSCOs profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of product cost deflation, even though SYSCOs gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant. Prolonged periods of product cost inflation may also have a negative impact on the companys profit margins and earnings to the extent such product cost increases are not passed on to customers due to resistance to higher prices. The foodservice industry is sensitive to national and regional economic conditions. Inflation, fuel costs and other factors affecting consumer confidence and the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home may negatively impact SYSCOs sales and operating results. SYSCOs operating results are also sensitive to, and may be adversely affected by, other factors, including difficulties with the collectability of accounts receivable, competitive price pressures, severe weather conditions and unexpected increases in fuel or other transportation related costs. Although these factors have not had a material adverse impact on SYSCOs past operations, there can be no assurance that one or more of these factors will not adversely affect future operating results. Leverage and Debt Service Because historically a substantial part of SYSCOs growth has been the result of acquisitions and capital expansion, SYSCOs continued growth depends, in large part, on its ability to continue this expansion. As a result, its inability to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures through borrowed funds could restrict its ability to expand. Moreover, any default under the documents governing the indebtedness of SYSCO could have a significant adverse effect on the market value of SYSCOs common stock. Further, SYSCOs leveraged position may also increase its vulnerability to competitive pressures. 25 Product Liability Claims SYSCO, like any other seller of food, faces the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of products sold by the company causes injury or illness. With respect to product liability claims, SYSCO believes it has sufficient primary or excess umbrella liability insurance. However, this insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost, or, if available, may not be adequate to cover all of SYSCOs liabilities. SYSCO generally seeks contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying its products, but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited, as a practical matter, to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers. If SYSCO does not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available, product liability relating to defective products could materially reduce SYSCOs net earnings and earnings per share. Interruption of Supplies SYSCO obtains substantially all of its foodservice and related products from third party suppliers. For the most part, SYSCO does not have long term contracts with its suppliers committing them to provide products to SYSCO. Although SYSCOs purchasing volume can provide leverage when dealing with suppliers, suppliers may not provide the foodservice products and supplies needed by SYSCO in the quantities requested. Because SYSCO does not control the actual production of the products it sells, it is also subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside its control. These conditions include job actions or strikes by employees of suppliers, weather, crop conditions, transportation interruptions, and natural disasters or other catastrophic events. SYSCOs inability to obtain adequate supplies of its foodservice and related products as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise, could mean that SYSCO could not fulfill its obligations to customers, and customers may turn to other distributors. Labor Relations As of July 3, 2004, approximately 9,100 employees at 51 operating companies were members of 59 different local unions associated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and other labor organizations. In fiscal 2005, 12 agreements covering approximately 1,900 employees will expire. Failure of the operating companies to effectively renegotiate these contracts could result in work stoppages. Although SYSCOs operating subsidiaries have not experienced any significant labor disputes or work stoppages to date, and SYSCO believes they have satisfactory relationships with their unions, a work stoppage due to failure of one or more operating subsidiaries to renegotiate a union contract, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on SYSCO. Integration of Acquired Companies If SYSCO is unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, its profitability may decrease. Integration of an acquired business may be more difficult when SYSCO acquires a business in a market in which it has limited or no expertise, or with a corporate culture different from SYSCOs. If SYSCO is unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully, it may incur substantial costs and delays in increasing its customer base. In addition, the failure to integrate acquisitions successfully may divert managements attention from SYSCOs existing business and may damage SYSCOs relationships with its key customers and suppliers. Charter and Stockholder Rights Plan Under its Restated Certificate of Incorporation, SYSCOs Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to 1.5 million shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval. Issuance of these shares could make it more difficult for anyone to acquire SYSCO without approval of the Board of Directors, depending on the rights and preferences of the stock issued. In addition, if anyone attempts to acquire SYSCO without approval of the Board of Directors of SYSCO, the stockholders of SYSCO have the right to purchase preferred stock of SYSCO pursuant to its Stockholder Rights Plan, which could result in substantial dilution to a potential 26 acquiror. The existence of either of these provisions could deter hostile takeover attempts that might result in an acquisition of SYSCO that could otherwise have been financially beneficial to SYSCOs stockholders. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements made herein that look forward in time or express managements expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future events are forward looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. They include statements about SYSCOs ability to increase its market share and sales, long term debt to capitalization target ratios, anticipated capital expenditures, timing and expected benefits of the National Supply Chain initiative and related regional distribution centers, and SYSCOs ability to meet future cash requirements and remain profitable. These statements are based on managements current expectations and estimates; actual results may differ materially due in part to the risk factors discussed above. In addition, SYSCOs ability to increase its market share and sales, meet future cash requirements and remain profitable could be affected by conditions in the economy and the industry and internal factors such as the ability to control expenses. The ability to meet long term debt to capitalization target ratios may also be affected by share repurchases, cash flow, acquisitions and internal growth. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK SYSCO does not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes. SYSCOs use of debt directly exposes the company to interest rate risk. Floating rate debt, where the interest rate fluctuates periodically, exposes the company to short term changes in market interest rates. Fixed rate debt, where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument, exposes the company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate. SYSCO manages its debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that goal. The major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments, potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions. At July 3, 2004, the company had outstanding $73,834,000 of commercial paper at variable rates of interest with maturities through October 7, 2004. The companys total long term debt obligations of $1,394,326,000 were primarily at fixed rates of interest.
