Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Highlights Sales increased 3.2% in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2005 included 52 weeks, as compared to fiscal 2004 which included an additional 53rd week. After adjusting for the additional week in fiscal 2004, sales increased 5.3% in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 adjusted sales (See the reconciliation of fiscal 2004 actual sales to fiscal 2004 adjusted sales in Sales under Results of Operations). Gross margins as a percent of sales for fiscal 2005 decreased from the prior year due to the impact of product cost increases and changes in customer mix and segment mix. Operating expenses as a percent of sales for fiscal 2005 decreased from the prior year due to operating efficiencies, operating costs increasing at lower rates than sales price increases, reduced performance based management incentive compensation and decreased net pension costs, which overcame increased fuel costs and increased expenses incurred on the National Supply Chain project. The income tax provision in fiscal 2005 includes a tax benefit of $8.5 million primarily related to the reversal of valuation allowances previously recorded on certain state net operating loss carryforwards and a tax benefit of $11 million related to the reversal of a tax contingency accrual. The comparison of fiscal 2005s net earnings to fiscal 2004 was also negatively impacted by the additional 53rd week in fiscal 2004. Primarily as a result of these factors, net earnings for fiscal 2005 increased 6.0% over the prior year. Management believes that prolonged periods of rising product costs, together with general economic conditions, including the impact of increased fuel costs on consumer spending, contributed to a softness in the foodservice market and thus a slowing of SYSCOs sales growth beginning in the latter half of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and continuing into the first half of fiscal 2005. After adjusting for the additional week in last years fourth quarter, sales growth remained relatively stable over the course of fiscal 2005. Management believes that the declining rate of product cost increases over the course of fiscal 2005 has lessened the overall gross margin pressures experienced during the year and has contributed to the underlying unit growth experienced in the latter half of fiscal 2005. Additionally, management believes that the maturation of the companys business review process has contributed to unit sales growth. The company continues to focus on customer account penetration and expense controls, including managing personnel expenses, improving productivity and ongoing benchmarking and sharing of best practices at the operating companies. Overview SYSCO distributes food and related products to restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments and other foodservice customers. SYSCOs operations are located throughout the United States and Canada and include broadline companies, specialty produce companies, custom cut meat operations, Asian cuisine foodservice operations, hotel supply operations, and SYGMA, the companys chain restaurant distribution subsidiary. The company estimates that it serves about 14% of an approximately $210 billion annual market that includes the North American foodservice and hotel amenity, furniture and textile markets. According to industry sources, the foodservice, or food prepared away from home, market represents approximately one half of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level. This share grew from about 37% in 1972 to its current level in 1998. General economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home and in turn can impact SYSCOs sales. SYSCO historically has grown at a faster rate than the overall industry and has grown its market share in this fragmented industry. The company intends to continue to expand its market share and grow earnings through strategies which include: Sales growth: The company plans to grow sales by gaining an increased share of products purchased by existing customers, development of new customers, the use of foldouts (new operating companies created in established markets previously served by other SYSCO operating companies) and a disciplined acquisition program. The company uses market information to estimate the potential sales and profitability of new and existing customers. Marketing resources, SYSCO Brand products and value added services provided by SYSCO can be custom tailored to the purchasing needs of customers. Additionally, the investment of resources in any particular account can be made in proportion to the accounts potential profitability. Brand management: SYSCO Brand products are manufactured by suppliers to meet SYSCOs product specifications using strict quality assurance standards. SYSCO believes that SYSCO Brand products generally provide higher profitability than national brand products to SYSCO. SYSCO believes that SYSCO Brand products also provide a greater value to SYSCOs customers and differentiate SYSCO from its customers. 9 Table of Contents Productivity gains: The companys investment in warehousing and transportation technology and the implementation of best business practices allows SYSCO to leverage operating expenses relative to sales growth. Sales force effectiveness: The company invests in the development and expansion of its customer contact resources by hiring additional customer contact personnel through targeted recruiting, hiring and promotion practices, effective use of training programs and improved compensation systems. Expanded business review and business development functions allow the sales force to strengthen customer relationships and increase sales. Supply chain management: The companys National Supply Chain project and related organization is being developed to reduce total supply chain costs, operating costs and working capital requirements of the company. The companys National Supply Chain project is intended to optimize the supply chain activities for products for SYSCOs operating companies in each respective region and as a result, increase profitability and lower inventory and operating costs, working capital requirements and future facility expansion needs at SYSCOs operating companies while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers. The company expects to build from seven to nine regional distribution centers in the United States over the next seven years. The first of these centers, the Northeast Redistribution Center located in Front Royal, Virginia, opened during the third quarter of fiscal 2005. As of August 2005, it was supplying products to 12 of the 14 broadline operating companies in the Northeast Region and is expected to be shipping products to the remaining two operating companies in the Northeast Region by October 2005. The company expects to begin construction of its second regional redistribution facility, to be located in Alachua, Florida, in fiscal 2006. The expenses related to the National Supply Chain project in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 are expected to be approximately equal to expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 or about $15 million. During the first half of fiscal 2006, the ramp up phase of the Northeast Redistribution Center will be completed. It is anticipated that the majority of benefits that will be realized in fiscal 2006 from the Northeast Redistribution Center will be realized during the second half of fiscal 2006 as this is when the Northeast Redistribution Center is expected to be operating at full volume. Hurricane Katrina Hurricane Katrina principally impacted our operating companies in Jackson, Mississippi and New Orleans, Louisiana as well as causing many of our customers in the New Orleans and Mississippi Gulf Coast area to be closed. The impacted operations in Jackson have recovered and service to customers has been restored. SYSCOs facility in New Orleans sustained only minor damage from the storm but remained closed after the storm due to conditions in New Orleans. The facility has recently resumed partial operations; however, most of the orders received from customers of the New Orleans facility that are open for business have been temporarily rerouted to other nearby SYSCO facilities for fulfillment and delivery until the New Orleans facility has been restored to full capacity. We are still assessing the impact of Hurricane Katrina on our operations in the areas affected by the storm; however, we do not expect this occurrence to have a material adverse effect on SYSCOs financial position or fiscal 2006s operating results as a whole. 10 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth the components of the Results of Operations expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated: 2005 2004 2003 Sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Costs and Expenses Cost of sales 80.9 80.7 80.3 Operating expenses 13.9 14.1 14.7 Interest expense 0.2 0.2 0.2 Other, net 0.0 0.0 0.0 Total costs and expenses 95.0 95.0 95.2 Earnings before income taxes 5.0 5.0 4.8 Income taxes 1.8 1.9 1.8 Net earnings 3.2 % 3.1 % 3.0 % The following table sets forth the change in the components of the Results of Operations expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year: 2005 2004 Sales 3.2 % 12.2 % Costs and Expenses Cost of sales 3.5 12.8 Operating expenses 1.3 7.9 Interest expense 7.3 (3.3 ) Other, net (11.8 ) 48.1 Total costs and expenses 3.2 12.0 Earnings before income taxes 3.4 17.0 Income taxes (0.7 ) 17.8 Net earnings 6.0 % 16.6 % Basic earnings per share 7.1 % 17.5 % Diluted earnings per share 7.3 16.1 Average shares outstanding (1.0 ) (1.2 ) Diluted shares outstanding (1.3 ) 0.1 Sales Sales for fiscal 2005 were 3.2% greater than fiscal 2004, or 5.3% greater after adjusting for the additional week in fiscal 2004. Sales for fiscal 2004 were 12.2% greater than fiscal 2003, or 10.0% greater after adjusting for the additional week in fiscal 2004. Because the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 contained an additional week as compared to fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2003, sales growth for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003 are not directly comparable. In order to provide a more comparable picture of sales growth, management believes that it is appropriate to adjust the sales figures for fiscal 2004 by the estimated impact of the additional week. As a result, sales for fiscal 2004 presented in the table below are adjusted by one fourteenth of total sales for the fourth quarter. Set forth below is a reconciliation of actual sales growth to adjusted sales growth for the periods presented: 2005 2004 2003 (52 Weeks) (53 Weeks) (52 Weeks) Sales for the fiscal year $ 30,281,914,000 $ 29,335,403,000 $ 26,140,337,000 Estimated sales for the additional week 581,358,000 Adjusted sales $ 30,281,914,000 $ 28,754,045,000 $ 26,140,337,000 Actual percentage increase 3.2 % 12.2 % 11.9 % Adjusted percentage increase 5.3 % 10.0 % 11.9 % Acquisitions contributed 0.8% to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2005 and 0.9% for fiscal 2004. SYSCO generally expects to pass product cost increases to its customers; however, the actual amount of inflation reflected as sales price increases is difficult to quantify. Estimated product cost increases were 3.5% during fiscal 2005 as compared to 6.3% during fiscal 2004. Management believes that prolonged periods of rising product costs together with general economic conditions, including the impact of increased fuel costs on consumer spending, contributed to the softness in the foodservice market and thus a slowing of SYSCOs sales growth beginning in the latter half of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and continuing into the first half of fiscal 2005. 11 Table of Contents After adjusting for the additional week in last years fourth quarter, sales growth remained relatively stable over the course of fiscal 2005. Management believes that the declining rate of product cost increases over the course of fiscal 2005 has lessened the overall gross margin pressures experienced during the year and has contributed to the underlying unit growth in the latter half of fiscal 2005. Additionally, management believes that the maturation of the companys business review process has contributed to unit sales growth. The company also continues its focus on profitable sales growth. One part of this strategy involves being more selective with respect to which customers we serve, including improving the profitability of, or ultimately exiting, unprofitable customers and refining the use of customer purchasing potential and profitability data in targeting new customers. The company continues to see reductions in sales to unprofitable customers over the comparable prior year periods. In addition, the number of customer contact personnel increased almost 2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 as compared to the number at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2005. The company intends to continue to increase the number of customer contact associates in fiscal 2006. Industry sources estimate the total foodservice market experienced real sales growth of approximately 2.4% in calendar year 2004 and real sales decline of approximately 0.1% in calendar year 2003. A comparison of the sales mix in the principal product categories during the last three years is presented below: 2005 2004 2003 Fresh and frozen meats 19 % 19 % 18 % Canned and dry products 18 18 19 Frozen fruits, vegetables, bakery and other 14 14 14 Poultry 11 11 10 Dairy products 9 9 9 Fresh produce 8 8 8 Paper and disposables 8 8 8 Seafood 5 5 6 Beverage products 3 3 3 Equipment and smallwares 2 2 2 Janitorial products 2 2 2 Medical supplies 1 1 1 100 % 100 % 100 % A comparison of sales by type of customer during the last three years is presented below: 2005 2004 2003 Restaurants 64 % 64 % 63 % Hospitals and nursing homes 10 10 10 Schools and colleges 5 5 6 Hotels and motels 6 6 6 All other 15 15 15 100 % 100 % 100 % Gross Margins Gross margins as a percentage of sales declined in fiscal 2005 when compared to the prior year. Management believes that this gross margin decline was caused by several factors, including product cost increases, changes in segment mix, customer mix and pricing pressure. Product cost increases in most of the product categories had the impact of reducing gross margins as a percentage of sales, as gross profit dollars are earned on a higher sales dollar base. The decline in gross margins as a percent of sales slowed during the course of fiscal 2005 due in part to a lessening of the rate of product cost increases during the fiscal year. Gross margins as a percentage of sales declined in fiscal 2004 when compared to the prior year. Management believes that gross margins as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2004 were impacted by several factors, including product cost increases, changes in customer mix, segment mix and product mix and pricing pressure. Operating Expenses Operating expenses include the costs of warehousing and delivering products as well as selling, administrative and occupancy expenses. Changes in the percentage relationship of operating expenses to sales result from an interplay of several factors, including improved efficiencies, customer mix, and product cost increases which result in increases in sales prices. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was aided by improved operating efficiencies. For example, the Broadline segment continues to demonstrate improving trends in key expense metrics, including miles driven per trip, pieces per stop and pieces per error. Increases in product costs and the resulting increased average sales price per item also favorably impacted expenses as a percentage of sales as operating costs increased at a lower rate. 12 Table of Contents Operating expenses were negatively impacted by increased costs to deliver product to customers due to increased fuel costs of approximately $31,000,000 in fiscal 2005 over the prior year. Operating expenses related to the National Supply Chain project were $46,450,000 in fiscal 2005, as compared to $29,333,000 in fiscal 2004. Also included in operating expenses was the recognition of a gain of $13,803,000 in fiscal 2005 to adjust the carrying value of life insurance assets to their cash surrender value, as compared to a gain of $19,124,000 in fiscal 2004. Operating expenses were favorably impacted by a reduction of management performance based incentive bonuses of $26,989,000 and a decrease in net pension cost of $7,374,000 in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. The decrease in expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 was attributable to several factors including improved operating efficiencies as demonstrated by improving trends in key expense metrics tracked at the broadline operating companies, including pieces sold per delivery, product line items sold per delivery, pieces per trip and pieces per error. Increases in product costs and the resulting increased average sales price per item also favorably impacted expenses as a percentage of sales as operating costs increased at a lower rate. Operating expenses were negatively impacted by increases in net pension costs of $39,944,000 and by increases in expenses related to the National Supply Chain project of $5,584,000 over fiscal 2003. Also included in operating expenses was the recognition of a gain of $19,124,000 in fiscal 2004 to adjust the carrying value of life insurance assets to their cash surrender value, as compared to a loss of $156,000 in fiscal 2003. In order to partially manage the volatility and uncertainty of fuel costs, SYSCO from time to time will enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of SYSCOs projected monthly diesel fuel requirements. Forward diesel fuel purchase commitments outstanding as of July 2, 2005 were not material. Interest Expense The increase in interest expense in fiscal 2005 was due to increased borrowing interest rates. The increase in the companys overall borrowing interest rates was primarily due to an increase in the percentage of the companys debt with fixed interest rates in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2004, the companys debt portfolio included a larger percentage of floating rate debt in the form of either commercial paper issuances or fixed rate debt converted to floating through interest rate swap agreements. In addition, market interest rates have increased during fiscal 2005. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to lower borrowing interest rates offsetting moderately higher borrowing levels. The lower average borrowing rates of the company in fiscal 2004 were due to lower short term market interest rates and the use of interest rate swaps which converted the fixed rates of interest on a portion of SYSCOs long term debt to lower variable rates of interest. Other, Net Changes between the years result from fluctuations in miscellaneous activities, primarily gains and losses on the sale of surplus facilities. Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 36.97% in fiscal 2005, 38.50% in fiscal 2004 and 38.25% in fiscal 2003. The income tax provision in fiscal 2005 includes a tax benefit of $8,500,000 primarily related to the reversal of valuation allowances previously recorded on certain state net operating loss carryforwards and a tax benefit of $11,000,000 related to the reversal of a tax contingency accrual. Net Earnings Fiscal 2005 represents the twenty ninth consecutive year of increased earnings before the cumulative effect of accounting changes. The increases were due to the factors discussed above. In addition, the comparison of fiscal 2005s net earnings to fiscal 2004 was negatively impacted by the additional 53rd week in fiscal 2004. Earnings Per Share The increases in earnings per share were the result of factors discussed above, as well as a net reduction of shares outstanding due primarily to share repurchases. Return on Average Shareholders Equity The return on average shareholders equity was approximately 35% in fiscal 2005, 39% in fiscal 2004 and 36% in fiscal 2003. The higher return in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to the impact of minimum pension liability adjustments to shareholders equity. Since its inception, SYSCO has averaged approximately 20% return on average shareholders equity. 13 Table of Contents Segment Results The following table sets forth the change in the selected financial data of each of the companys reportable segments expressed as a percentage increase over the prior year and should be read in conjunction with Business Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements: 2005 2004 Earnings Earnings Sales Before Taxes Sales Before Taxes Broadline 1.7 % 5.3 % 10.4 % 13.0 % SYGMA 10.4 (28.1 ) 21.7 5.8 Other 8.2 6.6 19.0 53.5 The following table sets forth sales and earnings before taxes of each of the companys reportable segments expressed as a percentage of the respective consolidated total and should be read in conjunction with Business Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements: 2005 2004 2003 Earnings Earnings Earnings Sales Before Taxes Sales Before Taxes Sales Before Taxes Broadline 79.7 % 99.5 % 80.9 % 97.8 % 82.2 % 101.2 % SYGMA 12.9 1.2 12.1 1.7 11.2 1.9 Other 8.5 5.5 8.1 5.3 7.7 4.1 Intersegment sales (1.1 ) (1.1 ) (1.1 ) Unallocated corporate expenses (6.2 ) (4.8 ) (7.2 ) Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Broadline Segment Acquisitions contributed 0.1% to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2005 and 0.2% in fiscal 2004. The fiscal 2005 sales growth was primarily due to increased sales to marketing associate served customers and multi unit customers, including increased sales of SYSCO Brand products and increases in both sales prices and unit volumes. The comparison of fiscal 2005 sales to fiscal 2004 is negatively impacted by the additional week in fiscal 2004. The fiscal 2004 sales growth was due to increased sales to marketing associate served customers and multi unit customers, including increased sales of SYSCO Brand products, and price increases resulting from higher product costs. The additional week also contributed to the sales growth in fiscal 2004. The sales growth in fiscal 2005 and 2004 was obtained through increased sales to the existing customer base as well as the acquisition of new customers. The decrease of Broadline segment sales as a percentage of total SYSCO sales in fiscal 2005 was due primarily to strong sales growth in the SYGMA and other segments outpacing the Broadline sales growth, as well as the contributions to sales growth from the acquisitions of specialty produce and SYGMA operations during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004. The decrease of Broadline segment sales as a percentage of total SYSCO sales in fiscal 2004 was due primarily to strong sales growth in the SYGMA and other segments outpacing the Broadline sales growth, as well as the contribution to sales growth from the acquisition of the Asian cuisine foodservice operations during fiscal 2003. Marketing associate served sales as a percentage of broadline sales in the U.S. increased to 53.8% in fiscal 2005 as compared to 53.5% in fiscal 2004. SYSCO Brand sales as a percentage of broadline sales in the U.S. decreased to 49.4% for fiscal 2005 as compared to 49.5% in fiscal 2004. The increase in earnings before income taxes for fiscal 2005 was primarily due to increases in sales and increased operating efficiencies aided by lower expenses as a percentage of sales. Factors contributing to the lower expenses as a percentage of sales were reduced performance based management incentive compensation and decreased net periodic pension costs, which overcame higher fuel costs and increased expenditures related to the National Supply Chain project. The comparison of fiscal 2005s earnings before income taxes to fiscal 2004 was also negatively impacted by the additional 53rd week in fiscal 2004. The increase in earnings before income taxes for fiscal year 2004 was primarily due to increased sales and reduced expenses as a percentage of sales, which more than offset reduced margins as a percentage of sales. The additional week also contributed to the earnings growth in fiscal 2004. 14 Table of Contents SYGMA Segment Acquisitions contributed 2.6% to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2005 and 1.9% in fiscal 2004. The comparison of fiscal 2005 sales to fiscal 2004 is negatively impacted by the additional week in fiscal 2004. Both the fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 sales growth was due primarily to sales to new customers, sales growth in SYGMAs existing customer base related to new locations added by those customers, as well as increases in sales to existing locations, price increases resulting primarily from higher product costs and sales from acquisitions. The additional week also contributed to the sales growth in fiscal 2004. The decrease in earnings before income taxes in fiscal 2005 was due to several factors. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and the first quarter of fiscal 2005, SYGMA discontinued servicing a portion of its largest customers locations due to that customers geographic supply chain realignment. SYGMA offset these lost sales by obtaining sales from additional locations from this customer and obtaining new business from other customers. In many cases, this new business is being served out of different SYGMA locations than those that originally served the discontinued business. SYGMA opened a new facility to serve a portion of the new business which it began serving in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. As a result, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and throughout fiscal 2005, SYGMAs operating profits have been impacted by increased operating expenses as it transitioned its operations to serve the new business it has acquired. In addition, SYGMAs gross margins as a percent of sales in fiscal 2005 have declined from the comparable period in fiscal 2004 due to product cost increases and lower agreed upon pricing with its customers. The increase in earnings before income taxes in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to the increased sales offset by increased expenses incurred related to implementation of new systems, severance payments related to certain personnel changes, costs related to workers compensation insurance claims and pension costs. The additional week also contributed to the earnings growth in fiscal 2004. Liquidity and Capital Resources SYSCO provides marketing and distribution services to foodservice customers primarily throughout the United States and Canada. The company intends to continue to expand its market share through profitable sales growth, foldouts and acquisitions. The company also strives to increase the effectiveness of its customer contact personnel, its consolidated buying programs and the productivity of its warehousing and distribution activities. These objectives require continuing investment. SYSCOs resources include cash provided by operations and access to capital from financial markets. SYSCOs operations historically have produced significant cash flow. Cash generated from operations is first allocated to working capital requirements; investments in facilities, fleet and other equipment required to meet customers needs; cash dividends; and acquisitions compatible with the companys overall growth strategy. Any remaining cash generated from operations may, at the discretion of management, be applied toward a portion of the cost of the share repurchase program, while the remainder of the cost may be financed with additional long term debt. SYSCOs share repurchase program is used primarily to offset shares issued under various employee benefit and compensation plans, for acquisitions, to reduce shares outstanding (which may have the net effect of increasing earnings per share) and to aid in managing the ratio of long term debt to total capitalization. Management targets a long term debt to total capitalization ratio between 35% and 40%. The ratio may exceed the target range from time to time, due to borrowings incurred in order to fund acquisitions and internal growth opportunities, and due to fluctuations in the timing and amount of share repurchases. The ratio also may fall below the target range due to strong cash flow from operations and fluctuations in the timing and amount of share repurchases. This ratio was 33.1% and 35.2% at July 2, 2005 and July 3, 2004, respectively. For purposes of calculating this ratio, long term debt includes both the current maturities and long term portion. In April 2005, SYSCO filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement covering $1,500,000,000 in debt securities. The registration statement was declared effective in May 2005. In June 2005, SYSCO repaid the 6.5% senior notes totaling $150,000,000 at maturity utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances. In July 2005, SYSCO also repaid the 4.75% senior notes totaling $200,000,000 at maturity also utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances. The company intends to issue between $350,000,000 and $500,000,000 of long term debt in September 2005. The amount of long term debt that SYSCO issues will depend upon market conditions at the time of issuance. The proceeds from such issuance are intended to be utilized to repay outstanding commercial paper issuances and for working capital and general corporate purposes. Also during the fall of 2005, the company intends to renegotiate its revolving bank credit facility which supports the U.S. commercial paper program. 15 Table of Contents Operating Activities Cash flow from operations in fiscal 2005 was negatively impacted by increases in inventory balances of $35,014,000 and increases in accounts receivable balances of $72,829,000, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable balances of $28,080,000. Cash flow from operations in fiscal 2004 was negatively impacted by increases in inventory balances of $162,502,000 and increases in accounts receivable balances of $177,058,000, offset by an increase in accounts payable balances of $95,874,000. Cash flow from operations in fiscal 2003 was negatively impacted by increases in inventory balances of $69,959,000 and increases in accounts receivable balances of $218,150,000, offset by an increase in accounts payable balances of $237,360,000. Also impacting cash flow from operations was a decrease in accrued expenses of $32,674,000 in fiscal 2005, an increase in accrued expenses of $61,544,000 in fiscal 2004 and a decrease in accrued expenses of $12,480,000 in fiscal 2003. The changes in accrued expenses in each year are primarily due to the amount of accrued incentive bonuses related to that year. Also impacting cash flow from operations were decreases in other long term liabilities and prepaid pension cost of $86,338,000 in fiscal 2005, $35,056,000 in fiscal 2004 and $72,814,000 in fiscal 2003. The decreases in other long term liabilities and prepaid pension cost in each year are primarily due to the amount of pension contributions exceeding the net pension cost recognized in each year. The companys contributions to its defined benefit plans were $220,361,000, $165,512,000 and $164,565,000 during fiscal 2005, fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, respectively. Included in the amounts contributed in fiscal 2005 was $134,000,000 voluntarily contributed to the qualified pension plan in the fourth quarter. The decision to increase the contributions to the qualified pension plan in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to the decreased discount rate, which increased the pension obligation and negatively impacted the fiscal 2005 year end pension funded status. The company expects to contribute approximately $74,000,000 to its defined benefit plans in fiscal 2006. During the second quarter of fiscal 2002, the company began reorganizing its supply chain to maximize consolidated efficiencies and increase the effectiveness of the merchandising and procurement functions performed for the benefit of customers. The structure results in the deferral of certain federal and state income tax payments, as supply chain distributions are not included in taxable income until distributed in periods subsequent to when they are recognized in book income. Fiscal 2004 is the first period that supply chain distributions were included in taxable income since the company began deferring these items for tax purposes in fiscal 2002. As a result of the impact of these items and other temporary differences, including the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards, excess tax depreciation and pension contributions, taxes paid during fiscal 2005 and 2004 increased to $436,378,000 and $344,414,000, respectively, as compared to $28,747,000 in fiscal 2003. The net cash flow impact of supply chain distribution deferrals in fiscal 2005 was incrementally positive when compared to what would have been paid on an annual basis without the deferral, due to increased volume through this structure. The amount of taxes paid in fiscal 2004 was reduced by $70,615,000 as the result of the utilization of a U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward. This net operating loss carryforward was generated in fiscal 2003 primarily as a result of the deferral of supply chain distributions. Also impacting the amount of taxes paid in each year is the amount of deductible pension contributions made in each year. As indicated above, the company expects that its pension contributions in fiscal 2006 will be substantially less than the contributions made in the preceeding three fiscal years. Investing Activities Fiscal 2005 capital expenditures included the construction of fold out facilities in Spokane, Washington and Geneva, Alabama, replacement or significant expansion of facilities in Baltimore, Maryland; Cleveland, Ohio; Denver, Colorado; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Miami, Florida; and Hartford, Connecticut, and the completion of the Northeast Redistribution Center in Front Royal, Virginia. Fiscal 2005 capital expenditures related to the National Supply Chain project were $34,009,000, bringing the total amount of capital expenditures on the project since inception to $186,263,000. Fiscal 2004 capital expenditures included the construction of fold out facilities in Oxnard, California and Fargo, North Dakota, replacement or significant expansion of facilities in Billings, Montana; Cleveland, Ohio; Jacksonville, Florida; Miami, Florida; and San Antonio, Texas, and the Northeast Redistribution Center in Front Royal, Virginia as well as continued expenditures related to the National Supply Chain project. Fiscal 2003 capital expenditures included the construction of fold out facilities in Las Vegas, Nevada and Oxnard, California, replacement facilities in Cleveland, Ohio; Dallas, Texas; and Miami, Florida and the Northeast Redistribution Center in Front Royal, Virginia. Total expenditures in fiscal 2006 are expected to be in the range of $425,000,000 to $450,000,000. Fiscal 2006 expenditures will include the continuation of the fold out program; facility, fleet and other equipment replacements and expansions; a corporate office expansion; the companys National Supply Chain project; and investments in technology. During fiscal 2005, SYSCO acquired for cash one broadline foodservice operation, four custom meat cutting operations, and two specialty produce distributors. During fiscal 2004, SYSCO acquired for cash certain assets of two broadline foodservice operations, a specialty produce distributor, and one quickservice operation. During fiscal 2003, SYSCO acquired for cash a broadline foodservice operation, two quickservice operations, a custom meat cutting operation, a specialty distributor of products to the Asian cuisine foodservice market and a distributor of paper and chemical products. 16 Table of Contents Financing Activities The company routinely engages in Board approved share repurchase programs. The number of shares acquired and their cost during the past three fiscal years was 16,790,200 shares for $597,660,000 in fiscal 2005, 16,454,300 shares for $608,506,000 in fiscal 2004, and 16,500,000 shares for $478,471,000 in fiscal 2003. An additional 5,375,000 shares have been purchased at a cost of $190,747,000 through August 27, 2005, resulting in 10,443,700 shares remaining available for repurchase as authorized by the Board as of that date. The company made four regular quarterly dividend payments during each of fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003. SYSCO began paying the current quarterly dividend rate of $0.15 per share in January 2005, an increase from the $0.13 per share that became effective in January 2004. In May 2005, SYSCO declared its regular quarterly dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 of $0.15 per share, which was paid in July 2005. In September 2005, SYSCO also declared its regular quarterly dividend for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 of $0.15 per share, payable in October 2005. In November 2000, the company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement covering 30,000,000 shares of common stock to be offered from time to time in connection with acquisitions. As of August 27, 2005, 29,447,835 shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement. In June 1998, the company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement covering $500,000,000 in debt securities. As of August 27, 2005, $425,000,000 in debt securities had been issued under the registration statement, leaving $75,000,000 available for issuance. In March 2004, SYSCO issued 4.60% notes totaling $200,000,000 due March 15, 2014 in a private offering. Proceeds from the notes were utilized to retire outstanding commercial paper. In April 2005, SYSCO filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement covering $1,500,000,000 in debt securities. The registration statement was declared effective in May 2005. In June 2005, SYSCO repaid the 6.5% senior notes totaling $150,000,000 at maturity utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances. In July 2005, SYSCO repaid the 4.75% senior notes totaling $200,000,000 at maturity also utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances. The company intends to issue between $350,000,000 and $500,000,000 of long term debt in September 2005. The amount of long term debt that SYSCO issues will depend on market conditions at the time of issuance. The proceeds from such issuance are intended to be utilized to repay outstanding commercial paper issuances and for working capital and general corporate purposes. In March 2005, SYSCO entered into a forward starting interest rate swap with a notional amount of $350,000,000 as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the cash outflows of interest payments on the forecasted debt issuance due to changes in the benchmark interest rate. The fair value of the swap as of July 2, 2005 was ($32,584,000), which is reflected in Accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, with the corresponding amount reflected as a loss, net of tax, in Other comprehensive income. SYSCO has uncommitted bank lines of credit, which provided for unsecured borrowings for working capital of up to $95,000,000, of which $31,000,000 was outstanding as of July 2, 2005 and $33,200,000 was outstanding as of August 27, 2005. SYSCO has a commercial paper program in the United States which is supported by a bank credit facility in the amount of $450,000,000, maturing in fiscal 2008. SYSCO also has a commercial paper program in Canada which is supported by a bank credit facility in the amount of CAD $100,000,000, maturing in fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, aggregate outstanding commercial paper issuances and short term bank borrowings ranged from approximately $28,560,000 to $253,384,000, $73,102,000 to $478,114,000, and $55,813,000 to $495,703,000, respectively. Outstanding commercial paper issuances were $157,851,000 as of July 2, 2005 and $519,186,000 as of August 27, 2005. Also during the fall of 2005, the company intends to renegotiate its revolving bank credit facility which supports the U.S. commercial paper program. From August 1, 2005 through August 27, 2005, outstanding commercial paper issuances have averaged $511,847,000. This increased level of commercial paper issuances is primarily a result of the repayment of the 6.5% senior notes and 4.75% senior notes, which matured June 15, 2005 and July 30, 2005, respectively, coupled with a contribution to the qualified pension plan of $134,000,000 at the end of fiscal 2005. As described above, the company intends to issue long term debt in September 2005. Until such time, SYSCO believes that outstanding commercial paper issuances will continue at these current levels. The company expects to continue to meet its capital investment and working capital requirements during this period. The company also believes that it continues to have access to additional debt financing if needed. 17 Table of Contents Total debt at July 2, 2005 was $1,431,108,000, of which approximately 86% was at fixed rates averaging 5.6% and the remainder was at floating rates averaging 3.2%. Included in current maturities of long term debt at July 2, 2005 are the 4.75% senior notes totaling $200,000,000, which were repaid at maturity in July 2005, and the 7.0% senior notes totaling $200,000,000, which mature in May 2006. As part of normal business activities, SYSCO issues letters of credit through major banking institutions as required by certain vendor and insurance agreements. As of July 2, 2005 and July 3, 2004, letters of credit outstanding were $76,817,000 and $11,001,000, respectively. The increase in letters of credit outstanding from July 3, 2004 to July 2, 2005 was due primarily to the issuance of a letter of credit in April 2005 in the amount of $72,000,000 to satisfy the collateral requirement for an insurance agreement which was previously satisfied with funds on deposit in an insurance trust. In summary, management believes that the companys cash flows from operations, as well as the availability of capital under its existing commercial paper programs, bank lines of credit, debt shelf registration and its ability to access capital from financial markets in the future, will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements while maintaining proper liquidity for normal operating purposes. Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth certain information concerning SYSCOs obligations and commitments to make contractual future payments: Payments Due by Period Less Than More Than Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years (In thousands) Short term debt and commercial paper $ 188,851 $ 63,998 $ 124,853 $ $ Long term debt 1,207,586 401,521 104,921 469 700,675 Capital lease obligations 34,671 9,412 4,366 1,024 19,869 Long term non capitalized leases 305,402 56,824 76,772 51,917 119,889 Deferred compensation (1) 98,929 4,623 7,415 5,318 81,573 Purchase obligations (2) 725,436 714,910 10,526 Total contractual cash obligations $ 2,560,875 $ 1,251,288 $ 328,853 $ 58,728 $ 922,006 (1) The estimate of the timing of future payments under the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan involves the use of certain assumptions, including retirement ages and payout periods. (2) For purposes of this table, purchase obligations include agreements for purchases of product in the normal course of business, for which all significant terms have been confirmed. Such amounts included in the table above are based on estimates. Purchase obligations also includes amounts committed with a third party to provide hardware and hardware hosting services (See discussion under Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8). Certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration, typically payable only in the event that certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved. Aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of July 2, 2005 included approximately 1,059,000 shares of SYSCOs common stock and $105,614,000 in cash. These amounts are not included in the table above. 18 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements. Significant accounting policies employed by SYSCO are presented in the notes to the financial statements. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations. These policies require managements most subjective or complex judgments, often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Senior management has reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates and this related disclosure. SYSCOs most critical accounting policies pertain to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, self insurance programs, pension plans, income taxes, vendor consideration and accounting for business combinations. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts SYSCO evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and determines the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors. In circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligation, a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected. In addition, allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on analysis of historical trends of write offs and recoveries. The company utilizes specific criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be written off, including bankruptcy, accounts referred to outside parties for collection and accounts past due over specified periods. If the financial condition of SYSCOs customers were to deteriorate, additional allowances may be required. Self Insurance Program SYSCO maintains a self insurance program covering portions of workers compensation, group medical, general liability and vehicle liability costs. The amounts in excess of the self insured levels are fully insured by third party insurers. Liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. In an attempt to mitigate the risks of workers compensation, vehicle and general liability claims, safety procedures and awareness programs have been implemented. Pension Plans Amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis. Three of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits, the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets. The measurement date for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans is fiscal year end for fiscal years 2005 and prior. Beginning in fiscal 2006, the measurement date will be May 31st which represents a change in accounting. The one month acceleration of the measurement date will allow additional time for management to evaluate and report the actuarial pension measurements in the year end financial statements and disclosures within the accelerated filing deadlines of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The cumulative effect of this change in accounting is expected to result in an increase to earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 of approximately $9,400,000, net of tax. For guidance in determining the discount rate, SYSCO calculates the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality fixed income investments for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the pension plans. The discount rate assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate. The discount rate assumption utilized impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs. The discount rate utilized to determine net pension costs for fiscal 2005 increased 0.25% to 6.25% from the discount rate utilized to determine net pension costs for fiscal 2004 of 6.00%. This 0.25% increase in the discount rate decreased SYSCOs net pension costs for fiscal 2005 by approximately $9,500,000. The discount rate for determining fiscal 2006 net pension costs, which was determined as of the May 31, 2005 measurement date, decreased 0.65% to 5.60%. This 0.65% decrease will increase SYSCOs net pension costs for fiscal 2006 by approximately $29,300,000. SYSCO looks to actual plan experience in determining the rates of increase in compensation levels. SYSCO used a plan specific age related set of rates (equivalent to a single rate of 5.89%) for the qualified pension plan (Retirement Plan), as of July 2, 2005 and July 3, 2004. The Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan assumes annual salary increases of 10% through fiscal 2007 and 7% thereafter as of July 2, 2005 and July 3, 2004. 19 Table of Contents The expected long term rate of return on plan assets of the Retirement Plan was 9.00% for fiscal 2005 and 2004. The expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns, reflecting a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and the forward looking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on long term bonds and the historical returns of the major stock markets. Although not determinative of future returns, the effective annual rate of return on plan assets, developed using geometric/compound averaging, was approximately 10.9%, 10.3%, 3.3% and 12.3% over the 20 year, 10 year, 5 year and 1 year periods ended December 31, 2004, respectively. In addition, in nine of the last 15 years, the actual return on plan assets has exceeded 9.00%. The rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate. The expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs. A 1.0% increase (decrease) in the assumed rate of return for fiscal 2006 would decrease (increase) SYSCOs net pension costs for fiscal 2006 by approximately $11,600,000. Minimum pension liability adjustments are recorded so that the recorded pension liability is at least equal to the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation. Minimum pension liability adjustments are non cash adjustments that are reflected as an increase (or decrease) in the pension liability and an offsetting charge (or benefit) to shareholders equity, net of tax, through comprehensive loss (or income). Amounts reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to minimum pension liability, were charges, net of tax, of $54,286,000 as of July 2, 2005, and $20,733,000 as of July 3, 2004. Changes in the assumptions, including changes to the discount rate discussed above, together with the normal growth of the plan, the impact of actuarial losses from prior periods and the timing and amount of contributions, decreased net pension costs $7,374,000 in fiscal 2005 and is expected to increase net pension costs in fiscal 2006 by approximately $23,700,000. The company made cash contributions to its pension plans of $220,361,000 and $165,512,000 in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively, including voluntary contributions to the Retirement Plan of $214,000,000 and $160,000,000 in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. Included in the amounts contributed in fiscal 2005 was $134,000,000 voluntarily contributed to the qualified pension plan in the fourth quarter. The decision to increase the contributions to the Retirement Plan in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to the decreased discount rate, which increased the pension obligation and negatively impacted the fiscal 2005 year end pension funded status. In fiscal 2006, as in the previous years, contributions to the Retirement Plan will not be required to meet ERISA minimum funding requirements but the company anticipates that it will make voluntary contributions of approximately $66,000,000, which is the estimated maximum amount that will be tax deductible in fiscal 2006. The estimated fiscal 2006 contributions to fund benefit payments for the SERP and other post retirement plans together are approximately $7,997,000. Income Taxes The determination of the companys provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. The companys provision for income taxes reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various U.S. federal and state, as well as Canadian federal and provincial jurisdictions. Jurisdictional tax law changes, increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items, accruals or adjustments of accruals for tax contingencies or valuation allowances, and the companys change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate. In evaluating the exposures connected with the various tax filing positions, the company establishes an accrual when, despite managements belief that the companys tax return positions are supportable, management believes that certain positions may be successfully challenged and a loss is probable. When facts and circumstances change, these accruals are adjusted. Vendor Consideration SYSCO recognizes consideration received from vendors when the services performed in connection with the monies received are completed and when the related product has been sold by SYSCO. There are several types of cash consideration received from vendors. In many instances, the vendor consideration is in the form of a specified amount per case or per pound. In these instances, SYSCO will recognize the vendor consideration as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold. In the situations where the vendor consideration is not related directly to specific product purchases, SYSCO will recognize these as a reduction of cost of sales when the earnings process is complete, the related service is performed and the amounts realized. In certain of these latter instances, the vendor consideration represents a reimbursement of a specific incremental identifiable cost incurred by SYSCO. In these cases, SYSCO classifies the consideration as a reduction of those costs with any excess funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales and recognizes these in the period in which the costs are incurred and related services performed. Accounting for Business Combinations Goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired. Certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired, including goodwill and other intangible assets, as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit. In addition, SYSCO assesses the 20 Table of Contents recoverability of these intangibles by determining whether the fair values of the applicable reporting units exceed their carrying values. The evaluation of fair value requires the use of projections, estimates and assumptions as to the future performance of the operations in performing a discounted cash flow analysis, as well as assumptions regarding sales and earnings multiples that would be applied in comparable acquisitions in the industry. Actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections, resulting in the company revising its assumptions and, if required, recognizing an impairment loss. New Accounting Standards On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)), which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS 123). SFAS 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB Opinion 25), and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS 123. However, SFAS 123(R) requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under the new standard. SYSCO will adopt SFAS 123(R) in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. SFAS 123(R) allows for two transition methods. The basic difference between the two methods is that the modified prospective transition method does not require restatement of prior periods, whereas the modified retrospective transition method will require restatement. As permitted by SFAS 123, the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using APB Opinion 25s intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options or stock issuances under the employee stock purchase plan. Although the full impact of the companys adoption of SFAS 123(R)s fair value method has not yet been determined, the company expects that it will have a significant impact on its results of operations. The disclosure in the footnotes to the companys consolidated financial statements under Stock Based Compensation of pro forma net income and earnings per share as if the company had recognized compensation cost for share based payments under SFAS 123 for periods prior to fiscal 2006 is not necessarily indicative of the potential impact of recognizing compensation cost for share based payments under SFAS 123(R) in future periods. The company estimates that the earnings per share impact to fiscal 2006 resulting from recording compensation expense related to stock options and the Employees Stock Purchase Plan will be approximately $0.11 to $0.13. The potential impact of adopting SFAS 123(R) on fiscal 2006s results of operations and earnings per share is dependent on several factors, including the number of options granted in fiscal 2006, the fair value of those options which will be determined at the date of grant, the level of participation in the Employees Stock Purchase Plan, the related income tax benefits recorded and the diluted shares outstanding. This estimate is based on certain assumptions as to these factors and the actual impact may differ if actual results vary from the assumptions. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes, and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements. The standard changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a voluntary change in accounting principle requiring a retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of the change in principle unless it is impracticable rather than the recording of a cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle in net income in the year of change. The standard is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Risk Factors Low Margin Business; Inflation and Economic Sensitivity The foodservice distribution industry is characterized by relatively high inventory turnover with relatively low profit margins. SYSCO makes a significant portion of its sales at prices that are based on the cost of products it sells plus a percentage markup. As a result, SYSCOs profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of product cost deflation, even though SYSCOs gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant. Prolonged periods of product cost inflation also may have a negative impact on the companys profit margins and earnings to the extent such product cost increases are not passed on to customers due to resistance to higher prices. The foodservice industry is sensitive to national and regional economic conditions. Inflation, fuel costs and other factors affecting consumer confidence and the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home may negatively impact SYSCOs sales and operating results. SYSCOs operating results are also sensitive to, and may be adversely affected by, other factors, including difficulties with the collectability of accounts receivable, competitive price pressures, severe weather conditions and unexpected increases in fuel or other transportation related costs. Although these factors have not had a material adverse impact on SYSCOs past operations, there can be no assurance that one or more of these factors will not adversely affect future operating results. 21 Table of Contents Increased Fuel Costs Increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on the Companys results of operations. The high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home. The high cost of fuel can also increase the price paid by SYSCO for product as well as the costs incurred by SYSCO to deliver product to its customers. These factors in turn may negatively impact SYSCOs sales, margins, operating expenses and operating results. Interruption of Supplies and Increases in Product Costs SYSCO obtains substantially all of its foodservice and related products from third party suppliers. For the most part, SYSCO does not have long term contracts with its suppliers committing them to provide products to SYSCO. Although SYSCOs purchasing volume can provide leverage when dealing with suppliers, suppliers may not provide the foodservice products and supplies needed by SYSCO in the quantities and at the prices requested. Because SYSCO does not control the actual production of the products it sells, it also is subject to delays caused by interruption in production and increases in product costs based on conditions outside its control. These conditions include job actions or strikes by employees of suppliers, weather, crop conditions, transportation interruptions, increases in fuel costs, competitive demands and natural disasters or other catastrophic events. SYSCOs inability to obtain adequate supplies of its foodservice and related products as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise, could mean that SYSCO could not fulfill its obligations to customers, and customers may turn to other distributors. Leverage and Debt Service Because a substantial part of SYSCOs growth historically has been the result of acquisitions and capital expansion, SYSCOs continued growth depends, in large part, on its ability to continue this expansion. As a result, its inability to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures through borrowed funds could restrict its ability to expand. Moreover, any default under the documents governing the indebtedness of SYSCO could have a significant adverse effect on the market value of SYSCOs common stock. Further, SYSCOs leveraged position may also increase its vulnerability to competitive pressures. Product Liability Claims SYSCO, like any other seller of food, faces the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of products sold by the company causes injury or illness. With respect to product liability claims, SYSCO believes it has sufficient primary or excess umbrella liability insurance. However, this insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost, or, if available, may not be adequate to cover all of SYSCOs liabilities. SYSCO generally seeks contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying its products, but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited, as a practical matter, to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers. If SYSCO does not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available, product liability relating to defective products could materially reduce SYSCOs net earnings and earnings per share. Labor Relations As of July 2, 2005, approximately 8,700 employees at 54 operating companies were members of 61 different local unions associated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and other labor organizations. In fiscal 2006, 16 agreements covering approximately 2,400 employees will expire. Failure of the operating companies to effectively renegotiate these contracts could result in work stoppages. Although SYSCOs operating subsidiaries have not experienced any significant labor disputes or work stoppages to date, and SYSCO believes they have satisfactory relationships with their unions, a work stoppage due to failure of one or more operating subsidiaries to renegotiate a union contract, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on SYSCO. Integration of Acquired Companies If SYSCO is unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, its profitability may decrease. Integration of an acquired business may be more difficult when SYSCO acquires a business in a market in which it has limited or no expertise, or with a corporate culture different from SYSCOs. If SYSCO is unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully, it may incur substantial costs and delays in increasing its customer base. In addition, the failure to integrate acquisitions successfully may divert managements attention from SYSCOs existing business and may damage SYSCOs relationships with its key customers and suppliers. Charter and Stockholder Rights Plan Under its Restated Certificate of Incorporation, SYSCOs Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to 1.5 million shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval. Issuance of these shares could make it more difficult for anyone to acquire SYSCO 22 Table of Contents without approval of the Board of Directors, depending on the rights and preferences of the stock issued. In addition, if anyone attempts to acquire SYSCO without approval of the Board of Directors of SYSCO, the stockholders of SYSCO have the right to purchase preferred stock of SYSCO pursuant to its Stockholder Rights Plan, which could result in substantial dilution to a potential acquiror. The existence of either of these provisions could deter hostile takeover attempts that might result in an acquisition of SYSCO that could otherwise have been financially beneficial to SYSCOs stockholders. Forward Looking Statements Certain statements made herein that look forward in time or express managements expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future events are forward looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. They include statements about SYSCOs ability to increase its market share and sales, long term debt to capitalization target ratios, anticipated capital expenditures, timing and expected benefits of the National Supply Chain project and related regional distribution centers, and SYSCOs ability to meet future cash requirements and remain profitable. These statements are based on managements current expectations and estimates; actual results may differ materially due in part to the risk factors discussed above. In addition, SYSCOs ability to increase its market share and sales, meet future cash requirements and remain profitable could be affected by conditions in the economy and the industry and internal factors such as the ability to control expenses. The ability to meet long term debt to capitalization target ratios also may be affected by cash flow including amounts spent on share repurchases and acquisitions and internal growth. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk SYSCO does not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes. SYSCOs use of debt directly exposes the company to interest rate risk. Floating rate debt, where the interest rate fluctuates periodically, exposes the company to short term changes in market interest rates. Fixed rate debt, where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument, exposes the company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate. SYSCO manages its debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that goal. The major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments, potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions. At July 2, 2005, the company had outstanding $157,851,000 of commercial paper at variable rates of interest with maturities through July 29, 2005. The companys total long term debt obligations of $1,367,110,000 were primarily at fixed rates of interest. The company intends to issue between $350,000,000 and $500,000,000 of long term debt in September 2005. The amount of long term debt that SYSCO issues will depend upon market conditions at the time of issuance. In March 2005, SYSCO entered into a forward starting interest rate swap with a notional amount of $350,000,000 as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the cash outflows of interest payments on $350,000,000 of the forecasted debt issuance due to changes in the benchmark interest rate. During fiscal 2004 and part of fiscal 2005, SYSCO had several fixed to floating interest rate swaps outstanding. These were entered into in fiscal 2004 as management believed that floating interest rates were more advantageous. During fiscal 2005, SYSCO terminated the fixed to floating interest rate swaps outstanding locking in effective yields on the related debt. Management believes that present market conditions reflect fixed long term rates near historical lows. As such, management believes that fixed long term rates present a better opportunity than in the recent past and intends to issue long term debt at fixed rates with extended terms in September 2005. 23 Table of Contents In the following tables, commercial paper issuances are reflected as floating rate debt and the U.S. commercial paper is classified as long term based on the maturity of the companys revolving loan agreement which supports the companys U.S. commercial paper program and the companys intent to continue to refinance this facility on a long term basis.

Increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on the Companys results of operations in three areas. First, the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home. Second, the high cost of fuel can increase the price paid by SYSCO for product purchases for which SYSCO may not be able to pass these costs fully to its customers. Third, increased fuel costs impact the costs incurred by SYSCO to deliver product to its customers. During fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, fuel costs represented approximately 0.4%, 0.3% and 0.3% of sales, respectively. Fuel costs incurred by SYSCO in fiscal 2005 increased by approximately $31,000,000 over fiscal 2004. In order to partially manage the volatility and uncertainty of fuel costs, SYSCO from time to time will enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of SYSCOs projected monthly diesel fuel requirements. Forward diesel fuel purchase commitments outstanding as of July 2, 2005 were not material. 25 Table of Contents
