Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Highlights Sales increased 7.8% in fiscal 2006 over the prior year. Gross margins as a percentage of sales were 19.28% for fiscal 2006, or 0.18% greater as a percentage of sales than the prior year. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2006 increased from the prior year, primarily due to incremental share based compensation expense; increased fuel costs and increased pension costs, partially offset by lower management performance based incentive compensation. Interest expense increased in fiscal 2006 over the prior year due to a combination of increased borrowing rates and increased borrowing levels. The increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 was due to the combination of the adoption of SFAS 123(R), coupled with the impact of certain tax benefits recorded in fiscal 2005. Primarily as a result of these factors, net earnings before the cumulative effect of accounting change for fiscal 2006 decreased 12.0% over the prior year. The Northeast Redistribution Center (Northeast RDC) began operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2005; therefore, the net impact of the National Supply Chain project in fiscal 2006 includes both expenses incurred by the project as well as certain direct benefits. Current direct benefits have been realized in the areas of cost of sales and operating expenses. Management estimates that expenses 11 Table of Contents and direct benefits related to the National Supply Chain project had a net negative impact on earnings before income taxes of approximately $40,000,000 during fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2006, SYSCO adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, (SFAS 123(R)) utilizing the modified prospective transition method under which prior period results have not been restated. The results of operations for fiscal 2006 include incremental share based compensation cost over what would have been recorded had the company continued to account for share based compensation under APB 25 of $118,038,000 ($105,810,000, net of tax). SYSCO adopted accounting pronouncement EITF 04 13 Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory With the Same Counterparty, (EITF 04 13) at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The accounting standard requires certain transactions, where inventory is purchased by SYSCO from a customer and then resold at a later date to the same customer (as defined), to be presented in the income statement on a net basis. The impact of adopting this new standard resulted in sales being reduced by $99,803,000. Cost of sales were also reduced by the same amount and thus net earnings are unaffected by the adoption of this standard. SYSCO adopted this accounting pronouncement beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and will apply it to similar transactions prospectively. Prior years sales and cost of sales have not been restated. Therefore, the calculation of sales growth and the comparison of gross margins, operating expenses and earnings as a percentage of sales between the two years are affected. In the first quarter of fiscal 2006, SYSCO recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting, due to a change in the measurement date for pension and other postretirement benefit plans to assist the company in meeting accelerated SEC filing dates, which increased net earnings for fiscal 2006 by $9,285,000, net of tax. General economic conditions, including fuel costs and their impact on consumer spending, can have an impact on SYSCOs sales growth. Management believes that SYSCOs continued focus on customer account penetration through the use of business reviews with customers, increases in the number of customer contact personnel and efforts of the companys marketing associates overcame these economic conditions and contributed to the companys sales growth in fiscal 2006. These economic conditions may continue to be a factor to SYSCOs sales growth in future periods. Overview SYSCO distributes food and related products to restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments and other foodservice customers. SYSCOs operations are located throughout the United States and Canada and include broadline companies, specialty produce companies, custom cut meat operations, hotel supply operations, and SYGMA, the companys chain restaurant distribution subsidiary. The company estimates that it serves about 14% of an approximately $232 billion annual market that includes the North American foodservice and hotel amenity, furniture and textile markets. According to industry sources, the foodservice, or food prepared away from home, market represents approximately one half of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level. This share grew from about 37% in 1972 to about 50% in 1998 and has not changed materially since that time. General economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect the frequency of purchases and amounts spent by consumers for food prepared away from home and in turn can impact SYSCOs sales. SYSCO historically has grown at a faster rate than the overall industry and has grown its market share in this fragmented industry. The company intends to continue to expand its market share and grow earnings through strategies which include: Sales growth: The company plans to grow sales by gaining an increased share of products purchased by existing customers, development of new customers, the use of foldouts (new operating companies created in established markets previously served by other SYSCO operating companies) and a disciplined acquisition program. The company uses market information to estimate the potential sales and profitability of new and existing customers. Marketing resources, SYSCO Brand products and value added services provided by SYSCO can be custom tailored to the purchasing needs of customers. Additionally, the investment of resources in any particular account can be made in proportion to the accounts potential profitability. Brand management: SYSCO Brand products are manufactured by suppliers to meet the companys product specifications using strict quality assurance standards. Management believes that SYSCO Brand products provide a greater value to customers and differentiate the company from its competitors. Management also believes that SYSCO Brand products generally provide higher profitability than national brand products. 12 Table of Contents Productivity gains: The companys investment in warehousing and transportation technology and the implementation of best business practices allows SYSCO to leverage operating expenses relative to sales growth. Sales force effectiveness: The company invests in the development and expansion of its customer contact resources by hiring additional customer contact personnel through targeted recruiting, hiring and promotion practices, effective use of training programs and improved compensation systems. Expanded business review and business development functions allow the sales force to strengthen customer relationships and increase sales. Supply chain management: The companys National Supply Chain project and related organization is being developed to reduce total supply chain costs, operating costs and working capital requirements of the company. National Supply Chain Project The companys National Supply Chain project is intended to optimize the supply chain activities for products for SYSCOs operating companies in each respective region and is expected to result in increased sales and profitability. In addition, it will lower inventory, operating costs, working capital requirements and future facility expansion needs at SYSCOs operating companies while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers. The company expects to build from seven to nine regional distribution centers in the United States. The first of these centers, the Northeast RDC located in Front Royal, Virginia, opened during the third quarter of fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2006 management identified a number of operational changes that they believed would make the Northeast RDC more efficient and held case volumes constant while these changes were being implemented. Additional case volume began to flow through the Northeast RDC after implementing these changes and case volumes continued to increase at a controlled and measured pace. Management continues to believe that the long term economic objectives of the project will be achieved. The long term benefits expected to be realized from the National Supply Chain project will be reflected in the sales, cost of sales, operating expenses and interest expense line items in the Results of Operations statement. In January 2006, SYSCO completed the purchase of land in Alachua, Florida for the future site of its second RDC, which will service the companys five broadline operating companies in Florida. This facility is expected to be operational in fiscal 2008. The company has also purchased the site for construction of a third RDC in Hamlet, Indiana. Results of Operations The following table sets forth the components of the Results of Operations expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated: 2006 2005 2004 Sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Costs and Expenses Cost of sales 80.7 80.9 80.7 Operating expenses 14.7 13.9 14.1 Interest expense 0.3 0.2 0.2 Other, net 0.0 0.0 0.0 Total costs and expenses 95.7 95.0 95.0 Earnings before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change 4.3 5.0 5.0 Income taxes 1.7 1.8 1.9 Earnings before cumulative effect of accounting change 2.6 3.2 3.1 Cumulative effect of accounting change Net earnings 2.6 % 3.2 % 3.1 % 13 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the change in the components of the Results of Operations expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year: 2006 2005 Sales 7.8 % 3.2 % Costs and Expenses Cost of sales 7.5 3.5 Operating expenses 14.4 1.3 Interest expense 45.5 7.3 Other, net (17.3 ) (11.8 ) Total costs and expenses 8.6 3.2 Earnings before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change (8.6 ) 3.4 Income taxes (2.7 ) (0.7 ) Earnings before cumulative effect of accounting change (12.0 ) 6.0 Cumulative effect of accounting change Net earnings (11.0 )% 6.0 % Earnings before cumulative effect of accounting change: Basic earnings per share (9.9 )% 7.1 % Diluted earnings per share (8.2 ) 7.3 Net earnings: Basic earnings per share (8.6 ) 7.1 Diluted earnings per share (7.5 ) 7.3 Average shares outstanding (2.3 ) (1.0 ) Diluted shares outstanding (3.7 ) (1.3 ) Sales Sales for fiscal 2006 were 7.8% greater than fiscal 2005. Acquisitions contributed 1.4% to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2006 and 0.8% for fiscal 2005. The adoption of EITF 04 13 at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 reduced sales growth in fiscal 2006 by 0.3%, or $99,803,000. Sales for fiscal 2005 were 3.2% greater than fiscal 2004, or 5.3% greater after adjusting for the additional week in fiscal 2004. Because the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 contained an additional week as compared to fiscal 2005, sales growth for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 are not directly comparable. In order to provide a more comparable picture of sales growth, management believes that it is appropriate to adjust the sales figures for fiscal 2004 by the estimated impact of the additional week. As a result, sales for fiscal 2004 presented in the table below are adjusted by one fourteenth of total sales for the fourth quarter. Set forth below is a reconciliation of actual sales growth to adjusted sales growth for the periods presented: 2006 2005 2004 (52 Weeks) (52 Weeks) (53 Weeks) Sales for the fiscal year $ 32,628,438,000 $ 30,281,914,000 $ 29,335,403,000 Estimated sales for the additional week 581,358,000 Adjusted sales $ 32,628,438,000 $ 30,281,914,000 $ 28,754,045,000 Actual percentage increase 7.8 % 3.2 % 12.2 % Adjusted percentage increase 7.8 % 5.3 % 10.0 % SYSCO generally expects to pass product cost increases to its customers; however, the actual amount of inflation reflected as sales price increases is difficult to quantify. Estimated product cost increases were 0.6% during fiscal 2006 as compared to 3.5% during fiscal 2005. 14 Table of Contents SYSCOs continued focus on customer account penetration through the use of business reviews with customers, increases in the number of customer contact personnel and efforts of the companys marketing associates contributed to the sales growth in fiscal 2006. The number of customer contact personnel has increased approximately 6% since the end of fiscal 2005. Management believes that prolonged periods of rising product costs together with general economic conditions, including the impact of increased fuel costs on consumer spending, contributed to the softness in the foodservice market and thus a slowing of SYSCOs sales growth beginning in the latter half of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and continuing into the first half of fiscal 2005. After adjusting for the additional week in fiscal 2004, sales growth remained relatively stable over the course of fiscal 2005. Management believes that the declining rate of product cost increases over the course of fiscal 2005 has lessened the overall gross margin pressures experienced during the year and has contributed to the underlying unit growth in the latter half of fiscal 2005 and all of fiscal 2006. Additionally, management believes that the continued focus on the companys business review process has contributed to unit sales growth. Industry sources estimate the total foodservice market experienced real sales growth of approximately 1.9% in calendar year 2005 and 2.3% in calendar year 2004. A comparison of the sales mix in the principal product categories during the last three years is presented below: 2006 2005 2004 Fresh and frozen meats 19 % 19 % 19 % Canned and dry products 18 18 18 Frozen fruits, vegetables, bakery and other 14 14 14 Poultry 10 11 11 Dairy products 9 9 9 Fresh produce 9 8 8 Paper and disposables 8 8 8 Seafood 5 5 5 Beverage products 3 3 3 Equipment and smallwares 2 2 2 Janitorial products 2 2 2 Medical supplies 1 1 1 100 % 100 % 100 % A comparison of sales by type of customer during the last three years is presented below: 2006 2005 2004 Restaurants 63 % 64 % 64 % Hospitals and nursing homes 10 10 10 Schools and colleges 5 5 5 Hotels and motels 6 6 6 All other 16 15 15 100 % 100 % 100 % Gross Margins Gross margins as a percentage of sales were 19.3% for fiscal 2006, as compared to 19.1% for fiscal 2005. The adoption of EITF 04 13 contributed 0.06% to the increase in gross margins as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2006. Management believes that the remaining gross margin increase was aided by several factors, including low product cost inflation and effective merchandising. Estimated product cost increases, an internal measure of inflation, were 0.6% during fiscal 2006, as compared to 3.5% during fiscal 2005. SYSCO generally expects to pass product cost increases to its customers; however, during periods of rapidly increasing product costs, price increases to customers generally lag. This lag impacted gross margins in fiscal 2005 as discussed below. Conversely, in fiscal 2006, the moderation of product cost increases allowed SYSCO to be more effective in managing pricing to its customers. This was achieved by maintaining stable pricing and avoiding the absorption of significant product cost increases before pricing to customers was adjusted. The benefits realized by the National Supply Chain project and better leveraging of our purchasing power resulted in lower overall product costs. 15 Table of Contents Gross margins as a percentage of sales were 19.1% for fiscal 2005, as compared to 19.3% for fiscal 2004. Management believes that this gross margin decline was caused by several factors, including product cost increases, changes in segment mix, customer mix and pricing pressure. The decline in gross margins as a percentage of sales slowed during the course of fiscal 2005 due in part to a lessening of the rate of product cost increases during the fiscal year. Product cost increases in most of the product categories had the impact of reducing gross margins as a percentage of sales. The gross margin reduction is generally due to two reasons: i) the resulting higher sales dollar base impacts the comparison of the ratio between the two years and ii) price increases passed on to customers lag behind the product cost increases incurred from vendors. In periods of rising product costs, even when gross margin dollars are maintained or slightly increased, the resulting gross margin percentage of sales ratio will be lower than the prior year due to the higher sales dollar base. During periods of rapidly increasing product costs like those experienced in fiscal 2005, price increases to customers generally lag. In the case of marketing associate served customers, marketing associates will generally encounter resistance and may not be able to immediately raise prices. In the case of multi unit customers, prices are agreed to contractually. The contracted prices are fixed for periods of up to 30 days and thus price increases to these customers will also lag. The contracted prices are frequently also fee based which results in the same gross margin dollars with a higher sales price and therefore a lower gross margin as a percentage of sales. Changes in segment mix also contributed to the decline in gross margins in fiscal 2005 when compared to the prior year. Sales at the SYGMA segment, which traditionally have lower margins than Broadline segment sales, grew faster than sales at the Broadline segment. Changes in customer mix also contributed to the decline in gross margins in fiscal 2005 when compared to the prior year. Multi unit customer sales in the Broadline segment, which traditionally yield lower gross margins and lower expenses than marketing associate served customer sales, grew faster, and thus represented a greater percentage of total sales in fiscal 2005 than in fiscal 2004. Management also believes that competitive pricing pressures contributed to the decline in gross margins. Operating Expenses Operating expenses include the costs of warehousing and delivering products as well as selling, administrative and occupancy expenses. Changes in the percentage relationship of operating expenses to sales result from an interplay of several factors, including improved efficiencies, customer mix, and product cost increases which result in increases in sales prices. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were 14.7% for fiscal 2006, as compared to 13.9% for fiscal 2005. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales included incremental share based compensation, increased fuel costs, increased pension costs and increased expenses associated with the National Supply Chain project, partially offset by reduced management performance based incentive bonuses. Operating expenses for fiscal 2006 include incremental share based compensation cost of $118,038,000 resulting from the adoption of SFAS 123(R) (See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). Fuel costs increased $48,600,000 fiscal 2006 over the prior year. Net pension costs increased $23,734,000 in fiscal 2006 over the prior year. Operating expenses were reduced by the recognition of a gain of $9,702,000 in fiscal 2006 to adjust the carrying value of life insurance assets to their cash surrender value, as compared to a gain of $13,803,000 in fiscal 2005. Management performance based incentive bonuses were reduced by $27,270,000 in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Management estimates that expenses and direct benefits related to the National Supply Chain project had a net negative impact on earnings before income taxes of approximately $40,000,000 during fiscal 2006. Direct benefits from the National Supply Chain project in fiscal 2006 were primarily realized in reduced cost of sales. The long term benefits expected to be realized from the National Supply Chain project will be reflected in the sales, cost of sales, operating expenses and interest expense line items in the Results of Operations statement. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were 13.9% for fiscal 2005, as compared to 14.1% for fiscal 2004. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was aided by improved operating efficiencies. For example, the Broadline segment continues to demonstrate improving trends in key expense metrics, including miles driven per trip, pieces per stop and pieces per error. Increases in product costs and the resulting increased average sales price per item also favorably impacted expenses as a percentage of sales as operating costs increased at a lower rate than sales. Operating expenses for fiscal 2005 were negatively impacted by increased costs to deliver product to customers due to increased fuel costs of approximately $31,000,000 over the prior year. Operating expenses related to the National Supply Chain project were $46,450,000 in fiscal 2005, as compared to $29,333,000 in fiscal 2004. Also included in operating expenses was the recognition of a 16 Table of Contents gain of $13,803,000 in fiscal 2005 to adjust the carrying value of life insurance assets to their cash surrender value, as compared to a gain of $19,124,000 in fiscal 2004. Operating expenses were reduced by a reduction of management performance based incentive bonuses of $26,989,000 and a decrease in net pension cost of $7,374,000 in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. In order to partially manage the volatility and uncertainty of fuel costs, SYSCO from time to time will enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of SYSCOs projected monthly diesel fuel requirements. Forward diesel fuel purchase commitments outstanding as of July 1, 2006 and July 2, 2005, respectively, were not material. Net pension costs for fiscal 2007 are expected to decrease $53,900,000 from fiscal 2006 due primarily to an increase in the discount rate utilized to determine net pension costs. Interest Expense The increase in interest expense of $34,100,000 in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 was due to a combination of increased borrowing rates and increased borrowing levels. In fiscal 2006, commercial paper and short term bank borrowing rates increased over the prior year. Effective borrowing rates on long term debt also increased over the comparable prior year period. In fiscal 2005, effective borrowing rates on long term debt were lowered through the use of fixed to floating interest rate swaps. Higher overall borrowing levels are a result of the level of share repurchases, increased working capital requirements driven primarily by sales growth and continued capital investments in the form of additions to plant and equipment and acquisitions of new businesses. The increase in interest expense of $5,120,000 in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004, was due to increased borrowing interest rates. The increase in the companys overall borrowing interest rates was primarily due to an increase in the percentage of the companys debt with fixed interest rates in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2004, the companys debt portfolio included a larger percentage of floating rate debt in the form of either commercial paper issuances or fixed rate debt converted to floating through interest rate swap agreements. In addition, market interest rates increased during fiscal 2005. Other, Net Changes between the years result from fluctuations in miscellaneous activities, primarily gains and losses on the sale of surplus facilities. Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 39.35% in fiscal 2006, 36.97% in fiscal 2005 and 38.50% in fiscal 2004. The increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 was a combination of the adoption of SFAS 123(R), which is discussed in Note 13, Share Based Compensation, and Note 14, Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, and certain tax benefits recorded in fiscal 2005. SYSCO recorded a tax benefit of $12,228,000, or 10.4% of the $118,038,000 in incremental share based compensation expense recorded in fiscal 2006, as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123(R). The income tax expense in fiscal 2005 was reduced by tax benefits totaling $19,500,000 primarily related to the reversal of a tax contingency accrual and to the reversal of valuation allowances previously recorded on certain state net operating loss carryforwards. Net Earnings Net earnings decreased 11.0% in fiscal 2006 over the prior year. The decrease was due primarily to the factors discussed above. In addition, in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, SYSCO recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting due to a change in the measurement date for pension and other postretirement benefits, which increased net earnings for fiscal 2006 by $9,285,000, net of tax. The increases in net earnings in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 were due to the factors discussed above. In addition, the comparison of fiscal 2005s net earnings to fiscal 2004 was negatively impacted by the additional 53rd week in fiscal 2004. 17 Table of Contents Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share decreased 8.6% and 7.5%, respectively, in fiscal 2006 over the prior year. These decreases were due primarily to the result of factors discussed above, partially offset by a net reduction in shares outstanding. The net reduction in average shares outstanding used to calculate basic earnings per share is primarily due to share repurchases. The net reduction in diluted shares outstanding is primarily due to share repurchases, the exclusion of certain options from the diluted share calculation due to their anti dilutive effect and a modification of the treasury stock method calculation utilized to compute the dilutive effect of stock options as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123(R). This modification results in lower diluted shares outstanding than would have been calculated had compensation cost not been recorded for stock options and stock issuances under the Employees Stock Purchase Plan. Basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share increased 7.1% and 7.3%, respectively, in fiscal 2005 over prior year. The increases in earnings per share were the result of factors discussed above, as well as a net reduction of shares outstanding due primarily to share repurchases. Return on Average Shareholders Equity The return on average shareholders equity was approximately 30% in fiscal 2006, 35% in fiscal 2005 and 39% in fiscal 2004. The lower return in fiscal 2006 was impacted by the reduction in earnings resulting from the adoption of SFAS 123(R) as discussed above. The higher return in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to the impact of minimum pension liability adjustments to shareholders equity. Since its inception, SYSCO has averaged approximately 20% return on average shareholders equity. Segment Results The following table sets forth the change in the selected financial data of each of the companys reportable segments expressed as a percentage increase over the prior year and should be read in conjunction with Business Segment Information in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8: 2006 2005 Earnings Earnings Sales Before Taxes Sales Before Taxes Broadline 5.8 % 1.9 % 1.7 % 5.0 % SYGMA 10.8 (55.4 ) 10.4 (28.1 ) Other 23.4 28.6 8.4 11.7 The following table sets forth sales and earnings before taxes of each of the companys reportable segments expressed as a percentage of the respective consolidated total and should be read in conjunction with Business Segment Information in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8: 2006 2005 2004 Earnings Earnings Earnings Sales Before Taxes Sales Before Taxes Sales Before Taxes Broadline 78.7 % 110.8 % 80.1 % 99.4 % 81.3 % 97.9 % SYGMA 13.3 0.6 12.9 1.2 12.1 1.7 Other 9.2 7.9 8.1 5.6 7.7 5.2 Intersegment sales (1.2 ) (1.1 ) (1.1 ) Unallocated corporate expenses (19.3 ) (6.2 ) (4.8 ) Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % The company does not allocate share based compensation related to stock option grants, issuances of stock pursuant to the Employees Stock Purchase Plan and restricted stock grants to non employee directors and corporate officers. The increase in unallocated corporate expenses as a percentage of consolidated earnings before taxes in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 is primarily attributable to these items. See further discussion of Share Based Compensation in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 18 Table of Contents Broadline Segment Sales for fiscal 2006 were 5.8% greater than fiscal 2005. The adoption of EITF 04 13 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 reduced sales growth in fiscal 2006 by 0.2%, or $57,211,000. Sales for fiscal 2005 were 1.7% greater than fiscal 2004. Acquisitions contributed 0.1% to the overall sales growth rate for both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. Management believes that SYSCOs continued focus on customer account penetration through the use of business reviews with customers, increases in the number of customer contact personnel and efforts of the companys marketing associates contributed to the sales growth in fiscal 2006. The fiscal 2005 sales growth was primarily due to increased sales to marketing associate served customers and multi unit customers, including increased sales of SYSCO Brand products and increases in both sales prices and unit volumes. The comparison of fiscal 2005 sales to fiscal 2004 is negatively impacted by the additional week in fiscal 2004. The decrease of Broadline segment sales as a percentage of total SYSCO sales in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 was due primarily to strong sales growth in the SYGMA and other segments outpacing the Broadline sales growth, as well as the contributions to sales growth from the acquisitions of specialty meat, specialty produce and SYGMA operations during fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. Marketing associate served sales as a percentage of Broadline sales in the U.S. remained the same at 54.0% in fiscal 2006 and 2005. SYSCO Brand sales as a percentage of Broadline sales in the U.S. decreased to 55.4% for fiscal 2006 as compared to 57.4% in fiscal 2005. The increase in earnings before income taxes for fiscal 2006 were primarily due to increases in sales partially offset by higher fuel costs and the continued investment in the National Supply Chain project. The increase in earnings before income taxes for fiscal 2005 was primarily due to increases in sales and increased operating efficiencies aided by lower expenses as a percentage of sales. Factors contributing to the lower expenses as a percentage of sales were reduced performance based management incentive compensation and decreased net periodic pension costs, which overcame higher fuel costs and increased expenditures related to the National Supply Chain project. The comparison of fiscal 2005s earnings before income taxes to fiscal 2004 was also negatively impacted by the additional 53rd week in fiscal 2004. SYGMA Segment Sales for fiscal 2006 were 10.8% greater than fiscal 2005. The adoption of EITF 04 13 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 reduced sales growth in fiscal 2006 by 1.1%, or $42,560,000. Sales for fiscal 2005 were 10.4% greater than fiscal 2004. Acquisitions contributed 0.5% to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2006 and 2.6% for fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2006 growth was due primarily to sales to new customers and sales growth in SYGMAs existing customer base related to new locations added by those customers, each of which temporarily increases SYGMAs cost to service the customers. In addition, certain customers were transferred from Broadline operations to be serviced by SYGMA operations, contributing to the sales increase. Fiscal 2005 sales growth was due primarily to sales to new customers, sales growth in SYGMAs existing customer base related to new locations added by those customers, as well as increases in sales to existing locations, price increases resulting primarily from higher product costs and sales from acquisitions. The comparison of fiscal 2005 sales to fiscal 2004 is negatively impacted by the additional week in fiscal 2004. The decrease in earnings before income taxes in fiscal 2006 was due to several factors. Certain of SYGMAs customers have experienced a slowdown in their business. This in turn results in lower cases per delivery and therefore reduced gross margin dollars per stop. In addition, SYGMA has experienced increased fuel costs, startup costs related to new facilities, costs incurred on information systems projects and increased workers compensation costs. The decrease in earnings before income taxes in fiscal 2005 was due to several factors. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and the first quarter of fiscal 2005, SYGMA discontinued servicing a portion of its largest customers locations due to that customers geographic supply chain realignment. SYGMA offset these lost sales by obtaining sales from additional locations from this customer and obtaining new business from other customers. In many cases, this new business is being served out of different SYGMA locations than those that originally served the discontinued business. SYGMA opened a new facility to serve a portion of the new business which it began serving in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. As a result, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and throughout fiscal 2005, SYGMAs operating profits have been impacted by increased operating expenses as it transitioned its operations to serve the new business it has acquired. In addition, SYGMAs gross margins as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2005 have declined from the comparable period in fiscal 2004 due to product cost increases and lower agreed upon pricing with its customers. 19 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources SYSCO provides marketing and distribution services to foodservice customers primarily throughout the United States and Canada. The company intends to continue to expand its market share through profitable sales growth, foldouts and acquisitions. The company also strives to increase the effectiveness of its customer contact personnel and its consolidated buying programs, as well as the productivity of its warehousing and distribution activities. These objectives require continuing investment. SYSCOs resources include cash provided by operations and access to capital from financial markets. SYSCOs operations historically have produced significant cash flow. Cash generated from operations is first allocated to working capital requirements; investments in facilities, fleet and other equipment required to meet customers needs; cash dividends; and acquisitions compatible with the companys overall growth strategy. Any remaining cash generated from operations may, at the discretion of management, be applied toward a portion of the cost of the share repurchase program, while the remainder of the cost may be financed with additional long term debt. SYSCOs share repurchase program is used primarily to offset shares issued under various employee benefit and compensation plans, for acquisitions, to reduce shares outstanding (which may have the net effect of increasing earnings per share) and to aid in managing the ratio of long term debt to total capitalization. Management targets a long term debt to total capitalization ratio between 35% and 40%. The ratio may exceed the target range from time to time, due to borrowings incurred in order to fund acquisitions and internal growth opportunities, and due to fluctuations in the timing and amount of share repurchases. The ratio also may fall below the target range due to strong cash flow from operations and fluctuations in the timing and amount of share repurchases. This ratio was 36.2% and 33.1% at July 1, 2006 and July 2, 2005, respectively. For purposes of calculating this ratio, long term debt includes both the current maturities and long term portion. Operating Activities Cash flow from operations in fiscal 2006 was negatively impacted by an increase in inventory balances of $119,392,000 and an increase in accounts receivable balances of $162,586,000, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable balances of $49,775,000. Cash flow from operations in fiscal 2005 was negatively impacted by an increase in inventory balances of $35,014,000 and an increase in accounts receivable balances of $72,829,000, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable balances of $28,080,000. Cash flow from operations in fiscal 2004 was negatively impacted by an increase in inventory balances of $162,502,000 and an increase in accounts receivable balances of $177,058,000, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable balances of $95,874,000. The increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances were primarily a result of sales growth. Accounts payable balances are impacted by many factors, including changes in product mix, cash discount terms and changes in payment terms with vendors due to the use of more efficient electronic payment methods. Also impacting cash flow from operations was an increase in accrued expenses of $29,161,000 in fiscal 2006, a decrease in accrued expenses of $52,423,000 in fiscal 2005 and an increase in accrued expenses of $26,687,000 in fiscal 2004. The increase in accrued expenses for fiscal 2006, was related to various miscellaneous accruals while the changes in accrued expenses for fiscal 2005 and 2004 were primarily due to the amount of accrued incentive bonuses related to those years. Also impacting cash flow from operations was an increase in other long term liabilities and prepaid pension cost of $75,382,000 in fiscal 2006, and decreases of $86,338,000 in fiscal 2005 and $35,056,000 in fiscal 2004. The increases in other long term liabilities and prepaid pension cost in fiscal 2006 are primarily due to the amount of net pension cost recognized exceeding the amount of pension contribution during the year. The decreases in other long term liabilities and prepaid pension cost in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 are primarily due to the amount of pension contributions exceeding the net pension cost recognized in each year. The companys contributions to its defined benefit plans were $73,764,000, $220,361,000 and $165,512,000 during fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. Included in the amounts contributed in fiscal 2006 was $66,000,000 voluntarily contributed to the qualified pension plan representing the maximum tax deductible amount. Included in the amount contributed for fiscal 2005 was $134,000,000 voluntarily contributed to the qualified pension plan in the fourth quarter in addition to the $80,000,000 which was contributed during the year. The decision to increase the contributions to the Retirement Plan in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate used to measure the year end obligation, which increased the pension obligation and negatively impacted the fiscal 2005 year end pension funded status prior to the additional $134,000,000 contribution. The company expects to contribute approximately $90,000,000 to its defined benefit plans in fiscal 2007. 20 Table of Contents One of the factors increasing the amount of taxes paid in fiscal 2006 as compared to the amounts paid in fiscal 2005 was the amount of deductible pension contributions made during the year. As discussed above, the companys pension contributions were substantially lower in fiscal 2006 than in the preceding fiscal years. The amount of taxes paid in fiscal 2004 was reduced by $70,615,000 as the result of the utilization of a U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward. This net operating loss carryforward was generated in fiscal 2003 primarily as a result of the deferral of supply chain distributions. Investing Activities Fiscal 2006 capital expenditures included the construction of fold out facilities in Springfield, Illinois; Geneva, Alabama; and Knoxville, Tennessee, replacement or significant expansion of facilities in Raleigh, North Carolina; Columbus, Ohio; Albuquerque, New Mexico; and Denver, Colorado, and continuing work on the corporate headquarters expansion. Fiscal 2005 capital expenditures included the construction of fold out facilities in Spokane, Washington and Geneva, Alabama, replacement or significant expansion of facilities in Baltimore, Maryland; Cleveland, Ohio; Denver, Colorado; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Miami, Florida; and Hartford, Connecticut, and the completion of the Northeast Redistribution Center in Front Royal, Virginia. Fiscal 2004 capital expenditures included the construction of fold out facilities in Oxnard, California and Fargo, North Dakota, replacement or significant expansion of facilities in Billings, Montana; Cleveland, Ohio; Jacksonville, Florida; Miami, Florida; and San Antonio, Texas, and the Northeast Redistribution Center in Front Royal, Virginia, as well as continued expenditures related to the National Supply Chain project. Total capital expenditures in fiscal 2007 are expected to be in the range of $575,000,000 to $625,000,000. Fiscal 2007 expenditures will include the continuation of the fold out program; facility, fleet and other equipment replacements and expansions; the corporate office expansion; the companys National Supply Chain project; and investments in technology. During fiscal 2006, SYSCO acquired for cash one broadline foodservice operation, one custom meat cutting operation and five specialty produce distributors. During fiscal 2005, SYSCO acquired for cash one broadline foodservice operation, four custom meat cutting operations, and two specialty produce distributors. During fiscal 2004, SYSCO acquired for cash certain assets of two broadline foodservice operations, a specialty produce distributor, and one quickservice operation. Financing Activities The company routinely engages in Board approved share repurchase programs. The number of shares acquired and their cost during the past three fiscal years was 16,479,800 shares for $544,131,000 in fiscal 2006, 16,790,200 shares for $597,660,000 in fiscal 2005, and 16,454,300 shares for $608,506,000 in fiscal 2004. An additional 673,400 shares have been purchased at a cost of $20,191,000 through August 26, 2006, resulting in 18,665,500 shares remaining available for repurchase as authorized by the Board as of that date. The company made four regular quarterly dividend payments during each of fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004. SYSCO began paying the current quarterly dividend rate of $0.17 per share in January 2006, an increase from the $0.15 per share that became effective in January 2005. In May 2006, SYSCO declared its regular quarterly dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 of $0.17 per share, which was paid in July 2006. In September 2006, SYSCO also declared its regular quarterly dividend for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 of $0.17 per share, payable in October 2006. In November 2000, the company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement covering 30,000,000 shares of common stock to be offered from time to time in connection with acquisitions. As of August 26, 2006, 29,477,835 shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement. In March 2004, SYSCO issued 4.60% notes totaling $200,000,000 due March 15, 2014 in a private offering. Proceeds from the notes were utilized to retire outstanding commercial paper. In June 2005, SYSCO repaid the 6.5% senior notes totaling $150,000,000 at maturity utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances. In July 2005, SYSCO repaid the 4.75% senior notes totaling $200,000,000 at maturity also utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances. 21 Table of Contents In April 2005, SYSCO filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement covering $1,500,000,000 in debt securities. The registration statement was declared effective in May 2005. In September 2005, SYSCO issued 5.375% senior notes totaling $500,000,000 due on September 21, 2035, under its April 2005 shelf registration. These notes, which were priced at 99.911% of par, are unsecured, are not subject to any sinking fund requirement and include a redemption provision which allows SYSCO to retire the notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the noteholders are not penalized by the early redemption. Proceeds from the notes were utilized to retire commercial paper issuances outstanding as of September 2005. In March 2005, SYSCO entered into a forward starting interest rate swap with a notional amount of $350,000,000 as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the cash outflows of interest payments on the forecasted debt issuance due to changes in the benchmark interest rate. The fair value of the swap as of July 2, 2005 was ($32,584,000), which is reflected in Accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, with the corresponding amount reflected as a loss, net of tax, in Other comprehensive income (loss). In September 2005, in conjunction with the issuance of the 5.375% senior notes described above, SYSCO settled the $350,000,000 notional amount forward starting interest rate swap. Upon termination, SYSCO paid cash of $21,196,000, which represented the fair value liability associated with the swap agreement at the time of termination. This amount is being amortized as interest expense over the 30 year term of the debt, and the unamortized balance is reflected as a loss, net of tax, in Other comprehensive income (loss). In May 2006, SYSCO repaid at maturity the 7.0% senior notes totaling $200,000,000 utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances. SYSCO has uncommitted bank lines of credit, which provided for unsecured borrowings for working capital of up to $145,000,000, of which $29,300,000 was outstanding as of July 1, 2006 and $13,400,000 was outstanding as of August 26, 2006. In November 2005, SYSCO and one of its subsidiaries, SYSCO International, Co., entered into a new revolving credit facility to support the companys U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs. The facility, which was increased to $750,000,000 in March 2006, may be increased up to $1,000,000,000 at the option of the company, and terminates on November 4, 2010, subject to extension. The facility replaced the previous $450,000,000 (U.S. dollar) and $100,000,000 (Canadian dollar) revolving credit agreements in the U.S. and Canada, respectively, both of which were terminated. In April 2006, SYSCO initiated a new commercial paper program allowing the company to issue short term unsecured notes in aggregate not to exceed $1.3 billion. This new commercial paper program replaced notes that were issued under SYSCOs previous commercial paper program as they matured and became due and payable. During fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, aggregate outstanding commercial paper issuances and short term bank borrowings ranged from approximately $126,846,000 to $774,530,000, $28,560,000 to $253,384,000, and $73,102,000 to $478,114,000, respectively. Outstanding commercial paper issuances were $399,568,000 as of July 1, 2006 and $464,917,000 as of August 26, 2006. Total debt at July 1, 2006 was $1,762,692,000, of which approximately 75% was at fixed rates averaging 6.0% and the remainder was at floating rates averaging 5.2%. Included in current maturities of long term debt at July 1, 2006 are the 7.25% senior notes totaling $100,000,000, which mature in April 2007. It is the companys intention to fund the repayment of these notes at maturity through issuances of commercial paper, senior notes or a combination thereof. As part of normal business activities, SYSCO issues letters of credit through major banking institutions as required by certain vendor and insurance agreements. As of July 1, 2006 and July 2, 2005, letters of credit outstanding were $60,000,000 and $76,817,000, respectively. SYSCOs affiliate, BSCC, is a cooperative for income tax purposes. SYSCO believes that the cooperative entity is appropriate for BSCC based on the business operations of this affiliate and on the legal structure applied. However, if the application of the cooperative structure was to be disallowed by any federal, state or local tax authority, SYSCO could be required to accelerate the payment of a portion or all of its income tax liabilities that it otherwise has deferred until future periods and be liable for interest on such amounts. Amounts included as deferred income tax liabilities related to BSCC deferred supply chain distributions were $924,902,000 as of July 1, 2006. If SYSCO was required to accelerate a significant portion of these deferred tax liabilities, the company may be required to raise additional capital through debt financing or the issuance of equity or it may be required to forego or defer planned capital expenditures or share repurchases or a combination thereof and may be required to pay interest on amounts deferred. 22 Table of Contents In summary, management believes that the companys cash flows from operations, as well as the availability of additional capital under its existing commercial paper programs, bank lines of credit, debt shelf registration and its ability to access capital from financial markets in the future, will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements while maintaining proper liquidity for normal operating purposes. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business with customers, vendors and others, SYSCO has entered into off balance sheet arrangements, such as letters of credit, which totaled $60,000,000 as of July 1, 2006. Additionally, other than normal long term non capitalized leases included in the Contractual Obligations table below, the company does not have any material off balance sheet financing arrangements. None of these off balance sheet arrangements either has, or is likely to have, a material effect on SYSCOs current or future financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth certain information concerning SYSCOs obligations and commitments to make contractual future payments: Payments Due by Period Less Than More Than Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years (In thousands) Recorded Contractual Obligations: Short term debt and commercial paper $ 428,868 $ 29,300 $ $ 399,568 $ Long term debt 1,305,415 102,269 3,852 7,403 1,191,891 Capital lease obligations 28,409 3,996 1,706 1,388 21,319 Deferred compensation(1) 116,236 6,641 9,556 9,159 90,880 SERP and other postretirement plans(2) 211,691 9,356 25,104 37,413 139,818 Unrecorded Contractual Obligations: Interest payments related to debt(3) 1,293,133 67,874 123,760 123,760 977,739 Long term non capitalized leases 331,278 56,499 86,803 58,995 128,981 Purchase obligations(4) 1,050,109 810,903 74,613 66,185 98,408 Total contractual cash obligations $ 4,765,139 $ 1,086,838 $ 325,394 $ 703,871 $ 2,649,036 (1) The estimate of the timing of future payments under the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan involves the use of certain assumptions, including retirement ages and payout periods. (2) Includes estimated contributions to the unfunded SERP and other postretirement benefit plans made in amounts needed to fund benefit payments for vested participants in these plans through fiscal 2015, based on actuarial assumptions. (3) Includes payments on floating rate debt based on rates as of July 1, 2006, assuming amount remains unchanged until maturity, and payments on fixed rate debt based on maturity dates. (4) For purposes of this table, purchase obligations include agreements for purchases of product in the normal course of business, for which all significant terms have been confirmed. Such amounts included in the table above are based on estimates. Purchase obligations also includes amounts committed with a third party to provide hardware and hardware hosting services (See discussion under Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8). Purchase obligations exclude full requirements electricity contracts where no stated minimum purchase volume is required. Certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration, typically payable only in the event that certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved. Aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of July 1, 2006 included $147,572,000 in cash. This amount is not included in the table above. No obligations were included in the table above for the qualified retirement plan because as of July 1, 2006, SYSCO does not have a minimum funding requirements under ERISA guidelines for this plan due to its previous voluntary contributions. 23 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements. Significant accounting policies employed by SYSCO are presented in the notes to the financial statements. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations. These policies require managements most subjective or complex judgments, often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Senior management has reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates and this related disclosure. SYSCOs most critical accounting policies pertain to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, self insurance programs, pension plans, income taxes, vendor consideration, accounting for business combinations and share based compensation. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts SYSCO evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and determines the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors. In circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligation, a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected. In addition, allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on analysis of historical trends of write offs and recoveries. The company utilizes specific criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be written off, including bankruptcy, accounts referred to outside parties for collection and accounts past due over specified periods. If the financial condition of SYSCOs customers were to deteriorate, additional allowances may be required. Self Insurance Program SYSCO maintains a self insurance program covering portions of workers compensation, group medical, general liability and vehicle liability costs. The amounts in excess of the self insured levels are fully insured by third party insurers. Liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience, medical cost trends, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. In an attempt to mitigate the risks of workers compensation, vehicle and general liability claims, safety procedures and awareness programs have been implemented. Pension Plans Amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis. Three of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits, the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets. The measurement date for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans is fiscal year end for fiscal years 2005 and prior. Beginning in fiscal 2006, the measurement date is May 31st which represents a change in accounting. The one month acceleration of the measurement date allows additional time for management to evaluate and report the actuarial pension measurements in the year end financial statements and disclosures within the accelerated filing deadlines of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The cumulative effect of this change in accounting resulted in an increase to earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 of $9,285,000, net of tax. For guidance in determining the discount rate, SYSCO calculates the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality fixed income investments for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the pension plan. The discount rate assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate. The discount rate assumption utilized impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs. The discount rate utilized to determine net pension costs for fiscal 2006 decreased 0.65% to 5.60% from the discount rate utilized to determine net pension costs for fiscal 2005 of 6.25%. This 0.65% decrease in the discount rate increased SYSCOs net pension costs for fiscal 2006 by approximately $29,300,000. The discount rate for determining fiscal 2007 net pension costs, which was determined as of the May 31, 2006 measurement date, increased 1.13% to 6.73%. This 1.13% increase will decrease SYSCOs net pension costs for fiscal 2007 by an estimated $53,079,000. 24 Table of Contents SYSCO looks to actual plan experience in determining the rates of increase in compensation levels. SYSCO used a plan specific age related set of rates for the qualified pension plan (Retirement Plan), which are equivalent to a single rate of 6.17% and 5.89%, respectively, as of July 1, 2006 and July 2, 2005. The Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan assumes annual salary increases of 10% through fiscal 2007 and 7% thereafter as of July 1, 2006 and July 2, 2005. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets of the Retirement Plan was 9.00% for fiscal 2006 and 2005. The expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns, reflecting a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and the forward looking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on long term bonds and the historical returns of the major stock markets. Although not determinative of future returns, the effective annual rate of return on plan assets, developed using geometric/compound averaging, was approximately 10.3%, 8.4%, 4.0% and 5.9% over the 20 year, 10 year, 5 year and 1 year periods ended December 31, 2005, respectively. In addition, in nine of the last 15 years, the actual return on plan assets has exceeded 9.00%. The rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate. The expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs. A 1.0% increase (decrease) in the assumed rate of return for fiscal 2007 would decrease (increase) SYSCOs net pension costs for fiscal 2007 by approximately $12,972,000. Minimum pension liability adjustments result when the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets and are recorded so that the recorded pension liability is at a minimum equal to the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation. Minimum pension liability adjustments are non cash adjustments that are reflected as an increase (or decrease) in the pension liability and an offsetting charge (or benefit) to shareholders equity, net of tax, through accumulated other comprehensive loss (or income). Amounts reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to minimum pension liability, were charges, net of tax, of $11,106,000 as of July 1, 2006, and $54,286,000 as of July 2, 2005. Changes in the assumptions, including changes to the discount rate discussed above, together with the normal growth of the plan, the impact of actuarial losses from prior periods and the timing and amount of contributions, increased net pension costs $23,700,000 in fiscal 2006 and is expected to decrease net pension costs in fiscal 2007 by approximately $53,900,000. The company made cash contributions to its pension plans of $73,764,000 and $220,361,000 in fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively, including voluntary contributions to the Retirement Plan of $66,000,000 and $214,000,000 in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively. In fiscal 2006, the companys voluntary contribution to the Retirement Plan represented the maximum tax deductible amount. In fiscal 2005, the company made a voluntary contribution of $134,000,000 in the fourth quarter in addition to the $80,000,000 which was contributed during the year. The decision to increase the contributions to the Retirement Plan in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate used to measure the year end obligation, which increased the pension obligation and negatively impacted the fiscal 2005 year end pension funded status prior to the additional $134,000,000 contribution. In fiscal 2007, as in the previous years, contributions to the Retirement Plan will not be required to meet ERISA minimum funding requirements but the company anticipates that it will make voluntary contributions of approximately $80,000,000, which is not greater than the estimated maximum amount that will be tax deductible in fiscal 2007. The estimated fiscal 2007 contributions to fund benefit payments for the SERP and other post retirement plans together are approximately $10,000,000. Income Taxes The determination of the companys provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. The companys provision for income taxes reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various U.S. federal and state, as well as Canadian federal and provincial jurisdictions. Jurisdictional tax law changes, increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items, accruals or adjustments of accruals for tax contingencies or valuation allowances, and the companys change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate. In evaluating the exposures connected with the various tax filing positions, the company establishes an accrual when, despite managements belief that the companys tax return positions are supportable, management believes that certain positions may be successfully challenged and a loss is probable. When facts and circumstances change, these accruals are adjusted. 25 Table of Contents Vendor Consideration SYSCO recognizes consideration received from vendors when the services performed in connection with the monies received are completed and when the related product has been sold by SYSCO. There are several types of cash consideration received from vendors. In many instances, the vendor consideration is in the form of a specified amount per case or per pound. In these instances, SYSCO will recognize the vendor consideration as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold. In the situations where the vendor consideration is not related directly to specific product purchases, SYSCO will recognize these as a reduction of cost of sales when the earnings process is complete, the related service is performed and the amounts realized. In certain of these latter instances, the vendor consideration represents a reimbursement of a specific incremental identifiable cost incurred by SYSCO. In these cases, SYSCO classifies the consideration as a reduction of those costs with any excess funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales and recognizes these in the period in which the costs are incurred and related services performed. Accounting for Business Combinations Goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired. Certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired, including goodwill and other intangible assets, as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit. In addition, SYSCO assesses the recoverability of these intangibles by determining whether the fair values of the applicable reporting units exceed their carrying values. The evaluation of fair value requires the use of projections, estimates and assumptions as to the future performance of the operations in performing a discounted cash flow analysis, as well as assumptions regarding sales and earnings multiples that would be applied in comparable acquisitions in the industry. Actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections, resulting in the company revising its assumptions and, if required, recognizing an impairment loss. Share Based Compensation SYSCO provides compensation benefits to employees and non employee directors under several share based payment arrangements including various employee stock option plans, the Employees Stock Purchase Plan, the Management Incentive Plans and the Non Employee Directors Stock Plan. Prior to July 3, 2005, SYSCO accounted for its stock option plans and the Employees Stock Purchase Plan using the intrinsic value method of accounting provided under APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, (APB 25) and related interpretations, as permitted by FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, (SFAS 123) under which no compensation expense was recognized for stock option grants and issuances of stock pursuant to the Employees Stock Purchase Plan. However, share based compensation expense was recognized in periods prior to fiscal 2006 (and continues to be recognized) for stock issuances pursuant to the Management Incentive Plans and stock grants to non employee directors. Share based compensation was included as a pro forma disclosure in the financial statement footnotes and continues to be provided for periods prior to fiscal 2006. Effective July 3, 2005, SYSCO adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective transition method. Under this transition method, compensation cost recognized in fiscal 2006 includes: a) compensation cost for all share based payments granted through July 2, 2005, but for which the requisite service period had not been completed as of July 2, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123, and b) compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to July 2, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123(R). Results for prior periods have not been restated. As a result of adopting SFAS 123(R) on July 3, 2005, SYSCOs earnings before income taxes and net earnings for fiscal 2006 were $118,038,000 and $105,810,000 lower, respectively, than if the company had continued to account for share based compensation under APB 25. Basic and diluted earnings per share before the cumulative effect of the accounting change for fiscal 2006 were both $0.17 lower than if the company had continued to account for share based compensation under APB 25. As of July 1, 2006, there was $112,111,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to share based compensation arrangements. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.72 years. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a Black Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of SYSCOs stock, implied volatilities from traded options on SYSCOs stock and other factors. SYSCO utilizes historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model; separate 26 Table of Contents groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The risk free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The fair value of the stock issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan is calculated as the difference between the stock price and the employee purchase price. The fair value of the stock issued under the Management Incentive Plans is based on the stock price less a 12% discount for post vesting restrictions. The discount for post vesting restrictions is estimated based on restricted stock studies and by calculating the cost of a hypothetical protective put option over the restriction period. The compensation cost related to these share based awards is recognized over the requisite service period. The requisite service period is generally the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. The compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from awards under the Management Incentive Plans is accrued over the fiscal year to which the incentive bonus relates. The compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from employee purchases of stock under the Employees Stock Purchase Plan is recognized during the quarter in which the employee payroll withholdings are made. Certain of SYSCOs option awards are generally subject to graded vesting over a service period. In those cases, SYSCO will recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. In other cases, certain of SYSCOs option awards provide for graded vesting over a service period but include a performance based provision allowing for the vesting to accelerate. In these cases, if it is probable that the performance condition will be met, SYSCO recognizes compensation cost on a straight line basis over the shorter performance period; otherwise, it recognizes compensation cost over the probable longer service period. In addition, certain of SYSCOs options provide that if the optionee retires at certain age and years of service thresholds, the options continue to vest as if the optionee continued to be an employee. In these cases, for awards granted prior to July 2, 2005, SYSCO will recognize the compensation cost for such awards over the service period and accelerate any remaining unrecognized compensation cost when the employee retires. For awards granted subsequent to July 3, 2005, SYSCO will recognize compensation cost for such awards over the period from the date of grant to the date the employee first becomes eligible to retire with his options continuing to vest after retirement. New Accounting Standards The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position No. FTB 85 4 1, Accounting for Life Settlement Contracts by Third Party Investors (FSP FTB 85 4 1), in March 2006 which allows an investor to account for its investments in a life settlement contract using either the investment method or the fair value method. The investment method requires the initial investment to be recognized at the transaction price, while the fair value method requires the initial investment to be recognized at its transaction price and remeasured to fair value each subsequent reporting period. This standard was adopted by the FASB to address volatility concerns when underlying investments are maintained in the stock market. The election of the investment method or fair value method is irrevocable and should be made on an instrument by instrument basis. Previously, only the fair value method was available. FSP FTB 85 4 1 is effective for SYSCO in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Prospective application is required for all new investments in life settlement contracts, and a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings should be made at the date of adoption to recognize the impact on existing life settlement contract investments. SYSCO will adopt FSP FTB 85 4 1 in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 using the investment method which will result in a cumulative change in accounting principle charge of approximately $39,735,000. In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109 (SFAS 109). FIN 48 clarifies the application of SFAS 109 by defining criteria that an individual tax position must meet for any part of the benefit of that position to be recognized in the financial statements. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on the measurement, derecognition, classification and disclosure of tax positions, along with accounting for the related interest and penalties. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. SYSCO is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of FIN 48 will have on the companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 27 Table of Contents Forward Looking Statements Certain statements made herein that look forward in time or express managements expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future events are forward looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. They include statements about SYSCOs ability to increase its market share and sales, long term debt to capitalization target ratios, anticipated capital expenditures, timing and expected benefits of the National Supply Chain project and related regional distribution centers, the potential outcome of ongoing tax audits and SYSCOs ability to meet future cash requirements and remain profitable. These statements are based on managements current expectations and estimates; actual results may differ materially due in part to the risk factors discussed above. In addition, SYSCOs ability to increase its market share and sales, meet future cash requirements and remain profitable could be affected by conditions in the economy and the industry and internal factors such as the ability to control expenses, including fuel costs. The ability to meet long term debt to capitalization target ratios also may be affected by cash flow including amounts spent on share repurchases and acquisitions and internal growth. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk SYSCO does not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes. SYSCOs use of debt directly exposes the company to interest rate risk. Floating rate debt, where the interest rate fluctuates periodically, exposes the company to short term changes in market interest rates. Fixed rate debt, where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument, exposes the company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate. SYSCO manages its debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that goal. The major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments, potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions. In September 2005, SYSCO issued 5.375% senior notes totaling $500,000,000 due on September 21, 2035. In conjunction with the issuance of the 5.375% senior notes, SYSCO settled a $350,000,000 notional amount forward starting interest rate swap which was designated as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the cash outflows of interest payments on the debt issuance due to changes in the benchmark interest rate. At July 1, 2006, the company had outstanding $399,568,000 of commercial paper at variable rates of interest with maturities through July 3, 2006. The companys total long term debt obligations of $1,733,392,000 were primarily at fixed rates of interest. The company had no interest rate swaps outstanding at July 1, 2006. In the following table as of July 1, 2006, commercial paper issuances are reflected as floating rate debt and both the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper issuances outstanding are classified as long term based on the maturity date of the companys revolving loan agreement which supports the companys U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs and the companys intent to continue to refinance this facility on a long term basis. The following table presents the companys interest rate position as of July 1, 2006. All amounts are stated in U.S. dollar equivalents.

The companys total long term debt obligations of $1,367,110,000 were primarily at fixed rates of interest. At that time, management believed that present market conditions reflected fixed long term rates near historical lows. As such, management believed that fixed long term rates presented a better opportunity than in the recent past and had the intent to issue between $350,000,000 and $500,000,000 of long term debt at fixed rates with extended terms in September 2005, the amount to be issued depending upon market conditions at the time of issuance. In March 2005, SYSCO entered into a forward starting interest rate swap with a notional amount of $350,000,000 as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the cash outflows of interest payments on $350,000,000 of the forecasted debt issuance due to changes in the benchmark interest rate. The issuance of this long term debt in fiscal 2006 is discussed above. During part of fiscal 2005, SYSCO had several fixed to floating interest rate swaps outstanding. These were entered into in fiscal 2004 as management believed that floating interest rates were more advantageous. During fiscal 2005, SYSCO terminated the fixed to floating interest rate swaps outstanding locking in effective yields on the related debt. In the following tables as of July 2, 2005, commercial paper issuances are reflected as floating rate debt and the U.S. commercial paper is classified as long term based on the maturity date of the companys revolving loan agreement which supports the companys U.S. commercial paper program and the companys intent to continue to refinance this facility on a long term basis.

To the extent that business transactions are not denominated in Canadian dollars, the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk. SYSCO will also incur gains and losses within shareholders equity due to translation of the financial statements from Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars. The Canadian financing subsidiary has notes denominated in U.S. dollars, which has the potential to create taxable income in Canada when the debt is paid due to changes in the exchange rate from the inception of the debt through the payment date. A 10% unfavorable change in the fiscal 2006 year end exchange rate would not materially increase the tax liability associated with these notes. The company does not routinely enter into material agreements to hedge foreign currency risks. 29 Table of Contents The price and availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due to changes in production, seasonality and other market factors generally outside of our control. Increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on the companys results of operations in three areas. First, the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home. Second, the high cost of fuel can increase the price paid by SYSCO for product purchases for which SYSCO may not be able to pass these costs fully to its customers. Third, increased fuel costs impact the costs incurred by SYSCO to deliver product to its customers. During fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, fuel costs represented approximately 0.5%, 0.4% and 0.3% of sales, respectively. Fuel costs incurred by SYSCO in fiscal 2006 increased by approximately $48,600,000 over fiscal 2005. In order to partially manage the volatility and uncertainty of fuel costs, SYSCO from time to time will enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of SYSCOs projected monthly diesel fuel requirements. Forward diesel fuel purchase commitments outstanding as of July 1, 2006 were not material. 30 Table of Contents
