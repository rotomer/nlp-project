Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Highlights Sales increased 7.4% in fiscal 2007 over the prior year. Accounting pronouncement EITF 04 13 (see below) negatively impacted sales growth in fiscal 2007 by 0.7% and also affects the comparison of gross margins, operating expenses and earnings as a percentage of sales between the periods. Gross margins as a percentage of sales were 19.3% for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2007 decreased from the prior year, reflecting efficiencies in our operating activities. Decreases in pension and share based compensation expenses and higher gains related to the cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance policies were largely offset by increased management incentive bonus accruals and investments in strategic business initiatives. Earnings before the cumulative effect of accounting change increased 18.3% for fiscal 2007 over the prior year. Diluted earnings per share before the cumulative effect of accounting change increased 18.5% for fiscal 2007 over the prior year. Overview SYSCO distributes food and related products to restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments and other foodservice customers. Our operations are located throughout the United States and Canada and include broadline companies, specialty produce companies, custom cut meat operations, hotel supply operations, SYGMA (our chain restaurant distribution subsidiary) and a company that distributes to internationally located chain restaurants. We estimate that we serve about 15% of an approximately $225 billion annual market that includes foodservice market and hotel amenity, furniture and textile market both in the United States and Canada. According to industry sources, the foodservice, or food prepared away from home, market represents approximately one half of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level. This share grew from about 37% in 1972 to about 50% in 1998 and has not changed materially since that time. General economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect the frequency of purchases and amounts spent by consumers for food prepared away from home and, in turn, can impact our sales. Historically, we have grown at a faster rate than the overall industry and have grown our market share in this fragmented industry. We intend to continue to expand our market share and grow earnings by focusing on sales growth, brand management, productivity gains, sales force effectiveness and supply chain management. Strategic Business Initiatives In fiscal 2006, our executive team, with the approval of the Board of Directors, established a strategy team to examine many aspects of our businesses with an emphasis on strategic focus areas which would help us achieve our long term vision of becoming the global leader of the efficient, multi temperature food product value chain. During fiscal 2007, we began to move from identifying strategic opportunities and developing a strategy process to implementing the initiatives that came from that process. Near the end of the fiscal year, we announced new responsibilities for several executives as we integrated the strategy teams and their initiatives into our business. A strategic management function will remain in place to help put strategic business initiatives into action and continue to refine and develop corporate strategy. The following areas generally comprise the initiatives that will serve as the foundation of our efforts to ensure a sustainable future. Each area is staffed with SYSCO associates focused on the following: Sourcing and National Supply Chain focuses on lowering our cost of goods sold by leveraging SYSCOs purchasing power and procurement expertise and capitalizing on an end to end view of our supply chain. We expect our National Supply Chain project to lower inventory, operating costs, working capital requirements and future facility expansion needs at our operating companies while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers. Integrated Delivery focuses on standardized processes to optimize warehouse and delivery activities across the corporation and manage energy consumption to achieve a more efficient delivery of products to our customers. Demand explores and implements initiatives to better understand and more profitably sell to and service SYSCOs customers, including better tools and techniques for selling. Organizational Capabilities works to align management reporting, information technology systems and performance measures with the business initiatives. A major component of our National Supply Chain project entails the use of redistribution centers (RDCs). The first RDC, the Northeast RDC located in Front Royal, Virginia, opened during the third quarter of fiscal 2005. In January 2006, we completed the purchase of land in Alachua, Florida for the future site of our second RDC, which will service our five broadline operating companies in Florida. Construction of the building site is in progress and this facility is expected to be operational in fiscal 2008. In March 2007, we purchased the site for construction of a third RDC in Hamlet, Indiana. 12 Table of Contents We will continue to use our strategic business initiatives to help us grow by leveraging our market leadership position to continuously improve how our associates buy, handle and market products for our customers. Our primary focus is on growing and optimizing the core foodservice distribution business in North America. We are currently working to expand our import and export business. We will also continue to explore and identify opportunities to grow our global capabilities and stay abreast of international acquisition opportunities. Accounting Changes As of June 30, 2007, we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) (SFAS 158). The recognition provision requires an employer to recognize a plans funded status in its statement of financial position and recognize the changes in a postretirement benefit plans funded status in comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur. The effect of adoption on our consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2007 was a decrease in prepaid pension cost of $83,846,000, a decrease in other assets of $43,854,000, an increase in accrued expenses of $10,967,000, a decrease in long term deferred taxes of $73,328,000, an increase in other long term liabilities of $52,289,000, and a charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss of $117,268,000. The adoption of SFAS 158s recognition provision did not have an effect on our consolidated balance sheet as of July 1, 2006. The adoption has no effect on our consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2007, or for any prior year presented, and it will not affect our consolidated results of operations in future periods. SFAS 158 also has a measurement date provision, which is a requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal year end statement of financial position, effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. In the first quarter of fiscal 2006, we changed the measurement date for pension and other postretirement benefit plans from fiscal year end to May 31st to assist us in meeting accelerated SEC filing dates. As a result of this change, we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting, which increased net earnings for fiscal 2006 by $9,285,000, net of tax. With the issuance of SFAS 158, we have elected to early adopt the measurement date provision in order to adopt both provisions of this accounting standard at the same time. As a result, beginning in fiscal 2008, the measurement date will return to correspond with our fiscal year end. We have performed measurements as of May 31, 2007 and June 30, 2007 of our plan assets and benefit obligations. We will record a charge to beginning retained earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 of approximately $4,000,000, net of tax, for the impact of the cumulative difference in our pension expense between the two measurement dates. We will also record a benefit to beginning accumulated other comprehensive loss in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 of approximately $23,000,000, net of tax, for the impact of the difference in our balance sheet recognition provision between the two measurement dates. In the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we adopted accounting pronouncement EITF 04 13 Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty, (EITF 04 13). The accounting standard requires certain transactions, where inventory is purchased by us from a customer and then resold at a later date to the same customer (as defined), to be presented in the income statement on a net basis. This situation primarily arises for SYSCO when a customer has a proprietary item which they have either manufactured or sourced, but they require our distribution and logistics capabilities to get the product to their locations. The application of this standard requires sales and cost of sales to be reduced by the same amount for these transactions and thus net earnings are unaffected by the application of this standard. We adopted this accounting pronouncement beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and have applied it to similar transactions prospectively. Prior period sales and cost of sales have not been restated. Therefore, the calculation of sales growth and the comparison of gross margins, operating expenses and earnings as a percentage of sales between the non comparable periods is affected. The impact of adopting this standard resulted in sales being reduced by $99,803,000 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and $253,724,000 for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2007, without a reduction in sales for the comparable prior year periods. Beginning with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, sales are reported on a comparable accounting basis with the comparable prior year period. In fiscal 2006, we adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, (SFAS 123(R)) utilizing the modified prospective transition method under which prior period results have not been restated. Our consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2006 include incremental share based compensation cost over what would have been recorded had the company continued to account for share based compensation under APB 25 of $118,038,000 ($105,810,000, net of tax). Our consolidated results of operations for all future periods will include share based compensation cost recorded in accordance with SFAS 123(R). 13 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth the components of our consolidated results of operations expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated: 2007 2006 2005 Sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Costs and Expenses Cost of sales 80.7 80.7 80.9 Operating expenses 14.4 14.7 13.9 Interest expense 0.3 0.3 0.2 Other, net 0.0 0.0 0.0 Total costs and expenses 95.4 95.7 95.0 Earnings before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change 4.6 4.3 5.0 Income taxes 1.7 1.7 1.8 Earnings before cumulative effect of accounting change 2.9 2.6 3.2 Cumulative effect of accounting change 0.0 Net earnings 2.9 % 2.6 % 3.2 % The following table sets forth the change in the components of our consolidated results of operations expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year: 2007 2006 Sales 7.4 % 7.8 % Costs and Expenses Cost of sales 7.4 7.5 Operating expenses 5.3 14.4 Interest expense (3.8 ) 45.5 Other, net 96.7 (17.3 ) Total costs and expenses 7.0 8.6 Earnings before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change 16.2 (8.6 ) Income taxes 13.0 (2.7 ) Earnings before cumulative effect of accounting change 18.3 (12.0 ) Cumulative effect of accounting change (100.0 ) N/A Net earnings 17.0 % (11.0 )% Earnings before cumulative effect of accounting change: Basic earnings per share 19.1 % (9.9 )% Diluted earnings per share 18.5 (8.2 ) Net earnings: Basic earnings per share 17.4 (8.6 ) Diluted earnings per share 17.6 (7.5 ) Average shares outstanding (0.5 ) (2.3 ) Diluted shares outstanding (0.4 ) (3.7 ) Sales Sales for fiscal 2007 were 7.4% greater than fiscal 2006. Acquisitions contributed 0.7% to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2006. The impact of EITF 04 13 reduced sales growth by 0.7%, or $334,002,000 for fiscal 2007, compared to a $99,803,000 reduction for fiscal 2006. Sales are reported on a comparable basis beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, which is the one year anniversary of the adoption of EITF 04 13. Sales for fiscal 2006 were 7.8% greater than fiscal 2005. Acquisitions contributed 1.4% to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2006. The adoption of EITF 04 13 at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 negatively impacted sales growth in fiscal 2006 by 0.3%. Estimated product cost increases were 3.4% during fiscal 2007 as compared to 0.6% during fiscal 2006. We believe that our continued focus on customer account penetration through the use of business reviews with customers and the continued investment in increasing the number of customer contact personnel contributed to the sales growth in fiscal 2007 and 2006. The number of customer contact personnel increased 5% during fiscal 2007 and 6% during fiscal 2006. In addition, we believe fiscal 2006 sales growth was aided by a declining rate of product cost increases experienced throughout the year, which lessened the overall gross margin pressures and contributed to underlying unit growth. 14 Table of Contents Industry sources estimate the total foodservice market experienced real sales growth of approximately 1.1% in calendar year 2006 and 1.7% in calendar year 2005. A comparison of the sales mix in the principal product categories during the last three years is presented below: 2007 2006 2005 Fresh and frozen meats 19 % 19 % 19 % Canned and dry products 18 18 18 Frozen fruits, vegetables, bakery and other 13 14 14 Poultry 10 10 11 Dairy products 9 9 9 Fresh produce 9 9 8 Paper and disposables 8 8 8 Seafood 5 5 5 Beverage products 3 3 3 Janitorial products 3 2 2 Equipment and smallwares 2 2 2 Medical supplies 1 1 1 100 % 100 % 100 % A comparison of sales by type of customer during the last three years is presented below: 2007 2006 2005 Restaurants 64 % 63 % 64 % Hospitals and nursing homes 10 10 10 Schools and colleges 5 5 5 Hotels and motels 6 6 6 All other 15 16 15 100 % 100 % 100 % Gross Margins Gross margins as a percentage of sales were 19.3% for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. The impact of EITF 04 13 contributed a 0.12% increase to gross margins as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006. Estimated product cost increases, an internal measure of inflation, were 3.4% for fiscal 2007. The rate of product cost rose throughout the year, ending at an estimated 6.1% for the fourth quarter. Product cost increases result in reduced gross margins as a percentage of sales when compared to the prior year, as gross profit dollars are earned on a higher sales dollars base. However, the company was able to manage this inflationary environment well resulting in gross profit dollars increasing 7.4% for the year. Gross margins as a percentage of sales were 19.3% for fiscal 2006, as compared to 19.1% for fiscal 2005. The adoption of EITF 04 13 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 contributed 0.06% to the increase in gross margins as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005. Management believes that the remaining gross margin increase as a percentage of sales was aided by several factors, including low product cost inflation and effective merchandising. While we can not predict if product cost inflation will continue in future periods, in general, we believe prolonged periods of high inflation may have a negative impact on our customers and as a result, on our sales, gross margins and earnings. Operating Expenses Operating expenses include the costs of warehousing and delivering products as well as selling, administrative and occupancy expenses. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were 14.4% for fiscal 2007, as compared to 14.7% for fiscal 2006. The impact of EITF 04 13 increased operating expenses as a percentage of sales by 0.09% for fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. The decline in operating expenses as a percentage of sales, prior to the effect of the impact of EITF 04 13, was primarily due to efficiencies obtained at the operating company level. Decreases in pension and share based compensation expenses and higher gains related to the cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance policies were largely offset by increased management incentive bonus accruals and investments in strategic business initiatives. Share based compensation expense decreased $28,852,000 in fiscal 2007 over the prior year, due primarily to the completion of expense recognition in fiscal 2006 of a significant number of options granted in fiscal 2002. Net pension costs decreased $56,001,000 in fiscal 2007 over the prior year, due primarily to the increase in the discount rate used to determine fiscal 2007 pension costs. 15 Table of Contents Operating expenses were reduced by the recognition of a gain of $23,922,000 in fiscal 2007 to adjust the carrying value of life insurance assets to their cash surrender value. This compared to the recognition of a gain of $9,702,000 in fiscal 2006. Due primarily to improved operating results, the non stock portion of management incentive bonus accruals increased $64,770,000 in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 when our performance did not satisfy the criteria for paying bonuses to our corporate officers. Investments in strategic business initiatives increased $22,410,000 in fiscal 2007 over the prior year. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were 14.7% for fiscal 2006, as compared to 13.9% for fiscal 2005. The impact of EITF 04 13 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 increased operating expenses as a percentage of sales by 0.04% for fiscal 2006. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales included incremental share based compensation, increased fuel costs, increased pension costs and increased expenses associated with the National Supply Chain project, partially offset by reduced management incentive bonus accruals. Share based compensation expense increased $107,088,000 in fiscal 2006 over the prior year, resulting from incremental expense incurred due to the adoption of SFAS 123(R) (See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). Fuel costs increased $48,600,000 in fiscal 2006 over the prior year. Net pension costs increased $23,734,000 in fiscal 2006 over the prior year. Operating expenses were reduced by the recognition of a gain of $9,702,000 in fiscal 2006 to adjust the carrying value of life insurance assets to their cash surrender value, as compared to a gain of $13,803,000 in fiscal 2005. The non stock portion of various management incentive bonus accruals decreased $18,216,000 in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Net pension costs in fiscal 2008 are expected to decrease by approximately $9,000,000 due primarily to the funding status and asset performance of the qualified pension plan. Interest Expense The decrease in interest expense of $4,098,000 in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was primarily due to decreased borrowing levels. The increase in interest expense of $34,100,000 in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 was due to a combination of increased borrowing rates and increased borrowing levels. In fiscal 2006, commercial paper and short term bank borrowing rates increased over the prior year. Effective borrowing rates on long term debt also increased over fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2005, effective borrowing rates on long term debt were lowered through the use of fixed to floating interest rate swaps. Higher overall borrowing levels in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 were a result of the level of share repurchases, increased working capital requirements driven primarily by sales growth and continued capital investments in the form of additions to plant and equipment and acquisitions of new businesses. Other, Net Changes between the years result from fluctuations in miscellaneous activities, primarily gains and losses on the sale of surplus facilities. The increase in fiscal 2007 over the prior year is primarily due to a gain of approximately $5,800,000 on the sale of land. Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 38.25% in fiscal 2007, 39.35% in fiscal 2006 and 36.97% in fiscal 2005. The decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was primarily due to lower share based compensation expense in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 and increased gains recorded related to the cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance policies. The increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 was a result of increased share based compensation expense in fiscal 2006 due to the adoption of SFAS 123(R) and certain tax benefits recorded in fiscal 2005, which are discussed in Note 13, Share Based Compensation, and Note 14, Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Net Earnings Net earnings increased 17.0% in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006. Net earnings decreased 11.0% in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005. The changes in net earnings for these periods were due primarily to the factors discussed above as well as the impact on the comparisons due to the fiscal 2006 accounting change discussed below. In the first quarter of fiscal 2006, SYSCO recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting due to a change in the measurement date for pension and other postretirement benefits, which increased net earnings for fiscal 2006 by $9,285,000, net of tax. 16 Table of Contents Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share increased 17.4% and 17.6%, respectively, in fiscal 2007 over the prior year. These increases were due primary to the result of factors discussed above. Basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share decreased 8.6% and 7.5%, respectively, in fiscal 2006 over the prior year. These decreases were due primarily to the result of factors discussed above, partially offset by a net reduction in shares outstanding. The net reduction in average shares outstanding used to calculate basic earnings per share is primarily due to share repurchases. The net reduction in diluted shares outstanding is primarily due to share repurchases, the exclusion of certain options from the diluted share calculation due to their anti dilutive effect and a modification of the treasury stock method calculation utilized to compute the dilutive effect of stock options as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123(R). This modification results in lower diluted shares outstanding than would have been calculated had compensation cost not been recorded for stock options and stock issuances under the Employees Stock Purchase Plan. Segment Results The following table sets forth the change in the selected financial data of each of our reportable segments expressed as a percentage increase over the prior year and should be read in conjunction with Business Segment Information in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8: 2007 2006 Earnings Earnings Sales Before Taxes Sales Before Taxes Broadline 7.0 % 9.5 % 5.8 % 2.0 % SYGMA 6.0 (1) 10.3 (2) Other 13.8 7.1 23.7 27.5 (1) Percentage is not meaningful. SYGMA had earnings before taxes of $10,393,000 in fiscal 2007 and a loss before taxes of $660,000 in fiscal 2006. (2) Percentage is not meaningful. SYGMA had a loss before taxes of $660,000 in fiscal 2006 and earnings before taxes of $11,028,000 in fiscal 2005. The following table sets forth sales and earnings before taxes of each of our reportable segments expressed as a percentage of the respective consolidated total and should be read in conjunction with Business Segment Information in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8: 2007 2006 2005 Earnings Earnings Earnings Sales Before Taxes Sales Before Taxes Sales Before Taxes Broadline 78.6 % 104.4 % 78.9 % 110.8 % 80.3 % 99.4 % SYGMA 12.5 0.6 12.7 0.0 12.4 0.7 Other 10.2 7.9 9.6 8.5 8.4 6.1 Intersegment sales (1.3 ) (1.2 ) (1.1 ) Unallocated corporate expenses (12.9 ) (19.3 ) (6.2 ) Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % We do not allocate share based compensation related to stock option grants, issuances of stock pursuant to the Employees Stock Purchase Plan and restricted stock grants to non employee directors. The decrease in unallocated corporate expenses as a percentage of consolidated earnings before taxes in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 is primarily attributable to reduced share based compensation expense and increased gains recorded related to the cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance policies. The increase in unallocated corporate expenses as a percentage of consolidated earnings before taxes in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 is primarily attributable to increased share based compensation expense due to the adoption of SFAS 123(R). See further discussion of Share Based Compensation in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Broadline Segment Sales for fiscal 2007 were 7.0% greater than fiscal 2006. The impact of EITF 04 13 reduced sales growth by 0.4%, or $173,171,000 for fiscal 2007 compared to a $57,211,000 reduction for fiscal 2006. Sales are reported on a comparable basis beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, which is the one year anniversary of the adoption of EITF 04 13. Acquisitions did not have an impact on the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2007 growth was due to increased sales to marketing associate served customers and multi unit customers primarily through continued focus on customer account penetration through the use of business reviews with customers, increases in the number of customer contact personnel and efforts of our marketing associates. 17 Table of Contents The decrease of Broadline segment sales as a percentage of total SYSCO sales in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was due primarily to contributions to sales growth from the acquisitions of specialty meat, specialty produce and SYGMA operations during fiscal 2006. Marketing associate served sales as a percentage of Broadline sales in the U.S. were 52.0% for fiscal 2007, as compared to 51.9% for fiscal 2006. SYSCO Brand sales as a percentage of Broadline sales in the U.S. were 45.5% for fiscal 2007 as compared to 48.1% for fiscal 2006. The increase in earnings before income taxes for fiscal 2007 was primarily due to increases in sales, gross margin dollar increases and effective expense management. Sales for fiscal 2006 were 5.8% greater than fiscal 2005. The adoption of EITF 04 13 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 reduced sales growth in fiscal 2006 by 0.2%. Acquisitions contributed 0.1% to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2006. Management believes that SYSCOs continued focus on customer account penetration through the use of business reviews with customers, increases in the number of customer contact personnel and efforts of our marketing associates contributed to the sales growth in fiscal 2006. The decrease of Broadline segment sales as a percentage of total SYSCO sales in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was due primarily to strong sales growth in the SYGMA and other segments outpacing the Broadline sales growth, as well as the contributions to sales growth from the acquisitions of specialty meat, specialty produce and SYGMA operations during fiscal 2006. The increase in earnings before income taxes for fiscal 2006 were primarily due to increases in sales partially offset by higher fuel costs and the continued investment in the National Supply Chain project. SYGMA Segment Sales for fiscal 2007 were 6.0% greater than fiscal 2006. The impact of EITF 04 13 reduced sales growth by 2.7%, or $159,236,000 for fiscal 2007 compared to a $42,560,000 reduction for fiscal 2006. Sales are reported on a comparable basis beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, which is the one year anniversary of the adoption of EITF 04 13. Acquisitions contributed 2.1% to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2007 growth was due to sales to new customers and sales growth in SYGMAs existing customer base related to increased sales at existing locations as well as new locations added by those customers. In addition, certain customers were transferred from Broadline operations to be serviced by SYGMA operations, contributing to the sales increase. The increase in earnings before income taxes in fiscal 2007 was due to several factors, including sales growth, increased margins and improved operating efficiencies, partially offset by costs of labor and auto liability related expenses. In addition, the transfer of customers from Broadline operations referred to above also contributed to the increase in earnings before income taxes. Sales for fiscal 2006 were 10.3% greater than fiscal 2005. The adoption of EITF 04 13 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 reduced sales growth in fiscal 2006 by 1.1%. Acquisitions contributed 0.5% to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2006 growth was due primarily to sales to new customers and sales growth in SYGMAs existing customer base related to new locations added by those customers, each of which temporarily increases SYGMAs cost to service the customers. In addition, certain customers were transferred from Broadline operations to be serviced by SYGMA operations, contributing to the sales increase. The decrease in earnings before income taxes in fiscal 2006 was due to several factors. Certain of SYGMAs customers experienced a slowdown in their business. This in turn resulted in lower cases per delivery and therefore reduced gross margin dollars per stop. In addition, SYGMA experienced increased fuel costs, startup costs related to new facilities, costs incurred on information systems projects and increased workers compensation costs. Liquidity and Capital Resources SYSCO provides marketing and distribution services to foodservice customers primarily throughout the United States and Canada. We intend to continue to expand our market share through profitable sales growth, foldouts and acquisitions. We also strive to increase the effectiveness of our customer contact personnel and our consolidated buying programs, as well as the productivity of our warehousing and distribution activities. These objectives require continuing investment. Our resources include cash provided by operations and access to capital from financial markets. Our operations historically have produced significant cash flow. Cash generated from operations is first allocated to working capital requirements; investments in facilities, fleet and other equipment required to meet customers needs; cash dividends; and acquisitions compatible with our overall growth strategy. Any remaining cash generated from operations may be applied toward a portion of the cost of the share repurchase program, while the remainder of the cost may be financed with additional debt. Our share repurchase program is used primarily to offset shares issued under various employee benefit and compensation plans, to reduce shares outstanding (which may have the net effect of increasing earnings per share) and to aid in managing the ratio of long term debt to total capitalization. We target a long term debt to total capitalization ratio between 35% and 40%. The ratio may exceed the target range 18 Table of Contents from time to time, due to borrowings incurred in order to fund acquisitions and internal growth opportunities, and due to fluctuations in the timing and amount of share repurchases. The ratio also may fall below the target range due to strong cash flow from operations and fluctuations in the timing and amount of share repurchases. This ratio was 35.0% and 36.2% as of June 30, 2007 and July 1, 2006, respectively. For purposes of calculating this ratio, long term debt includes both the current maturities and long term portion. We believe that our cash flows from operations, as well as the availability of additional capital under our existing commercial paper programs, bank lines of credit, debt shelf registration and our ability to access capital from financial markets in the future, will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements while maintaining proper liquidity for normal operating purposes. Operating Activities We generated $1,402,922,000 in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2007, $1,124,679,000 in fiscal 2006 and $1,191,208,000 in fiscal 2005. Increases in our cash flow from operations are primarily due to increased earnings offset by investments in working capital. Cash flow from operations in fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 was reduced by increases in inventory balances and increases in accounts receivable balances, offset by an increase in accounts payable balances. The increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances were primarily due to sales growth. The accounts payable balances did not increase at the same rate as inventory increases. Accounts payable balances are impacted by many factors, including changes in product mix, cash discount terms and changes in payment terms with vendors due to the use of more efficient electronic payment methods. Accrued expenses increased $132,936,000 during fiscal 2007, increased $29,161,000 during fiscal 2006, and decreased $52,423,000 during fiscal 2005. The increase in accrued expenses during fiscal 2007 was primarily due to increased accruals for current year incentive bonuses due to improved operating results over the prior year. The increase in accrued expenses during fiscal 2006 was related to various miscellaneous accruals. The decrease in accrued expenses during fiscal 2005 was primarily due to the amount of accrued incentive bonuses related to that year. Also affecting the increase in accrued expenses and the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets during fiscal 2007 was the recording of the product liability claim of $50,296,000 and corresponding receivable of $48,296,000. Cash flow from operations was not negatively affected, as these items mostly offset. See further discussion of the product liability claim under Other Considerations. Other long term liabilities and prepaid pension cost, net, increased $14,817,000 during fiscal 2007, decreased $75,382,000 in fiscal 2006 and increased $86,338,000 in fiscal 2005. The change in these accounts was primarily attributable to the recording of net pension costs and the timing and amount of pension contributions to our company sponsored plans. In fiscal 2007, our pension contributions exceeded the amount of net pension costs recognized during the year resulting in a net cash outflow. In fiscal 2006 and 2005, the net pension costs recorded exceeded the amount of pension contributions during the year resulting in a net cash inflow. One of the factors increasing the amount of taxes paid in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, as compared to the amounts paid in fiscal 2005, was the amount of deductible pension contributions made during the year. Our contributions to our defined benefit plans were $91,163,000, $73,764,000 and $220,361,000 during fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively. We expect to contribute approximately $92,000,000 to our defined benefit plans in fiscal 2008. Also impacting taxes paid is the net cash flow impact of supply chain distribution deferrals for fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, being incrementally positive when compared to what would have been paid on an annual basis without the deferral, due to increased volume through BSCC. Investing Activities Fiscal 2007 capital expenditures included: construction of fold out facilities in Springfield, Illinois and Raleigh, North Carolina; replacement or significant expansion of facilities in Miami, Florida, Albuquerque, New Mexico, Columbia, South Carolina, Kansas City, Kansas, and Riviera Beach, Florida; the Southeast RDC in Alachua, Florida; and continuing work on the corporate headquarters expansion. Fiscal 2006 capital expenditures included: construction of fold out facilities in Springfield, Illinois, Geneva, Alabama, Knoxville, Tennessee and Raleigh, North Carolina; replacement or significant expansion of facilities in Columbus, Ohio, Albuquerque, New Mexico and Denver, Colorado; and continuing work on the corporate headquarters expansion. 19 Table of Contents Fiscal 2005 capital expenditures included: construction of fold out facilities in Spokane, Washington and Geneva, Alabama; replacement or significant expansion of facilities in Baltimore, Maryland, Cleveland, Ohio, Denver, Colorado, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Miami, Florida and Hartford, Connecticut; and completion of the Northeast RDC in Front Royal, Virginia. We expect total capital expenditures in fiscal 2008 to be in the range of $625,000,000 to $650,000,000. Fiscal 2008 expenditures will include the continuation of the fold out program; facility, fleet and other equipment replacements and expansions; the corporate office expansion; the companys National Supply Chain project; and investments in technology. During fiscal 2007, we acquired for cash one broadline foodservice operation. During fiscal 2006, we acquired for cash one broadline foodservice operation, one custom meat cutting operation and five specialty produce distributors. During fiscal 2005, we acquired for cash one broadline foodservice operation, four custom meat cutting operations, and two specialty produce distributors. Financing Activities We routinely engage in Board approved share repurchase programs. The number of shares acquired and their cost during the past three fiscal years were 16,231,200 shares for $550,865,000 in fiscal 2007, 16,479,800 shares for $544,131,000 in fiscal 2006 and 16,790,200 shares for $597,660,000 in fiscal 2005. An additional 3,157,700 shares have been purchased at a cost of $101,710,000 through August 15, 2007, resulting in 19,950,000 shares remaining available for repurchase as authorized by the Board as of that date. Dividends paid were $445,416,000, or $0.72 per share, in fiscal 2007, $397,537,000, or $0.64 per share, in fiscal 2006 and $357,298,000, or $0.56 per share in fiscal 2005. In May 2007, we declared our regular quarterly dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 of $0.19 per share, which was paid in July 2007. In November 2000, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement covering 30,000,000 shares of common stock to be offered from time to time in connection with acquisitions. As of August 15, 2007, 29,477,835 shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement. We have uncommitted bank lines of credit, which provided for unsecured borrowings for working capital of up to $145,000,000, of which $18,900,000 was outstanding as of June 30, 2007 and $6,600,000 was outstanding as of August 15, 2007. We have a commercial paper program allowing us to issue short term unsecured notes in an aggregate not to exceed $1,300,000,000. The current program was entered into in April 2006 and replaced notes that were issued under our previous commercial paper program as they matured and became due and payable. SYSCO and one of our subsidiaries, SYSCO International, Co., has a revolving credit facility supporting our U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs. The facility in the amount of $750,000,000 may be increased up to $1,000,000,000 at our option, and terminates on November 4, 2011, subject to extension. In the first half of fiscal 2008, we intend to increase the size of the credit facility to $1,000,000,000 and extend the termination date by an additional year to 2012. This facility was originally entered into in November 2005 in the amount of $500,000,000 and was increased to $750,000,000 in March 2006. In September 2006, the termination date on the facility was extended to November 4, 2011, in accordance with the terms of the agreement. This facility replaced the previous $450,000,000 (U.S. dollar) and $100,000,000 (Canadian dollar) revolving credit agreements in the U.S. and Canada, respectively, both of which were terminated in November 2005. During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, aggregate outstanding commercial paper issuances and short term bank borrowings ranged from approximately $356,804,000 to $755,180,000, $126,846,000 to $774,530,000, and $28,560,000 to $253,384,000, respectively. Outstanding commercial paper issuances were $531,826,000 as of June 30, 2007 and $625,308,000 as of August 15, 2007. In June 2005, we repaid the 6.5% senior notes totaling $150,000,000 at maturity utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances. In July 2005, we repaid the 4.75% senior notes totaling $200,000,000 at maturity also utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances. In April 2005, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement covering $1,500,000,000 in debt securities. The registration statement was declared effective in May 2005. In September 2005, we issued 5.375% senior notes totaling $500,000,000 due on September 21, 2035, under the April 2005 shelf registration. These notes, which were priced at 99.911% of par, are unsecured, are not subject to any sinking fund requirement and include a redemption provision which allows us to retire the notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the noteholders are not penalized by the early redemption. Proceeds from the notes were utilized to retire commercial paper issuances outstanding as of September 2005. 20 Table of Contents In March 2005, we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap with a notional amount of $350,000,000 as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the cash outflows of interest payments on the forecasted debt issuance due to changes in the benchmark interest rate. The fair value of the swap as of July 2, 2005 was ($32,584,000), which is reflected in Accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, with the corresponding amount reflected as a loss, net of tax, in Other comprehensive income (loss). In September 2005, in conjunction with the issuance of the 5.375% senior notes described above, we settled the $350,000,000 notional amount forward starting interest rate swap. Upon termination, we paid cash of $21,196,000, which represented the fair value liability associated with the swap agreement at the time of termination. This amount is being amortized as interest expense over the 30 year term of the debt, and the unamortized balance is reflected as a loss, net of tax, in Other comprehensive income (loss). In May 2006, we repaid at maturity the 7.0% senior notes totaling $200,000,000 utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances. In April 2007, we repaid at maturity the 7.25% senior notes totaling $100,000,000 utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances. Total debt as of June 30, 2007 was $1,780,695,000, of which approximately 68% was at fixed rates averaging 5.8% and the remainder was at floating rates averaging 5.2%. Certain loan agreements contain typical debt covenants to protect noteholders, including provisions to maintain our long term debt to total capital ratio below a specified level. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of June 30, 2007. As part of normal business activities, we issue letters of credit through major banking institutions as required by certain vendor and insurance agreements. As of June 30, 2007 and July 1, 2006, letters of credit outstanding were $62,645,000 and $60,000,000, respectively. Other Considerations Product Liability Claim In July, 2007, SYSCO was found contractually liable in arbitration proceedings related to a product liability claim from one of our former customers. As of June 30, 2007, we have recorded $50,296,000 on our consolidated balance sheet within accrued expenses related to the accrual of this loss. Also as of June 30, 2007, a corresponding receivable of $48,296,000 is included in the consolidated balance sheet within prepaid expenses and other current assets, which represents the estimate of the loss less the $2,000,000 deductible on SYSCOs insurance policy. We have hold harmless agreements with the product suppliers and are named as an additional insured party under the suppliers policies with their insurers. Further, we maintain our own product liability insurance with coverage related to this claim. We believe it is probable that we will be able to recover the recorded loss from one or more of these sources. Multi Employer Pension Plans As discussed in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, we contribute to several multi employer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering union represented employees. Under current law regarding multi employer defined benefit plans, a plans termination, our voluntary withdrawal or the mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from any under funded multi employer defined benefit plan would require us to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the multi employer plans unfunded vested liabilities. Based on the information available from plan administrators, we estimate that our share of withdrawal liability on all the multi employer plans we participate in, some of which appear to be under funded, could be as much as $120,000,000. For those plans that appear to be under funded, we do not currently believe that it is probable that there will be a mass withdrawal of employers contributing to these plans or that any of the plans will terminate in the near future. However, required contributions to multi employer plans could increase in the future as these plans strive to improve their funding levels. In addition, the Pension Protection Act, enacted in August 2006, will require under funded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their under funding, perhaps beginning as soon as calendar 2008. Unforeseen requirements to pay such increased contributions, withdrawal liability and excise taxes could cause us to raise additional capital through debt financing or the issuance of equity or we may be required to cancel planned capital expenditures or share repurchases or a combination of these items. 21 Table of Contents BSCC Cooperative Structure Our affiliate, BSCC, is a cooperative taxed under subchapter T of the Unites States Internal Revenue Code. We believe that the deferred tax liabilities resulting from the business operations and legal ownership of BSCC are appropriate under the tax laws. However, if the application of the tax laws to the cooperative structure of BSCC were to be successfully challenged by any federal, state or local tax authority, we could be required to accelerate the payment of all or a portion of our income tax liabilities associated with BSCC that we otherwise have deferred until future periods, and in that event, would be liable for interest on such amounts. As of June 30, 2007, we have recorded deferred income tax liabilities of $988,000,000 related to the BSCC supply chain distributions. This amount represents the income tax liabilities related to BSCC that were accrued, but the payment had been deferred as of June 30, 2007. In addition, if the IRS or any other taxing authority determines that all amounts since the inception of BSCC were inappropriately deferred or that BSCC should have been a taxable entity, we estimate that in addition to making a current payment for amounts previously deferred, as discussed above, we may have liability, representing interest that would be payable on the cumulative deferred balances ranging from $185,000,000 to $205,000,000, prior to federal and state income tax benefit, as of June 30, 2007. We calculated this amount based upon the amounts deferred since the inception of BSCC applying the applicable jurisdictions interest rates in effect in each period. During the third quarter of fiscal 2007, the IRS, in connection with its audit of our 2003 and 2004 federal income tax returns, proposed adjustments related to the taxability of BSCC. We are vigorously protesting these adjustments. We have reviewed the merits of the issues raised by the IRS and based upon our review, we believe that the resulting interest is not a probable liability and accordingly, have not recorded any related amount in any period. A taxing authority requiring us to accelerate the payment of these deferred tax liabilities and to pay related interest, if any, could cause us to raise additional capital through debt financing or the issuance of equity or we may have to forego or defer planned capital expenditures or share repurchases or a combination of these items. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off balance sheet arrangements. Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make contractual future payments: Payments Due by Period Less Than More Than Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years (In thousands) Recorded Contractual Obligations: Short term debt and commercial paper $ 550,726 $ 18,900 $ $ 531,826 $ Long term debt 1,201,957 1,636 2,416 200,691 997,214 Capital lease obligations 28,012 1,932 2,997 1,935 21,148 Product liability claim (1) 48,296 48,296 Deferred compensation(2) 116,726 5,984 11,614 11,012 88,116 SERP and other postretirement plans(3) 215,464 12,045 30,465 39,858 133,096 Unrecorded Contractual Obligations: Interest payments related to debt(4) 1,325,060 68,931 132,966 132,966 990,197 Long term non capitalized leases 367,710 63,383 98,558 63,469 142,300 Purchase obligations(5) 1,241,580 942,500 110,137 92,399 96,544 Total contractual cash obligations $ 5,095,531 $ 1,163,607 $ 389,153 $ 1,074,156 $ 2,468,615 (1) Relates to a recent arbitration award against us for which we expect reimbursement. (See discussion under Other Considerations in Liquidity and Capital Resources). (2) The estimate of the timing of future payments under the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan involves the use of certain assumptions, including retirement ages and payout periods. (3) Includes estimated contributions to the unfunded Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) and other postretirement benefit plans made in amounts needed to fund benefit payments for vested participants in these plans through fiscal 2016, based on actuarial assumptions. (4) Includes payments on floating rate debt based on rates as of June 30, 2007, assuming amount remains unchanged until maturity, and payments on fixed rate debt based on maturity dates. (5) For purposes of this table, purchase obligations include agreements for purchases of product in the normal course of business, for which all significant terms have been confirmed. Such amounts included in the table above are based on estimates. Purchase obligations also includes amounts committed with a third party to provide hardware and hardware hosting services over a ten year 22 Table of Contents period ending in fiscal 2015 (See discussion under Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8), fixed electricity agreements and fixed fuel purchase commitments. Purchase obligations exclude full requirements electricity contracts where no stated minimum purchase volume is required. Certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration, typically payable only in the event that certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved. Aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of June 30, 2007 included $113,303,000 in cash. This amount is not included in the table above. No obligations were included in the table above for the qualified retirement plan because as of July 30, 2007, we do not have a minimum funding requirement under ERISA guidelines for this plan due to our previous voluntary contributions. However, we intend to make voluntary contributions to the qualified retirement plan totaling $80,000,000 during fiscal 2008. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements. Significant accounting policies employed by SYSCO are presented in the notes to the financial statements. Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations. These policies require our most subjective or complex judgments, often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We have reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates and this related disclosure. Our most critical accounting policies and estimates pertain to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, self insurance programs, pension plans, income taxes, vendor consideration, accounting for business combinations and share based compensation. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable and determine the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors. In circumstances where we are aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligation, a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected. In addition, allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on analysis of historical trends of write offs and recoveries. We utilize specific criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be written off, including bankruptcy, accounts referred to outside parties for collection and accounts past due over specified periods. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, additional allowances may be required. Self Insurance Program We maintain a self insurance program covering portions of workers compensation, general liability and vehicle liability costs. The amounts in excess of the self insured levels are fully insured by third party insurers. We also maintain a fully self insured group medical program. Liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience, medical cost trends, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. In an attempt to mitigate the risks of workers compensation, vehicle and general liability claims, safety procedures and awareness programs have been implemented. Pension Plans Amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis. Three of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits, the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets. The measurement date for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans is fiscal year end for fiscal years 2005 and prior. In the first quarter of fiscal 2006, we changed the measurement date for pension and other postretirement benefit plans from fiscal year end to May 31st to assist us in meeting accelerated SEC filing dates. As a result of this change, we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting, which increased net earnings for fiscal 2006 by $9,285,000, net of tax. With the issuance of SFAS 158 (See Accounting Changes for further discussion), we have elected to early adopt the measurement date provision in order to adopt both provisions of this accounting standard at the same time. As a result, beginning in fiscal 2008, the measurement date will return to correspond with our fiscal year end. We have performed measurements as of May 31, 2007 and June 30, 2007 of our plan assets and benefit obligations. We will record a charge to opening retained earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 of $3,572,000, net of tax, for the impact of the difference in our pension expense between the two measurement dates. We will also record a benefit to opening accumulated other comprehensive loss in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 of $22,780,000, net of tax, for the impact of the difference in 23 Table of Contents our recognition provision between the two measurement dates. The measurement date used to determine fiscal 2008 net pension costs for all plans was June 30, 2007. For guidance in determining the discount rates, we calculate the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality fixed income investments for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the pension plan. The discount rate assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate. The discount rate assumptions utilized impact the recorded amount of net pension costs. The discount rate utilized to determine net pension costs for fiscal 2007 increased 1.13% to 6.73% from the discount rate utilized to determine net pension costs for fiscal 2006 of 5.60%. Of the $56,001,000 decrease in net pension costs for fiscal 2007, this 1.13% increase in the discount rate decreased SYSCOs net pension costs for fiscal 2007 by approximately $52,576,000 primarily because the higher discount rate in fiscal 2007 generated less amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. The discount rate for determining fiscal 2008 net pension costs for the qualified pension plan (Retirement Plan), which was determined as of the June 30, 2007 measurement date, increased 0.05% to 6.78%. The discount rate for determining fiscal 2008 net pension costs for the SERP, which was determined as of the June 30, 2007 measurement date, decreased 0.09% to 6.64%. The combined effect of these discount rate changes will decrease our net pension costs for all plans for fiscal 2008 by an estimated $480,000. A 1.0% increase in the discount rates for fiscal 2008 would decrease SYSCOs net pension cost by $19,000,000, while a 1.0% decrease in the discount rates would increase pension expense by $37,000,000. The impact of a 1.0% increase in the discount rates differ from the impact of a 1.0% decrease in discount rates because a 1.0% decrease in discount rates would require additional amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses which would not be required at our current discount rates or with a 1.0% increase in these rates. We look to actual plan experience in determining the rates of increase in compensation levels. We used a plan specific age related set of rates for the Retirement Plan, which are equivalent to a single rate of 6.17% as of June 30, 2007 and July 1, 2006. The SERP assumes annual salary increases of 10% through fiscal 2007 and 7% thereafter as of June 30, 2007 and July 1, 2006. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets of the Retirement Plan was 9.00% for fiscal 2007 and 2006. The expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns, reflecting a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and the forward looking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on long term bonds and the historical returns of the major stock markets. Although not determinative of future returns, the effective annual rate of return on plan assets, developed using geometric/compound averaging, was approximately 9.5%, 8.1%, 7.0% and 12.9% over the 20 year, 10 year, 5 year and 1 year periods ended December 31, 2006, respectively. In addition, in nine of the last 15 years, the actual return on plan assets has exceeded 10.00%. The rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate. The expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets of the Retirement Plan is 8.50% for fiscal 2008. A 1.0% increase (decrease) in the assumed rate of return for fiscal 2008 would decrease (increase) SYSCOs net pension costs for fiscal 2008 by approximately $15,900,000. Prior to the adoption of the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS 158, minimum pension liability adjustments resulted when the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets and were recorded so that the recorded pension liability is at a minimum equal to the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation. Minimum pension liability adjustments were non cash adjustments that are reflected as an increase (or decrease) in the pension liability and an offsetting charge (or benefit) to shareholders equity, net of tax, through accumulated other comprehensive loss (or income). The amounts reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income related to minimum pension liability, was a charge, net of tax, of $11,106,000 as of July 1, 2006. The adoption of the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS 158 as of June 30, 2007 resulted in the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans in the statement of financial position, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. The amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of June 30, 2007 after adoption of SFAS 158 was a charge, net of tax, of $125,265,000, which represented the net unrecognized actuarial losses, unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized transition obligation remaining from the initial adoption of SFAS 87/106 as of that date. Changes in the assumptions, including changes to the discount rate discussed above, together with the normal growth of the plan, the impact of actuarial losses from prior periods and the timing and amount of contributions, decreased net pension costs $56,001,000 in fiscal 2007 and is expected to decrease net pension costs in fiscal 2008 by approximately $9,000,000. We made cash contributions to our pension plans of $91,163,000 and $73,764,000 in fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively, including voluntary contributions to the Retirement Plan of $80,000,000 and $66,000,000 in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively. In fiscal 2008, as in the previous years, contributions to the Retirement Plan will not be required to meet ERISA minimum funding requirements but we anticipate that we will make voluntary contributions of $80,000,000, which is not greater than the estimated maximum amount that will be tax deductible in fiscal 2008. The estimated fiscal 2008 contributions to fund benefit payments for the SERP and other post retirement plans together are approximately $12,000,000. 24 Table of Contents Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Our provision for income taxes reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various U.S. federal and state, as well as Canadian federal and provincial jurisdictions. Jurisdictional tax law changes, increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items, accruals or adjustments of accruals for tax contingencies or valuation allowances, and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate. In evaluating the exposures connected with the various tax filing positions, we establish an accrual when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that certain positions may be successfully challenged and a loss is probable. When facts and circumstances change, these accruals are adjusted. Beginning in fiscal 2008, we will adopt FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48) which will change the accounting for tax positions. (See discussion under Note 3, New Accounting Standards, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8). Vendor Consideration We recognize consideration received from vendors when the services performed in connection with the monies received are completed and when the related product has been sold by SYSCO. There are several types of cash consideration received from vendors. In many instances, the vendor consideration is in the form of a specified amount per case or per pound. In these instances, we will recognize the vendor consideration as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold. In the situations where the vendor consideration is not related directly to specific product purchases, we will recognize these as a reduction of cost of sales when the earnings process is complete, the related service is performed and the amounts realized. In certain of these latter instances, the vendor consideration represents a reimbursement of a specific incremental identifiable cost incurred by SYSCO. In these cases, we classify the consideration as a reduction of those costs with any excess funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales and recognizes these in the period in which the costs are incurred and related services performed. Accounting for Business Combinations Goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired. Certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired, including goodwill and other intangible assets, as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit. In addition, annually or more frequently as needed, we assess the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles by determining whether the fair values of the applicable reporting units exceed the carrying values of these assets. The reporting units used in assessing goodwill impairment are our six operating segments as described in Note 17, Business Segment Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The components within each of our six operating segments have similar economic characteristics and therefore are aggregated into six reporting units. The evaluation of fair value requires the use of projections, estimates and assumptions as to the future performance of the operations in performing a discounted cash flow analysis, as well as assumptions regarding sales and earnings multiples that would be applied in comparable acquisitions in the industry. Actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections, resulting in the company revising its assumptions and, if required, recognizing an impairment loss. Share Based Compensation We provide compensation benefits to employees and non employee directors under several share based payment arrangements including various employee stock incentive plans, the Employees Stock Purchase Plan, the Management Incentive Plan and the Non Employee Directors Stock Plan. Prior to July 3, 2005, we accounted for our stock option plans and the Employees Stock Purchase Plan using the intrinsic value method of accounting provided under APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, (APB 25) and related interpretations, as permitted by FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, (SFAS 123) under which no compensation expense was recognized for stock option grants and issuances of stock pursuant to the Employees Stock Purchase Plan. However, share based compensation expense was recognized in periods prior to fiscal 2006 (and continues to be recognized) for stock issuances pursuant to the Management Incentive Plan and stock grants to non employee directors. Share based compensation was included as a pro forma disclosure in the financial statement footnotes and continues to be provided for periods prior to fiscal 2006. Effective July 3, 2005, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective transition method. Under this transition method, compensation cost recognized in fiscal 2006 includes: a) compensation cost for all share based payments granted through July 2, 2005, but for which the requisite service period had not been completed as of July 2, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123, and b) compensation cost for all share 25 Table of Contents based payments granted subsequent to July 2, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123(R). Results for prior periods have not been restated. As a result of adopting SFAS 123(R) on July 3, 2005, SYSCOs earnings before income taxes and net earnings for fiscal 2006 were $118,038,000 and $105,810,000 lower, respectively, than if the company had continued to account for share based compensation under APB 25. Basic and diluted earnings per share before the cumulative effect of the accounting change for fiscal 2006 were both $0.17 lower than if the company had continued to account for share based compensation under APB 25. As of June 30, 2007, there was $82,175,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to share based compensation arrangements. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.68 years. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a Black Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of SYSCOs stock, implied volatilities from traded options on SYSCOs stock and other factors. We utilize historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model; separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The risk free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The fair value of the stock issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan is calculated as the difference between the stock price and the employee purchase price. The fair value of the stock issued under the Management Incentive Plans is based on the stock price less a 12% discount for post vesting restrictions. The discount for post vesting restrictions is estimated based on restricted stock studies and by calculating the cost of a hypothetical protective put option over the restriction period. The compensation cost related to these share based awards is recognized over the requisite service period. The requisite service period is generally the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. The compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from awards under the Management Incentive Plan is accrued over the fiscal year to which the incentive bonus relates. The compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from employee purchases of stock under the Employees Stock Purchase Plan is recognized during the quarter in which the employee payroll withholdings are made. Certain of our option awards are generally subject to graded vesting over a service period. In those cases, we will recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. In other cases, certain of our option awards provide for graded vesting over a service period but include a performance based provision allowing for the vesting to accelerate. In these cases, if it is probable that the performance condition will be met, we recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the shorter performance period; otherwise, we recognize compensation cost over the probable longer service period. In addition, certain of our options provide that if the optionee retires at certain age and years of service thresholds, the options continue to vest as if the optionee continued to be an employee. In these cases, for awards granted prior to July 2, 2005, we will recognize the compensation cost for such awards over the remaining service period and accelerate any remaining unrecognized compensation cost when the employee retires. For awards granted subsequent to July 3, 2005, we will recognize compensation cost for such awards over the period from the date of grant to the date the employee first becomes eligible to retire with his options continuing to vest after retirement. Our option grants include options that qualify as incentive stock options for income tax purposes. In the period the compensation cost related to incentive stock options is recorded, a corresponding tax benefit is not recorded as it is assumed that we will not receive a tax deduction related to such incentive stock options. We may be eligible for tax deductions in subsequent periods to the extent that there is a disqualifying disposition of the incentive stock option. In such cases, we would record a tax benefit related to the tax deduction in an amount not to exceed the corresponding cumulative compensation cost recorded in the financial statements on the particular options multiplied by the statutory tax rate. New Accounting Standards In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109 (SFAS 109). FIN 48 clarifies the application of SFAS 109 by defining criteria that an individual tax position must meet for any part of the benefit of that position to be recognized in the financial statements. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on the measurement, derecognition, classification and disclosure of tax positions, along with accounting for the related interest and penalties. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, and therefore became effective for SYSCO on July 1, 2007. While we continue to analyze the financial statement impact resulting from the adoption of FIN 48, we estimate that the cumulative effect adjustment may result in an increase to tax liabilities of $70,000,000 to $100,000,000, with an offsetting charge to beginning retained earnings. 26 Table of Contents In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of SFAS 157. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. SFAS 159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 159 may have on our consolidated financial statements. Forward Looking Statements Certain statements made herein that look forward in time or express managements expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future events are forward looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. They include statements about SYSCOs ability to increase its market share and sales, long term debt to capitalization target ratios, anticipated capital expenditures, expected benefits of strategic business initiatives including the timing and expected benefits of the National Supply Chain project and related redistribution centers, the potential outcome of ongoing tax audits and SYSCOs ability to meet future cash requirements and remain profitable. These statements are based on managements current expectations and estimates; actual results may differ materially due in part to the risk factors discussed at Item 1.A. above and elsewhere. In addition, SYSCOs ability to increase its market share and sales, meet future cash requirements and remain profitable could be affected by conditions in the economy and the industry and internal factors such as the ability to control expenses, including fuel costs. The ability to meet long term debt to capitalization target ratios also may be affected by cash flow including amounts spent on share repurchases and acquisitions and internal growth. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes. Our use of debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk. Floating rate debt, where the interest rate fluctuates periodically, exposes us to short term changes in market interest rates. Fixed rate debt, where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument, exposes us to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates. We manage our debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that goal. The major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments, potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions. Fiscal 2007 As of June 30, 2007, we had outstanding $531,826,000 of commercial paper at variable rates of interest with maturities through September 24, 2007. Excluding commercial paper issuances, our long term debt obligations as of June 30, 2007 of $1,229,969,000 were primarily at fixed rates of interest. We had no interest rate swaps outstanding as of June 30, 2007. In the following table as of June 30, 2007, commercial paper issuances are reflected as floating rate debt and both the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper issuances outstanding are classified as long term based on the maturity date of our revolving loan agreement which supports our U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs and our intent to continue to refinance this facility on a long term basis. 27 Table of Contents The following table presents our interest rate position as of June 30, 2007.

In conjunction with the issuance of the 5.375% senior notes, we settled a $350,000,000 notional amount forward starting interest rate swap which was designated as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the cash outflows of interest payments on the debt issuance due to changes in the benchmark interest rate. As of July 1, 2006, we had outstanding $399,568,000 of commercial paper at variable rates of interest with maturities through July 3, 2006. Excluding commercial paper issuances, our long term debt obligations as of July 1, 2006 of $1,333,824,000 were primarily at fixed rates of interest. We had no interest rate swaps outstanding as of July 1, 2006. In the following table as of July 1, 2006, commercial paper issuances are reflected as floating rate debt and both the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper issuances outstanding are classified as long term based on the maturity date of our revolving loan agreement which supports our U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs and our intent to continue to refinance this facility on a long term basis.

To the extent that business transactions are not denominated in Canadian dollars, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk. We will also incur gains and losses within shareholders equity due to translation of the financial statements from Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars. Our Canadian financing subsidiary has notes denominated in U.S. dollars, which has the potential to create taxable income in Canada when the debt is paid due to changes in the exchange rate from the inception of the debt through the payment date. A 10% unfavorable change in the fiscal 2007 year end exchange rate would not materially increase the tax liability associated with these notes. We do not routinely enter into material agreements to hedge foreign currency risks. Fuel Price Risk The price and availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due to changes in production, seasonality and other market factors generally outside of our control. Increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on our results of operations in three areas. First, the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home. Second, the high cost of fuel can increase the price we pay for product purchases and we may not be able to pass these costs fully to our customers. Third, increased fuel costs impact the costs we incur to deliver product to our customers. During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, fuel costs represented approximately 0.6%, 0.5% and 0.4% of sales, 28 Table of Contents respectively. Fuel costs incurred by SYSCO increased by approximately $21,225,000 in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 and $48,600,000 in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005. In order to partially manage the volatility and uncertainty of fuel costs, from time to time, we will enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements. As of June 30, 2007, outstanding forward diesel fuel purchase commitments totaled approximately $44,500,000, which will lock in the price on a substantial portion of our fuel purchases through the end of calendar year 2007. 29 Table of Contents
