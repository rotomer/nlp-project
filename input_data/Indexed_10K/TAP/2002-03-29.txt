ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations INTRODUCTION As noted in Item 1(a) General Development of Business, Recent General Business Developments, we acquired the Carling business in England and Wales from Interbrew S.A. on February 2, 2002. Because the acquisition was finalized in 2002, the operating results and financial position of the Carling business are not included in our 2001, 2000 or 1999 results discussed below. This acquisition will have a significant impact on our future operating results and financial condition. The Carling business, which was subsequently renamed Coors Brewers Ltd., generated sales volume of approximately 9 million barrels in 2001. Since 1995, business has, on average, grown its volumes by 1.9% per annum, despite an overall decline in the U.K. beer market over the same period. This acquisition was funded through cash and third party debt. The borrowings will have a significant impact on our capitalization, interest coverage and free cash flow trends. See further discussion of this impact in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussions and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on going basis, we evaluate the continued appropriateness of our accounting policies and estimates, including those related to customer programs and incentives, bad debts, inventories, product retrieval, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, pension and other post retirement benefits and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Revenue recognition: Revenue is recognized upon shipment of our product to distributors. If we believe that our products do not meet our high quality standards, we retrieve those products and they are destroyed. Any retrieval of sold products is recognized as a reduction of sales at the value of the original sales price and is recorded at the time of the retrieval. Using historical results and production volumes, we estimate the costs that are probable of being incurred for product retrievals and record those costs in Cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Income Statements each period. Valuation allowance: We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Allowance for obsolete inventory: We write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about historic usage, future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required. Reserves for insurance deductibles: We carry deductibles for workers compensation, automobile and general liability claims up to a maximum amount per claim. The undiscounted estimated liability is accrued based on an actuarial determination. This determination is impacted by assumptions made and actual experience. Contingencies, environmental and litigation reserves: When we determine that it is probable that a liability for environmental matters or other legal actions has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable, an estimate of the required remediation costs is recorded as a liability in the financial statements. Costs that extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of company owned assets or are incurred to mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination may be capitalized. Other environmental costs are expensed when incurred. Goodwill and intangible asset valuation: Goodwill and other intangible assets, with the exception of the pension intangible asset and water rights, are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated future periods to be benefited, generally 40 years for goodwill and up to 20 years for trademarks, naming and distribution rights. We periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of goodwill and other intangibles may warrant revision or that their remaining balance may not be recoverable. In evaluating impairment, we estimate the sum of the expected future cash flows, undiscounted and without interest charges, derived from these intangibles over their remaining lives. In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Boards issued of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS 142 will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2002, and requires goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives to not be amortized but be reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Although we have yet to complete our analysis of these assets and the related amortization expense under the new rules, we anticipate that a significant part of the goodwill and other intangible assets on our books at year end will no longer be subject to amortization. Our analysis has not identified any goodwill or other intangible assets that would be considered impaired under SFAS 142. In 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Emerging Issues Task Force issued a pronouncement stating that shipping and handling costs should not be reported as a reduction to gross sales within the income statement. As a result of this pronouncement, our finished product freight expense, which is incurred upon shipment of our product to our distributors, is now included within Cost of goods sold in our accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Prior to 2000, this expense had previously been reported as a reduction to gross sales; fiscal year 1999 financial statements have been reclassified for consistent presentation of where freight expense is reported. Summary of operating results: Fiscal year ended December 30, December 31, December 26, 2001 2000 1999 (In thousands, except percentages) Gross sales $2,842,752 $2,841,738 $2,642,712 Beer excise taxes (413,290) (427,323) (406,228) Net sales 2,429,462 100% 2,414,415 100% 2,236,484 100% Cost of goods sold (1,537,623) 63% (1,525,829) 63% (1,397,251) 62% Gross profit 891,839 37% 888,586 37% 839,233 38% Other operating expenses: Marketing, general and administrative (717,060) 30% (722,745) 30% (692,993) 31% Special charges (23,174) 1% (15,215) 1% (5,705) Total other operating expenses (740,234) 31% (737,960) 31% (698,698) 31% Operating income 151,605 6% 150,626 6% 140,535 7% Other income net 46,408 2% 18,899 1% 10,132 Income before taxes 198,013 8% 169,525 7% 150,667 7% Income tax expense (75,049) 3% (59,908) 2% (58,383) 3% Net income $ 122,964 5% $ 109,617 5% $ 92,284 4% CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2001 VS. 2000 AND 2000 VS. 1999 This discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and capital resources for the three year period ended December 30, 2001, and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. Our fiscal year is the 52 or 53 weeks that end on the last Sunday in December. Our 2001 and 1999 fiscal years each consisted of 52 weeks whereas our 2000 fiscal year consisted of 53 weeks. 2001 VS. 2000: Gross and Net Sales Our gross and net sales were $2,842.8 million and $2,429.5 million, respectively, for the 52 week fiscal year ended December 30, 2001, resulting in a $1.1 million and $15.1 million increase over our 2000 gross and net sales of $2,841.7 million and $2,414.4 million, respectively. Net revenue per barrel increased 1.9% over 2000. Sales volume totaled 22,713,000 barrels in 2001, a 1.2% decrease from 2000. Excluding the extra week in fiscal year 2000, net sales volume decreased 0.1% in 2001. The relatively soft volume in 2001 resulted from the following factors: our competitors introduction of new flavored malt based beverages which garnered some attention from distributors and retailers and lessening some attention from core beer brands; unseasonably cold weather early in the year in most parts of the United States; and weak economic conditions in some of our key markets, including California and Texas. The increase in net sales and net revenue per barrel over last year was due to higher domestic pricing of approximately 2% and less promotional discounting, partially offset by a mix shift away from higher priced brands and geographies. Excise taxes as a percent of gross sales were 14.5% in 2001 compared with 15.0% in 2000. The decline was mainly due to the change in our geographic sales mix. Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit Cost of goods sold increased by 0.8% to $1,537.6 million from $1,525.8 million in 2000. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was 63.3% in 2001 compared with 63.2% in 2000. On a per barrel basis, cost of goods sold increased 2% over 2000. This increase was primarily due to higher packaging material costs for aluminum cans and glass bottles, in addition to higher raw materials, energy and labor costs. The continuing shift in our package mix toward more expensive longneck bottles also increased costs slightly. These increases were partially offset by distribution efficiencies from new information systems and processes designed to reduce transportation costs, the benefits from not incurring the 53rd week of costs and closing our Spain brewing and commercial operations in 2000. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales of 36.7% in 2001 was virtually unchanged from prior years 36.8%. Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses Marketing, general and administrative expenses were $717.1 million in 2001 compared with $722.7 million in 2000. The $5.6 million decrease was mostly due to lower costs for advertising and promotions and the favorable impact from the sale of our company owned distributorships which resulted in less advertising and overhead costs. In addition, overhead expenses declined due to 52 weeks in 2001 versus 53 weeks in the prior year. These favorable variances were partially offset by higher costs related to information systems, market research and professional fees. Special Charges Our net special charges were $23.2 million in 2001 compared to special charges of $15.2 million in 2000. The following is a summary of special charges incurred during these years: Information technology: We entered into a contract with EDS Information Services, LLC (EDS), effective August 1, 2001, to outsource certain information technology functions. We incurred outsourcing costs during the year of approximately $14.6 million. These costs were mainly related to a $6.6 million write down of the net book value of information technology assets that were sold to and leased back from EDS, $5.3 million of one time implementation costs and $2.7 million of employee transition costs and professional fees associated with the outsourcing project. We believe this new arrangement will allow us to focus on our core business while having access to the expertise and resources of a world class information technology provider. Restructure charges: In the third quarter of 2001, we recorded $1.6 million of severance costs for approximately 25 employees, primarily due to the restructuring of our purchasing organization. During the fourth quarter of 2001, we announced plans to restructure certain production areas. These restructurings, which began in October 2001 and have continued through April 2002, will result in the elimination of approximately 90 positions. As a result, we recorded associated employee termination costs of approximately $4.0 million in the fourth quarter. Similar costs of approximately $0.4 million related to employee terminations in other functions were also recorded in the fourth quarter. We expect all 2001 severance to be paid by the second quarter of 2002. We continue to evaluate our entire supply chain with the goal of becoming a more competitive and efficient organization. Can and end plant joint venture: In the third quarter of 2001, we recorded $3.0 million of special charges related to the dissolution of our existing can and end joint venture as part of the restructuring of this part of our business that will allow us to achieve operational efficiencies. Effective January 1, 2002, we entered into a partnership agreement with Ball Corporation, one of the worlds leading suppliers of metal and plastic packaging to the beverage and food industries, for the manufacture and supply of aluminum cans and ends for our domestic business. Property abandonment: In 2001, we recorded a $2.3 million charge for a portion of certain production equipment that was abandoned and will no longer be used. Spain closure: In 2000, we recorded a total pretax special charge of $20.6 million related to the closure of our Spain brewing and commercial operations. Of the total charge, $11.3 million related to severance and other related closure costs for approximately 100 employees, $4.9 million related to a fixed asset impairment charge and $4.4 million for the write off of our cumulative translation adjustments previously recorded to equity related to our Spain operations. All severance and related closure costs were paid by July 1, 2001, out of current cash balances. The closure resulted in savings of approximately $7 million in 2001 and only modest savings in 2000. These savings were invested back into our domestic and international businesses. In December 2001, the plant and related fixed assets were sold for approximately $7.2 million resulting in a net gain, before tax, of approximately $2.7 million. Insurance settlement: In 2000, we received an insurance claim settlement of $5.4 million that was credited to special charges. Operating Income As a result of the factors noted above, operating income was $151.6 million for the year ended December 30, 2001, an increase of $1.0 million or 0.7% over operating income of $150.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Excluding special charges, operating income was $174.8 million, an $9.0 million or 5.4% increase over operating earnings of $165.8 million in 2000. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net consists of items such as interest income, equity income on certain unconsolidated affiliates and gains and losses from divestitures and foreign currency exchange transactions. Net other income was $46.4 million in 2001 compared with income of $18.9 million in 2000. The $27.5 million increase was mainly due to $27.7 million of gains recognized from the sale of company owned distributorships coupled with a $2.0 million gain from the sale of certain non essential water rights. In addition, as part of our tax strategy to utilize certain capital loss carryforwards, we recognized gains of $4.0 million from the sale of marketable securities. Partially offsetting these gains were net foreign currency exchange losses of $0.3 million primarily related to a derivative transaction performed in anticipation of the Carling acquisition, a write off of mineral land reserves of $1.0 million, an equity loss from the Molson USA joint venture of $2.2 million and goodwill amortization of $1.6 million related to this investment. Income Taxes Our reported effective tax rate for 2001 was 37.9% compared to 35.3% in 2000. In 2000, our rate was affected by the favorable settlement of certain tax issues related to the Spain brewery closure, the resolution of an Internal Revenue Service audit and reduced state tax rates. Excluding the impact of special charges, our effective tax rate for 2001 was 37.9% compared to 38.0% in 2000. Net Income Net income for the year increased $13.3 million, or 12.2%, over the prior year. For 2001, net income was $123.0 million, or $3.33 per basic share ($3.31 per diluted share), which compares to net income of $109.6 million, or $2.98 per basic share ($2.93 per diluted share), for 2000. Adjusting for the impact of share repurchases of approximately 1,500,000 shares, net income per share, would have been $3.29 per basic share ($3.27 per diluted share) in 2001. Excluding special charges and gains on sales of distributorships, after tax earnings for 2001 were $120.2 million, or $3.26 per basic share ($3.23 per diluted share). This was a $6.3 million or 5.5% increase over 2000 of $113.9 million, or $3.10 per basic share ($3.04 per diluted share). 2000 VS. 1999: Gross and Net Sales Our gross and net sales for 2000 were $2,841.7 million and $2,414.4 million, respectively, resulting in a $199.0 million and $177.9 million increase over our 1999 gross and net sales of $2,642.7 million and $2,236.5 million, respectively. Net revenue per barrel was 3.1% higher than 1999. Gross and net sales were favorably impacted by a 4.7% increase in barrel unit volume. We sold 22,994,000 barrels of beer and other malt beverages in 2000 compared to sales of 21,954,000 barrels in 1999. Net sales in 2000 were also favorably impacted by a continuing shift in consumer preferences toward higher net revenue products, domestic price increases and a longer fiscal year (2000 consisted of 53 weeks versus 52 weeks in 1999). Excluding our 53rd week, unit volume was up approximately 4.1% compared to the 52 week period ended December 26, 1999. Excise taxes as a percent of gross sales decreased slightly in 2000 compared to 1999 primarily as a result of a shift in the geographic mix of our sales. Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit Cost of goods sold was $1,525.8 million in 2000, an increase of 9.2% compared to $1,397.3 million in 1999. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was 63.2% for 2000 compared to 62.5% for 1999. On a per barrel basis, cost of goods sold increased 4.3% in 2000 compared to 1999. This increase was primarily due to an ongoing mix shift in demand toward more expensive products and packages, including longneck bottles and import products sold by Coors owned distributors, as well as higher aluminum, energy and freight costs. Cost of goods sold also increased as a result of higher labor costs in 2000 from wage increases and overtime incurred during our peak season to meet unprecedented demand for our products, higher depreciation expense because of higher capital expenditures and additional fixed costs as a result of our 53rd week in 2000. Gross profit for 2000, was $888.6 million, a 5.9% increase over gross profit of $839.2 million for 1999. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit decreased to 36.8% in 2000 compared to 37.5% of net sales in 1999. Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses Marketing, general and administrative costs were $722.7 million in 2000 compared to $693.0 million in 1999. The $29.7 million or 4.3% increase over the prior year was primarily due to higher spending on marketing and promotions, both domestically and internationally. We continued to invest behind our brands and sales forces domestic and international during 2000, which included reinvesting incremental revenues that were generated from the volume and price increases achieved and discussed earlier. Our 2000 corporate overhead and information technology spending was also up slightly over 1999. Special Charges In 2000, our net special charges were $15.2 million. We incurred a total special charge of $20.6 million triggered by our decision to close our Spain brewery and commercial operations. Of the approximately $20.6 million charge, approximately $11.3 million related to severance and other related closure costs for approximately 100 employees, approximately $4.9 million related to a fixed asset impairment charge and approximately $4.4 million for the write off of our cumulative translation adjustments previously recorded to equity related to our Spain operations. In 2000, approximately $9.6 million of severance and other related closure costs were paid with the remaining $1.7 million reserve being paid during the first quarter of 2001. These payments were funded from current cash balances. Closing our Spain operations eliminated annual operating losses of approximately $7.0 million to $8.0 million. The anticipated payback period is less than three years. We intend to invest much of the annual savings into our domestic and international businesses. The closure resulted in small savings in 2000. The Spain closure special charge was partially offset by an unrelated insurance claim settlement credit of $5.4 million. In 1999, we recorded a special charge of $5.7 million. The special charge included $3.7 million for severance costs from the restructuring of our engineering and construction units and $2.0 million for distributor network improvements. Approximately 50 engineering and construction employees accepted severance packages under this reorganization. Amounts paid related to this restructuring were approximately $0.2 million, $2.3 million and $0.9 million during 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Operating Income As a result of these factors, our operating income was $150.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of $10.1 million or 7.2% over operating income of $140.5 million for the year ended December 26, 1999. Excluding special charges, operating earnings were $165.8 million for 2000, an increase of $19.6 million or 13.4% over operating earnings of $146.2 million for 1999. Other Income (Expense), Net Net other income was $18.9 million for 2000, compared with net other income of $10.1 million for 1999. The significant increase in 2000 was primarily due to higher net interest income, resulting from higher average cash investment balances with higher average yields and lower average debt balances in 2000 compared to 1999. Income Taxes Our reported effective tax rate for 2000, was 35.3% compared to 38.8% for 1999. The primary reasons for the decrease in our effective rate were the realization of a tax benefit pertaining to the Spain brewery closure, the resolution of an Internal Revenue Service audit and reduced state tax rates. Excluding the impact of special charges, our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2000, was 38.0%, compared to 38.8% for the year ended December 26, 1999. Net Income Net income for the year increased $17.3 million or 18.7% over the prior year. For 2000, net income was $109.6 million, or $2.98 per basic share ($2.93 per diluted share), which compares to net income of $92.3 million, or $2.51 per basic share ($2.46 per diluted share), for 1999. Excluding special charges and gains of sales of distributorships, after tax earnings for 2000, were $113.9 million, or $3.10 per basic share ($3.04 per diluted share). This was an $18.1 million or 18.9% increase over after tax earnings, excluding special charges, of $95.8 million, or $2.61 per basic share ($2.56 per diluted share), for 1999. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities, marketable securities and external borrowings, including a new revolving credit facility that became effective after year end. At the end of 2001, our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $309.7 million, down from $386.2 million at the end of 2000. Additionally, cash and cash equivalents declined from $119.8 million in 2000 to $77.1 million in 2001. At December 30, 2001, working capital was $89.0 million compared to $118.4 million at December 31, 2000. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to the following: the payment of $65 million for the purchase of a 49.9% interest in Molson USA, LLC, a joint venture with Molson, Inc.; higher capital expenditures of $244.5 million; and $72.3 million of stock repurchases. Proceeds from the sale of our company owned distributorships positively impacted our cash balance. The decrease in working capital was due to the reclassification of $80 million of debt from long term to current, as this amount is due in July 2002; higher accounts payable resulting mostly from increased capital expenditures, higher cash overdraft balances (which are classified as financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows), coupled with liabilities assumed relative to our purchase of Rexams interest in our prior can joint venture. Lower sales in 2001, driven primarily by a slight softening in demand, resulted in a decrease in accounts receivable. Inventories increased due to an inventory transfer from our prior can joint venture related to our purchase of Rexams interest in that joint venture. At December 30, 2001, our total investment in marketable securities was $232.6 million, all of which were classified as current assets. At December 31, 2000, the amount in current was $72.8 million. In January 2002, these securities were sold, resulting in a net gain of $4.0 million, of which approximately half of these proceeds were used in the Carling acquisition and the remaining amount was applied towards operating cash requirements. In March 2002, all obligations under the terms of our Colorado Industrial Revenue bonds were prepaid totaling approximately $5.0 million and the debt was terminated. As part of the settlement and indemnification agreement related to the Lowry Superfund site with the City and County of Denver and Waste Management of Colorado, Inc., we agreed to post a letter of credit equal to the present value of our share of future estimated costs if estimated future costs exceed a certain amount and our long term credit rating falls to a certain level. The future estimated costs now exceed the level provided in the agreement, however, our credit rating remains above the level that would require this letter of credit to be obtained. Based on our preliminary evaluation, should our credit rating fall below the level stipulated by the agreement, it is reasonably possible that the letter of credit that would be issued could be for as much as $10 million. For more information on the Lowry Superfund site see the Environmental Contingencies section below. We believe that cash flows from operations, cash from the sale or maturity of marketable securities, all of which are highly liquid, and cash provided by short term borrowings through our revolver financing, when necessary, will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditures. However, our liquidity could be significantly impacted by a decrease in demand for our products, which could arise from competitive circumstances, a decline in the societal acceptability views of alcohol beverages, any shift away from light beers and any of the other factors we describe in the section titled "Risk Factors". We also have recently entered into new credit facilities in connection with the acquisition of the Coors Brewers business. These facilities contain financial and operating covenants, and provide for scheduled repayments, that could impact our liquidity on an ongoing basis. Operating Activities The net cash provided by operating activities for each of the three years presented reflects our net income adjusted for non cash items. Net cash provided by operating activities was $193.4 million for 2001, compared to $280.7 million and $211.3 million for 2000 and 1999, respectively. Operating cash flows were $87.3 million lower in 2001 than in 2000 as higher net income of $13.3 million was more than offset by a decline in cash distributions received from our joint venture entities and lower depreciation expense. Also in 2001, we realized significant gains on the sale of properties and securities, and our net deferred tax liability decreased from year end 2000 mainly due to the realization of certain tax benefits. The gains from the sale of properties were mainly due to the sale of three company owned distributorships for $27.7 million. Operating cash flows in 1999 were $67.4 million lower than in 2000 because of a $48.0 million contribution we made to our defined benefit pension plan in January 1999 with no similar contribution being made in 2000. The 1999 contribution was made as a result of benefit improvements made to our defined benefit pension plan that resulted in an increase in the projected benefit obligation of approximately $48.0 million. The remaining increase in 2000 operating cash flow was due to higher net income, higher depreciation expense, the non cash portion of the special charge related to Spain, higher cash distributions received from our joint venture entities and working capital changes. The increase in distributions received was a result of higher earnings of the joint ventures in 2000 compared to 1999. The fluctuations in working capital were primarily due to timing between the two years; our accounts receivable were lower at December 31, 2000, as a result of the 53rd week in 2000, which tends to be our slowest week, and our accounts payable were higher at December 31, 2000, due to increased capital expenditures at the end of 2000 compared to 1999. These increases in operating cash flows were partially offset by increases in the equity earnings of our joint ventures and gains on sale of properties. Investing Activities During 2001, we used $196.7 million in investing activities compared to a use of $297.5 million in 2000 and $121.0 million in 1999. The $100.8 million decrease from 2000 to 2001 was primarily due to proceeds from the sale of properties, mainly three of our company owned distributorships, and lower net investment activity in 2001. In 2001, our net cash proceeds from marketable securities activity was $39.9 million compared to a net cash use of $148.6 million in 2000. In 2000, we shifted to investing in longer term marketable securities by investing cash from short term investment maturities into longer term corporate, government agency and municipal debt instruments, all of which are highly liquid. This change in investment strategy resulted in a higher cash outflow for purchases of securities in 2000 compared to 2001. Cash used in 2001 for investing activities consisted of the $65 million payment made to acquire our 49.9% interest in Molson USA, a joint venture with Molson, Inc. and increased capital expenditures of $244.5 million compared to $154.3 in 2000. A significant portion of our 2001 capital expenditures were for capacity related projects that were started late in 2000 and in early 2001. Net cash used in investing was $176.5 million higher in 2000 compared to 1999 mostly due to our change in investment strategy in 2000 which resulted in a higher net cash outflow for purchases of securities in 2000 compared to 1999 of $159.6 million, coupled with higher capital expenditures. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $38.8 million in 2001, consisting primarily of $72.3 million for purchases of our Class B common stock under our stock repurchase program, dividend payments of $29.5 million on our Class B common stock, partially offset by cash inflows of $51.6 million related to an increase in cash overdrafts over year end 2000; and $10.7 million associated with the exercise of stock options under our stock option plans. During 2000, we used approximately $26.9 million in financing activities, primarily for dividend payments of $26.6 million on our Class B common stock and $20.0 million for purchases of our Class B common stock under our stock repurchase program. These cash uses were partially offset by cash inflows of $17.2 million related to the exercise of stock options under our stock option plans. During 1999, we used $87.7 million in financing activities consisting primarily of principal payments of $40.0 million on our medium term notes, net purchases of $11.0 million for Class B common stock, dividend payments of $23.7 million and a decrease in cash overdrafts of $11.3 million. Debt Obligations At December 30, 2001, we had $100 million in unsecured Senior Notes outstanding, $80 million of which is due in July 2002. The remaining $20 million is due in 2005. Fixed interest rates on these notes range from 6.76% to 6.95%. Interest is paid semiannually in January and July. No principal payments were due or made on our debt in 2001 or 2000. Our affiliate, RMMC has planned capital improvements of approximately $50.0 million over the first three years of its operations. RMMC will fund these improvements using third party financing. This debt will be secured by the joint ventures various supply and access agreements with no recourse to either Coors or Ball. This debt will not be included in our financial statements. In connection with our acquisition of the Coors Brewers business, we entered into new senior unsecured credit facilities under which we borrowed $800 million of term debt and $750 million of short term bridge debt. The new facilities also provide up to $300 million of revolving borrowing, none of which has been drawn to date. For more information about our senior unsecured credit facilities, see Note 17, Subsequent Event, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Subsequent to our acquisition of the Coors Brewers business from Interbrew S.A., Standard and Poors (S&P) affirmed its BBB+ corporate rating while Moodys downgraded our senior unsecured rating to Baa2 from Baa1. The Moodys downgrade reflects the large size of the acquisition relative to our existing business, and the competitive challenges we continue to face in the U.S. market. It also reflects the significant increase in debt that will result, as well as the decrease in our financial flexibility. The rating continues to reflect our successful franchise in the U.S. market, the Coors Brewers strong position in the U.K. market and the product and geographic diversification that Coors Brewers adds. Our debt to total capitalization ratio declined to 9.9% at the end of 2001, from 10.1% at year end 2000 and 11.1% at year end 1999. At February 2, 2002, following the acquisition of the Coors Brewers business, our debt to total capitalization ratio was approximately 63%. Revolving Line of Credit In addition to the Senior Notes, at December 30, 2001, we had an unsecured, committed credit arrangement totaling $200 million, all of which was available as of December 30, 2001. This line of credit had a five year term expiring in 2003. A facilities fee was paid on the total amount of the committed credit. Under the arrangement, we were required to maintain a certain debt to total capitalization ratio and were in compliance at year end 2001. In February 2002, this credit facility was terminated and replaced by the credit agreements associated with the purchase of Coors Brewers. Financial Guarantees We have a 1.1 million yen financial guarantee outstanding on behalf of our subsidiary, Coors Japan. This subsidiary guarantee is primarily for two working capital lines of credit and payments of certain duties and taxes. One of the lines provides up to 500 million yen and the other provides up to 400 million yen (approximately $6.8 million in total as of December 30, 2001) in short term financing. As of December 30, 2001, the approximate yen equivalent of $3.0 million was outstanding under these arrangements and is included in Accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Advertising and Promotions As of December 30, 2001, our aggregate commitments for advertising and promotions, including marketing at sports arenas, stadiums and other venues and events, were approximately $91.5 million over the next eight years. Stock Repurchase Plan In November 2000, the board of directors authorized the extension of our stock repurchase program through 2001. The program authorizes repurchases of up to $40 million of our outstanding Class B common stock. In the third quarter of 2001, our board of directors increased the amount authorized for stock repurchases in 2001 from $40 million to $90 million. The authorized increase was in response to the market conditions following the events of September 11, 2001. Repurchases were financed by funds generated from operations or by our cash and cash equivalent balances. During 2001, we used $72.3 million to repurchase common stock under this stock purchase program. Even though the board of directors extended the program in November 2001, and authorized the repurchase during 2002 of up to $40 million of stock, we have decided to suspend our share repurchases until debt levels resulting from the acquisition of the Coors Brewers business from Interbrew are reduced. Capital Expenditures After being capacity constrained in our operations during peak season in recent years, in 2001 we spent $244.5 million on capital improvement projects, approximately two thirds of which was related to improving production capacity, flexibility and efficiency. With these important capabilities in place, we now have ample capacity in brewing, packaging and warehousing to more efficiently meet expected growth in consumer demand for our products, including during the peak summer selling season. During 2002, we currently anticipate capital spending in the range of $135 to $145 million in our North American business. Combined with the capacity work completed in 2001, this level of capital spending will allow us to grow this business and improve its efficiency in the years ahead. As a result, we currently plan capital spending for our North American business in the range of 2002 levels for at least the next several years. Molson USA, LLC On January 2, 2001, we entered into a joint venture partnership agreement with Molson, Inc. and paid $65 million for a 49.9% interest in the joint venture. The joint venture, known as Molson USA, LLC, was formed to import, market, sell and distribute Molsons brands of beer in the United States. We used a portion of our current cash balances to pay the $65 million acquisition price. Pension Plan Assets In 2001, the funded position of the Coors Retirement Plan was eroded somewhat due to the combined effects of a lower discount rate and a challenging investment environment. This resulted in the recognition of an additional minimum liability, resulting from the excess of our accumulated benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets. For pension plans with accumulated obligations in excess of plan assets, the projected benefit obligation was $659.1 million and the accumulated benefit obligation was $567.2 million. The amounts recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position for accrued pension liability, additional minimum liability, accumulated other comprehensive loss, prepaid benefit cost and intangible asset in 2001 are $61.9 million, $29.8 million, $13.7 million ($8.5 million, net of tax), $21.5 million and $48.3 million, respectively. For further information regarding pension plan assets, refer to Note 7, Employee Retirement Plans, and Note 13, Other Comprehensive Income, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Cautionary Statement Pursuant to Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 This report contains "forward looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify these statements by forward looking words such as "expect," "anticipate," "plan," "believe," "seek," "estimate," "outlook," "trends," "industry forces," "strategies," "goals" and similar words. Statements that we make in this report that are not statements of historical fact may also be forward looking statements. In particular, statements that we make under the headings "Narrative Description of Business," "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," and "Outlook for 2002" relating to our overall volume trends, consumer preferences, pricing trends and industry forces, cost reduction strategies and anticipated results, our expectation for funding our 2002 capital expenditures and operations, our debt service capabilities, our shipment level and profitability, increased market share and the sufficiency of capital to meet working capital, capital expenditures requirements and our strategies are forward looking statements. Forward looking statements are not guarantees of our future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward looking statements. There may be events in the future that we are not able to predict accurately, or over which we have no control. You should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements. We do not promise to notify you if we learn that our assumptions or projections are wrong for any reason. You should be aware that the factors we discuss in "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this report could cause our actual results to differ from any forward looking statements. Our actual results for future periods could differ materially from the opinions and statements expressed with respect to future periods. In particular, our future results could be affected by factors related to our acquisition of the Coors Brewers business in the U.K., including integration problems, unanticipated liabilities and the substantial amount of indebtedness incurred to finance the acquisition, which could, among other things, hinder our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions, make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn and place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to less leveraged competitors. To improve our financial performance, we must grow premium beverage volume, achieve modest price increases for our products and control costs. The most important factors that could influence the achievement of these goals and cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements, include, but are not limited to, the matters we discussed in "Risk Factors". OUTLOOK FOR 2002 Overall, 2001 represented a challenging year for our company, particularly in the area of sales growth. However, in the fourth quarter of 2001, we began to see improved sales trends in our business and in the beer industry. We are cautiously optimistic that improved U.S. industry growth, when combined with our new advertising and sales efforts, will allow us in 2002 to achieve our long standing goal of growing our unit volume 1% to 2% faster than the U.S. beer industry. Despite widespread U.S. economic weakness, the industry pricing environment continued to be favorable late in 2001 and early in 2002. An increase in the level of promotional discounting or the degree of value pack activity could have an unfavorable impact on sales and margins. Geographic and product mix continued to have a modest negative impact on net sales per barrel late in 2001, with sales shifting toward lower revenue geographies and products. Also important, the comparative net sales per barrel impact of the sale of company owned U.S. distributorships that we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2001 a reduction of about 2.5 % is likely to continue for the next three quarters, with slight easing in the third quarter of 2002 and significant easing in the fourth quarter. The disposition of Coors owned distributorships reduces the growth in our sales per barrel primarily because the volumes sold by these distributorships represents much higher revenue per barrel business than our average and because the non Coors brand volumes (for example, import beers) sold by these distributorships are not included in our reported unit volume. The current outlook for U.S. cost of goods is more encouraging than we have seen in the past few years. Following are the five cost factors that we think will be most important in 2002: First, we are beginning to achieve significant operating efficiencies. Our operations teams have begun to achieve success in a number of areas, particularly with distribution costs and related supply chain work. Some of these savings have started to become significant, especially in the fourth quarter of 2001. During the past two years, we have been focused on adding production capacity, culminating with the start up of the new bottle line in our Shenandoah facility this spring. Now, we will focus on utilizing the capacity we have in the most efficient way possible. Second, input costs, including packaging materials, agricultural commodities and fuel, are stabilizing. Early in 2002, the outlook is for approximately flat can costs, assuming aluminum ingot prices stay near their current levels. We anticipate modestly higher glass bottle costs, with little change in paper packaging rates and agricultural commodity costs in 2002. Fuel costs are always difficult to forecast, but the outlook at this point is about the same as in 2001. Changes in oil or natural gas prices could alter this outlook. Third, mix shifts will also affect costs, but probably less than in the past few years. Aside from changes in raw material rates, we plan to spend more on glass in 2002 because of the continuing shift in our package mix toward longneck bottles (LNNRs), which cost more and are less profitable than most of our other package configurations. We anticipate increasing LNNRs to more than 80% of our bottle mix this year. This represents a significant slowdown in this mix shift toward LNNRs as we complete the phase out of the shorter convenience bottles. Fourth, labor related costs are expected to increase due to higher pension and health care costs, as well as higher crewing related to capacity expansion projects completed in 2001. Fifth, we anticipate that the sale of our distributorships in 2001 will be the largest single factor affecting reported cost of goods in 2002. The fourth quarter 2001 impact of about (3%) offers the best template for the first three quarters of 2002, with this factor essentially normalizing early in the fourth quarter of 2002. The disposition of Coors owned distributorships reduces the growth in our cost of goods sold per barrel primarily because the volumes sold by these distributorships represents much higher cost per barrel business than our average and because the non Coors brand volumes (for example, import beers) sold by these distributorships are not included in our reported unit volume. Bringing together all of these factors, we plan to continue to make progress in reducing costs in key areas of our company in 2002. Overall, we see substantial additional potential to reduce our cost of doing business. Marketing and sales spending in North America is expected to increase in 2002. We continue to focus on reducing costs so that we can invest in our brands and sales efforts incrementally. Additional sales and marketing spending is determined on an opportunity by opportunity basis. Incremental revenue generated by price increases is likely to be spent on advertising and marketplace support because the competitive landscape has shifted during the past four years toward much more marketing, promotional and advertising spending. General and administrative costs are expected to increase due to higher labor benefit costs and spending on systems to support our supply chain initiatives. Interest expense will greatly exceed interest income in 2002 due to the additional debt we incurred to complete the Carling acquisition. We also reduced cash balances to complete this transaction. We will be keenly focused on generating cash and paying down debt for the next few years. In 2002, we have planned capital expenditures (excluding capital improvements for our container joint ventures, which will be recorded on the books of the respective joint ventures) for our North American business in the range of approximately $135 to $145 million for improving and enhancing our facilities, infrastructure, information systems and environmental compliance. This capital spending plan is down from $244.5 million in 2001. All of the planned reduction for 2002 is the result of completing capacity related projects in 2001. Based on preliminary analysis, we anticipate 2002 capital spending in our U.K. business will be in the range of $80 to $90 million. The impact of Coors Brewers on our 2002 outlook will depend substantially on business plans being developed in early 2002. CONTINGENCIES Environmental: We were one of a number of entities named by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at the Lowry Superfund site. This landfill is owned by the City and County of Denver (Denver), and was managed by Waste Management of Colorado, Inc. (Waste). In 1990, we recorded a special pretax charge of $30 million, a portion of which was put into a trust in 1993 as part of an agreement with Denver and Waste to settle the outstanding litigation related to this issue. Our settlement was based on an assumed cost of $120 million (in 1992 adjusted dollars). It requires us to pay a portion of future costs in excess of that amount. In January 2002, in response to the EPAs five year review conducted in 2001, Waste provided us with updated annual cost estimates through 2032. We have reviewed these cost estimates in the assessment of our accrual related to this issue. In determining that the current accrual is adequate, we eliminated certain costs included in Wastes estimates, primarily trust management costs that will be accrued as incurred, certain remedial costs for which technology has not yet been developed and income taxes which we do not believe to be an included cost in the determination of when the $120 million threshold is reached. We generally used a 2% inflation rate for future costs, and discounted certain operations and maintenance costs at the site that we deemed to be determinable, at a 5.46% risk free rate of return. Based on these assumptions, the present value and gross amount of discounted costs are approximately $1 million and $4 million, respectively. We did not assume any future recoveries from insurance companies in the estimate of our liability. There are a number of uncertainties at the site, including what additional remedial actions will be required by the EPA, and what costs are included in the determination of when the $120 million threshold is reached. Because of these issues, the estimate of our liability may change as facts further develop, and we may need to increase the reserve. While we cannot predict the amount of any such increase, an additional accrual of as much as $25 million is reasonably possible based on our preliminary evaluation, with additional cash contributions beginning as early as 2013. We were one of several parties named by the EPA as a PRP at the Rocky Flats Industrial Park site. In September 2000, the EPA entered into an Administrative Order on Consent with certain parties, including our company, requiring implementation of a removal action. Our projected costs to construct and monitor the removal action are approximately $300,000. The EPA will also seek to recover its oversight costs associated with the project which are not possible to estimate at this time. However, we believe they would be immaterial to our operating results, cash flows and financial position. In August 2000, an accidental spill into Clear Creek at our Golden, Colorado, facility caused damage to some of the fish population in the creek. A settlement reached in February 2001 with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment was modified based on public comment, including comments by the EPA. As a result, permit violations that occurred several years prior to the accidental spill were included in the settlement, as well as economic benefit penalties related to those prior violations. A total civil penalty of $100,000 was assessed in the final settlement with the Department reached in August 2001. In addition, we will undertake an evaluation of our process wastewater treatment plant. On December 21, 2001, we settled with the Colorado Division of Wildlife for the loss of fish in Clear Creek. We have agreed to construct, as a pilot project, a tertiary treatment wetlands area to evaluate the ability of a wetlands to provide additional treatment to the effluent from our waste treatment facilities. We will also pay for the stocking of game fish in the Denver metropolitan area and the cost of two graduate students to assist in the research of the pilot project. The anticipated costs of the project are estimated to be approximately $500,000. The amounts of these settlements have been fully accrued as of December 30, 2001. From time to time, we have been notified that we are or may be a PRP under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act or similar state laws for the cleanup of other sites where hazardous substances have allegedly been released into the environment. We cannot predict with certainty the total costs of cleanup, our share of the total cost, the extent to which contributions will be available from other parties, the amount of time necessary to complete the cleanups or insurance coverage. In addition, we are aware of groundwater contamination at some of our properties in Colorado resulting from historical, ongoing or nearby activities. There may also be other contamination of which we are currently unaware. While we cannot predict our eventual aggregate cost for our environmental and related matters in which we are currently involved, we believe that any payments, if required, for these matters would be made over a period of time in amounts that would not be material in any one year to our operating results, cash flows or our financial or competitive position. We believe adequate reserves have been provided for losses that are probable and estimable. Litigation: We are also named as a defendant in various actions and proceedings arising in the normal course of business. In all of these cases, we are denying the allegations and are vigorously defending ourselves against them and, in some instances, have filed counterclaims. Although the eventual outcome of the various lawsuits cannot be predicted, it is managements opinion that these suits will not result in liabilities that would materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Risk Factors You should carefully consider the following factors and the other information contained within this document: We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. Because of the acquisition of the Coors Brewers business, we will have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our stockholders equity. As of February 2, 2002, we have total debt of more than $1.7 billion. Furthermore, our debt agreements permit us to incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our consolidated indebtedness may have the effect, generally, of restricting our flexibility in responding to changing market conditions and could make us vulnerable in the event of a general downturn in economic conditions or our business. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to us, including: a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, reducing the funds available to us for other purposes including expansion through acquisitions, marketing spending and expansion of our product offerings; and we may be more leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage. Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to our indebtedness will depend on our financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Our ability to successfully integrate the Coors Brewers business and to implement our business strategy with respect to the Coors Brewers business could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. While we believe that the acquisition of the Coors Brewers business will provide us with significant opportunities to increase our revenues, there can be no assurances that these benefits will be realized or that we will not face difficulty in integrating the Coors Brewers business. Acquisitions involve a number of special risks, including the risk that acquired businesses will not achieve the results we expect, the risk that we may not be able to retain key personnel of the acquired business, unanticipated events or liabilities, and the potential disruption of our business. If we are unable to successfully integrate the Coors Brewers business, we may not realize anticipated revenue growth, which may negatively impact our profitability. The occurrence of any of the events referred to in the risks described above or other unforeseen developments in connection with the acquisition and integration of the Coors Brewers business could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we have not previously operated a business the size of Coors Brewers in the U.K. If we are unable to retain key personnel of the acquired business, we may be unable to realize the benefits that we expect from the acquisition. If the costs of operating the acquired business are higher than we expect, our business, financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected. Loss of the Coors Brewers Limited management team could negatively impact our ability to successfully operate the U.K. business. The successful operation and integration of the Coors Brewers business is dependent, to a great extent, upon retention of the current management team. Although current management has committed to staying with us, the loss of one or more members could have a material adverse impact on the success of the Coors Brewers business until proper replacements could be found. Our success depends largely on the success of one product in the U.S. and in the U.K. the failure of which would materially adversely affect our financial results. Although we currently have 11 products in our U.S. portfolio, Coors Light represented more than 70% of our sales volume for 2001. A key factor in our growth is based on consumer taste preferences that are beyond our control. Our primary competitors portfolios are more evenly diversified than ours. As a consequence, if consumer tastes shift to another style of beer, the loss of sales from Coors Light would have a disproportionately negative impact on our business compared to the business of our principal competitors. We cannot assure that the Coors Light brand will maintain market share or continue to grow. We cannot provide assurance that our acquisition of Coors Brewers will mitigate our reliance on a single product to any significant degree or offset the impact of any potential loss of market share or sales of Coors Light. Moreover, Carling lager is the best selling brand in the U.K. and represented more than 50% of the Coors Brewers sales volume in the U.K. Consequently, any material shift in consumer preferences in the U.K. away from Carling would have a disproportionately negative impact on that business. Because our primary production facility in the U.S. and the Coors Brewers production facilities in the U.K. are each located at a single site, we are more vulnerable than our competitors to transportation disruptions and natural disasters. Our primary U.S. production facilities are located in Golden, Colorado, where we brew more than 90% of our volume in the U.S. and package approximately 60% of our products sold in the U.S. Our centralized operations in the U.S. require us to ship our products greater distances than our competitors. We ship approximately 64% of our products by truck and intermodal directly to distributors and satellite redistribution centers. The remaining 36% of our products are transported by railcar to distributors and satellite redistribution centers. If our transportation system in the U.S. is disrupted as a result of labor strikes, work stoppages, or for any other reason, our business and financial results would be negatively impacted. The Coors Brewers production facilities in the U.K. are located in Burton on Trent, England. Although these facilities are composed of two breweries, they are located side by side. These two breweries account for the majority of our production in the U.K. Because these operations are both centralized, we would experience proportionately greater disruption and losses than our competitors if these primary production facilities in the U.S. or the U.K. were damaged by natural disasters or other catastrophes. We are significantly smaller than our two primary competitors in the U.S., and we are more vulnerable than our competitors to cost and price fluctuations. The beer industry is highly competitive. At the retail level, we compete on the basis of quality, taste, advertising, price, packaging innovation and retail execution by our distributors. Competition in our various markets could cause us to reduce pricing, increase capital and other expenditures or lose market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In the U.S., we compete primarily with Anheuser Busch Companies, Inc. and Miller Brewing Co., the top two brewers in the U.S. Both of our primary competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, production, distribution and other resources than we have. As a consequence, we face significant competitive disadvantages related to their greater economies of scale. To remain competitive, we must spend substantially more per barrel on advertising due to our smaller scale. In addition, we are subject to being outspent by our competitors in advertising, promotions and sponsorships. Aggressive marketing campaigns by our competitors could requires us to spend additional amounts on marketing or cause us to lose market share, which would adversely affect our profit margins. The concentration of our operations at one location contributes to higher costs per barrel than our primary competitors due to a number of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, higher transportation costs and the need to maintain satellite redistribution centers. Our primary competitors have multiple geographically dispersed breweries and packaging facilities. Therefore, they have lower transportation costs and less need for satellite redistribution centers. As a result of our higher costs per barrel and resulting lower margins, we are more vulnerable to cost and price fluctuations than our major competitors. Any significant increase in costs, such as fuel or packaging costs, or significant decrease in prices that we can charge for our products, would have a disproportionately material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. We are vulnerable to the pricing actions of our primary competitors, which are beyond our control. An improved pricing environment over the past several years has allowed us to make moderate, consistent increases in beer prices. These pricing increases have contributed to our improved profitability. The market may not continue to accept price increases, and our competitors may move away from price increases and implement competitive strategies that involve price discounting. Any material negative change in the current pricing environment could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations. If any of our suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our requirements, we may be unable to promptly obtain the materials we need to operate our business. We purchase most of our paperboard and label packaging for our U.S. products from Graphic Packaging International Corporation. William K. Coors and Peter H. Coors serve, along with other Coors family members, as co trustees of a number of Coors family trusts which collectively control both Graphic Packaging and us. Graphic Packaging supplies unique packaging to us that is not currently produced by any other supplier. Our agreement with Graphic Packaging expires in 2002. We have begun negotiations to extend this agreement. Because we do not believe there is another readily available source for this packaging, the loss of Graphic Packaging as our supplier without sufficient time to develop an alternative source for our packaging requirements, or a significant increase in prices charged by Graphic Packaging, would likely have a material adverse effect on our business. We are dependent on our suppliers for all of the raw materials used in our products as well as for all packaging materials. We currently purchase nearly all of our aluminum cans in the U.S. from our joint venture with Ball Corporation and more than half of our glass bottles from our joint venture with Owens Brockway Glass Container, Inc.. We also have agreements to purchase substantially all of our remaining can and bottle needs from these joint venture partners. Coors Brewers has only a single source for their can supply. The loss of this supplier without sufficient time to develop an alternative source would likely have a material adverse effect on their business. As with most agricultural products, the supply and price of raw materials used to produce our products can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including frosts, droughts, other weather conditions, economic factors affecting growth decisions, various plant diseases and pests. To the extent that any of the foregoing affects the ingredients we use to produce our products, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The government may adopt regulations that could increase our costs or our liabilities or could limit our business activities. Our business is highly regulated by national and local government entities. These regulations govern many parts of our operations, including brewing, marketing and advertising, transportation, distributor relationships, sales and environmental issues. We cannot assure you that we have been or will at all times be in compliance with all regulatory requirements or that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in connection with regulatory requirements. The beer industry could be subjected to changes or additions to governmental regulations. For example, we could face new labeling or packaging requirements or restrictions on advertising and promotions that could adversely affect the sale of our products. Governmental entities also levy taxes and may require bonds to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Various legislative authorities in both the U.S. and the U.K. from time to time consider various proposals to impose additional excise taxes on the production and sale of alcohol beverages, including beer. The last significant increase in federal excise taxes on beer was in 1991 when Congress doubled federal excise taxes on beer. We cannot assure you that the operations of our breweries and other facilities will not become subject to increased taxation by federal, state or local authorities. Any significant increases could have a materially adverse impact on our financial results. If the social acceptability of our products declines, or if litigation is directed at the alcohol beverage industry, our sales volumes could decrease and our business could be materially adversely affected. In recent years, there has been increased social and political attention directed to the alcohol beverage industry. We believe that this attention is the result of public concern over alcohol related problems, including drunk driving, underage drinking and health consequences from the misuse of alcohol. If the social acceptability of beer were to decline significantly, sales of our products could materially decrease. Similarly, recent litigation against the tobacco industry has directed increased attention to the alcohol beverage industry. If our industry were to become involved in litigation similar to that of the tobacco industry, our business could be materially adversely affected. Any significant shift in packaging preferences in the beer industry could disproportionately increase our costs and could limit our ability to meet consumer demand. Any significant shift in packaging preferences by retailers and consumers could disproportionately increase our costs and may affect our ability to meet consumer demand, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Reconfiguring our packaging facilities to produce different types or amounts of packaging than we currently produce would likely increase our costs. In addition, we may not be able to complete any necessary changes quickly enough to keep pace with shifting consumer preferences. Our primary competitors are larger and may be better able to accommodate a packaging preference shift. If we are not able to respond quickly to a packaging preference shift, our sales and market share could decline. We depend on independent distributors to sell our products and we cannot provide any assurance that these distributors will effectively sell our products. We sell all of our products in the U.S. to wholesale distributors for resale to retail outlets. We are highly dependent on independently owned distributors. Distributors that we own account for less than 5% of our total domestic volume. Some of our distributors are at a competitive disadvantage because they are significantly smaller than the largest distributors in their markets. Our distributors also sell products that compete with our products. We cannot control or provide any assurance that these distributors will not give our competitors products higher priority, thereby reducing their efforts to sell our products. In addition, the regulatory environment of many states makes it very difficult to change distributors. In most cases, poor performance by a distributor is not grounds for replacement. Consequently, if we are not allowed or are unable to replace unproductive or inefficient distributors, our business, financial position, and results of operation may be adversely affected. Unlike the U.S., in the U.K. Coors Brewers wholesales its products directly to retail outlets and is not dependent upon wholesalers. In the U.K., Coors Brewers distributes its products through Tradeteam, its joint venture with Exel Logistics. Tradeteam operates a system of satellite warehouses and a transportation fleet for delivery between Coors Brewers and customers. Coors Brewers is reliant exclusively upon Tradeteam for these services. Because our sales volume is more concentrated in a few geographic areas in the U.S., any loss of market share in the states where we are concentrated would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Although we sell beer nationwide and in select international markets, only a few states, California, Texas, Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey, together represented 44% of our total domestic volume in 2001. We have relatively low market share in the Midwest and Southeast regions of the U.S. Any loss of market share in our core states could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We are subject to environmental regulation by federal, state and local agencies, including laws that impose liability without regard to fault. Our operations are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations regarding, among other things, the generation, use, storage, disposal, emission, release and remediation of hazardous and non hazardous substances, materials or wastes as well as the health and safety of our employees. Under certain of these laws, namely the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and its state counterparts, we could be held liable for investigation and remediation of hazardous substance contamination at our currently or formerly owned or operated facilities or at third party waste disposal sites, as well as for any personal or property damage arising out of such contamination regardless of fault. From time to time, we have been notified that we are or may be a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. Although we believe that none of the sites in which we are currently involved will materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, we cannot predict with certainty the total costs of cleanup, our share of the total costs, the extent to which contributions will be available from other parties, the amount of time necessary to complete the cleanups or insurance coverage. In addition, we could be named a potentially responsible party at sites in the future and the costs associated with such future sites may be material. Environmental laws and regulations are complex and change frequently. While we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with these environmental laws and regulations, we cannot assure you that we will not incur any environmental liability or that these environmental laws and regulations will not change or become more stringent in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Consolidation of pubs and growth in the size of pub chains in the U.K. could result in less bargaining strength on pricing. The trend toward consolidation of pubs, away from independent pub and club operations, is increasing in the U.K. One result of this trend is that these pub chains are larger entities, and could have stronger price negotiating power, than independent businesses. If the trend continues, it could impact Coors Brewers ability to obtain favorable pricing both on trade and off trade (due to spillover effect of reduced negotiating leverage) and could reduce profit margins for us and industry wide for brewers. We may experience labor disruptions in the U.K. Approximately, 31% of the Coors Brewers 3,150 employees are unionized compared to approximately 8% of our 5,500 employees in the U.S. Although we believe relations with our employees are very good both in the U.S. and in the U.K., the Coors Brewers operations could be affected to a somewhat greater degree by labor strikes, work stoppages or other similar employee related issues. ITEM 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, the value of foreign currencies and production and packaging materials prices. To manage these exposures when practical, we have established policies and procedures that govern the management of these exposures through the use of a variety of financial instruments. By policy, we do not enter into such contracts for the purpose of speculation. Our objective in managing our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and production and packaging materials prices is to decrease the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in the applicable rates and prices. To achieve this objective, we primarily enter into forward contracts, options and swap agreements whose values change in the opposite direction of the anticipated cash flows. We do not hedge the value of net investments in foreign currency denominated operations and translated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Our primary foreign currency exposures were the Canadian dollar (CAD), the Japanese yen (YEN) and the British pound (GBP). In December 2001, we entered into a foreign currency forward sale agreement to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in the British pound exchange rate related to acquisition of certain Coors Brewers assets. Also in anticipation of the Carling acquisition, we entered into a commitment with a lender for the financing of this transaction. Included within the commitment letter is a foreign currency written option which reduced our exposure on the U.S. dollar borrowing to fund the Coors Brewers transaction. The derivatives resulting from these agreements do not qualify for hedge accounting and, accordingly, were marked to market at year end. The associated $0.3 million net expense was recorded in other income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Subsequent to year end, the foreign currency swap settled on January 12, 2002, and the written option included in the loan commitment expired on February 11, 2002, resulting in a combined loss and amortization expense of $1.2 million to be realized during the first quarter of 2002. Derivatives are either exchange traded instruments that are highly liquid, or over the counter instruments with highly rated financial institutions. No credit loss is anticipated because the counterparties to over the counter instruments generally have long term ratings from S&P or Moodys that are no lower than A or A2, respectively. Additionally, most counterparty fair value positions favorable to us and in excess of certain thresholds are collateralized with cash, U.S. Treasury securities or letters of credit. We have reciprocal collateralization responsibilities for fair value positions unfavorable to us and in excess of certain thresholds. At December 30, 2001, we had zero counterparty collateral and had none outstanding. A sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate our exposure to market risk of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The sensitivity analysis reflects the impact of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the applicable market interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The volatility of the applicable rates and prices are dependent on many factors that cannot be forecast with reliable accuracy. Therefore, actual changes in fair values could differ significantly from the results presented in the table below. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1, Summary of Accounting Policies, and Note 12, Derivative Instruments, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. The following table presents the results of the sensitivity analysis of our derivative and debt portfolio: As of As of Estimated fair value volatility December 30, 2001 December 31, 2000 (In millions) Foreign currency risk: forwards, option $(22.2) $ (3.0) Interest rate risk: swaps, debt $ (0.4) $ (1.3) Commodity price risk: swaps, options $(12.2) $ (9.1)
