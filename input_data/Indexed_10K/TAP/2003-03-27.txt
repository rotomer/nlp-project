ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction As noted on Item 1(a) General Development of Business, Recent General Business Developments, we acquired the Carling business (subsequently renamed CBL) in England and Wales from Interbrew S.A. on February 2, 2002. Since the acquisition was finalized in 2002, the operating results and financial position of CBL are not included in our results discussed below for any period prior to the acquisition. This acquisition had a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition. CBL generated sales volume of approximately 9.2 million barrels in 2002. This acquisition was funded through cash and third party debt as reflected in our consolidated balance sheet. The borrowings will have a significant impact on our capitalization, interest coverage and cash flow trends. See further discussion of this impact in the Liquidity section below. Critical Accounting Policies Managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. We review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on an on going basis. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require our judgment in an application. There are also areas in which our judgment in selecting among reasonable alternatives would not produce a materially different result. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have identified the policies below as critical to our financial condition and results of operations: Allowance for Doubtful Accounts In the Americas segment, our allowance for doubtful accounts and credit risk is insignificant as the majority of the Americas accounts receivable balance is generated from sales to independent distributors with whom we have a predetermined collection date arranged through electronic funds transfer. Also, in the Americas, we secure substantially all of our credit risk with purchase money security interests in inventory and proceeds, personal guarantees and other letters of credit. Because the majority of CBL sales are directly to retail customers and, because of the policy of making trade loans to customers, our ability to manage our credit risk in this business is critical. At CBL, we provide allowances for trade receivables and trade loans associated with the ability to collect outstanding receivables from our customers. Generally, provisions are recorded to cover the full exposure to a specific customer (total amount of all trade accounts and loans from a specific customer less the amount of security and insurance coverage) at the point the account is considered uncollectible. We record the provision as a bad debt in general and administrative expenses. Provisions are reversed upon recoverability of the account or relieved at the point an account is written off. We are not able to predict changes in financial condition of our customers and, if circumstances related to our customers deteriorate, our estimates of the recoverability of our trade receivables could be materially affected, and we may be required to record additional allowances. 18 Pension and Postretirement Benefits CBC and its subsidiaries have defined benefit plans that cover the majority of employees. As a result of the acquisition of CBL, we have assumed responsibility for a portion of the assets and liabilities of what was the Bass Brewers Pension Plan, renamed the Coors Brewers Pension Plan. CBC also has postretirement plans that provide medical benefits and life insurance for retirees and eligible dependents. The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions" (SFAS No. 87) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions" (SFAS No. 106). Both of these statements require that management make certain assumptions relating to the long term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates used to measure future obligations and expenses, salary scale inflation rates, health care cost trend rates and other assumptions. We believe that the accounting estimates related to our pension and postretirement plans is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period based on the performance of plan assets, actuarial valuations, and market conditions (for further explanation of our assumptions and year end financial results for these plans, see Item 8, Footnote 7, "Employee Retirement Plans" and Footnote 8, "Postretirement Benefits"). Contingencies, Environmental and Litigation Reserves We estimate the range of liability related to environmental matters or other legal actions where the amount and range of loss can be estimated. We record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to our pending matter and revise our estimates. Costs that extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of company owned assets or are incurred to mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination may be capitalized. Other environmental costs are expensed when incurred. The most significant estimates that could impact our financial statements relate to the Lowry Superfund site. Goodwill and Other Intangible Asset Valuation We adopted the provisions of Statements of Financial Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations" (SFAS No. 141) on July 1, 2001, and No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (SFAS No. 142) on December 31, 2001. We evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets annually, and we evaluate our other intangible assets whenever there is evidence that certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Significant judgments and assumptions are required in the evaluation of intangible assets for impairment, most significantly the estimated future cash flows to be generated by these assets. Changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our goodwill and other intangible assets, thereby requiring us to write down the assets. As an example, our valuation model for the goodwill associated with our Molson USA joint venture assumes certain volume growth and pricing assumptions that, if not ultimately achieved, could result in impairment charges. Trade Loans CBL extends loans to retail outlets that sell our brands. Some of these loans provide for no interest to be payable, others provide for payments at below market interest rate. In return, the retail outlets receive smaller discounts on beer and other beverage products purchased from us, with the net result being CBL attaining a market return on the outstanding loan balance. Consistent with GAAP, we have reclassified a portion of the beer revenue into interest income to reflect a market rate of interest on these notes. For the fiscal year ended December 29, 2002, this amount was $16.4 million. We have included this interest income in the European segment since it is so 19 closely related to the European business, even though all other interest income and expense is reflected in the Corporate segment. Derivatives We use derivatives in the normal course of business to manage our exposure to fluctuations in production and packaging material prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. By policy, we do not enter into such contracts for trading purposes or for the purpose of speculation. All derivatives held by us are designated as hedges with the expectation that they will be highly effective in offsetting underlying exposures. We account for our derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as assets or liabilities at fair value in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (SFAS No. 133), which we early adopted on January 1, 1999. Such accounting is complex, as evidenced by significant interpretations of the primary accounting standard, which continues to evolve, as well as the significant judgments and estimates involved in the estimation of fair value in the absence of quoted market values. These estimates are based upon valuation methodologies deemed appropriate in the circumstances; however, the use of different assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. Equity Method Accounting We generally apply the equity method of accounting to 20% 50% owned investments where we exercise significant influence. As described below, we have an equity ownership in, and conduct business with various joint ventures, which directly relate to our core activities. There are no related parties that own interests in our equity method investments. Coors Canada is a general partnership that was formed to market CBC products in Canada. We own a 50.1% interest in this non consolidated joint venture that we account for using the equity method of accounting due to the effective control of the partnership being shared equally by the partners under the operating agreement. All manufacture, distribution and sale of CBC branded beers are contracted to Molson Inc. (Molson) by the partnership. The partnership never takes title to the beer. It is paid an amount equal to the sales proceeds Molson receives from third party customers, less the costs incurred by Molson for its manufacture, distribution and sale of the CBC branded products. We reflect this amount in revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Income (see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Footnote 10, "Equity Method Investments"). Rocky Mountain Metal Container and Rocky Mountain Bottle Co., along with CBLs Tradeteam joint venture, are dedicated predominantly to our packaging and distribution activities and were formed with companies which have core competencies sought by us to reduce costs. The CBL joint venture with Grolsch was formed to provide a long term relationship with that brands owner in a key segment of the U.K. beer market. In 2002, our share of the pre tax joint venture profits for each of these investments has been offset against Cost of Goods Sold in our Consolidated Statements of Income (see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Footnote 10, "Equity Method Investments"). Effective with the first quarter of 2003, we will include our entire share of Tradeteam results in the Other income, net line of our Consolidated Statements of Income and reflect the results on a separate line if and when they become material. This prospective change in presentation is attributable to Tradeteam no longer being a captive provider of distribution and logistics services to CBL. In November 2002, Tradeteam entered into an agreement to provide distribution services to Interbrew U.K. Limited, another large brewer in the United Kingdom (See Item 1(a), General Development of Business Recent General Business Developments). Other income, net line includes the equity method income for the Molson USA joint venture. This joint venture was formed to import, market, sell and distribute Molson products in the United States. 20 We have recorded our share of the ventures results in the Other income, net line in our Consolidated Statements of Income given the immateriality of its results. A qualitative analysis of our results would be impacted if the results of these joint ventures were included in different lines of our Consolidated Statements of Income. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our global business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, our income tax provision is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by many different tax authorities. We adjust our income tax provision in the period it is probable that actual results will differ from our estimates. Tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period a determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Reductions to the valuation allowance related to the acquisition of CBL that relate to deferred taxes arising from that acquisition would reduce goodwill.

Results for 2000, 2001 and the first five weeks of 2002 exclude CBL, the business acquired from Interbrew in February 2002. Our fiscal year is the 52 or 53 weeks that end on the last Sunday in December. Our 2002 and 2001 fiscal years each consisted of 52 weeks whereas our 2000 fiscal year consisted of 53 weeks. 2002 vs. 2001: Net Sales and Volume Our net sales were $3,776.3 million and $2,429.5 million for fiscal years 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase of $1,346.8 million, or 55.4%, was due primarily to the acquisition of CBL. We sold 31.8 million barrels of beverages in 2002 versus 22.7 million barrels in 2001, an increase of 40.2%. Comparable sales volumes for our Americas business were basically flat in 2002 vs. 2001. Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit Cost of goods sold in 2002 was $2,414.5 million, a $876.9 or 57% increase from $1,537.6 million in 2001. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was 63.9% in 2002 compared to 63.3% in 2001. On a per barrel basis, cost of goods sold increased 12% over 2001. The increase was due mainly to the acquisition of CBL. Other factors contributing to the increase in cost of goods sold include higher capacity costs associated with adding capacity to our Golden and Memphis manufacturing facilities and bottle packaging capacity in Shenandoah, Virginia. We also incurred higher pension and other labor related costs. These higher costs were offset by the sale of three company owned distributorships during 2001, lower domestic packaging costs and continued improvement in operations efficiencies, including lower transportation costs and improved operating line efficiencies in our domestic operations. Cost of goods sold for our Americas business declined by approximately 3.4% from 2001 to 2002. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 36.1% in 2002 compared to 36.7% last year. Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses Marketing, general and administrative expenses were $1,057.2 million, compared to $717.1 million during the same period last year. The increase was due to the acquisition of CBL and investing more in our domestic advertising and sales promotion efforts, especially activity related to our exclusive beer sponsorship with the NFL. As a percentage of net sales, marketing, general and administrative expenses were 28.1% and 29.5% in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Comparable marketing, general and administrative costs for our Americas business increased by approximately 2.6% from 2001 to 2002. Special Charges In 2002, we recorded special charges of $6.3 million. A net $6.4 million charge was recorded in the fourth quarter related primarily to restructuring initiatives in our Golden brewery business operations. We also recorded charges for acquisition costs for CBL, including accounting, appraisal and legal fees. These special charges were offset by a credit related to the cash payment on a debt due to us from our former partner in a brewing business in South Korea (See Item 8, Footnote 9, Special Charges). During 2001, we recorded special charges of $23.2 million primarily related to incremental consulting, legal and other costs incurred in preparation to restructure and outsource our information technology infrastructure. Also included in the 2001 charges were termination and severance costs related to the restructuring of our purchasing and production organizations, impairment charges on certain fixed 22 assets and charges related to the dissolution of our former can and end joint venture. These charges were partially offset by a gain related to the sale of our former Spain brewery and related fixed assets. Operating Income Operating income was $298.3 million for the year ended December 29, 2002, an increase of $146.7 million or 96.8% over operating income of $151.6 million for the year ended December 30, 2001, mainly due to the acquisition of CBL and the other factors noted above. Comparable operating income for our Americas business grew by approximately 19.3% from 2001 to 2002. Interest Income Interest income of $21.2 million increased $4.8 million over the prior year, due to interest in the current year on loans to customers in the acquired CBL business, partially offset by a decrease in interest income on previously held interest bearing securities, which we sold in January 2002 to help fund the acquisition of CBL. Interest Expense Total year interest expense of $70.9 million increased $68.9 million over the same period last year due to the significant increase in debt incurred to purchase CBL. Other Income, Net Net other income was $8.0 million in 2002 compared to income of $4.3 million in 2001. The increase is primarily the result of a $1.8 million gain from the sale of non core water rights in 2002. Consolidated Effective Tax Rate Our fiscal year ended 2002 effective tax rate was 37.0%, down from 37.9% for 2001 mainly because of the effects of purchase price accounting and tax planning associated with the acquisition of CBL. Net Income Net income for 2002 was $161.7 million, or $4.47 per basic share ($4.42 per diluted share), compared to $123.0 million, or $3.33 per basic share ($3.31 per diluted share), in 2001. 2001 vs. 2000: Net Sales and Volume Our net sales were $2,429.5 million for the 52 week fiscal year ended December 30, 2001, resulting in a $15.1 million or 0.6% increase over our 2000 Net sales of $2,414.4 million. Sales volume totaled 22.7 million barrels in 2001, a 1.2% decrease from 2000. Excluding the extra week in fiscal year 2000, net sales volume decreased 0.1% in 2001. The relatively soft volume in 2001 resulted primarily from the following factors: competitors introduction of new flavored malt based beverages (FABs) supported by heavy advertising which took market share from more traditional beers and diverted some attention from distributors and retailers and from core beer brands; unseasonably cold weather early in the year in most parts of the United States; and, weak economic conditions and sales results in some of our key markets, including California and Texas. 23  The increase in net sales and net revenue per barrel over last year was due to higher domestic pricing of approximately 2% and less promotional discounting, partially offset by a mix shift away from higher priced brands and geographies. Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit Cost of goods sold increased by 0.8% to $1,537.6 million from $1,525.8 million in 2000. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was 63.3% in 2001 compared to 63.2% in 2000. This increase was primarily due to higher packaging material costs for aluminum cans and glass bottles, in addition to higher raw materials, energy and labor costs. The continuing shift in our package mix toward more expensive longneck bottles also increased costs slightly. These increases were partially offset by distribution efficiencies from new information systems and processes designed to reduce transportation costs, the benefits from not incurring the 53rd week of costs and closing our Spain brewing and commercial operations in 2000. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 36.7% in 2001 compared to 36.8% in 2000. Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses Marketing, general and administrative expenses were $717.1 million in 2001 compared to $722.7 million in 2000. The $5.6 million decrease was mostly due to lower costs for advertising and promotions and the favorable impact from the sale of our company owned distributorships. In addition, overhead expenses declined due to 52 weeks in 2001 versus 53 weeks in the prior year. These favorable variances were offset partially by higher costs related to information systems, market research and professional fees. Special Charges Our net special charges were $23.2 million in 2001 compared to special charges of $15.2 million in 2000. The following is a summary of special charges incurred during these years: Information Technology We entered into a contract with EDS Information Services, LLC, effective August 1, 2001, to outsource certain information technology functions. We incurred start up and transition costs during the year of approximately $14.6 million. Restructure Charges In the third quarter of 2001, we recorded $1.6 million of severance costs for approximately 25 employees, primarily due to the restructuring of our purchasing organization. During the fourth quarter of 2001, we announced plans to restructure certain production areas. As a result, we recorded associated employee termination costs of approximately $4.0 million in the fourth quarter. Similar costs of approximately $0.4 million related to employee terminations in other functions were also recorded in the fourth quarter. Can and End Plant Joint Venture In the third quarter of 2001, we recorded a $3.0 million charge related to the dissolution of our existing can and end joint venture as part of the restructuring of this part of our business that will allow us to achieve operational efficiencies. Effective January 1, 2002, we entered into a partnership with Ball Corporation for the manufacture and supply of aluminum cans and ends for our domestic business. 24 Property Abandonment In 2001, we recorded a $2.3 million charge for a portion of certain production equipment that was abandoned and will no longer be used. Spain Closure In 2000, we recorded a total pretax special charge of $20.6 million related to the closure of our Spain brewing and commercial operations. In December 2001, the plant and related fixed assets were sold, resulting in a net gain before tax of approximately $2.7 million, which was credited to special charges. Insurance Settlement In 2000, we received an insurance claim settlement of $5.4 million that was credited to special charges. Operating Income As a result of the factors noted above, operating income was $151.6 million for the year ended December 30, 2001, an increase of $1.0 million or 0.7% over operating income of $150.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Other Income (Expense), Net Net other income was $46.4 million in 2001 compared with income of $18.9 million in 2000. The $27.5 million increase was due mainly to $27.7 million of gains recognized from the sale of company owned distributorships coupled with a $2.0 million gain from the sale of certain non core water rights. In addition, as part of our tax strategy to utilize certain capital loss carryforwards, we recognized gains of $4.0 million from the sale of marketable securities. Partially offsetting these gains were net foreign currency exchange losses of $0.3 million primarily related to a derivative transaction performed in anticipation of the Carling acquisition, a write off of mineral land reserves of $1.0 million, an equity loss from the Molson USA joint venture of $2.2 million and goodwill amortization of $1.6 million related to this investment. Income Taxes Our reported effective tax rate for 2001 was 37.9% compared to 35.3% in 2000. In 2000, our rate was affected by the favorable settlement of certain tax issues related to the Spain brewery closure, the resolution of an Internal Revenue Service audit and reduced state tax rates. Net Income Net income for the year increased $13.3 million, or 12.2%, over the prior year. For 2001, net income was $123.0 million, or $3.33 per basic share ($3.31 per diluted share), which compares to net income of $109.6 million, or $2.98 per basic share ($2.93 per diluted share), for 2000. The Americas Segment Results of Operations The Americas malt beverage segment primarily consists of our production, marketing and sales of the Coors family of brands in the United States and its territories. This segment also includes the Coors Light business in Canada that is conducted through a partnership with Molson (Coors Canada) and the sale of Molson products in the United States that is conducted through a joint venture with Molson (Molson USA). The Americas segment also includes the small amount of CBC products that are exported and sold outside of the United States and its possessions, excluding Europe. 25 Prior to our acquisition of CBL, we reported results of operations in one segment. In 2002, we began categorizing our operations into two geographic segments: the Americas and Europe. Accordingly, the historical Americas segment results primarily relate to our historical consolidated results of operations excluding only our pre acquisition Europe operation, which generated minimal volume and revenue. For a comparison of our one operating segment from 2000 to 2001, see "Consolidated Results of Operations 2000 vs. 2001." Fiscal Year Ended December 29, 2002 December 30, 2001 December 31, 2000 % of Net Sales % of Net Sales % of Net Sales (In thousands, except percentages) Net sales $ 2,400,849 100 % $ 2,422,282 100 % $ 2,403,720 100 % Cost of goods sold (1,481,630 ) 62 % (1,532,471 ) 63 % (1,513,051 ) 63 % Gross profit 919,219 38 % 889,811 37 % 890,669 37 % Other operating expenses: Marketing, general and administrative (724,943 ) 30 % (706,872 ) 29 % (710,224 ) 29 % Special (charges) credit (3,625 ) (23,174 ) 1 % 5,583 Total other operating expenses (728,568 ) 30 % (730,046 ) 30 % (704,641 ) 29 % Operating income 190,651 8 % 159,765 7 % 186,028 8 % Other income: Gain on sale of distributorships 27,667 1 % 1,000 Other income, net 4,864 1,319 3,017 Total other income 4,864 28,986 1 % 4,017 Income before income taxes $ 195,515 8 % $ 188,751 8 % $ 190,045 8 % Net Sales and Volume In 2002, Net sales of $2,400.8 million decreased 0.9% compared to Net sales of $2,422.3 million during the same period last year. Net revenue per barrel declined 1% over 2001. The declines were mostly due to the sale of company owned distributorships in 2001 (whose volumes were included in 2001 results until the date of sale); a decline in volume in Puerto Rico, where sales were negatively impacted by a 50% increase in a beer excise tax that took effect during the summer; and negative sales mix, primarily in the United States, which moved away from our higher revenue per barrel brands, geographies and packages. Partially offsetting these declines were higher domestic pricing and reduced price promotions. Sales volume totaled approximately 22.7 million barrels in 2002, virtually unchanged from a year ago. Growth in domestic Coors Light and Keystone Light brands were partially offset by declines in Zima, Killians and exported Coors Light to Puerto Rico. Zima was impacted disproportionately by the recent influx of new FABs in the United States. Additionally, exported Coors Light incurred a significant decline in the latter half of the year due to the 50% increase in Puerto Ricos beer excise tax. Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit Cost of goods sold was $1,481.6 million in 2002 compared to $1,532.5 million for the same period last year. As a percentage of Net sales, Cost of goods sold was approximately 61.7% in 2002 compared 26 to 63.3% in 2001. On a per barrel basis, Cost of goods sold decreased 3.4% from 2001. The decrease in Cost of goods sold during 2002 was attributable primarily to the sale of company owned distributorships in 2001, and lower transportation and packaging costs, as well as the result of continued operations efficiency initiatives. The decreases were partially offset by higher capacity costs associated with adding capacity to our Golden and Memphis manufacturing facilities and bottle packaging capacity to our facility in Shenandoah, Virginia. Also, we incurred higher pension and other labor related costs. Gross profit increased 3.3% to $919.2 million in 2002 compared to the same period last year as a result of the factors noted above. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 38.3% in 2002 compared to 36.7% last year. Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased 2.6% to $724.9 million in 2002 from $706.9 million in 2001, mostly due to higher marketing expense as a result of investing more behind our brands in advertising and sales promotion, including additional headcount in certain markets. General and administrative expenses were down slightly in 2002 primarily due to the sale of company owned distributorships last year, somewhat offset by higher systems investments and labor related expenses. Special (Charges) Credit Our special charges of $3.6 million in 2002, were mainly due to a $7.0 million charge in the fourth quarter related to restructuring initiatives in our Golden brewery business operations and charges related to the dissolution of our former can and end joint venture. These charges were partially offset by a credit related to a cash payment on a debt from our former partner in a brewing business in South Korea. During 2001, we recorded special charges of $23.2 million primarily related to incremental consulting, legal and other costs incurred in preparation to restructure and outsource our information technology infrastructure. Also included in the 2001 charges were termination and severance costs related to the restructuring of our purchasing and production organizations, impairment charges on certain fixed assets and charges related to the dissolution of our former can and end joint venture. Operating Income Due to the factors noted above, operating income increased 19.3% to $190.7 million compared to $159.8 million for the same period last year. Other Income, Net Other income, net was $4.9 million in 2002, representing a $24.1 million decrease from 2001. The decrease resulted from the sale of company owned distributorships in 2001, coupled with the equity loss from the Molson USA joint venture, partially offset by a gain on the sale of non core waters rights. The Europe Segment Results of Operations We acquired the CBL business on February 2, 2002 (see Item 1(a) General Development of Business, Recent General Business Developments), and began reporting these results in a new Europe reporting segment. The Europe segment consists of our production and sale of the CBL brands, principally in the United Kingdom, but also in other parts of the world, our joint venture arrangement relating to the production and distribution of Grolsch in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland, and our joint venture arrangement with Tradeteam for the physical distribution of products throughout 27 Great Britain. It also includes the sale of Coors Light in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. The CBL business represents nearly all of our new Europe segment. Since we did not own CBL prior to February 2002, we do not report historical financial results for this business. Accordingly, the historical Europe segment results include only our pre acquisition Europe operation, which generated very small volume and revenue. Our discussion on the results of operations for the Europe segment has been condensed for these purposes, as comparative results are generally not meaningful. Fiscal Year Ended December 29, 2002 December 30, 2001 December 31, 2000 % of Net Sales % of Net Sales % of Net Sales (In thousands, except percentages) Net sales $ 1,375,473 100 % $ 7,180 100 % $ 10,695 100 % Cost of goods sold (932,900 ) 68 % (5,152 ) 72 % (12,778 ) 119 % Gross profit 442,573 32 % 2,028 28 % (2,083 ) 19 % Other operating expenses: Marketing, general and administrative (332,297 ) 24 % (10,188 ) 142 % (12,521 ) 117 % Special charges (20,798 ) 194 % Total other operating expenses (332,297 ) 24 % (10,188 ) 142 % (33,319 ) 312 % Operating income (loss) 110,276 8 % (8,160 ) 114 % (35,402 ) 331 % Other income (expense): Interest income 16,390 1 % Other income (expense), net 1,766 (29 ) Total other income (expense) 18,156 1 % (29 ) Income before income taxes $ 128,432 9 % $ (8,160 ) 114 % $ (35,431 ) 331 % Net Sales and Volume The Europe segment achieved Net sales of $1,375.5 million in 2002 reflecting unit volume sales of 9.2 million barrels. Carling, the largest beer brand in the United Kingdom, grew at mid single digit rates in both the On Trade and Off Trade channels, with sales of approximately 6 million barrels during 2002. Although our Worthington brand declined at a low single digit rate, it gained market share in the declining mainstream ale market. Grolsch and Reef both grew more than 20% during the year. Driven by solid on and off premise performance, our U.K. brands gained approximately 0.4% of market share in 2002. As discussed in "Item 1, Description of Business," recent years have seen a shift in the overall consumption of beer in the United Kingdom, with volumes shifting from the On Trade channel, where drinks are sold for consumption on premise, to the Off Trade channel, also described as the "take home" or off premise market. Unlike the United States, where manufacturers are generally not permitted to distribute beer directly to retail customers, manufacturers in the United Kingdom sell their products directly to retail. The On Trade channel accounted for approximately 66% of our U.K. volumes in 2002. CBLs major brands have consistently gained market share in On Trade over the past five years through the success of the brand advertising program and through our focus on customer service and sales force development. The Off Trade channel is growing and accounted for approximately 34% of our U.K. sales volume in 2002. Our growth has been a result of our success in building customer relationships, driving distribution and ensuring the consistent high quality display of CBLs key brands. 28 Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit Cost of goods sold was $932.9 million in 2002. As a percentage of net sales, cost of goods sold was 67.8%. During 2002, we closed our Cape Hill brewery and Alloa malting facility as we continue to focus on reducing operating costs and balance capacity with demand. Gross profit was $442.6 million in 2002. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit was 32.2%. Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses Total year marketing, general and administrative expenses were $332.3 million, or 24.2% of net sales. Operating Income As a result of the factors noted above, operating income was $110.3 million for 2002. Interest Income During 2002, the Europe segment recognized $16.4 million of interest income associated with trade loans to retail outlets. Other Income (Expense), Net For the fiscal year ended December 29, 2002, other income was $1.8 million primarily related to favorable non recurring gains on the sale of assets. Income Before Income Taxes The Europe segment contributed $128.4 million, or approximately 50%, in 2002 to consolidated income before income taxes. The Corporate Segment Results of Operations The Corporate segment includes interest and certain corporate costs that are not attributable to the Americas or Europe operating segments. The majority of these corporate costs relate to interest expense, certain legal and finance costs and other miscellaneous expenses. Fiscal Year Ended December 29, 2002 December 30, 2001 December 31, 2000 (In thousands) Net sales $ $ $ Cost of goods sold Gross profit Other operating expenses: Marketing, general and administrative Special charges (2,642 ) Total other operating expenses (2,642 ) Operating income (2,642 ) Other (expense) income: Interest income 4,797 16,409 21,325 Interest expense (70,919 ) (2,006 ) (6,414 ) Other income, net 1,417 3,019 Total other (expense) income (64,705 ) 17,422 14,911 Income before income taxes $ (67,347 ) $ 17,422 $ 14,911 29 Special Charges Special charges of $2.6 million were recognized during the fiscal year ended 2002 for transition expenses related to the acquisition of CBL, including accounting, appraisal and legal fees. Interest Income In 2002, interest income decreased $11.6 million versus 2001 because we sold the majority of our marketable securities to fund a portion of the acquisition of CBL. Interest Expense Interest expense was $70.9 million in 2002 compared to $2.0 million during 2001. The increase in 2002 was the result of increased debt to fund the acquisition of CBL. Other Income, Net In 2002, other income decreased $1.6 million from 2001 to $1.4 million. The decrease is due primarily to foreign exchange losses recognized during the first half of 2002 related to the CBL acquisition. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and external borrowings. As of December 29, 2002, including cash and short term borrowings, we had negative working capital of $94.0 million compared to working capital of $89.0 million at December 30, 2001. At December 29, 2002, cash and short term marketable securities totaled $59.2 million, compared to $309.7 million at December 30, 2001. Our cash and short term marketable securities balances decreased primarily due to the sale of marketable securities totaling $232.6 million during the first quarter of 2002, the majority of which was used to fund a portion of our acquisition of CBL. Other factors that contribute to our change in cash balances include repayments of long term debt, increases in accounts receivable and increased capital expenditures. Our working capital change was due primarily to lower cash and short term marketable securities, increase in current portion of long term debt, partially offset by the increase in working capital resulting from the CBL acquisition. In March 2002, all obligations under the terms of our Colorado Industrial Revenue bonds were prepaid totaling approximately $5.0 million and the debt was terminated. As part of the settlement and indemnification agreement related to the Lowry Superfund site with the City and County of Denver and Waste Management of Colorado, Inc., we agreed to post a letter of credit equal to the present value of our share of future estimated costs if estimated future costs exceed a certain amount and our long term credit rating falls to a certain level. The future estimated costs now exceed the level provided in the agreement, however, our credit rating remains above the level that would require this letter of credit to be obtained. Based on our evaluation, should our credit rating fall below the level stipulated by the agreement, it is reasonably possible that the letter of credit that would be issued could be for as much as $10 million. For more information on the Lowry Superfund site, see the Environmental Contingencies section below. We believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by short term borrowings, when necessary, will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditures. However, our liquidity could be impacted significantly by a decrease in demand for our products, which could arise from competitive circumstances, a decline in the acceptability of alcohol beverages, any shift away from light beers and any of the other factors we describe in the section titled "Risk Factors." We also have 30 credit facilities which contain financial and operating covenants, and provide for scheduled repayments, that could impact our liquidity on an ongoing basis. During the fiscal year ended December 29, 2002, we repaid $208 million of long and short term debt, net of short term borrowings. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities of $258.5 million for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2002, increased $65.1 million from the prior fiscal year. The change was attributable primarily to an increase in net income and the absence of the non cash gain on the sale of the company owned distributorships, partially offset by a net decrease resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Operating cash flows were $87.3 million lower in 2001 than in 2000 as higher net income of $13.3 million was more than offset by a decline in cash distributions received from our joint venture entities. Also in 2001, we realized significant non cash gains on the sale of properties and securities, and our net deferred tax liability decreased from year end 2000 due mainly to the realization of certain tax benefits. The gains from the sale of properties were due mainly to the sale in 2001 of three company owned distributorships for $27.7 million. Investing Activities During the fiscal year ended December 29, 2002, net cash used in investing activities was $1.6 billion compared to $196.7 million in the same period last year. The increase is due to the $1.6 billion payment, net of cash acquired, made to purchase CBL. Also, in 2001, we made a payment of $65.0 million for our 49.9% interest in Molson USA. However, excluding our $1.6 billion payment to acquire CBL and our $65.0 million payment for our interest in Molson USA, total cash provided by investing activities increased approximately $134.5 million compared to the same period last year, mostly due to a substantial decrease in purchases of securities. We did not purchase any new marketable securities in 2002 compared to purchases of $228.2 million during 2001. During 2001, we used $196.7 million in investing activities compared to a use of $297.5 million in 2000. The $100.8 million decrease from 2000 to 2001 was due primarily to proceeds from the sale of properties, mainly three of our company owned distributorships, and lower net investment activity in 2001. In 2001, our net cash proceeds from marketable securities activity was $39.9 million compared to a net cash use of $148.6 million in 2000. Cash used in 2001 for investing activities consisted of the $65.0 million payment made to acquire our interest in the Molson USA joint venture and increased capital expenditures and additions to intangible assets of $244.5 million compared to $154.3 million in 2000. A significant portion of our 2001 capital expenditures were for capacity related projects that were started late in 2000 and in early 2001. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.3 billion in 2002. Activity in the current year included debt proceeds of $2.7 billion partially offset by debt repayments and capital lease obligations of $1.4 billion, and changes in cash overdraft balances of $27.8 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $38.8 million in 2001, consisting primarily of $72.3 million for purchases of our Class B common stock under our stock repurchase program, dividend payments of $29.5 million on our Class B common stock, partially offset by cash inflows of $51.6 million related to an increase in cash overdrafts over year end 2000; and $10.7 million associated with the exercise of stock options under our stock option plans. 31 Debt Obligations Senior Private Placement Notes At December 29, 2002, we had $20 million in unsecured Senior notes at a fixed interest rate of 6.95% per annum. Interest on the notes is due semi annually in January and July. At December 29, 2002, $20 million was classified as long term debt as this balance is due in July of 2005. In July 2002, we made an $80 million principal payment on the "A" series of notes due in July 2002. Our private placement notes require that we conduct our business with certain restrictions on indebtedness, liens, mergers, consolidations, asset sales and certain other types of business activities in which we can engage. We were in compliance with these requirements at December 29, 2002. 63/8% Senior Notes Due 2012 On May 7, 2002, CBC completed a private placement of $850 million principal amount of 63/8% Senior notes, due 2012, with interest payable semi annually. The notes were priced at 99.596% of par for a yield to maturity of 6.43%, were unsecured, were not subject to any sinking fund provision and included a redemption provision (make whole provision) which allowed us to retire the notes at whole or any time at a redemption price. The notes were issued with registration rights and were guaranteed by Adolph Coors Company and certain domestic subsidiaries. Net proceeds from the sale of the notes were approximately $841 million. The net proceeds were used to (1) repay the $750 million of loans outstanding under our senior unsecured bridge facility which we entered into in connection with our acquisition of CBL and (2) to repay approximately $91 million of outstanding term borrowings under our senior unsecured credit facilities. Simultaneously with the private placement, we entered into a registration rights agreement pursuant to which we exchanged the unregistered notes for substantially identical notes registered with the SEC. The exchange of all the notes was completed on September 16, 2002. Under the terms of the notes, we must comply with certain restrictions. These restrictions include restrictions on debt secured by certain types of mortgages, above certain threshold percentages of consolidated net tangible assets, and restrictions on certain types of sale leaseback transactions. As of December 29, 2002, we were in compliance with all of these restrictions. Senior Credit Facility At December 29, 2002, we had $533.7 million outstanding in unsecured Senior Credit facilities consisting of a U.S. dollar denominated amortizing term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $168 million and a 228 million GBP denominated amortizing term loan. Based on foreign exchange rates at December 29, 2002, aggregate principal amounts outstanding related to the 228 million GBP amortizing term loan were $365.7 million. Our term loan is payable quarterly in arrears beginning June 27, 2003, and matures February 1, 2007. During the year ended December 29, 2002, we repaid approximately $310 million on our five year amortizing term loan. This has reduced the scheduled required future amortization amounts based upon application of payments already made against future payments due as per the terms of our loan agreement. We and all of our existing and future, direct and indirect, domestic subsidiaries, other than immaterial domestic subsidiaries, have guaranteed our term loan borrowings. Our term loan requires us to meet certain periodic financial tests, including maximum total leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio. There are also certain restrictions on indebtedness, liens and guarantees; mergers, consolidations and some types of acquisitions and assets sales; and 32 certain types of business in which we can engage. As of December 29, 2002, we were in compliance with all of these restrictions. Revolving Line of Credit At December 29, 2002, we had an unsecured committed credit arrangement totaling $300 million, of which $241 million was available. On December 24, 2002, we borrowed approximately $59 million on this line of credit and used the borrowings to pay down our U.S. dollar denominated amortizing term loan on the same date. This action was undertaken to facilitate the movement of funds from CBL to the United States. This line of credit has a five year term expiring 2007. On a quarterly basis, we pay a facilities fee based on the total amount of available committed credit. Under the terms of this credit facility, we are required to maintain the same leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio as those defined in our term loan, as well as operate our business with the same restrictions as defined in the term loan. We were in compliance with these requirements at December 29, 2002. Uncommitted Lines of Credit At December 29, 2002, we had two USD uncommitted lines of credit totaling $40 million. The lines of credit are with two different lenders. We had $22 million outstanding under these lines of credit as of December 29, 2002. In addition, CBL had two uncommitted lines of credit totaling GBP 20 million, or approximately $32 million based on foreign exchange rates at December 29, 2002. Approximately 10 million GBP, or $16 million based on prevailing exchange rates, was outstanding under these lines of credit at December 29, 2002. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data, Footnote 4, Debt, for additional discussion of our long term borrowings. On July 1, 2002, Rocky Mountain Metal Container (RMMC), our limited liability company with Ball Corporation ("Ball"), increased its debt obligations under the terms of a private placement, from $20 million to $50 million. The debt obligation at December 29, 2002, is the maximum contemplated under the private placement facility. The debt proceeds have been used to finance planned capital improvements. RMMCs debt is secured by its various supply and access agreements with no recourse to CBC or to Ball. This debt is not included in our financial statements because the limited liability company is accounted for under the equity method. Tradeteam, the joint venture between CBL and Exel Logistics, had one uncommitted line of credit totaling 15 million GBP, or approximately $24 million based on foreign exchange rates at December 29, 2002. No amount was outstanding on this line of credit at December 29, 2002; however, Tradeteam is required to pay a 0.5% commitment fee on any undrawn amount. This line of credit bears interest at a rate of 1% over GBP LIBOR. 33  Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Contractual Cash Obligations as of December 29, 2002: Payments Due By Period Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years (In thousands) Long term debt $ 1,527,441 $ 144,049 $ 270,090 $ 256,296 $ 857,006 Capital lease obligations 5,079 4,688 391 Operating leases 92,638 17,757 28,361 17,239 29,281 Other long term obligations(1) 4,539,747 804,353 1,328,837 921,401 1,485,156 Total obligations $ 6,164,905 $ 970,847 $ 1,627,679 $ 1,194,936 $ 2,371,443 (1)These amounts consist largely of long term supply contracts with our joint ventures and unaffiliated third parties to purchase material used in production and packaging, such as cans and bottles, in addition to various long term commitments for advertising and promotions. Other Commercial Commitments Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Total amounts committed Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years (In thousands) Standby letters of credit $ 776 $ 776 $ $ $ Advertising and Promotions As of December 29, 2002, our aggregate commitments for advertising and promotions, including marketing at sports arenas, stadiums and other venues and events, total approximately $259.0 million over the next nine years. Capital Expenditures In 2002, we spent $246.8 million on capital improvement projects worldwide. Of this, 60% was in support of the Americas business segment and the remainder was for the Europe segment. We currently plan capital expenditures in the same range or slightly lower for 2003. In 2002, we completed major capacity investments within the Americas segment in all three of our plants. These investments will allow us to continue to meet growing demand cost efficiently. Capital expenditures in 2003 will focus on continuing to reduce costs. In the Europe segment, a significant portion of our capital investment is to support our business in the On Trade channel where investment is required in dispense equipment and kegs. The major focus of our capital investment program in 2003 is on investment in our brewery in Burton on Trent to increase packaging capacity and efficiency following the closure of the brewery at Cape Hill. The majority of our spending on this effort will be in 2003. Pension Plan Assets Recent declines in global equity markets have resulted in a reduction of the fair value of the assets of the pension plans sponsored by us. This asset value reduction, coupled with an increase in the present value of the obligations of the pension plans due to lower interest rates, has resulted in 34 accumulated pension benefit obligations exceeding the fair value of the plan assets on a consolidated U.S. dollar basis of $393.6 million. Accordingly, we have taken a charge to equity of $212.1 million, net of tax, representing the recording of the appropriate liability and the related deferred tax effects. For pension plans with accumulated obligations in excess of plan assets, the projected benefit obligation was $2,199.0 million and the accumulated benefit obligation was $2,011.1 million. The amounts reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for accrued pension liability, accumulated other comprehensive loss, prepaid benefit cost and intangible asset in 2002 are $431.4 million, $359.0 million ($220.6 million, net of tax), $37.7 million and $42.2 million, respectively. In 2002, an additional minimum pension liability of $339.3 million was recorded and is included in the accrued pension liability amount. It is our practice to fund amounts for pensions at least sufficient to meet the minimum requirements set forth in applicable employee benefits laws and local tax laws. For further information regarding pension plan assets, refer to Footnote 7, "Employee Retirement Plans," and Footnote 13, "Other Comprehensive Income," in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. In 2002, our actuarially assumed long term rates of return on plan asset investments was 9.5% for the CBC Retirement Plan and 7.25% for the Coors Brewers Pension Plan. In selecting those assumptions, we considered investment returns by asset class as represented by our independent pension investment consultants, and applied the relevant asset allocation percentages. The discount rates used were based on prevailing yields of high quality corporate fixed income investments in the United States and the United Kingdom. In 2002, consolidated pension expense was $18.6 million, which represented less than 1% of consolidated Cost of goods sold and other operating expenses. Pension contributions on a consolidated basis were $31.5 million in the current year. From a cash flow standpoint, on a consolidated basis we increased our voluntary pension contributions from $2.6 million per month to $3.6 million per month in October, 2002, and we are continuing to contribute at that higher level in 2003. We expect that the funded positions of the two primary pension plans will improve through a combination of higher contributions and investment returns more in line with long term historical averages. We are still evaluating lowering our 2003 actuarial assumption relative to the rate of return on plan asset investments for the CBC Retirement Plan. If we lowered our rate of return by 50 basis points, pension expense in 2003 would increase by approximately $2.7 million. Any change in this assumption would have no effect on our cash flows. On a consolidated basis, we had unrecognized net actuarial losses of $547.0 million and $105.0 million at December 29, 2002 and December 30, 2001, respectively. Actuarial losses are primarily comprised of short term investment losses which are lower than actuarially assumed investment returns and liability losses due to increased pension liabilities and falling interest rates. Pension expense includes amortization of these actuarial losses after they exceed certain thresholds and, as a result, we recorded actuarial loss amortization of $0.1 million in 2001 and $1.0 million in 2002. It is expected that actuarial loss amortization in 2003 will increase to approximately $8.0 million. We anticipate consolidated pension expense will increase from the $18.6 million in 2002 to approximately $35.0 million in 2003. The expected increase in consolidated pension cost is due to the combined impacts of higher actuarial loss amortization and other factors associated with the decrease in the pension plans funded position. 35 Cautionary Statement Pursuant to Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 This report contains "forward looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify these statements by forward looking words such as "expect," "anticipate," "plan," "believe," "seek," "estimate," "outlook," "trends," "industry forces," "strategies," "goals" and similar words. Statements that we make in this report that are not statements of historical fact may also be forward looking statements. In particular, statements that we make under the headings "Narrative Description of Business," "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," and "Outlook for 2003" including, but not limited to, statements relating to our overall volume trends, consumer preferences, pricing trends and industry forces, cost reduction strategies and anticipated results, our expectations for funding our 2003 capital expenditures and operations, debt service capabilities, shipment levels and profitability, increased market share and the sufficiency of capital to meet working capital, capital expenditures requirements and our strategies are forward looking statements. Forward looking statements are not guarantees of our future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward looking statements. In particular, our future results could be affected by our acquisition of the CBL business in the United Kingdom and the substantial amount of indebtedness incurred to finance the acquisition, which could, among other things, hinder our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions, make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn and place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to less leveraged competitors. You should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements. We do not promise to notify you if we learn that our assumptions or projections are wrong for any reason. You should be aware that the factors we discuss in "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this report could cause our actual results to differ from any forward looking statements. Risk Factors The reader should carefully consider the following factors and the other information contained within this document. The most important factors that could influence the achievement of our goals, and cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements, include, but are not limited to, the following: We have a substantial amount of debt. As of December 29, 2002, we hold approximately $1.5 billion in debt primarily associated with the acquisition of CBL. Because of the acquisition of the CBL business, we have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our stockholders equity. Our consolidated indebtedness could have the effect of restricting our flexibility in responding to changing market conditions and could make us more vulnerable in the event of a general downturn in economic conditions or our business, than if we had no or lower debt. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to us, including: a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, reducing the funds available to us for other purposes including expansion through acquisitions, marketing spending and introduction of new brands; and 36 we may be more leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage should competition require us to devote even more care to the "front end" of our business. Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations under our indebtedness will depend on our financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and some other factors beyond our control. Our primary production facilities in the United States and in the United Kingdom are each located at a single site, so we could be more vulnerable than our competitors to transportation disruptions, fuel increases and natural disasters. Our primary U.S. production facilities are located in Golden, Colorado, where we brew more than 90%, and package approximately 60% of our products sold in the Americas business. Our primary production facilities in the United Kingdom are located in Burton on Trent, England, where we brew approximately 70% of our products sold in the Europe business. Our centralized operations in the United States require us to ship our products greater distances than our competitors. If one of our plants was unable to continue production, or if there was disruption to our transportation system, our business and financial results could be impacted negatively. We are significantly smaller than our two primary competitors in the United States, and may consequently be more vulnerable than our competitors to cost and price fluctuations. The beer industry is highly competitive. At retail, our brands compete on the basis of quality, taste, advertising, price, packaging innovation and retail execution by our distributors. Competition in our various markets could cause us to reduce pricing, increase capital and other expenditures or lose market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In the United States, we compete primarily with Anheuser Busch and SAB Miller PLC (Miller), the top two brewers in the United States. Both of these competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, production and distribution resources than CBC has. Consequently, we are somewhat disadvantaged versus their greater economies of scale. To remain competitive, we must spend substantially more per barrel on advertising than our competitors. The concentration of our operations at fewer locations contributes to higher costs per barrel than our competitors due to a number of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, higher transportation costs and the need to maintain satellite redistribution centers. Our competitors have multiple geographically dispersed breweries and packaging facilities. As a result of our higher costs per barrel and resulting lower margins, we can be more vulnerable to fluctuations in costs such as fuel or packaging costs. If any of our suppliers, including our joint ventures, are unable to meet our requirements, we may be unable to promptly obtain the materials we need to operate our business. We purchase most of our paperboard and label packaging for our U.S. products from GPIC. GPIC supplies unique packaging to us that is not currently produced by any other supplier. Our supply agreement expired in 2002. GPIC has recently encountered labor issues at some of its manufacturing locations. We have almost completed a new agreement with GPIC (See Item 1(a) General Development of Business Recent General Business Developments), but the unavailability of packaging materials from GPIC for any reason, without sufficient time to develop an alternative source for our packaging requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are dependent on our suppliers for all of the raw materials used in our products as well as for all packaging materials. We currently purchase the majority of our aluminum cans in the United States from RMMC (with Ball Corporation) and more than half of our glass bottles from RMBC (with 37 Owens Brockway Glass Container, Inc.). We also have agreements to purchase substantially all of our remaining can and bottle needs from these partners. CBL has only a single source for their can supply. The inability of these suppliers to meet our production requirements without sufficient time to develop an alternative source could have a material adverse effect on our business. As with most agricultural products, the supply and price of raw materials, including water, used to produce our products can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including frosts, droughts, other weather conditions, economic factors affecting growth decisions, various plant diseases and pests. In fact, Colorado and other western states currently have some issues with drought conditions. To the extent that any of the foregoing affects the ingredients we use to produce our products, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Government regulatory authorities in the markets in which we operate may adopt regulations that could increase our costs or our liabilities or could limit our business activities. Our business is highly regulated by national and local government entities. These regulations govern many parts of our operations, including brewing, marketing and advertising, transportation, distributor relationships, sales and environmental issues. We do not know that we have been or will at all times be in compliance with all regulatory requirements or that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in connection with regulatory requirements. The regulations impacting the beer industry are subject to change at any time, and it is most likely that new rules would not be beneficial to our business. Governmental entities also levy taxes and often require bonds to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Various legislative authorities in both the United States and the United Kingdom from time to time consider various proposals to impose additional excise taxes on the production and sale of alcohol beverages, including beer. In the United States, the last significant increase in federal excise taxes on beer was in 1991 when Congress doubled the federal excise taxes on beer. In June 2002, excise taxes on most beer in Puerto Rico increased 50%. Our products could become subject to increased taxation by federal, state or local authorities. Any significant increases could have a materially adverse impact on our financial results. Due to the scope and complexity of the income tax laws in the many jurisdictions in which we operate, we are required to make judgments based on our interpretation of how these tax laws apply to our global business. While we exercise care in making these interpretations and always seek to comply with the tax laws, a tax authority could disagree with our views, or changes to the tax laws could have a material negative impact on our results. If the social acceptability of our products declines, or if litigation is directed at the alcohol beverage industry, our sales volumes could decrease and our business could be materially adversely affected. In recent years, there has been increased social and political attention directed to the alcohol beverage industry. We believe that this attention is the result of public concern over alcohol related problems, including drunk driving, underage drinking and health consequences from the misuse of alcohol. If the social acceptability of beer were to decline significantly, sales of our products could materially decrease. Similarly, recent litigation against the tobacco industry has directed increased attention to the alcohol beverage industry. If our industry were to become involved in litigation similar to that of the tobacco industry, our business could be materially adversely affected. A failure to successfully implement our redesigned supply chain processes and systems in the United States in 2003 could adversely affect our ability to take distributor orders, plan and schedule production, ship our products and bill distributors for shipments. During 2003, we plan to implement our redesigned supply chain processes, including the SAP Sales and Distribution module and other systems our customers will use to order beer, and we will use to 38 schedule production, track inventories and bill our customers. Some companies have experienced startup difficulties with similar projects. If our contingency plans fail, we face certain risks when the system is implemented, including the ability to operate cost effectively, deliver on customer orders, collect cash from sales and report the results of operations. Additionally, we may not achieve the benefits we expect from these re engineered processes. Any significant shift in packaging preferences in the beer industry could disproportionately increase our costs and could limit our ability to meet consumer demand. Reconfiguring our packaging facilities to produce different types or amounts of packaging than we currently produce would likely increase our costs. In addition, we may not be able to complete any necessary changes quickly enough to keep pace with shifting consumer preferences. Our primary competitors are larger and may be better able to accommodate a packaging preference shift. If we are not able to respond quickly to a packaging preference shift, our sales and market share could decline. We depend on independent distributors in the United States to sell our products, with no assurance that these distributors will effectively sell our products. We sell all of our products in the United States to wholesale distributors for resale to retail outlets. We are highly dependent on independently owned distributors. Some of our distributors are at a competitive disadvantage because they are significantly smaller than the largest distributors in their markets. Our distributors also sell products that compete with our products. We cannot control or provide any assurance that these distributors will not give our competitors products higher priority, thereby reducing sales of our products. In addition, the regulatory environment of many states makes it very difficult to change distributors. Consequently, if we are not allowed or are unable to replace unproductive or inefficient distributors, our business, financial position, and results of operation may be adversely affected. CBL wholesales its products directly to retail outlets and, other than for servicing independent outlets in the off trade, is not dependent upon wholesalers. In the United Kingdom, CBL distributes its products through Tradeteam, its joint venture with Excel Logistics. Tradeteam operates a system of satellite warehouses and a transportation fleet for delivery. CBL has an exclusive arrangement with Tradeteam for these services, and the inability of Tradeteam to provide these services could have a materially negative impact on our business if we were unable to timely substitute alternate distribution arrangements. Since our sales volume is more concentrated in a few geographic areas in the United States, a loss of market share in these particular markets would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Although we sell beer in the United States, the United Kingdom and in select international markets, only a few states, California, Texas, Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey, together represented 44% of our total U.S. volume in 2002. We have relatively low market share in the Midwest and Southeast regions of the United States. Any loss of market share in our core states could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our success depends largely on the success of two primary products, one in the United States and one in the United Kingdom; the failure or weakening of either could materially adversely affect our financial results. Although we currently have 11 products in our U.S. portfolio, Coors Light represented more than 70% of our Americas sales volume for 2002. A key factor in our growth is based on consumer taste preferences that are beyond our control. Our primary competitors portfolios are more evenly diversified than ours. As a consequence, if consumer tastes shift to another style of beer, the loss of sales from Coors Light would have a disproportionately negative impact on our business compared to the business of our principal competitors. 39 We cannot provide assurance that our acquisition of CBL will mitigate our reliance on Coors Light. Moreover, Carling lager is the best selling brand in the United Kingdom and represented approximately 66% of CBL sales volume in the United Kingdom. Consequently, any material shift in consumer preferences in the United Kingdom away from Carling would have a disproportionately negative impact on that business. Consolidation of pubs and growth in the size of pub chains in the United Kingdom could result in less ability to achieve pricing. The trend toward consolidation of pubs, away from independent pub and club operations, is continuing in the United Kingdom. These larger entities could have stronger price negotiating power, which could impact CBLs ability to obtain favorable pricing both On Trade and Off Trade (due to spillover effect of reduced negotiating leverage) and could reduce revenues and profit margins for us and industry wide for brewers. In addition, these larger customers are beginning to purchase directly more of the products that, in the past, we have provided as part of our factored business. This consolidation could impact us negatively. We are subject to environmental regulation by federal, state and local agencies, including laws that impose liability without regard to fault. Our operations are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations regarding, among other things, the generation, use, storage, disposal, emission, release and remediation of hazardous and non hazardous substances, materials or wastes as well as the health and safety of our employees. Under certain of these laws, namely the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and its state counterparts, we could be held liable for investigation and remediation of hazardous substance contamination at our currently or formerly owned or operated facilities or at third party waste disposal sites, as well as for any personal or property damage arising out of such contamination regardless of fault. From time to time, we have been notified that we are or may be a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. Although we believe that none of the sites where we are currently involved will materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, we cannot predict with certainty the total costs of cleanup, our share of the total costs, the extent to which contributions will be available from other parties, the amount of time needed to complete cleanups or insurance coverage. In addition, we could be named a potentially responsible party at sites in the future and the costs associated with such future sites could be material. Environmental laws and regulations are complex and change frequently. While we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with these environmental laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that we will not incur any environmental liability, or that these environmental laws and regulations will not change or become more stringent in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may experience labor disruptions in the United Kingdom. Approximately 26% of CBLs 3,000 employees are unionized compared to approximately 8% of CBCs 5,700 employees in the United States. Although we believe relations with our employees are very good both in the United States and in the United Kingdom, the CBL operations could be affected to a somewhat greater degree by labor strikes, work stoppages or other similar employee related issues. 40 Outlook for 2003 2002 was a challenging year for our Company, the U.S. beer industry and the U.S. economy. There were many new product offerings within the malt beverage business in 2002, including many flavored alcoholic beverages. We believe that these new entrants caused distraction within the industry and negatively impacted consumer demand for beer. Also, as discussed under "Competitive Conditions", the total U.S. beer industry volume growth was approximately 1.3% in 2002. These industry trends as well as a weak U.S. economy contributed to a challenging year for our Company. Our outlook for 2003 is cautiously optimistic, as we believe our advertising and sales efforts, including our NFL sponsorship, will move us closer to our long standing goal of growing our annual unit volume 1% to 2% faster than the U.S. beer industry. However, we have significant challenges, including higher pension and health care expenses and higher interest expense and principal payments on our debt, along with the inclusion of the money losing month of January in 2003 CBL results. Our acquisition of CBL in February 2002 has transformed us into a more global, diversified organization. In 2002, we benefited significantly from the additional unit volume of our Europe business, and we expect that this acquisition will continue to be a significant contributor to our consolidated results. Net Sales and Volume In 2002, net sales benefited from strong U.S. pricing as well as reductions in price promotions versus the prior year. This strong pricing was offset by the effect of selling company owned distributorships during 2001 and by a mix shift away from some of our higher net revenue products and geographic areas. We expect the good pricing environment to continue into 2003. However, an increase in promotional discounting or the degree of value pack activity could have an unfavorable impact on sales and margins. Further, sales and margins could be impacted adversely if this "negative mix shift" continues in 2003. Americas sales volume was disappointing in 2002. We finished the year with soft sales to retail trends, though our distributors ended the year with inventory levels above those of the prior year, ensuring that they had sufficient beer inventories to meet demand for the NFL playoffs and the Superbowl. We expect distributor inventories at the end of the first quarter of 2003 to be in line with the prior year, so our sales volume in the first quarter of 2003 is likely to lag sales to retail. This could limit our ability to leverage fixed costs. We anticipate that distributor inventories at the end of 2003 will be similar to those at the end of 2002, resulting in minimal impact of inventory changes on annual volume. Also, our sales in Puerto Rico are likely to continue to be under pressure through the first half of 2003, after which we will begin lapping the impact of the very significant increase in local beer excise tax that took effect in 2002. In 2002, our Europe business net sales were affected substantially by competitive off premise price discounting and an ongoing mix shift from On to Off Trade channels, resulting in fairly flat gross margins. Our Europe segment volume outlook is positive for 2003, although we expect significant volume shifts between quarters compared to a year ago. For instance, the Easter holiday will shift to the second quarter this year from first quarter last year. This shift will benefit second quarter, but will be offset by the lack of a World Cup soccer contest and the Queens 50th Jubilee celebration, that occurred in the second quarter last year. The third quarter should benefit from the lack of high, prior year, post World Cup Soccer retail inventories, as well as the introduction of our Carling brand in Scotland supported by a major soccer sponsorship. 41  Cost of Goods Sold Americas cost of goods sold per barrel was significantly lower in 2002 as a result of the impact of selling company owned distributorships during 2001, as well as lower packaging materials costs and lower costs resulting from operating efficiency initiatives within our distribution and supply chain. We anticipate challenging cost of goods sold per barrel comparisons in 2003, but we will continue our efforts to reduce annual costs per barrel. We believe the following factors will be most important going forward: First, input costs are expected to be slightly unfavorable. Our outlook for 2003 is for modestly higher paper and agricultural commodities costs, while aluminum can costs are expected to be lower. Diesel fuel spot prices have been significantly higher in recent months. If these high costs are sustained during the year, our outlook will be adversely affected. This could become more concerning in our current political environment. Second, operating efficiency initiatives resulted in significant savings in 2002, particularly within our transportation costs and related supply chain work. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2002, we began to lap the first significant savings from these efforts started over a year earlier, which made our cost of goods per barrel comparisons more challenging than the first three quarters of 2002. Our 2003 comparisons will continue to be challenging, but we continue to strive for our long term goal of cutting at least $5 $6 per barrel from our controllable production costs over the next several years. Third, labor related costs are expected to increase in 2003, primarily due to higher pension and health care costs. Europe segment 2002 cost of goods sold achieved modest savings from operating and purchasing efficiencies. We anticipate these savings to continue in 2003, if not accelerate, as we achieve benefits from closing our Cape Hill brewery in the fourth quarter of 2002. Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses Marketing and sales spending in both the Americas and Europe segments is expected to increase modestly in 2003 as we plan to continue investing behind our brands and sales efforts, as is our philosophy and past practice. Additional sales and marketing spending will be committed on an opportunity by opportunity basis, if incremental funding becomes available. General and administrative expense will be higher in 2003 in both the Americas and Europe due to higher labor benefit costs, due in part to higher pension expense, as well as spending on systems and other investments to support our larger, global business. Beginning in 2003, we will begin allocating certain general and administrative expenses to the Corporate segment. These expenses will include corporate office costs that are not attributable to either the Americas or Europe operating segments and include more "corporate center" functions like legal, finance, tax, insurance and other corporate expenses. Interest Income and Expense Consolidated 2003 interest income is expected to be fairly consistent with 2002, and will consist primarily of U.K. trade loan interest income. Interest expense will increase in 2003 vs. 2002, because we will incur a full year of interest on the debt associated with our CBL acquisition in February 2002. Our interest expense will also be impacted by the higher rate, long term debt structure that was not in place until the second quarter of 2002. Prior to finalizing the long term structure, we had higher short term borrowings at lower interest rates. 42 Taxes We expect our consolidated effective tax rate to be at 36% or slightly lower. The effective tax rate could differ materially from 36%, depending upon the outcome of the 1999 and 2000 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audits scheduled to be completed by June 2003 and the impact of further tax planning. Other In 2003, we have planned capital expenditures (excluding capital improvements for our container joint ventures, which will be recorded on the books of the respective joint ventures) in the range of, or slightly lower than, the $240.0 million we spent in 2002. In the Americas segment, these investments will continue to reduce costs and improve productivity. In the Europe segment, the major focus in 2003 is on our Burton on Trent brewery where we are increasing packaging capability and efficiency following the closure of the brewery at Cape Hill.  Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currencies and the prices of production and packaging materials. We have established policies and procedures to govern the strategic management of these exposures through a variety of financial instruments. By policy, we do not enter into any contracts for the purpose of trading or speculation. Our objective in managing our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and production and packaging materials prices is to decrease the volatility of our earnings and cash flows affected by potential changes in underlying rates and prices. To achieve this objective, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swaps, interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps, the values of which change in the opposite direction of the anticipated cash flows. We do not hedge the value of net investments in foreign currency denominated operations or translated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Our primary foreign currency exposures are British pound sterling (GBP), Canadian dollar (CAD) and Japanese yen (YEN). Derivatives are either exchange traded instruments, or over the counter agreements entered into with highly rated financial institutions. No losses on over the counter agreements due to counterparty credit issues are anticipated. All over the counter agreements are entered into with counterparties rated no lower than A (S&P) or A2 (Moodys). In some instances we and our counterparties have reciprocal collateralization agreements regarding fair value positions in excess of certain thresholds. These agreements call for the posting of collateral in the form of cash, treasury securities or letters of credit if a fair value loss position to us or our counterparties exceeds a certain amount. At December 29, 2002, no collateral was posted by us or our counterparties. On February 2, 2002, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Bass Holdings Ltd. and certain other intangible assets from Interbrew. We also paid off certain intercompany loan balances with Interbrew for a total purchase price of 1.2 billion GBP (approximately $1.7 billion at prevailing exchange rates then in existence), plus associated fees, expenses and a restructuring provision. This business was subsequently renamed CBL. As part of our strategy to limit the possible effects of foreign exchange on our acquisition of CBL and the subsequent financial structure implemented for the acquisition, we evaluated and entered into a number of derivative instruments. In December 2001, we entered into a commitment with lenders for the financing of the acquisition of CBL assets. Embedded in the commitment letter was a foreign currency option, purchased by us, which limited our maximum amount of U.S. dollars required to fund the acquisition. At the time our acquisition bid was accepted we entered into a foreign currency forward sale agreement to fix the GBP value of some of our cash on hand that was used to fund the acquisition. The option in the loan commitment expired on February 11, 2002, and the foreign currency forward sale settled on January 12, 43 2002. These two transactions resulted in a combined loss and amortization expense of $1.2 million realized during the first quarter of 2002. In connection with our acquisition of the CBL business, we entered into new senior unsecured credit facilities, borrowing $800 million of 5 year term debt and $750 million of bridge financing. These funds were subsequently exchanged for GBP and used to close the transaction. In order to better match our assets and liabilities the $750 million of bridge financing was recorded as an intercompany loan of 530 million GBP. Upon establishing the intercompany loan, we entered into a forward sale agreement for 530 million GBP. The forward sale agreement was made in order to hedge the effect of fluctuations in the GBP exchange rates on the re measurement of the intercompany loan. The forward sale agreement expired on May 7, 2002. The change in fair value of the forward sale was offset largely by increases or decreases in the value of the intercompany loan. (See Derivative Instruments Footnote 12 to the consolidated financial statements). Since the underlying financing associated with the intercompany loan was short term in nature (the bridge loan), and because our forward sale agreements established as hedges of the intercompany loan expired on May 7, 2002, we were exposed to fluctuations of the GBP exchange rate on our cash requirement to settle the forwards and repay the bridge loan. Therefore, on February 2, 2002, we paid approximately $1.7 billion for a 530 million GBP call option with a strike rate of 1.48 U.S. dollars to GBP. This option expired May 7, 2002. This option limited the maximum amount of U.S. dollars required to settle our forward sale agreement and repay our bridge loan obligations. The cash needed to settle our forward sale of 530 GBP, and subsequently, the $750 million bridge loan was satisfied by our private placement of $850 million principal amount of 63/8% Senior notes, due 2012 (See Derivative Instruments Footnote 12 to the consolidated financial statements) and cash on hand. Amortization expense of approximately $1.7 million related to the call option was recognized in the first quarter of 2002. On May 7, 2002, we entered into certain cross currency swaps totaling 530 million GBP (approximately $774 million). The swaps included an initial exchange of principal on the date of the private placement and will require final principal exchange 10 years later. The swaps also call for an exchange of fixed GBP interest payments for fixed U.S. dollar interest receipts. At the initial principal exchange, we paid U.S. dollars to a counterparty and received GBP. Upon final exchange, we will provide GBP to the counterparty and receive U.S. dollars. The cross currency swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges of the changes in value of the future GBP interest and principal receipts that resulted from changes in the U.S. dollar to GBP exchange rates on an intercompany loan between CBC and our Europe subsidiary. On May 28, 2002, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement related to $76.2 million of our 63/8% Senior notes due 2012. The interest rate swap converted $76.2 million notional amount from fixed rates to floating rates and matures in 2012. We will receive fixed U.S. dollar interest payments semi annually at a rate of 63/8% per annum and pay a rate to our counterparty based on a credit spread of 0.789% plus the three month LIBOR rate, thereby exchanging a fixed interest obligation for a floating interest rate obligation. There was no exchange of principal at the inception of the swap. We designated the interest rate swap as a fair value hedge of the changes in the fair value of $76.2 million of our 63/8% Senior Notes due 2012 attributable to changes in the LIBOR swap rates. We monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using two techniques sensitivity analysis and Value at Risk. Our market sensitive derivative and other financial instruments, as defined by the SEC, are foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swaps, interest rate swaps, and cross currency swaps. 44 We use Value at Risk to monitor the foreign exchange and interest rate risk of our cross currency swaps. The Value at Risk provides an estimate of the level of a one day loss that may be equaled or exceeded due to changes in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate and interest rate sensitive financial instruments. The type of Value at Risk model used to estimate the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value is a variance/covariance method. The Value at Risk model assumes normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used to compute value at risk. The computations used to derive our values take into account various correlations between currency rates and interest rates. The correlations have been determined by observing foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the most recent one year period. We have excluded anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances, and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies from the Value at Risk calculation, some of which these instruments are intended to hedge. The Value at Risk calculation is a statistical measure of risk exposure based on probabilities and is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we may incur. The calculated Value at Risk result does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. It attempts to represent the most likely measure of potential loss that may be experienced 95 times out of 100 due to adverse market events that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated by Value at Risk because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments, hedge percentages, timing and other factors. The estimated maximum one day loss in fair value on our cross currency swaps, derived using the Value at Risk model, was $8.6 million at December 29, 2002. As we did not enter into the cross currency swaps until the second quarter of 2002, there is no comparable one day loss in fair value at December 30, 2001. Such a hypothetical loss in fair value is a combination of the foreign exchange and interest rate components of the cross currency swap. Value changes due to the foreign exchange component would be offset completely by increases in the value of our inter company loan, the underlying transaction being hedged. The hypothetical loss in fair value attributable to the interest rate component would be deferred until termination or maturity. Details of all other market sensitive derivative and other financial instruments, including their fair values, are included in the table below. These instruments include foreign currencies, commodity swaps, interest rate swap and cross currency swaps. Notional principal amounts (USD) Fair values Maturity (In thousands) December 29, 2002 Foreign currency management Forwards $ 19,655 $ 106 01/03 12/03 Cross currency swap 773,800 (43,621 ) 05/12 Commodity pricing management Swaps 112,573 (4,630 ) 03/03 09/04 Interest rate pricing management Interest rate swap 76,200 8,493 05/12 December 30, 2001 Foreign currency management Option(1) 1,705,000 (1,023 ) 02/02 Forwards 217,370 2,336 01/02 04/03 Commodity pricing management Swaps 132,477 (10,563 ) 02/02 02/04 (1)The foreign exchange option for $1.7 billion notional was purchased to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in the GBP exchange rate related to acquisition of certain CBL assets.

Inter company loans are generally hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of cross currency swaps with third parties. A sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate our exposure to market risk of interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. The sensitivity analysis reflects the impact of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the applicable market interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. The volatility of the applicable rates and prices are dependent on many factors that cannot be forecast with reliable accuracy. Therefore, actual changes in fair values could differ significantly from the results presented in the table below. The following table presents the results of the sensitivity analysis of our derivative and debt portfolio: As of Estimated Fair Value Volatility December 29, 2002 December 30, 2001 (In millions) Foreign currency risk: forwards, options $ (2.1 ) $ (22.2 ) Interest rate risk: debt, swaps $ (42.1 ) $ (0.4 ) Commodity price risk: swaps $ (10.8 ) $ (12.2 ) 46
