ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary Overall, 2003 was a difficult year for us, especially in the US We faced extremely soft industry demand throughout the year in the US, and, although we made significant progress in key areas of our business, our Americas segment profits came in only slightly above our prior year results. The US beer industry faced many challenges in 2003, including: Continued weakness in the US economy during 2003 and, specifically, high unemployment levels among the key 21 24 year old male consumer population, Unfavorable weather, particularly in the Northeast, for a significant part of the peak summer selling season, The popularity of low carbohydrate diets that softened demand for beer, The rise in popularity of distilled spirits and other alternative beverages, particularly among 21 29 year olds, and A protracted grocery store strike in California that likely impacted sales in the largest beer state. Two additional issues were unique to our US business during 2003. First, we did not offer a product with low carbohydrate positioning. Second, late in the year, when most of the industry was showing signs of recovery, we experienced significant product supply problems that left us unable to meet all the needs of our wholesale and retail customers. We are addressing these issues early in 2004 in order to optimize our supply chain systems capabilities. Our 2003 performance in the Europe segment, specifically in the UK, reflected strong volume and market share growth. Results were negatively impacted by the lack of benefits in 2003 from revenue producing transitional activities which occurred in 2002 following our acquisition of the UK business, as well as high levels of discounting in the off Trade channel during the first two thirds of the year. Later in the year, however, our performance in the UK showed the positive profit impact of our strong volume growth, reduced off Trade discounting levels, and productivity improvements from supply chain initiatives. One critical area of accomplishment in 2003 was our cash generation and debt reduction. Full year debt repayments totaled $272 million, more than 30% greater than the $208 million we repaid in 2002. Cash flow during the year benefited from higher operating cash flow, a temporary reduction in cash taxes, improvements in working capital, and continually improving capital spending disciplines in the US Those are the key highlights for 2003. Looking forward, we have four major strategies were focused on to succeed in the global beer industry: First, we are striving to capture an increasing share of each new generation of legal drinking age beer drinkers in order to gain their brand loyalty for the long term. We intend to accomplish this by building our big brands in big markets Coors Light in the Americas, Carling and Grolsch in the UK which are the young adult beer drinkers point of entry into our portfolio. To achieve this goal, we continued during 2003 to refine our sales and marketing initiatives supporting our flagship brands. As a result, volume momentum in the UK behind Carling and Grolsch has been outstanding. In Canada, Coors Light has continued to grow volume and market share.Despite a poor volume year in the US, weve made progress among key demographics and retail channels, and we are taking steps to make all of our initiatives even more effective. Second, we intend to capture more than our fair share of the product news opportunities in the category each year through both new products and brands, or product developments with existing brands, such as Coors Light and Carling. In March 2004, we launched Aspen Edge our entry in the low carb segment here in the US. We are also repositioning Zima in the US, continuing to expand Carling Extra Cold in the UK, and launching our Coors Fine Light beer in the UK. Third, we need to strengthen our access to retail by building the capabilities that are key to partnering and being successful with our wholesalers and retailers. Our biggest investment to strengthen our access to retail in 2003 was the initiative to improve our Americas supply chain systems and processes. Making these investments was a necessity for the long term success of our business. Our start up problems were greater than expected, but in early 2004, product supply has improved as wholesale and retail stock outs are now a fraction of what they were in our most difficult period early in the fourth quarter of 2003. When the capabilities of our new supply chain systems and processes are more fully optimized later this year, our 13 distributors will have more control over their orders, better visibility throughout the shipping process, and better service, which we anticipate will result in efficiencies and cost savings for us and for our distributors. Fourth, we need to lower our cost structure so that we can grow profits and afford the investments needed to grow and succeed. In 2003 we made significant progress in both the Americas and Europe. Productivity from operations in the US was solid in 2003, despite soft volume. In the UK, we right sized our production assets in 2003, and we expect to see the benefits in 2004. We believe these four strategies represent the right business model for succeeding in our current environment. Despite our 2003 results and the challenges ahead, we have made significant progress in key areas of our business that make us optimistic about our future prospects. # # # 14 Results of Operations Our consolidated results are driven by the results of our two operating segments, Americas and Europe, and our unallocated corporate expenses. When comparing 2003 to 2002, note that we only include CBL results since February 2, 2002, the date of acquisition, thus excluding CBLs January 2002 results. Consolidated income before income taxes decreased 1.1% in 2003 compared to 2002. Our consolidated volume increased 2.8% from 31.8 million barrels to 32.7 million barrels. These results were driven by improved performance in the second half of the year in our major businesses outside the United States, including Europe, Canada, and the Caribbean. Our business was also helped by favorable foreign exchange rates, better margins, and improved UK operations productivity. However, offsetting these positive factors, our US business suffered from soft industry demand throughout the year, increased popularity of beers with low carbohydrate positioning, and our product supply disruptions related to implementation of our new supply chain systems and processes late in the year. Our effective tax rate in 2003 at 31.2% was significantly lower than our tax rate in 2002 at 37.0%. The lower rate was primarily the result of the favorable completion of tax audits for the years 1996 through 2000 and benefits realized from the tax structure related to the acquisition of our UK business. This lower tax rate is directly responsible for net income and earnings per share increasing 8% in 2003 from the prior year. From 2001 to 2002, consolidated income before taxes increased significantly, primarily as a result of our acquisition of CBL on February 2, 2002. From 2001 to 2002, our net sales and income before income taxes increased 55.4% and 29.6%, respectively, as a result of the additional business. We also experienced a significant increase in interest expense, from $2.0 million to $70.9 million, during 2002 as a result of debt incurred to acquire the CBL business. We achieved an increase from 22.7 million barrels to 31.8 million barrels of beverages, an increase of 40%. Our Americas business reported a modest increase in income before income taxes and basically flat volume from 2001 to 2002. These results are expanded upon in the Americas segment discussion that follows. Our consolidated effective tax rate was 37.0% in 2002, down from 37.9% for 2001. The decrease was driven by the benefits realized from our UK business. Americas Segment The Americas segment is focused on the production, marketing and sales of the Coors portfolio of brands in the United States and its territories. This segment also includes the Coors Light business in Canada that is conducted through a partnership investment with Molson, Coors Canada, and the sale of Molson products in the United States that is conducted through a joint venture investment, Molson USA. The Americas segment also includes the small amount of volume that is sold outside of the United States and its territories and Europe. 15 Fiscal Year Ended December 28, 2003 Percent Change December 29, 2002 Percent Change December 30, 2001 (In thousands, except percentages) Volume in barrels 22,374 (1.4 )% 22,688 N/M 22,667 Net sales $ 2,409,595 0.4 % 2,400,849 (0.9 % $ 2,422,282 Cost of goods sold (1,474,250 ) (0.5 )% (1,481,630 ) (3.3 )% (1,532,471 ) Gross profit 935,345 1.8 % 919,219 3.3 % 889,811 Marketing, general and administrative expenses (717,622 ) 2.3 % (701,454 ) 2.3 % (685,568 ) Special charges, net (1) N/M (3,625 ) (84.4 )% (23,174 ) Operating income 217,723 1.7 % 214,140 18.3 % 181,069 Gain on sale of distributorships (2) N/M 27,667 Other income, net (3) 3,485 (28.4 )% 4,864 N/M 1,319 Income before income taxes $ 221,208 1.0 % $ 219,004 4.3 % $ 210,055 (1) The 2002 net charge consists of expenses related to restructuring and the dissolution of our former can and end joint venture, offset by a cash payment on a debt from our former partner in a brewing business in South Korea. The net 2001 charge consists of the restructuring of our purchasing and production organizations, impairment charges on certain fixed assets, charges to dissolve our former can and end joint venture and incremental consulting, legal and other costs incurred in preparation to restructure and outsource our information technology infrastructure. (2) Gain from the sale of Company owned distributorships (3) Consists primarily of equity share of Molson USA losses and gains from sales of water rights and warehouses. N/M Not Meaningful Foreign Currency impact on 2003 results In 2003, our Americas segment benefited from a 10.8% year over year increase in the value of the Canadian Dollar (CAD) against the US dollar. As a result of this exchange rate fluctuation, net sales, operating income, and income before taxes are higher than in the prior year by approximately $5.5 million. Net sales and volume Net sales for the Americas segment increased slightly from 2002 to 2003. On a per barrel basis, net sales increased 1.8% while volume decreased 1.4% year over year. Net sales were impacted positively by continued favorable pricing in the United States, as well as significant growth in our Canadian business. Likewise, net sales were impacted positively by a one time $4.2 million increase in revenue during the first quarter that resulted from the settlement of a contract interpretation dispute between CBC and one of our wholesalers. However, we experienced challenges in our Americas segment as our volume was impacted negatively by a weak industry demand throughout the year caused by a very wet summer in the Northeast and a sluggish economy. In addition, we were negatively impacted by a mix shift toward lower revenue per barrel brands such as Keystone Light, which experienced a volume growth of 10.9%. Growing consumer interest in low carbohydrate food and beverage products hurt sales for Coors Light and other premium light beers that did not have low carbohydrate positioning. As a result of this change in consumer tastes and the mix shift away from premium products, Coors Light sales volume declined in 2003. We also experienced significant challenges in the fourth quarter of 2003 when we implemented new supply chain systems and processes. Due to a difficult start up early in the fourth quarter, we were unable to ship sufficient quantities of beer in some brand and package configurations. While our supply chain improved by the end of the year, the supply disruptions caused by this implementation had a meaningful negative impact on 2003 volume and earnings. Our 2002 net sales decreased 0.9% from 2001, while volume for the Americas segment remained relatively flat. Net revenue per barrel declined 1% from 2001. The declines were mostly due to the sale of company owned distributorships in 2001 (whose volumes were included in 2001 results until the date of sale), a decline in volume in Puerto Rico as a result of a 50% increase in a beer excise tax that took effect during the summer of 2002, and a 16 negative sales mix in the United States where consumer preferences moved toward our lower revenue per barrel brands, geographies, and packages. Partially offsetting these declines in sales and volume was improved domestic pricing and reduced price promotions. From a brand perspective, growth in domestic Coors Light and Keystone Light brands in 2002 versus 2001 were partially offset by declines in Zima, Killians and exported Coors Light. Zima was impacted disproportionately by the influx of new flavored alcohol beverages (FABs) in the United States during much of 2002. Cost of goods sold and gross profit Americas cost of goods sold increased approximately 0.9% per barrel in 2003 versus 2002. The overall increase in cost of goods sold per barrel in 2003 was the result of higher depreciation costs stemming from recent additions to fixed assets, higher pension and other labor related costs, increased fuel costs, and the de leveraging of fixed costs resulting from the decline in volume. Our higher pension costs were the result of the unfavorable impacts of lower returns on pension assets in recent years and lower discount rates. In addition to these more pervasive factors, we incurred approximately $8 million of increased costs in the fourth quarter of 2003, primarily related to extra freight, direct labor and finished goods loss associated with our new supply chain processes and systems implementation. These costs were in addition to the impacts from decreased volume. However, our controllable operations costs, which make up about 95% of our Americas cost of goods sold, declined slightly per barrel during the year as a result of operations efficiency initiatives and improved packaging costs. Compared to 2002, our 2003 gross profit increased 1.8%, or 3.2% on a per barrel basis. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased by nearly 1%. Increases were driven primarily by price increases and improved operations efficiencies and lower packaging costs. In 2002, we experienced a 3.3% decrease in cost of goods sold. On a per barrel basis, the decline was 3.4%. As a percentage of net sales, cost of goods sold was approximately 61.7% in 2002 compared to 63.3% in 2001. These decreases are attributable primarily to the sale of company owned distributorships in 2001, lower transportation and packaging costs and continued operations efficiency initiatives in our breweries. Offsetting these decreases were higher costs associated with adding capacity to our Golden and Memphis manufacturing facilities and bottle packaging capacity in Shenandoah, Virginia. We also incurred higher pension and other labor related costs. Our gross profit increased 3.3% in 2002 over 2001. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased nearly 2%. Increases were driven by the decline in cost of goods sold. Marketing, General and Administrative expenses Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased 2.3%, or 3.8% on a per barrel basis, in 2003 compared to 2002. This increase was driven by higher costs for employee benefits, primarily pension costs, and higher spending levels related to information technology. Selling and marketing expense was also slightly higher year over year. In 2002, marketing, general and administrative expenses increased 2.3% over the previous year, driven by higher marketing expense as we invested more behind our brands in advertising and sales promotion, higher systems investments and labor related costs. Partially offset by this increase in selling and marketing expense was a decline in general and administrative expense due to the sale of company owned distributorships in 2001. Europe Segment The Europe segment consists of our production and sale of the CBL brands, principally in the United Kingdom but also in other parts of the world, our joint venture arrangement relating to the production and distribution of Grolsch in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland, and our joint venture arrangement for the physical distribution of products throughout Great Britain (Tradeteam). It also includes the sale of Coors Fine Light in the United Kingdom and Coors Light in the Republic of Ireland. Note that the CBL results for January 2002, typically a loss month, are excluded from the 2002 results discussed below. 17 Fiscal Year Ended December 28, 2003 Percent Change December 29, 2002 (1) December 30, 2001 (1) (In thousands, except percentages) Volume in barrels 10,361 13.2 % 9,153 46 Net sales $ 1,590,518 15.6 % $ 1,375,473 $ 7,180 Cost of goods sold (1,112,533 ) 19.3 % (932,900 ) (5,152 ) Gross profit 477,985 8.0 % 442,573 2,028 Marketing, general and administrative expenses (361,553 ) 9.0 % (331,656 ) (10,188 ) Operating income (loss) 116,432 5.0 % 110,917 (8,160 ) Interest income 17,156 4.7 % 16,390 Other income, net (2) 4,114 133.0 % 1,766 Income (loss) before income taxes $ 137,702 6.7 % $ 129,073 $ (8,160 ) (1) Since we did not own CBL prior to February 2002, we do not report historical financial results for this business. Accordingly, the historical Europe segment results include only our pre acquisition Europe operation, which generated very small volume and revenue. Our discussion on the comparative results of the Europe segment from 2001 to 2002 has been excluded, as comparative results are not meaningful. (2) 2003 other income, net was composed primarily of Tradeteam income (included in cost of goods sold in 2002), offset by leasehold expenses and losses on asset sales (See Item 8, Note 2). In 2002, other income, net primarily related to income from a small investment in an internet marketing venture in the UK. N/M Not Meaningful Foreign currency impact on 2003 results In 2003, our Europe segment benefited from an 8.4% year over year increase in the value of the British pound sterling (GBP) against the US dollar, partially as a result of this exchange rate fluctuation, all results from our Europe segment in 2003 are significantly higher than in the prior year. The following table summarizes the approximate effect this change in exchange rate had on the Europe results in 2003: Increase Due to Currency Effects (In thousands) Net sales $US 126,071 Cost of goods sold (88,950 ) Gross profit 37,121 Marketing, general & administrative (29,115 ) Operating income 8,006 Interest income 1,398 Other income, net 397 Income before income taxes $ 9,801 Net sales and volume Net sales for the Europe segment increased 15.6% in 2003, while volume increased 13.2% from the previous year. The significant increase in net sales and volume was partly due to our owning the CBL business for the full year in 2003 versus forty seven weeks in 2002. 9% of the sales increase represents the effect of currency exchange rates. On a full year comparative basis, our sales volumes increased 6.7%. This growth was driven by the Carling and Grolsch brands, both of which grew volume by more than 10% during the year. Our on trade business, which represents approximately two thirds of our Europe volume and an even greater portion of margin, grew volume by approximately 5% compared to the full year 2002 as a result of strong sales execution, particularly with Carling and Carling Extra Cold, and unusually hot weather in the United Kingdom this summer. In a declining on trade market, this yielded a market share gain of approximately 1.5 percentage points. Our off trade volume for 2003 increased approximately 13% over the comparable period in 2002, led by Carling and Grolsch. 18 Contributing factors to this volume growth were the favorable summer weather and aggressive discounting, primarily in the first half of the year. Our off trade market share growth for the year was approximately 1%. Our positive volume in both the on and off trade and positive pricing in the on trade were partially offset by a decline in our on trade factored brand sales and, in the off trade, heavy price discounting and mix shift toward lower revenue per barrel sales. The decline in sales of factored brands in the on trade was driven by some of our large on trade chain customers changing to purchase non Coors products directly from the brand owners. Cost of goods sold and gross profit Cost of goods sold increased 19.3% in 2003 versus 2002. On a per barrel basis, cost of goods sold increased 5.4%. The aggregate increase in cost of goods sold was driven by increased volume and higher foreign exchange rates, coupled with our owning the business for the full year versus only a partial period in 2002. Also driving this increase, and the increase in the per barrel cost, was the reclassification of Tradeteam earnings from cost of goods sold to other income beginning in 2003 and the loss of income from contract brewing arrangements that substantially ceased near the end of 2002. Additionally, during the first three quarters of 2003, we incurred higher production costs as we contracted with regional brewers to package some of our off trade volume while we were commissioning the new and upgraded packing lines in our Burton brewery. We were able to realize some benefit from right sizing and improving our UK production infrastructure towards the latter half of the year, which partially offset the increases noted above. The increases in cost of goods sold were also reduced by the decrease in factored brand volume where the purchase cost is included in our cost of goods sold, but the related volume is not included in reported volumes. Gross profit in the Europe segment increased 8.0%; however, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, gross profit was essentially flat despite the inclusion of a full year of sales in 2003. Gross profit per barrel decreased 4.6% and gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased 2% during 2003 as a result of the reclassification of Tradeteam earnings and our contract packaging costs incurred as we commissioned the packaging lines in Burton. Marketing, general and administrative expenses Europe marketing, general and administrative expenses increased 9.0% during 2003 almost entirely due to exchange rates and the impact of the full year of ownership. On a per barrel basis, marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased 3.7% year over year. Various factors impacted marketing, general and administrative expense during 2003, which effectively off set each other: (a) we had higher investments in sales staff and increased depreciation charges from investments in information systems and dispense equipment, the latter supporting the sales growth in the on trade; (b) we were impacted by the loss of reimbursements from the transitional services arrangements with Interbrew S.A. that were set up following the CBL acquisition in February 2002 and largely concluded by the end of that year. These reimbursements were recorded as a reduction to marketing, general and administrative expenses in 2002; (c) we realized savings in employee bonus costs and directors costs; and (d) the one time gain of $3.5 million before tax on the sale of the rights to our Hoopers Hooch FAB brand in Russia during the third quarter. Interest income Interest income is earned on trade loans to UK on trade customers. Interest income increased 4.7% in 2003 as a result of favorable foreign exchange rates, the inclusion of an additional five weeks of results in 2003 and a lower debt balance in 2003. Corporate Corporate currently includes interest expense and certain other general and administrative costs that are not allocable to either the Americas or Europe operating segments. Corporate contains no sales or cost of goods sold. In 2003, we changed our allocation methodology between the Americas and Europe segments for general and administrative expenses, leaving certain of these costs in Corporate. The 2002 and 2001 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the new presentation. The majority of these corporate costs relates to worldwide finance and administrative functions, such as corporate affairs, legal, human resources, insurance and risk management. 19 Fiscal Year Ended December 28, 2003 Percent Change December 29, 2002 Percent Change December 30, 2001 (In thousands, except percentages) Net sales $ $ $ Cost of goods sold Gross profit Marketing, general and administrative expenses (26,784 ) 11.0 % (24,130 ) 13.3 % (21,304 ) Special charges (1) N/M (2,642 ) N/M Operating loss (26,784 ) N/M (26,772 ) 25.7 % (21,304 ) Interest income 2,089 (56.5 )% 4,797 (70.8 )% 16,409 Interest expense (81,195 ) 14.5 % (70,919 ) N/M (2,006 ) Other income, net (2) 798 (43.7 )% 1,417 (53.1 )% 3,019 Loss before income taxes $ (105,092 ) 14.9 % $ (91,477 ) N/M $ (3,882 ) (1) Relate primarily to acquisition costs for CBL, including accounting, appraisal and legal fees not eligible for capitalization. (2) Consists of foreign currency exchange gains (losses), bank fees and gains on sales of investments. N/M Not Meaningful Marketing, general and administrative expenses Marketing, general and administrative expenses for Corporate increased 11.0% in 2003 compared to 2002 due to increased pension and benefit costs and management of a larger global business. 2002 marketing, general and administrative expenses increased significantly from 2001 for the same reasons. Interest income Interest income for 2003 decreased $2.7 million because of lower interest rates and lower cash balances in 2003 over 2002. Interest income decreased $11.6 million from 2001 to 2002 due to higher cash and interest bearing securities balances in 2001. We sold all of our interest bearing securities in January 2002 to help fund the acquisition of CBL. Interest expense Interest expense increased $10.3 million in 2003. This increase was driven by having our fixed rate debt structure in place for the full year in 2003 versus only eight months in 2002 and the currency appreciation on our GBP denominated term debt prior to its payoff in August 2003. Prior to finalizing the long term structure in second quarter of 2002, we had exclusively short term borrowings at lower interest rates that supported our acquisition of CBL in February 2002. The increase is also due to our cross currency swap structure and our GBP denominated interest expense. Partially offsetting these factors was the implementation of our lower interest rate commercial paper program in June 2003, the initial proceeds of which we used to pay down approximately $300 million of higher rate GBP denominated term debt. Our new debt structure has lower interest costs on outstanding balances. 2002 interest expense increased $68.9 million versus 2001 due to the significant increase in debt incurred to purchase CBL early that year. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and external borrowings. As of December 28, 2003, including cash and short term borrowings, we had negative working capital of $54.9 million compared to negative working capital of $94.0 million at December 29, 2002. We are able to operate with a negative working capital investment because of relatively short terms on receivables in our Americas segment and our ability to carry low levels of finished goods inventories as a result of the structure of our distribution system. These factors are offset by higher investments in working capital in Europe, primarily with regard to accounts receivable. The increase in our working capital is the net result of changes in our short term borrowings, accrued expenses and other liabilities, accounts and notes receivable and raw materials. At December 28, 2003, cash and short term marketable securities totaled 20 $19.4 million, compared to $59.2 million at December 29, 2002. Our cash and short term marketable securities balances decreased primarily due to early payments of principal and interest on our long term debt made late in our fiscal year 2003. We believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by short term borrowings, when necessary, will be quite sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditures. However, our liquidity could be impacted significantly by a decrease in demand for our products, which could arise from competitive circumstances, a decline in the acceptability of alcohol beverages, any shift away from light beers and any of the other factors we describe in the section titled Risk Factors. We continue to evaluate opportunities to supplement our operating cash flow through potential monetizations of assets. Success in accomplishing these efforts will result in faster reduction of outstanding debt. We also have credit facilities that contain financial and operating covenants, and provide for scheduled repayments, that could impact our liquidity on an ongoing basis. During the fiscal year ended December 28, 2003, we made debt repayments of approximately $272.0 million. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased $285.6 million in 2003 compared to 2002. The increase was attributable primarily to cash provided by trade receivables and payables in 2003 the result of continued emphasis on working capital management by improving receivable collection in the UK and managing the purchasing cycle throughout the Company. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $65.1 million in 2002, compared to 2001. The change was attributable primarily to the acquisition of CBL, which added to our depreciation and amortization and modified the composition of our working capital in 2002. Investing Activities During the fiscal year ended December 28, 2003, we used net cash of $229.9 million in investing activities, compared to $1.6 billion used in 2002. The decrease in net cash used is due to the $1.6 billion payment, net of cash acquired, made to purchase CBL in 2002. However, excluding our 2002 $1.6 billion payment to acquire CBL, total cash used in investing activities increased approximately $232.9 million compared to the same period last year, mainly due to the absence of sales and maturities of investments in 2003 versus 2002. A significant amount of investments was sold in 2002 to help fund the acquisition of CBL. Net cash used in investing activities increased $1.4 billion from 2001 to 2002. The increase was due to the cash used in the acquisition of CBL. Also, in 2001, we made a payment of $65.0 million for our 49.9% interest in Molson USA. However, excluding these payments, total cash provided by investing activities increased approximately $134.7 million year over year mostly due to a substantial decrease in purchases of securities. As a result of our debt burden associated with the CBL acquisition, we did not purchase any marketable securities in 2002 compared to purchases of $228.2 million during 2001. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $357.4 million in 2003, representing a $1.6 billion decrease from cash provided by financing activities in 2002. This decrease is primarily attributable to the $2.4 billion proceeds from issuance of debt in 2002, partially offset by larger payments on debt and capital lease obligations in 2002. Debt related activity in 2003 reflected net payments of long and short term debt totaling $297.1 million whereas in 2002, debt related activity reflected a net increase in long and short term debt of $1.3 billion, due primarily to borrowings related to our acquisition of CBL. Repayments of long term debt during 2003 totaled $272.0 million; the remaining change in financing activities relates to temporary changes in short term borrowings. In 2002, net cash provided by financing activities increased $1.3 billion from the previous year as a result of debt proceeds and payments associated with our acquisition of CBL. Excluding these items, change in financing activities was driven by changes in overdraft balances and the absence of treasury stock purchases in 2002 versus purchases of $72.3 million in 2001. 21 Debt Structure Our total borrowings as of December 28, 2003, were composed of the following: As of Description December 28, 2003 December 29, 2002 (In thousands) Short term borrowings $ 21,309 $ 101,654 Senior private placement notes $ 20,000 $ 20,000 6 3/8% Senior notes due 2012 854,043 855,289 Senior Credit Facility: USD amortizing term loan 86,000 168,000 GBP amortizing term loan 365,689 Commercial paper 249,645 Other 20,006 16,809 Total long term debt (including current portion) 1,229,694 1,425,787 Less current portion of long term debt (69,856 ) (42,395 ) Total long term debt $ 1,159,838 $ 1,383,392 The aggregate principal debt maturities of long term debt for the next five fiscal years are as follows: Amount (In thousands) 2004 $ 69,856 2005 24,951 2006 80,133 2007 199,338 2008 Thereafter 855,416 Total $ 1,229,694 We incurred significant debt in 2002 to finance the purchase of CBL. Since the acquisition, we have used cash from operating activities and from asset monetizations, net of capital expenditures and other cash used in investing activities, to make payments on our debt obligations. In June 2003, we issued approximately $300 million of commercial paper, approximately $250 million of which was outstanding at December 28, 2003. $200 million of our commercial paper balance is classified as long term, reflecting our intent to keep this amount outstanding for longer than 360 days and our ability to refinance these borrowings on a long term basis through our revolving line of credit. The remaining $50 million is classified as short term, as our intent is to repay that portion in the next twelve months. Concurrent with our issuance of commercial paper, we made a payment against the then outstanding principal and interest on our GBP denominated amortizing term loan of approximately 181.1 million GBP ($300.3 million at then prevailing foreign currency exchange rates) using proceeds from our issuance of commercial paper. We repaid the balance of our GBP term loan in the third quarter of 2003 using cash generated from operations. We also repaid $55 million of our US dollar (USD) denominated term loan in the fourth quarter. In conjunction with these payments, we accelerated our amortization of loan fees, resulting in a charge of $3.7 million to interest expense during the year. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for further information. In May 2003, we increased our unsecured committed credit arrangement from $300 million to $500 million in order to support our commercial paper program. As of December 28, 2003, $250 million of the total $500 million line of credit was being used as a backstop for our commercial paper program while the remainder was available for general corporate purposes. At December 28, 2003, CBC had two USD denominated uncommitted lines of credit totaling $50.0 million in aggregate. The lines of credit are with two different lenders. We had $7.0 million outstanding under these lines of credit as of December 28, 2003. CBL had two 10 million GBP uncommitted lines of credit and a 10 22 million GBP overdraft facility. No amount had been drawn on the overdraft facility as of December 28, 2003. The lines of credit had balances outstanding of $11.9 million at December 28, 2003. In addition, we have two uncommitted lines of credit totaling 900 million Japanese yen or approximately $8.4 million at December 28, 2003. At December 28, 2003, interest rates were below 1% and balances outstanding totaled $2.4 million. Some of our debt instruments require us to meet certain covenant restrictions, including financial tests and other limitations. As of December 28, 2003, we were in compliance with all of these covenants. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Contractual Cash Obligations as of December 28, 2003 Payments Due By Period Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years (In thousands) Long term debt $ 1,229,694 $ 69,856 $ 105,084 $ 199,338 $ 855,416 Operating leases 105,749 21,898 36,534 18,671 28,646 Retirement plan expenditures (3) 172,059 78,305 19,874 21,167 52,713 Other long term obligations(1) 6,606,199 1,139,062 1,718,270 1,344,728 2,404,139 Total obligations $ 8,113,701 $ 1,309,121 $ 1,879,762 $ 1,583,904 $ 3,340,914 Other Commercial Commitments Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years (In thousands) Standby letters of credit $ 9,054 $ 9,054 $ $ $ Guarantees (2) 2,324 2,324 Total commercial commitments $ 11,378 $ 11,378 $ $ $ (1) Approximately $4.3 billion of the total other long term obligations relate to long term supply contracts with our joint ventures and unaffiliated third parties to purchase material used in packaging, such as cans and bottles. Approximately $1.2 billion relates to commitments associated with our logistics provider in the UK. The remaining amounts relate to sales and marketing, information technology services, open purchase orders and other commitments. On July 29, 2003, we signed a new agreement, effective August 1, 2003, with Owens relating to the operation of our joint venture and the production of glass bottles, as well as the supply of glass bottles for our non Golden commercial business. The new agreement has a term of 12 years, and is reflected in the table above, whereas the previous agreement extended to 2005. In December 2003, we signed a new agreement with Electronic Data Systems (EDS), an information services provider, effective January 1, 2004. The new EDS contract includes services to our Americas and Europe operations and our corporate offices and will expire in 2010. Included in Other long term obligations is the effect of our most recent completed contract with GPC, dated March 25, 2003. (2) Guarantees consist of guaranteed portions of short term debt also included in Long term debt above. (3) Represents expected contributions under our defined benefit pension plans and our benefits payments under retiree medical plans. Advertising and Promotions As of December 28, 2003, our aggregate commitments for advertising and promotions, including marketing at sports arenas, stadiums and other venues and events, total approximately $250 million over the next five years. Capital Expenditures In 2003, we spent approximately $240 million on capital improvement projects worldwide. Of this, approximately 62% was in support of the Europe business and the remainder was for the Americas. We currently plan capital expenditures in the same range, or slightly lower, for 2004. Pension Plans Although pension investment returns were strong in 2003, the impact of the three previous years returns and a continued decline in interest rates resulted in a slightly lower consolidated funded position at year end 2003 23 compared to year end 2002. At year end 2003, the accumulated pension benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of the plan assets on a consolidated US dollar basis by approximately $411 million, compared to $394 million at the end of 2002. Accordingly, we have taken a charge to equity of $15.0 million, net of tax (Refer to Item 8. Note 12). At year end 2003, the projected benefit obligations were $2,624.9 million and the accumulated benefit obligations were $2,412.5 million. The amounts reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for accrued pension liability, accumulated other comprehensive loss, prepaid benefit cost and intangible asset in 2003 are $452.3 million, $385.6 million ($236.0 million, net of tax), $41.5 million and $40.8 million, respectively. In 2003, an additional minimum pension liability of $9.7 million was recorded and is included in the accrued pension liability amount. It is our practice to fund amounts for pensions at least sufficient to meet the minimum requirements set forth in applicable employee benefits laws and local tax laws. For further information regarding pension plan assets, refer to Note 7, Employee Retirement Plans, and Note 13, Other Comprehensive Income, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. In 2003, our actuarially assumed long term rates of return on plan asset investments were 9% for the US Retirement Plan and 7.5% for the UK Plan. In selecting those assumptions, we considered investment returns by asset class as represented by our independent pension investment consultants, and applied the relevant asset allocation percentages. The discount rates of 6.25% and 5.63% were based on prevailing yields of high quality corporate fixed income investments in the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively. In 2003, consolidated pension expense was $38.7 million, which represented approximately 1% of consolidated cost of goods sold and other operating expenses. Pension contributions on a consolidated basis were $51.0 million during 2003. On a consolidated basis we anticipate making voluntary pension contributions of approximately $69 million in 2004. On a consolidated basis, we had unrecognized net actuarial losses of $598.0 million and $547.0 million at December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002, respectively. Actuarial losses are primarily comprised of cumulative investment returns that are lower than actuarially assumed investment returns and liability losses due to increased pension liabilities and falling interest rates. Pension expense includes amortization of these actuarial losses after they exceed certain thresholds. As a result of losses in excess of the thresholds, we recorded actuarial loss amortization of $9.1 million in 2003 and $1.0 million in 2002. It is expected that actuarial loss amortization in 2004 will increase to approximately $14 million. We anticipate consolidated pension expense will increase from the $38.7 million in 2003 to approximately $49 million in 2004. The expected increase in consolidated pension cost is primarily due to the combined impacts of higher actuarial loss amortization and foreign exchange. Cautionary Statement Pursuant to Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 This report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. From time to time, we may also provide oral or written forward looking statements in other materials we release to the public. Forward looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. You can identify these statements by forward looking words such as expect, anticipate, plan, believe, seek, estimate, outlook, trends, future benefits, strategies, goals and similar words. Statements that we make in this report that are not statements of historical fact may also be forward looking statements. In particular, statements that we make under the headings Narrative Description of Business, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Outlook for 2004 including, but not limited to, statements relating to our overall volume trends, consumer preferences, pricing trends and industry forces, cost reduction strategies and anticipated results, our expectations for funding our 2004 capital expenditures and operations, debt service capabilities, shipment levels and profitability, increased market share and the sufficiency of capital to meet working capital, capital expenditures requirements and our strategies, are forward looking statements. Forward looking statements are not guarantees of our future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward looking statements. In particular, our future results could be affected by the substantial amount of indebtedness remaining from financing the acquisition of the CBL business in the United Kingdom, which could, among other things, hinder our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions, make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn and place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to less leveraged competitors. You should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements. We do not promise to notify you if we learn that our assumptions or projections are wrong for any reason. We do not undertake to publicly update forward looking statements, whether as a result of new 24 information, future events or otherwise. You should be aware that the factors we discuss in Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report could cause our actual results to differ from any forward looking statements. Outlook for 2004 Americas Segment Net Sales and Volume Going into 2004, we expect the US pricing environment to remain positive and anticipate continued good performance in Canada. Nonetheless, an increase in price discounting or a decline in volume could have an unfavorable impact on sales and margins. Further, sales and margins could be impacted adversely if the negative mix shift that we experienced in 2003 continues into 2004. We believe that the March launch of our own low carbohydrate beer, Aspen Edge, will make us more competitive and contribute to improved volume treads in 2004. Also in response to the low carbohydrate interest, we began running new consumer education advertising for our Coors Light brand, indicating that Coors Light is nearly as low in carbohydrates as our competitions brands with low carbohydrate positioning. While the disruptions caused by the implementation of our new supply chain systems during the fourth quarter were frustrating both to us and to our distributors and caused us to lose volume, we were able to work through most of our product supply issues and rebuild overall distributor inventories by the middle of the first quarter of 2004. During December, sales to retail trends were soft and resulted in distributor inventories ending 2003 approximately 100,000 barrels higher than normal seasonal levels. This will impact 2004 volume trends, as distributors work down their inventories to normal seasonal levels during peak season. Finally, going into 2004, we continue to focus on regaining volume momentum, improving shipment performance, rebuilding the reliability and efficiency of our supply chain and gearing up for the peak summer selling season. Cost of Goods Sold In 2004, we believe the following factors are most important to our cost of goods sold per barrel expectations: First, input costs will increase in 2004, as we expect modestly higher packaging material expenses due to higher aluminum prices and energy related costs. Fuel costs and new transportation carrier regulations are likely to have an unfavorable impact on logistics costs. Second, labor related costs are expected to increase in 2004, primarily due to higher pension and healthcare costs. Third, we remain confident that our continued focus on operating efficiency within our entire supply chain will help us achieve our long term goal of reducing controllable production costs by $4 5 per barrel over the next 4 5 years. However, our ability to realize these savings is partially dependant on our ability to leverage fixed costs, and a significant change in our volume assumptions could impact our ability to reach this goal. While supply chain performance is better than it was in the fourth quarter of 2003, and while we have numerous initiatives underway to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our supply chain, we still need more progress to have success in the coming peak season. Finally, our 2003 cost per barrel results were adversely impacted by additional costs related to the implementation of our new supply chain systems. Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses Marketing and sales spending in the Americas in 2004 is expected to increase at a proportionately higher rate than the past few years as we plan to invest behind our Aspen Edge launch and incrementally behind our Coors Light marketing and sales efforts. Consistent with our philosophy and past practice, we will evaluate our brand and sales investment levels during the year and adjust as needed. General and administrative expense will be higher in 2004 primarily due to higher labor costs, including higher pension and healthcare expense, and increased spending on information systems. Europe Segment Net Sales and Volume In Europe, we anticipate that our on trade channel business will continue to grow both volume and share in 2004, but at a slower pace than in 2003, when volume trends benefited from the rollout of Carling Extra Cold and hot summer weather. In the off trade channel, volume and market share trends are likely to slow substantially in the first three quarters of 2004 as we lap aggressive off trade discounting activity and the unusually warm summer of 2003. 25 Nonetheless, we are optimistic that the impact of lower volume will be more than offset by the related improvement in margins, as it was in the fourth quarter of 2003, when we achieved better balance between growth and margins. We anticipate that volumes in the second quarter will benefit from the Euro 2004 football (soccer) tournament. In contrast, the third quarter could face particularly challenging volume comparisons due to the beneficial impact of the hot weather in 2003. We also anticipate that shifts in our factored brand sales (beverage brands owned by other companies but delivered to retail by us) will continue to have an adverse financial impact, however this will be at a lower rate than in 2003. Cost of Goods Sold Regarding costs, apart from a minor impact in the first quarter of 2004, we will no longer be lapping the income from contract brewing and transitional service arrangements, which ended early in 2003. As a result, the benefit of right sizing and improving our UK infrastructure and supply chain will flow into our cost structure, but we anticipate that there will be significant offsets from inflation and negative channel and package mix. With slower off trade volume growth and our new Burton packaging lines operating better, we anticipate a much lower need for high priced contract packaging services from other brewers in 2004 than in 2003. Marketing, General and Administrative Marketing, general & administrative spending is likely to increase in local currency in 2004 as we roll out the Coors Fine Light brand in the United Kingdom and incur increased labor costs and depreciation on dispense equipment, which stems from the strong on trade growth we achieved in 2003. Increases are also expected from the recently signed contract with EDS, which is extended to CBL for the first time in 2004. Other Income Comparisons of other income between the third quarter of 2004 with the third quarter of 2003 may be difficult due to the $3.5 million gain on the sale of the rights to our Hoopers Hooch brand in Russia during 2003. Interest Consolidated 2004 interest income is expected to be fairly consistent with 2003, and will consist primarily of UK trade loan interest income. We expect interest expense to be approximately $8 10 million lower than 2003 due partially to debt repayments we made during 2003 on our higher interest rate debt. Additionally, we expect to benefit from our lower interest rate commercial paper program that we implemented in 2003, the proceeds of which were used to pay down higher interest rate debt. Taxes We expect that our 2004 effective tax rate will be in the range of 32% to 35% absent any unusual items, up from 31.2% in 2003. The comparison will be particularly challenging against the second quarter of 2003, when our effective tax rate was 25.8% because of the completion of five years of tax audits. Our acquisition structure for the UK business is generally beneficial from a tax perspective but adds considerable volatility to our tax rate. 26 Capital Expenditures Our capital expenditures (excluding capital improvements for our container joint ventures which we tentatively plan to consolidate in 2004) are planned to be in the range of $225 million and $235 million in 2004, down from $240 million in 2003. The actual amount will depend on foreign exchange rates and our evaluation of a few potential projects now under review. Critical Accounting Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. We review our accounting policies on an on going basis. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have identified the accounting estimates below as critical to our financial condition and results of operations: Allowance for Doubtful Accounts In the Americas segment, our allowance for doubtful accounts and credit risk is insignificant as the majority of the Americas accounts receivable balance is generated from sales to independent distributors with whom we have a predetermined collection date arranged through electronic funds transfer. Also, in the Americas, we secure substantially all of our credit risk with purchase money security interests in inventory and proceeds, personal guarantees and other letters of credit. Because the majority of CBL sales are directly to retail customers and, because of the industry practice of making trade loans to customers, our ability to manage credit risk in this business is critical. At CBL, we provide allowances for trade receivables and trade loans associated with the ability to collect outstanding receivables from our customers. Generally, provisions are recorded to cover the full exposure to a specific customer (total amount of all trade accounts and loans from a specific customer less the amount of security and insurance coverage) at the point the account is considered uncollectible. We record the provision as a bad debt in general and administrative expenses. Provisions are reversed upon recoverability of the account or relieved at the point an account is written off. We are not able to predict changes in financial condition of our customers and, if circumstances related to our customers deteriorate, our estimates of the recoverability of our trade receivables could be materially affected, and we may be required to record additional allowances. Pension and Postretirement Benefits We have defined benefit plans that cover the majority of our employees. As a result of the acquisition of CBL, we have assumed responsibility for a portion of the assets and liabilities of what was the Bass Brewers Pension Plan, renamed the Coors Brewers Pension Plan. CBC also has postretirement welfare plans that provide medical benefits for retirees and eligible dependents and life insurance for certain retirees. The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS No. 87) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions (SFAS No. 106). Both of these statements require that management make certain assumptions relating to the long term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates used to measure future obligations and expenses, salary increases, inflation, health care cost trend rates and other assumptions. We believe that the accounting estimates related to our pension and postretirement plans is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period based on market conditions. We performed an analysis of high yield bonds at the end of 2003 to support the discount rates used in determining our pension liabilities in the United States and in the United Kingdom for the year ended December 28, 2003. Discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets are selected at the end of a given fiscal year and impact actual expense in the subsequent year. A fifty basis point change in certain assumptions would have the following effects: 27 Impact to 2003 Pension Costs 50 basis points Description of Pension Sensitivity Item Reduction (Unfavorable) Increase (Favorable) (In thousands) Expected return on US plan assets, 9.0% in 2003 $ (2,692 ) $ 2,692 Expected return on UK plan assets, 7.5% in 2003 $ (6,640 ) $ 6,640 Discount rate on US projected benefit obligation, 6.75% in 2003 $ (3,629 ) $ 3,629 Discount rate on UK projected benefit obligation, 5.7% in 2003 $ (10,532 ) $ 2,895 28 Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the retiree health care plan. A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects: flip One percentage point decrease One percentage point inecrease (In thousands) Effect on total of service and interest cost components $ (309 ) $ 327 Effect on postretirement benefit obligation $ (3,143 ) $ 3,305 Both US and UK plan assets consist primarily of equity securities with smaller holdings of bonds and real estate. Equity assets are well diversified between US and other international investments, with additional diversification in the domestic category through allocations to large cap, small cap, and growth and value investments. Relative allocations reflect the demographics of the respective plan participants. For example, our UK participants are more heavily weighted toward pensioners than our US participants. Therefore, we have elected a smaller equity percentage in our UK plan. The following compares target asset allocation percentages as of February 27, 2004 with actual asset allocations at December 28, 2003: US Plan Assets UK Plan Assets Target Allocations Actual Allocations Target Allocations Actual Allocations Equities 80 % 82 % 65 % 59 % Fixed Income 11 % 10 % 28 % 34 % Real Estate 9 % 8 % 7 % 6 % Other 1 % Contingencies, Environmental and Litigation Reserves We estimate the range of liability related to environmental matters or other legal actions where the amount and range of loss can be estimated. We record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to our pending matter and revise our estimates. Costs that extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of company owned assets or are incurred to mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination may be capitalized. Other environmental costs are expensed when incurred. We also expense legal costs as incurred. The most significant estimates that could impact our financial statements relate to the Lowry Superfund site (See Item 8, Note 14). Goodwill and Other Intangible Asset Valuation We adopted the provisions of Statements of Financial Standards No. 141, Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141) on July 1, 2001, and No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS No. 142) on December 31, 2001. We evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets annually, and we evaluate our other intangible assets when there is evidence that certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Significant judgments and assumptions are required in the evaluation of intangible assets for impairment, most significantly the estimated future cash flows to be generated by these assets and the rate used to discount those cash flows. For brewing business goodwill and intangibles, we used a rate of 7.6% to discount our cash flows during our annual impairment testing in 2003, which is a rate we believe to be representative of the weighted cost of capital for similar assets. We used a rate of 11% for our distribution rights associated with our distribution subsidiary. Changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our goodwill and other intangible assets, thereby requiring us to write down the assets. As an example, our valuation model for the goodwill associated with our Molson USA joint venture assumes certain volume growth and pricing assumptions that only small changes in which could result in significant impairment charges. Derivatives We use derivatives in the normal course of business to manage our exposure to fluctuations in production and packaging material prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. By policy, we do not enter into such contracts for trading purposes or for the purpose of speculation. All derivatives held by us are designated as hedges with the expectation that they will be highly effective in offsetting underlying exposures. We account for our derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as assets or liabilities at fair value in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133), which we early adopted on December 28, 1998. Such accounting is complex, as evidenced by significant interpretations of the primary accounting standard, which continues to evolve, as well as the significant judgments and estimates involved in the estimation of fair value in the absence of quoted market values. These estimates are based upon valuation methodologies 29 deemed appropriate in the circumstances; however, the use of different assumptions could have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our global business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, our income tax provision is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by many different tax authorities. We adjust our income tax provision in the period it is probable that actual results will differ from our estimates. Tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted. We record a net deferred tax asset or tax liability based on the un remitted earnings of our UK subsidiary that are not permanently reinvested in accordance with APB 23. In conjunction with this calculation, we estimate associated earnings and profit adjustments, potential foreign tax credits and cumulative translation adjustments relating to the foreign exchange rates. We do not provide deferred taxes on certain outside basis difference in our acquired foreign subsidiarys stock, Coors Brewers Limited (CBL). This outside basis difference is permanent in duration under SFAS 109 because we do not intend to take any action that would result in recognizing the gain inherent in certain book over tax basis differences. As a result, differences between book and tax treatment of income statement items in our UK business are treated as permanent. This treatment increases the volatility in our effective tax rate. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period a determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Reductions to the valuation allowance related to the acquisition of CBL that relate to deferred taxes arising from that acquisition would reduce goodwill, unless the reduction was caused by a change in law, in which case the adjustment would impact earnings. Equity Method Accounting We generally apply the equity method of accounting to 20% 50% owned investments where we exercise significant influence. As described below, we have an equity ownership in, and conduct business with various joint ventures, which directly relate to our core activities. There are no related parties that own interests in our equity method investments (see further discussion in Item 8, Note 2). Coors Canada is a general partnership that was formed to market CBC products in Canada. We own a 50.1% interest in this non consolidated joint venture that we account for using the equity method of accounting due to the effective control of the partnership being shared equally by the partners under the operating agreement. All manufacture, distribution and sale of CBC branded beers are contracted to Molson by the partnership. The partnership never takes title to the beer. It is paid an amount equal to the sales proceeds Molson receives from third party customers, less the costs incurred by Molson for its manufacture, distribution and sale of the CBC branded products. We reflect this amount in net sales in our Consolidated Statements of Income. RMMC and RMBC, are dedicated predominantly to our packaging and distribution activities and were formed with companies which have core competencies sought by us to reduce costs. The CBL joint venture with Grolsch was formed to provide a long term relationship with that brands owner in a key segment of the U.K. beer market. In 2003 and 2002, our share of the pre tax joint venture profits for each of these investments was offset against cost of goods sold in our Consolidated Statements of Income. In 2003, we included our entire share of CBLs Tradeteam joint venture results in the other income, net line of our Consolidated Statements of Income, given the immateriality of its results. In 2002, we included our share of Tradeteam results in cost of goods sold. This change in presentation was attributable to Tradeteam no longer being a captive provider of distribution and logistics services to CBL. In November 2002, Tradeteam entered into an agreement to provide distribution services to Interbrew U.K. Limited, another large brewer in the United Kingdom. 30 Other income, net line includes the equity method income for the Molson USA joint venture. This joint venture was formed to import, market, sell and distribute Molson products in the United States. We have recorded our share of the ventures results in the other income, net line in our Consolidated Statements of Income given the immateriality of its results. A qualitative analysis of our results would be impacted if the results of these joint ventures were included in different lines of our Consolidated Statements of Income. Recent Accounting Pronouncements FASB Statement No. 132 Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits (Revised 2003) This standard revision is effective immediately and is reflected in Notes 7 and 8. While the standard does not change the accounting and measurement for pensions and other postretirement benefits, it does add new disclosures for the footnotes to the financial statements, including comparative information for prior periods presented. The disclosures are applicable to both pension and other postretirement plans. Key additional disclosures include: Plan assets by category. A narrative description of investment policies and strategies, including target allocation percentages. A narrative description of the basis used to determine the overall expected long term rate of return on assets. Benefits expected to be paid in each of the next five years and the total for the five years thereafter. The employers best estimate of the contributions expected to be made during the next fiscal year. Interim disclosures (in Form 10 Q) of net periodic benefit expense and significant revisions to employer contributions paid or expected to be paid. FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities An Interpretation of ARB51 The FASB finalized FIN 46R in December 2003. FIN 46R expands the scope of ARB51 and various EITFs and can require consolidation of legal structures, called variable interest entities (VIEs). We do have VIEs that we have tentatively determined will qualify for consolidation. These include RMMC and RMBC. We plan to consolidate these VIEs in the first quarter of 2004. Although we believe our Grolsch and Coors Canada investments are VIEs, we are still evaluating whether we are the primary beneficiaries for these investments with respect to consolidation under FIN 46. The most significant impacts to our financial statements will be to add the fixed assets of RMMC and RMBC totaling approximately $75 million, and RMMC debt of approximately $45 million to our balance sheet. The impact to our gross profit margin in the income statement is not expected to be significant. SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 (SAB 104), Revenue Recognition SAB 104 was released in December 2003. SAB 104 updates interpretative guidance in the codification of staff accounting bulletins to provide consistent accounting guidance on revenue recognition. We adopted SAB 104 in December 2003 with no impact to our financial statements or our financial reporting. Related Party Transactions Transactions with Management and Others From time to time, we employ members of the Coors family, which collectively owns 100% of the voting common stock of the company. Hiring and placement decisions are made based upon merit, and compensation packages offered are commensurate with policies in place for all employees of the company. Certain Business Relationships We purchase a large portion of our paperboard packaging requirements from Graphic Packaging Corporation (GPC), a related party. Various Coors family trusts collectively own all of our Class A voting common stock, approximately 30% of our Class B common stock, and approximately 30% of GPCs common stock. Our purchases under the GPC packaging agreement in 2003 totaled $106.4 million. Related accounts payable balances included in Affiliates Accounts Payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $5.0 million and $0.8 million at December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002, respectively. We are also a limited partner in a real estate development partnership in which a subsidiary of GPC is the general partner. The partnership owns, develops, operates and sells certain real estate previously owned directly by us. We received no distributions from this partnership in 2003. 31 Risk Factors The reader should carefully consider the following factors and the other information contained within this document. The most important factors that could influence the achievement of our goals, and cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements, include, but are not limited to, the following: Government regulatory authorities specific to the alcohol beverage industry in the markets in which we operate may adopt regulations that could increase our costs or our liabilities or could limit our business activities. Our business is highly regulated by national and local government entities. These regulations govern many parts of our operations, including brewing, marketing and advertising, transportation, distributor relationships, sales and environmental issues. We do not know that we have been or will at all times be in compliance with all past, present or future regulatory requirements or that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in complying with regulatory requirements. We have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our stockholders equity. As of December 28, 2003, we held approximately $1.2 billion in debt primarily related to our acquisition of CBL. As a result, a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt. If our financial and operating performance is insufficient to generate sufficient cash flow for all of our activities, we may be required to use a disproportionate amount of cash to satisfy our obligations. We are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, most significantly the British pound and the Canadian dollar. With the acquisition of CBL in 2002, we significantly altered the impact of currency fluctuations on our results of operations and cash flows. 2003 results have benefited significantly from a strengthening of the British pound versus the US dollar, offset to a certain extent by cash flow hedges on a portion of our debt. We cannot predict future fluctuations in exchange rates. A future devaluation of the British pound versus the US dollar could negatively impact results. Our primary production facilities in the Americas and in Europe are each located at a single site, so we could be more vulnerable than our competitors to transportation disruptions, fuel increases and natural disasters. Our primary Americas production facilities are located in Golden, Colorado, where we brew more than 90%, and package approximately 63%, of our products sold in the Americas business. Our primary production facility in Europe is located in Burton on Trent, England, where we brew and package approximately 70% of our products sold in the Europe business. While our business operations remain centralized, our competitors have multiple geographically dispersed breweries and packaging facilities. As a result, we must ship our products greater distances than some of our competitors, making us more vulnerable to fluctuations in costs such as fuel or packaging costs. We rely on a small number of suppliers to obtain the packaging and raw materials we need to operate our business. We purchase most of our paperboard and label packaging for our US products from GPC. This packaging is unique to us and is not produced by any other supplier. Additionally, we are contractually obligated to purchase substantially all of our can and bottle needs in the United States from our container joint ventures or from our partners in those ventures, Ball Corporation (RMMC) and Owens Brockway Glass Container, Inc. (RMBC). CBL has only a single source for its can supply (Ball). The inability of any of these suppliers to meet our production requirements without sufficient time to develop an alternative source could have a material adverse effect on our business. In regard to agricultural products, the supply and price of raw materials, including water, used to produce our products can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including frosts, droughts and other weather conditions, economic factors affecting growth decisions, various plant diseases and pests. To the extent that any of the foregoing affects the ingredients used to produce our products, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Any significant shift in consumer packaging preferences in the beer industry could disproportionately increase our costs and could limit our ability to meet consumer demand. Reconfiguring our packaging facilities to produce different types or amounts of packaging than we currently produce would likely increase our costs. In addition, we may not be able to complete any necessary changes quickly enough to keep pace with shifting consumer preferences. Our primary competitors are larger and may be better able to accommodate a packaging preference shift. If we are not able to respond quickly to a packaging preference shift, our sales and market share could decline. Our success depends largely on the success of two primary products, one in the United States and one in the United Kingdom; the failure or weakening of either could materially adversely affect our financial results. 32 Although we currently have 14 products in our US portfolio, Coors Light represented more than 70% of our Americas sales volume for 2003. In the United Kingdom, Carling lager is the best selling brand in the United Kingdom and represented approximately 69% of CBL sales volume in 2003. Consequently, any material shift in consumer preferences away from Coors Light or Carling would have a disproportionately negative impact on our business. If the contract we have with our current information technology service provider fails, we could experience significant disruption in our business. We rely exclusively on one information technology services provider for our network, help desk, hardware, and software configuration, both at CBC and CBL. If the service provider fails and we are unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner, we could be unable to properly administer our information technology systems. We are significantly smaller than our two primary competitors in the Americas segment, and may consequently be more vulnerable to cost and price fluctuations. At retail, our brands compete on the basis of quality, taste, advertising, price, packaging innovation and retail execution by our distributors. Competition in our various markets could cause us to reduce prices, increase capital and other expenditures or lose market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. We compete primarily with AB and Miller, the top two brewers in the United States. Both of these competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, production and distribution resources than CBC has. Furthermore, these competitors are not as concentrated geographically in their product sales as CBC is. Consequently, we are somewhat disadvantaged versus their greater economies of scale. If the social acceptability of our products declines, or if litigation is directed at the alcohol beverage industry, our sales volumes could decrease and our business could be materially adversely affected. Coors and many other brewers and distilled spirits manufacturers have been sued in several courts regarding advertising practices and alleged underage consumption. Each suit seeks an injunction and unspecified money damages. (See Item 3, Legal Proceedings, for further information about the cases.) These cases are evidence of increased social and political attention directed to the alcohol beverage industry in recent years. If the social acceptability of beer were to decline significantly, or if our industry were to become involved in litigation similar to that of the tobacco industry, our business could be materially adversely affected. We are highly dependent on independent distributors in the United States to sell our products, with no assurance that these distributors will effectively sell our products. We sell all of our products in the United States to distributors for resale to retail outlets. Some of our distributors are at a competitive disadvantage because they are significantly smaller than the largest distributors in their markets. Our distributors also sell products that compete with our products. We cannot control or provide any assurance that these distributors will not give our competitors products higher priority, thereby reducing sales of our products. In addition, the regulatory environment of many states makes it very difficult to change distributors. Consequently, if we are not allowed or are unable to replace unproductive or inefficient distributors, our business, financial position, and results of operation may be adversely affected. Benefits related to our redesigned supply chain processes and systems in the United may not be realized. During 2003, we implemented our redesigned supply chain processes and systems in the United States. We use this system to schedule production, track inventories and bill our customers. We may not achieve the benefits we expect from these re engineered processes. We experienced difficulties with the implementation of the systems in the fall of 2003 and, as a result, we incurred about $8 million of increased costs, primarily related to extra freight, labor and finished goods loss. The supply disruptions also had a meaningful impact on our volume. We are still facing challenges, including stock outs and low inventory levels of some of our products throughout our US business. We are working to improve our shipping performance, to rebuild the reliability and efficiency of our supply chain and to reduce stock outs. If we are unable to correct the remaining issues in time for our peak selling season, it may materially adversely impact our business. We cannot predict with certainty our eventual aggregate cost for our environmental and related matters in which we are currently involved. We are one of a number of entities named by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a potentially liable party (PRP) at the Lowry Superfund Site. As a PRP, we are obligated to pay a portion of future costs in excess of the original settlement amount. While we have estimated and accrued for expected costs, if actual incremental costs are higher than expected, we could have to accrue additional costs and make additional cash payments. 33 We are currently launching new products. If these products fail, it could have a significant effect on our operating results. In our Americas segment, we plan to launch Aspen Edge, a low carbohydrate beer, and Zima XXX, an extension of our Zima brand, in 2004. We recently launched Coors Fine Light in our Europe segment. If these brands do not launch successfully, it could result in a significant impact to our operating results. Consolidation of pubs and growth in the size of pub chains in the United Kingdom could result in less ability to achieve pricing. The trend toward consolidation of pubs, away from independent pub and club operations, is continuing in the United Kingdom. These larger entities have stronger price negotiating power, which could impact CBLs ability to obtain favorable pricing in on trade (due to spillover effect of reduced negotiating leverage) and could reduce our revenues and profit margins. In addition, these larger customers are beginning to purchase directly more of the products that, in the past, we have provided as part of our factored business. This consolidation could impact us negatively. Due to a high concentration of unionized workers in the United Kingdom, we could be significantly affected by labor strikes, work stoppages or other employee related issues. Approximately 31% of CBLs total workforce is represented by trade unions. Although we believe relations with our employees are good, more stringent labor laws in the United Kingdom expose us to a greater risk of loss should we experience labor disruptions. We depend exclusively on one logistics provider in England, Wales and Scotland for distribution of our CBL products. We are involved in a joint venture with Exel Logistics called Tradeteam. Tradeteam handles all of the physical distribution for CBL in England, Wales and Scotland, except where a different distribution system is requested by a customer. If Tradeteam were unable to continue distribution of our product and we were unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner, we could experience significant disruptions in our business that could ultimately have a negative impact on our operations. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currencies and the prices of production and packaging materials. We have established policies and procedures to govern the strategic management of these exposures through a variety of financial instruments. By policy, we do not enter into any contracts for the purpose of trading or speculation. Our objective in managing our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and production and packaging materials prices is to decrease the volatility of our earnings and cash flows affected by potential changes in underlying rates and prices. To achieve this objective, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swaps, interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps, the values of which change in the opposite direction of the anticipated cash flows. We do not hedge the value of net investments in foreign currency denominated operations or translated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Our primary foreign currency exposures are British pound sterling (GBP), Canadian dollar (CAD) and Japanese yen (YEN). Derivatives are either exchange traded instruments, or over the counter agreements entered into with highly rated financial institutions. No losses on over the counter agreements due to counterparty credit issues are anticipated. All over the counter agreements are entered into with counterparties rated no lower than A (S&P) or A2 (Moodys). In some instances we and our counterparties have reciprocal collateralization agreements regarding fair value positions in excess of certain thresholds. These agreements call for the posting of collateral in the form of cash, treasury securities or letters of credit if a fair value loss position to us or our counterparties exceeds a certain amount. At December 28, 2003, no collateral was posted by us or our counterparties. At December 28, 2003, we were a party to certain cross currency swaps totaling 530 million GBP (approximately $774 million at then prevailing foreign currency exchange rates). The swaps include an initial exchange of principal on the settlement date of our 63/8% private placement (see Note 4, Debt) and will require final principal exchange 10 years later. The swaps also call for an exchange of fixed GBP interest payments for fixed US dollar interest receipts. At the initial principal exchange, we paid US dollars to a counterparty and received GBP. Upon final exchange, we will provide GBP to the counterparty and receive US dollars. The cross currency swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges of the changes in value of the future GBP interest and principal receipts that results from changes in the US dollar to GBP exchange rates on an intercompany loan between CBL and us. 34 At December 28, 2003, we were a party to an interest rate swap agreement related to our 63/8% fixed rate debt. The interest rate swap converted $76.2 million notional amount from fixed rates to floating rates and matures in 2012. We will receive fixed US dollar interest payments semi annually at a rate of 63/8% per annum and pay a rate to our counterparty based on a credit spread of 0.789% plus the three month LIBOR rate, thereby exchanging a fixed interest obligation for a floating rate obligation. There was no exchange of principal at the inception of the swap. We designated the interest rate swap as a fair value hedge of the changes in the fair value of $76.2 million fixed rate debt attributable to changes in the LIBOR swap rates. We monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using two techniques sensitivity analysis and Value at Risk. Our market sensitive derivative and other financial instruments, as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), are foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swaps, interest rate swaps, and cross currency swaps. We use Value at Risk to monitor the foreign exchange and interest rate risk of our cross currency swaps. The Value at Risk provides an estimate of the level of a one day loss that may be equaled or exceeded due to changes in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate and interest rate sensitive financial instruments. The type of Value at Risk model used to estimate the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value is a variance/covariance method. The Value at Risk model assumes normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used to compute value at risk. The computations used to derive our values take into account various correlations between currency rates and interest rates. The correlations have been determined by observing foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the most recent one year period. We have excluded anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances, and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies from the Value at Risk calculation, some of which these instruments are intended to hedge. The Value at Risk calculation is a statistical measure of risk exposure based on probabilities and is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we may incur. The calculated Value at Risk result does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. It attempts to represent the most likely measure of potential loss that may be experienced 95 times out of 100 due to adverse market events that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated by Value at Risk because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments, hedge percentages, timing and other factors. The estimated maximum one day loss in fair value on our cross currency swaps, derived using the Value at Risk model, was $5.9 million and $8.6 million at December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002, respectively. As we did not enter into the cross currency swaps until the second quarter of 2002, there is no comparable one day loss in fair value at December 30, 2001. Such a hypothetical loss in fair value is a combination of the foreign exchange and interest rate components of the cross currency swap. Value changes due to the foreign exchange component would be offset completely by increases in the value of our inter company loan, the underlying transaction being hedged. The hypothetical loss in fair value attributable to the interest rate component would be deferred until termination or maturity. 35 Details of all other market sensitive derivative and other financial instruments, including their fair values, are included in the table below. These instruments include foreign currencies, commodity swaps, interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps. Notional principal amounts (USD) Changes in Fair Value Positive (Negative) Maturity (In thousands) December 28, 2003 Foreign currency management Forwards $ 44,048 $ (1,382 ) 1/04 12/05 Cross currency swap 773,800 (138,684 ) 5/12 Commodity pricing management Swaps 92,468 9,638 2/04 2/06 Interest rate pricing management Interest rate swap 76,200 6,904 5/12 Total $ (123,524 ) December 29, 2002 Foreign currency management Forwards $ 19,655 $ 106 01/03 12/03 Cross currency swap 773,800 (43,621 ) 05/12 Commodity pricing management Swaps 112,573 (4,630 ) 03/03 09/04 Interest rate pricing management Interest rate swap 76,200 8,493 05/12 Total $ (39,652 ) Maturities of derivative financial instruments held on December 28, 2003, are as follows (in thousands): 2004 2005 2006 and thereafter Total $ 4,760 $ 3,106 $ (131,390 ) $ (123,524 ) A sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate our exposure to market risk of interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. The sensitivity analysis reflects the impact of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the applicable market interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. The volatility of the applicable rates and prices are dependent on many factors that cannot be forecast with reliable accuracy. Therefore, actual changes in fair values could differ significantly from the results presented in the table below. The following table presents the results of the sensitivity analysis of our derivative and debt portfolio: As of Estimated Fair Value Volatility December 28, 2003 December 29, 2002 (In millions) Foreign currency risk: forwards, swaps $ (5.0 ) $ (2.1 ) Interest rate risk: debt, swaps $ (32.4 ) $ (42.1 ) Commodity price risk: swaps $ (10.2 ) $ (10.8 ) 36
