ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary Our 2005 financial results reflect a significant change in the Company due to the Merger with Molson, Inc., as well as challenging operating environments in all of our major businesses. Our net sales of $5.5 billion increased by $1.2 billion, or 28%, while the volume of beer sold by our company increased by 7.7 million barrels, or 24%. The main driver of these increases was the inclusion of the result of Molsons business in Canada, as a result of the Merger which occurred on February 9, 2005. Our operating income increased to $422 million from $348 million as a result of Molsons inclusion in our results. Operating income in 2005 included special items, discussed in more detail below and later in this section, of $145 million of expense, while 2004 operating income included $8 million of special income items. Net income was $135 million ($1.69 per diluted share) in 2005, 27 down from $197 million ($5.19 per diluted share) in 2004. Net income for 2005 included a loss from discontinued operations, represented by our former Brazil segment, of $92 million. For comparability purposes, certain discussions in this section, particularly those regarding Canada, and in some instances for consolidated results, will also include pro forma comparisons, as if Molsons results were included in our pre Merger results from the beginning of 2004. On a pro forma basis, net sales from continuing operations were $5.6 billion for 2005, down 4.4% from 2004. Pro forma net income in 2005 was $93.4 million, or $1.10 per diluted share. Components of our Income Statement Net sales Our net sales represent almost exclusively the sale of beer and malt beverages, the vast majority of which are brands that we own and brew ourselves. We import or brew and sell certain non owned partner brands under licensing and related arrangements. We also sell certain "factored brands," as a distributor, to customers in the United Kingdom (Europe segment). Cost of goods sold Our cost of goods sold include costs we incur to make and ship beer. These costs include brewing materials, such as barley, in the United States and United Kingdom where we manufacture our own malt. In Canada, we purchase malt from third parties. Hops and various starches are other key brewing materials purchased by all of our segments. Packaging materials, including costs for glass bottles, aluminum cans, and cardboard and paperboard are also included in our cost of goods sold. Our cost of goods sold also include both direct and indirect labor, freight costs, utilities, maintenance costs, and other manufacturing overheads. Marketing, general and administrative These costs include media advertising (television, radio, print), tactical advertising (signs, banners, point of sale materials) and promotion costs planned and executed on both local and national levels within our operating segments. Also included here are costs to run our sales organizations, including labor and other overheads. Lastly, this classification also includes general and administrative costs for functions such as finance, legal, human resources and information technology, which consist primarily of labor and outside services. Special Items These are unique items which affect our income statement, which are discussed below. Other income (expense) This classification includes primarily gains and losses associated with activities not directly related to brewing and selling beer. For instance, gains or losses on sales of non operating assets, our share of income or loss associated with our ownership in the Montr&eacute;al Canadiens hockey club, and certain foreign exchange gains and losses are classified here. Interest income (expense), net Interest costs associated with borrowings to finance our operations are included in the corporate unallocated costs. Interest income in the Europe segment is associated with certain trade loans receivable from customers. Discussions of income statement line items such as minority interests, discontinued operations and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle are discussed in detail elsewhere in MD&A and in the notes to the financial statements. Discontinued Operations The Companys business in Brazil, which was acquired as part of the Merger, is now reported as discontinued operations due to the sale of a controlling interest in the business on January 13, 2006. 28 During 2005, the Brazil business affected the Companys financial results in the following ways, all of which are not expected to impact the Companys results in reporting periods following the sale: The income statement impact included losses that totaled $91.8 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, in 2005. Since the Companys effective tax rate did not benefit from these Brazil losses, these represent after tax impacts on the Companys financial results. As a result of the sale, the Companys balance sheet will improve in two principal ways: The Companys total debt position improves by approximately $128 million in 2006 versus 2005 following the Brazil sale with the inflow of $68 million of sale proceeds and the elimination of approximately $63 million of Brazil financial debt. Contingent liabilities of approximately $260 million, related primarily to tax claims, are removed from the Companys balance sheet. MCBC does have a level of continuing potential exposure to these contingent liabilities of Kaiser, as well as previously disclosed but less than probable un accrued claims, due to certain indemnities provided to FEMSA pursuant to the sales and purchase agreement underlying the sale of our majority interest in Kaiser. Such indemnities are more fully described in Note 19 on page 118. While the Company believes that all significant contingencies have been disclosed as part of the sale process and adequately reserved for on the Kaiser financial statements, resolution of contingencies and claims above reserved or otherwise disclosed amounts could, under some circumstances, result in additional liabilities for Molson Coors because of transaction related indemnity provisions. The Brazil business reduced the Companys free cash flow by $22 million during 2005 due primarily to operating losses and interest expense. Special Items The Company reported special items totaling $145.4 million during 2005. These special charges were primarily related to accelerated initiatives to improve the Companys future performance and were as follows: The US segment recorded special charges of $68.1 million during 2005, primarily related to closing the Memphis brewery, including accelerated asset depreciation and estimated costs associated with settling pension obligations for Memphis brewery workers. The Canada segment recorded special charges of $5.2 million during 2005, related primarily to restructuring of the sales and marketing organizations. The Europe segment recorded net special charges of $13.8 million during 2005, primarily attributable to restructuring expenses for cost reduction initiatives, as well as costs related to the closure of the Companys sales operation in Russia and Taiwan, netted against a net gain on disposals of assets during the year. We estimate annual savings from the Europe initiatives to approximate $20 million allocated 75% to selling, general and administrative and 25% to cost of goods sold beginning 2007. Special charges allocated to Corporate in 2005 were $58.3 million, substantially all of which ($55.9 million) were associated with severance and other costs related to change in control and other agreements with departing officers following the Merger. These costs are discussed in more detail in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 on page 93. 29 Merger Synergies Update During 2005, the Company captured $59 million in Merger related cost synergies, surpassing the Companys 2005 goal of $50 million. The Companys Merger related synergies goals are an incremental $50 million in 2006 and total annual synergies of $175 million, which are expected by the third year following the completion of the Merger. As a result of work performed by our synergy and operating teams during the first year of the Merger, we now anticipate capturing $75 million in additional cost reduction opportunities by the end of 2008, above and beyond the original $175 million year three synergies target. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle Molson Coors has adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143" (FIN 47) under which companies must recognize potential long term liabilities related to the eventual retirement of assets. As a result of adopting FIN 47, the Company recorded a cumulative non cash expense of $3.7 million, after tax, in the 2005 fourth quarter, reported as Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting in the Companys income statement. As reported in the Companys 2005 fourth quarter and full year results, this expense represents accumulated remediation and restoration costs expected to be incurred up to 30 years in the future for anticipated asset retirements. Following this catch up expense in the 2005 fourth quarter, the Company does not expect FIN 47 related expense to have a significant impact on its annual operating results. Results of Operations United States Segment The United States (US) segment produces, markets, and sells the Coors portfolio of brands in the United States and its territories and includes the results of the Rocky Mountain Metal Corporation (RMMC) and Rocky Mountain Bottle Corporation (RMBC) joint ventures consolidated beginning in 2004 under FIN 46R. The US segment also includes a small amount of Coors brand volume that is sold outside of the United States and its territories, including primarily Mexico and the Caribbean and sales of Molson products in the United States. Fiscal Year Ended December 25, 2005 Percent Change December 26, 2004 Percent Change December 28, 2003 (In thousands, except percentages) Volume in barrels 22,645 2.6 % 22,068 (0.8 )% 22,257 Net sales $ 2,474,956 4.0 % $ 2,380,193 2.2 % $ 2,328,004 Cost of goods sold (1,525,060 ) 4.3 % (1,462,373 ) 0.2 % (1,459,961 ) Gross profit 949,896 3.5 % 917,820 5.7 % 868,043 Marketing, general and administrative expenses (739,315 ) 0.5 % (735,529 ) 5.8 % (695,195 ) Special items, net (68,081 ) Operating income 142,500 (21.8 )% 182,291 5.5 % 172,848 Other (expense), income, net(1) (457 ) (102.3 )% 19,924 216.3 % 6,299 Segment earnings before income taxes(2) $ 142,043 (29.8 )% $ 202,215 12.9 % $ 179,147 (1)Consists primarily of gains from sales of non operating assets, water rights, a royalty settlement and equity share of Molson USA losses in 2004 and 2003. 30 (2)Earnings before income taxes in 2005 and 2004 includes $12,679 and $13,015, respectively, of the minority owners share of income attributable to the RMBC and RMMC joint ventures. Net sales Full year US sales increased in 2005 versus 2004, driven by volume increases in the Coors Light, Keystone Light, and Blue Moon brands, and the addition of Molson brands sold in the United States included in US results following the Merger. Coors Lights performance improved because of better sales execution, an ad campaign (the "Silver Bullet Train"), and increased promotional activities. In addition, Coors Light benefited from the strength of the premium light beer category which increased in 2005. Offsetting these were volume declines related to Coors Original, Aspen Edge and Zima. Net sales per barrel increased 1.3% from 2004 to 2005. We saw favorable front line pricing in 2005, partially offset by significant price promotions and coupons and reflective of the competitive landscape. These factors combined allowed for approximately one half of the increase in revenue per barrel. Collection of fuel surcharges from customers was the next largest factor contributing to the increase in net sales per barrel. However, our efforts to recover the higher costs of fuel from customers do not completely mitigate our exposure in this area, as discussed below under cost of goods sold. US net sales improved by 2.2% in 2004 versus 2003, although sales volumes were lower year over year. Net sales per barrel improved by 3.1% in 2004 versus 2003, benefiting from a favorable industry pricing environment and lower price promotion levels in 2004. US sales in 2004 benefited from the introduction of Aspen Edge early in the year, and strong growth from the Blue Moon and Zima XXX brands later in the year. Collection of fuel price surcharges from customers added $4.6 million. Cost of goods sold Cost of goods sold per barrel increased by 1.6% from $66.27 per barrel in 2004 to $67.35 per barrel in 2005. The increase in cost of goods sold per barrel was driven by high inflation in freight, diesel fuel, packaging materials, and energy costs. Inflation alone would have accounted for an increase of approximately 4% in cost of goods per barrel. However, these unfavorable factors were offset partially by favorable cost trends from supply chain cost management, labor productivity and synergies from the Merger. Cost of goods sold increased $2.4 million or 0.2% in 2004 versus 2003. On a per barrel basis, the increase was approximately 1.0%. The increase was the net effect of inflation (primarily higher fuel and packaging costs) ($15.1 million); as well as increased labor related expenses ($12.1 million) and a mix shift to higher cost brands and packages, such as Aspen Edge in 2004 ($10.9 million); offset by the cycling of extra expense related to our supply chain system implementation costs in 2003 ($6.5 million); and the implementation of FIN 46R which had the effect of reducing our cost of sales by re allocating certain joint venture expenses in our income statement out of cost of sales ($13.0 million). Marketing, general and administrative expenses Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased by $3.8 million, or 0.5% in 2005 versus 2004. Increased spending on sales capabilities were offset by lower general and administrative overhead costs. Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased $43.0 million in 2004, compared to 2003, or 6.0%. This represents an additional $2.18 per barrel increase. The increase is due to higher investments in sales and marketing efforts ($29.6 million), in addition to modestly higher labor related costs ($5.1 million). 31 Special items Special items in the US segment in 2005 were associated primarily with the planned closure of the Memphis brewery, targeted for late 2006. We recorded $33.3 million in accelerated depreciation on brewery assets, reflecting their revised useful lives, $3.2 million in direct impairments of assets, $1.7 million for accruals of severance and associated benefits, and $25.0 million representing an estimate of costs to settle multi employer pension plan obligations associated with Memphis workers. We recorded an additional $4.9 million of restructuring charges associated with brewery operations in Golden. Other income, net Other income was lower in 2005 versus 2004, primarily due to two large factors that occurred in 2004 but did not occur in 2005. First, we recorded $11.7 million of gains on the sale of certain owned, non operating real estate, and second, we recorded royalties of $8.3 million from the receipt of cash in 2004 associated with a settlement from the purchaser of a coal mine previously owned by Coors. Other income increased in 2004 versus 2003 for primarily the same reasons listed in the previous paragraph. Canada Segment Before the Merger, the Canada segment consisted of Coors Brewing Companys 50.1% interest in the Coors Canada partnership through which the Coors Light business in Canada was conducted. Molson was the other owner of the partnership. The partnership contracted with Molson for the brewing, distribution and the sale of Coors Light in Canada. Coors Canada managed all marketing activities for our products in Canada. In connection with the Merger, Coors Canada and sale of Coors Light in Canada was dissolved into the Canada segment. Coors Light is currently Molson Canadas largest selling beer, the largest selling light beer and the second best selling packaged beer brand overall in Canada. Following the Merger, our Canada segment consists primarily of Molsons beer business including the production and sale of the Molson brands, principally in Canada, our joint venture arrangements related to the distribution of beer in Ontario and the Western provinces, Brewers Retail, Inc. (BRI) (consolidated under FIN 46R), and Brewers Distribution Limited (BDL). 32 The following represents the Canada segments historical results: Fiscal Year Ended December 25, 2005(3) Percent Change December 26, 2004 Percent Change December 28, 2003 (In thousands, except percentages) Volume in barrels 7,457 Net sales(1) $ 1,527,306 N/M $ 60,693 27.7 % $ 47,527 Cost of goods sold (790,859 ) Gross profit 736,447 N/M 60,693 27.7 % 47,527 Marketing, general and administrative expenses (377,545 ) N/M 969 N/M 114 Special item (5,161 ) Operating income 353,741 473.7 % 61,662 29.4 % 47,641 Other (expense) income, net (2,183 ) Segment earnings before income taxes(2) $ 351,558 470.1 % $ 61,662 29.4 % $ 47,641 N/M Not Meaningful (1)Net sales in 2004 and 2003 represent royalties to the Company from the Coors Canada partnership. Income from the Coors Canada partnership was higher in 2004 versus 2003 primarily as a result of improved product pricing for Coors Light ($9 million). A stronger Canadian dollar ($3 million) and higher beer volume ($1 million) also contributed to improved Canada results. (2)Earnings before income taxes in 2005 include $5,093 of the minority owners share of income attributable to the Brewers Retail Inc. joint venture. (3)Molsons results are included in the Canada segment results, beginning at the date of the Merger, February 9, 2005. The following represents the Canada segments pro forma results, as if the Merger had occurred on December 29, 2003, the first day of Coors 2004 fiscal year: Fiscal Year Ended December 25, 2005 Percent Change December 26, 2004 (In thousands, except percentages) Volume in barrels $ 8,153 (1.1 )% $ 8,241 Net sales(1) 1,627,721 6.5 % 1,528,279 Cost of goods sold (818,297 ) 5.9 % (772,510 ) Gross profit 809,424 7.1 % 755,769 Marketing, general and administrative expenses (425,468 ) 24.2 % (342,635 ) Special item (5,161 ) (74.7 )% (20,404 ) Operating income 378,795 (3.5 )% 392,730 Other (expense) income, net (1,490 ) (47.5 )% (2,837 ) Segment earnings before income taxes(2) $ 377,305 (3.2 )% $ 389,893 N/M Not meaningful 33 Foreign currency impact on results Our Canada segment (as stated in US dollars) benefited from a 6.9% year over year increase in the value of the Canadian dollar against the US dollar in 2005. The following summarizes the impact on the Canada segments pro forma income statement. Increase due to currency effect 2005 (In thousands) Net sales $ 112,869 Cost of goods sold (55,923 ) Gross profit 56,946 Marketing, general and administrative expenses (30,143 ) Special items (433 ) Operating income 26,370 Other income (expense), net (159 ) Income before income taxes and minority interests $ 26,211 Net sales For the year ended December 25, 2005, pro forma net sales in the Canada Segment were $1.6 billion, 6.5% higher than the comparable period in the prior year. Net sales revenue per barrel in Canada grew slightly in local currency for the year ended December 25, 2005, driven by modest general price increases offset by unfavorable product mix. Net unfavorable sales mix was driven by value segment growth, primarily in Ontario and Alberta, which was partially offset by improved import sales at higher than average sale prices. Canada segment net sales volume for the year ended December 25, 2005, decreased 1.1% to 8.2 million barrels (9.6 million hectoliters) on a comparable pro forma basis from a year ago. The decrease was driven by volume declines in the first quarter, partially offset by strong industry volume trends and improved sales activity and market performance over the balance of 2005. Cost of goods sold and gross profit On a pro forma basis, cost of goods sold increased 5.9% to $818.3 million for the year ended December 25, 2005 from $772.5 million in the same period for 2004. For the same period, in local currency, cost of goods sold per barrel in Canada decreased as synergy and other cost savings were offset by unfavorable product mix. Marketing, general and administrative expenses On a pro forma basis, marketing, general and administrative expenses increased 24.2% to $425.5 million for the year ended December 25, 2005 from $342.6 million in the same period for 2004. Canada increased marketing and sales spending at a high single digit growth rate. In local currency general and administrative costs increased due to higher depreciation, increased employee costs and non recurring items partially offset by Merger related synergies. Special Items Special charges of $5.2 million were attributed primarily to restructuring the sales and marketing organizations in Canada. These efforts will further integrate the marketing and selling organizations 34 into one team, improving our brand communications and customer focus. Special charges in 2004 of $20.4 million were Merger related, and therefore did not recur in 2005. Other (expense) income, net Other expense represents the equity earnings in the Montr&eacute;al Canadiens Hockey Club. Europe Segment The Europe segment consists of our production and sale of the CBL brands principally in the United Kingdom, our joint venture arrangement for the production and distribution of Grolsch in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland (consolidated under FIN 46R beginning in 2004), factored brand sales (beverage brands owned by other companies, but sold and delivered to retail by us), and our joint venture arrangement with Exel Logistics for the distribution of products throughout Great Britain (Tradeteam). Our Europe segment also includes a small volume of sales in Asia, Russia and other export markets. Fiscal Year Ended December 25, 2005 Percent Change December 26, 2004 Percent Change December 28, 2003 (In thousands, except percentages) Volume in barrels 10,329 (2.9 )% 10,635 1.5 % 10,478 Net sales $ 1,501,299 (19.5 )% $ 1,864,930 14.8 % $ 1,624,582 Cost of goods sold (989,740 ) (22.6 )% (1,279,321 ) 13.5 % (1,126,822 ) Gross profit 511,559 (12.6 )% 585,609 17.6 % 497,760 Marketing, general and administrative expenses (429,973 ) (3.8 )% (447,163 ) 16.4 % (384,094 ) Special items (13,841 ) (284.0 )% 7,522 Operating income 67,745 (53.6 )% 145,968 28.4 % 113,666 Interest income 12,978 (19.0 )% 16,024 (6.6 )% 17,156 Other (expense) income, net (14,174 ) 150.6 % (5,655 ) (243.5 )% 3,940 Segment earnings before income taxes(1) $ 66,549 (57.4 )% $ 156,337 16.0 % $ 134,762 (1)Earnings before income taxes in 2005 and 2004 includes $5,798 ($4,191, net of tax) and $6,854 ($4,798, net of tax) of the minority owners share of income attributable to the Grolsch joint venture. Foreign currency impact on results Our Europe segment was adversely affected by a 0.5% year over year decrease in the value of the British Pound Sterling (GBP or &pound;) against the US dollar in 2005. Conversely, the Europe segment 35 benefited from a 12.0% year over year increase in the value of the GBP against the US dollar in 2004. The following summarizes the impact on the Europe segments income statement. Increase Due to Currency Effects(1) 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net sales $ (15,049 ) $ 193,473 Cost of goods sold 9,892 (129,611 ) Gross profit (5,157 ) 63,862 Marketing, general & administrative and special item 2,936 (47,311 ) Operating income (2,221 ) 16,551 Interest income (289 ) 1,291 Other income (expense), net 322 (1,502 ) Income before income taxes and minority interests $ (2,188 ) $ 16,340 (1)For 2005, assuming the same rates as 2004; for 2004, assuming the same rates as 2003. Net sales Net sales for the Europe segment decreased 19.5% in 2005, while volume decreased 2.9% from the previous year. Currency exchange rates accounted for approximately 5% of the decrease in net sales. The volume decline was driven by the Grolsch brand, flavored alcohol beverages (FABs) and ales. This decline was partially offset by growth of the Carling brand. CBLs overall volume decline for the year was slightly worse than the overall market decline. Beer volume in our on premise business, which represents approximately two thirds of our Europe volume and an even greater portion of margin, declined by 2% compared to 2004. This compared to an overall on premise market decline for beer as a category of 3.8% in the year, yielding a small market share gain for us. Our off premise volume for 2005 decreased approximately 2% over 2004, driven by decline in Grolsch volume. We experienced a small off premise market share decline. In addition to the volume movements documented above, we experienced unfavorable pricing in both the on premise and the off premise channels, and a decrease in the sales value of factored brands. These reductions were compounded by unfavorable channel and brand mix. A change in our trading arrangements with one major factored brand customer has required us to move from gross reporting of sales and cost of goods sold to a net presentation for that customer, which caused a year over year reduction in both net sales and cost of goods sold of $243.4 million, but with no net impact on gross profit. Owned brand net sales per barrel decreased approximately 2% for the year. Net sales for the Europe segment increased 14.8% in 2004 from 2003, while volume increased 1.5% from the previous year. The volume growth was driven by the Carling and Grolsch brands. Volume growth for the year was restricted by the cooler and wetter summer weather in the United Kingdom compared to a record breaking summer in 2003 and the comparison to a period of high off premise discounting in the first half of 2003. Our on premise business saw volume decline by 0.5% in 2004 compared to 2003. This compared to an overall on premise market decline of 2% in the year, yielding a market share gain of approximately 1%. Our off premise volume for 2004 increased approximately 6% over 2003, led by Carling and Grolsch. Our off premise market share growth for the year was approximately 0.6 percentage points. 36 In addition to the volume movements documented above, we had positive pricing in 2004 in both the on premise and the off premise channels, and an increase in the sales value of factored brands. These gains were partially offset by negative channel and brand mix. Owned brand net sales per barrel increased approximately 3% in 2004. Cost of goods sold Cost of goods sold decreased 22.6% in 2005 versus 2004. The decrease in local currency cost of goods sold was driven by the gross to net reporting of sales and cost of goods sold for the one major on premise customer discussed above that reduced factored cost of goods sold by $243.4 million (but with no impact on gross profit), combined with a mix shift away from glass packaged products which have higher packaging costs. These reductions were partially offset by the de leveraging of fixed costs, higher distribution costs due to the implementation of the European Working Time Directive, which has restricted the number of hours that drivers are allowed to work, and increased energy costs. Cost of goods sold increased 13.5% in 2004 versus 2003, with approximately 12.0% of the increase being due to the effect of GBP currency exchange rates. The increase in local currency cost of goods sold in 2004 was driven by increased volume and higher labor costs, together with a mix shift to the off premise where products have higher packaging costs, and an increase in the value of factored brand purchases where the cost is included in our cost of goods sold. These increases were offset by the benefit of a reduction in contract packaging costs from 2003, where we contracted with regional brewers to package some of our off premise volume while we were commissioning the new and upgraded packaging lines in our Burton brewery. On a per barrel basis, cost of goods sold increased 11.9%; excluding the impact of GBP currency exchange rates cost of goods sold per barrel was broadly flat compared to 2003. Marketing, general and administrative expenses Europe marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased 3.8% during 2005 versus 2004, and 1.0% on a per barrel basis. This decrease is primarily the result of lower overhead, sales and marketing and payroll related spending. Europe marketing, general and administrative expenses increased 16.4% during 2004 versus 2003; and 14.7% on a per barrel basis. GBP foreign exchange accounted for the great majority of this increase. Special Items 2005 special items of $13.8 million largely relate to employee restructuring activities associated with operations and supply chain restructuring efforts ($14.3 million) and asset impairments ($3.6 million), partly offset by profits on the sale of surplus real estate ($6.6 million). Also included in 2005 are exit costs associated with the closure of our Russia and Taiwan offices. Special income in 2004 represents the profit on sale of real estate. Other (expense) income, net The adverse movement in other (expense) income, net in 2005 and 2004 continues to be the result of declining Tradeteam operating performance, and increased non operating leasehold expenses. 37 Interest income Interest income is earned on trade loans to UK on premise customers. Interest income decreased 19.0% and 6.6% in 2005 and 2004, respectively, as a result of lower loan balances versus the prior years. Corporate Corporate includes interest and certain other general and administrative costs that are not allocated to the operating segments. The majority of these corporate costs relates to worldwide finance and administrative functions, such as corporate affairs, legal, human resources, insurance and risk management.

(3)Loss before income taxes in 2005 and 2004 includes $7,472 and $1,595 of the minority owners share of interest expense attributable to debt obligations of the RMMC joint venture. Marketing, general and administrative expenses General and administrative (G&A) expenses were higher in 2005 versus 2004, primarily due to establishing the new global organization and headquarters, significant legal fees for defense costs associated with shareholder lawsuits and regulatory inquiries, information technology projects, and a reallocation of certain G&A costs from segments to Corporate. General and administrative expenses were higher in 2004, versus 2003, primarily due to increased incentive compensation and other labor related costs. 38  Interest expense, net Net interest expense nearly doubled in 2005, compared to 2004 due to the addition of Merger related debt including debt assumed on Molsons opening balance sheet which approximated $1.5 billion. Subsequent to the Merger, we established a $1.0 billion bridge facility which was used to refinance pre Merger Molson debt. We also established a $1.4 billion, five year credit facility which was used to refinance a portion of the bridge facility borrowings. We had $163 million outstanding under the credit facility at December 25, 2005. Subsequent to establishing both of these facilities, the existing bank facilities at both Molson and Coors were terminated. The bridge loan facility was refinanced with proceeds from approximately $1.1 billion of senior notes, which were issued on September 22, 2005 (see related Note 13) on page 102. Net interest expense decreased in 2004, compared to 2003 due to our paydown of debt and from swapping some of our debt from fixed to more favorable floating rates. Full year 2004 debt repayments of $382 million were about 40% above 2003. Our cash flow and debt paydown benefited from asset monetizations and capital spending discipline in 2004. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities, external borrowings and asset monetizations. As of December 25, 2005, including cash and short term borrowings, we had negative working capital of $768 million compared to positive working capital of $91 million at December 26, 2004. The largest contribution to the decrease in working capital is a $310 million increase in current portions of long term debt and short term borrowings. The increase attributable to current portions of long term debt reflects the Companys intentions in 2006 with regard to debt paydown under our commercial paper and credit facilities. Cash balances were lower at the end of 2005 than 2004 by $84 million, which also contributed to our decrease in working capital. Cash balances were higher at the end of 2004, partially because of the unavailability of debt eligible for pay down in an economical manner at that time. Working capital associated with discontinued operations in Brazil amounted to a negative $107 million as of the end of 2005, an amount which did not exist at the end of 2004. Deferred tax assets and liabilities, net, related to working capital items contributed negatively to working capital by $84 million year over year. Most other working capital items increased expectedly with the addition of Molson to the balance sheet in 2005 versus 2004. However, it is notable that accounts receivable did not increase, due largely to the impact of the UK business at CBL. CBL maintains a comparatively larger receivables balance than other segments as a percentage of sales, and in 2005 their receivables balance dropped in US $ due to a weaker pound versus the dollar at the end of 2005 versus 2004, and their receivables were significantly lower in local currency because of lower sales. At December 25, 2005, cash and cash equivalents totaled $39 million, compared to $123 million at December 26, 2004. Total outstanding debt, including current portions of long term debt and short term borrowings, was $2,485 million at December 25, 2005, and $932 million at December 26, 2004. The increase is due to debt assumed in the Merger, offset by debt pay downs during 2005. We believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by short term borrowings, when necessary, will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditures. However, our liquidity could be impacted significantly by a decrease in demand for our products, which could arise from competitive circumstances, a decline in the acceptability of alcohol beverages, any shift away from light beers and any of the other factors we describe in the section titled "Risk Factors" on page 15. 39 Operating Activities Our net cash provided by operating activities was $422 million, a decrease of $78 million from 2004. The addition of Molsons Canadian beer business made a significant positive contribution to our operating cash flow. However, there were several items that offset this increase. First, in early 2005 we made a $138 million Canadian tax payment, previously deferred by Molson. Our total tax expense for the year was only $50 million, and there were additional tax payments to other governmental authorities in addition to the $138 million. Second, we funded $202 million into our defined benefit pension plans in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, compared with book expense associated with these plans of $65 million. Operating cash flow in 2005 also diminished because of worse operating results in the Europe segment, and severance and change in control payments to officers who departed the Company following the Merger. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2004 decreased by $29 million, compared to 2003. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in cash taxes in 2004 versus 2003 when favorable finalization of tax audits resulted in refunds, offset by the reporting of additional cash flows as a result of consolidating certain joint ventures in 2004. Also, improved sales at the end of 2004, compared to 2003 resulted in higher receivable and inventory balances, which served to lower cash flows from operations in 2004. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities in 2005 was $313 million, compared to $67 million in 2004. Capital expenditures were higher by $195 million in 2005 due to the inclusion of Molsons Canada segment capital expenditures of $107 million following the Merger, and spending in the United States related to the build out of the Shenandoah facility to a full brewery. We also spent $17 million in 2005 to acquire Creemore Springs, a small brewery in Canada, and spent $20 million on transaction costs associated with the Merger. These factors were offset by the favorable impact of acquiring $74 million in cash with the Merger and collecting a net $17 million on trade loan activity in the United Kingdom. Cash used in investing activities decreased $147 million during 2004 compared to 2003. This improvement is attributable to reduced capital spending in 2004 ($29 million lower), cash received from the sale of kegs in the United Kingdom and the sales of real estate and other property in both the United States and the United Kingdom ($72 million in 2004 compared to $16 million in 2003), and a pension settlement received in 2004 ($26 million) from Interbrew (former owners of CBL in the United Kingdom). Also, we presented as an investing activity the inclusion of the opening cash balances of the joint ventures we began consolidating during the first quarter of 2004 as result of implementing FIN 46R. Financing Activities Our debt position significantly affects our financing activity. See Note 13 on page 102 for a summary of our debt position at December 25, 2005 and December 26, 2004. Net cash used in financing activities was $189 million in 2005, compared to $336 million in 2004. During 2005, we paid dividends to stockholders of $110 million, compared to $31 million in 2004, as a result of increased shares outstanding and a revised dividend policy following the Merger. The large increase in our balance sheet debt from $932 million at year end 2004 to $2,485 million at year end 2005 was largely the result of a "non cash" activity, that of assuming Molsons outstanding debt as of the Merger date (February 9, 2005). This debt assumed included borrowings Molson incurred prior to the Merger to pay the special dividends on Molson stock which preceded the Merger. Substantially all of our debt pay down occurred after the Merger date. Also, we collected approximately $11 million less in 2005 versus 2004 as a result of stock option exercises. 40 Net cash used in financing activities was $336 million in 2004, compared to $357 million in 2003. The change is mainly the result of increased repayments of debt in 2004, offset by cash received from increased stock option exercises during the year. Capital Expenditures In 2005, we spent approximately $406 million (including approximately $47 million spent at consolidated joint ventures) on capital improvement projects worldwide. Of this, approximately half was in support of the US business with the remainder split almost equally between the European & Canadian businesses. Capital investment in the Brazilian discontinued operations and Corporate segment combined represented less than 5% of our total spending. The capital expenditure plan for 2006 is expected to be approximately $400 million (excluding capital spending by consolidated joint ventures), and will be impacted by the completion of the Shenandoah brewery build out and synergy related investments. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Contractual Cash Obligations as of December 25, 2005 Payments Due By Period Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years (In thousands) Long term debt, including current maturities(1) $ 2,484,770 $ 348,102 $ 8,020 $ 308,019 $ 1,820,629 Interest payments(2) 877,109 129,676 241,298 239,284 266,851 Derivative payments(2) 1,727,985 84,828 165,010 469,519 1,008,628 Retirement plan expenditures(3) 403,962 188,514 45,423 48,198 121,827 Operating leases 262,207 55,130 79,740 46,583 80,754 Capital leases(4) 5,493 3,551 1,634 308 Other long term obligations(5) 4,316,587 1,254,006 1,555,291 931,991 575,299 Total obligations $ 10,078,113 $ 2,063,807 $ 2,096,416 $ 2,043,902 $ 3,873,988 (1)We have had several significant changes to our debt obligations in 2005, primarily related to Merger related debt and the issuance of new bonds in Canada totaling approximately $1.1 billion in September 2005. Included in our debt obligations at December 25, 2005 are bonds issued by BRI, which is consolidated under FIN 46R. See Note 13 to the accompanying financial statements on page 102. (2)The "interest payments" line includes interest on our bonds and other borrowings outstanding at December 25, 2005, excluding the positive cash flow impacts of any interest rate or cross currency swaps. Current floating interest rates and currency exchange rates are assumed to be constant throughout the periods presented. The "derivative payments" line includes the interest rate swap and cross currency swap payment obligations only, which are paid to counterparties under our interest rate and cross currency swap agreements. Current floating interest rates and currency exchange rates are assumed to be constant throughout the periods presented. We will be receiving a total of $1,545 million in fixed rate payments from our counterparties under the swap arrangements, which offset the payments included in the table. As interest rates increase, payments 41 to our counterparties will also increase. Net interest payments, including swap receipts and payments, over the periods presented are as follows (in thousands). Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years Interest and derivative payments, net of derivative receipts $ 1,059,800 $ 136,520 $ 252,810 $ 255,210 $ 415,260 (3)Represents expected contributions under our defined benefit funded pension plans in the next twelve months and our benefits payments under retiree medical plans for all periods presented. (4)Includes a UK sale lease back included in a global information services agreement signed with Electronic Data Systems (EDS) late in 2003, effective January 2004, and totaling $3.6 million at December 25, 2005. The new EDS contract includes services to our US and Europe operations and our corporate offices and, unless extended, will expire in 2010. (5)Approximately $2 billion of the total other long term obligations relate to long term supply contracts to purchase raw material and energy used in production, including our contract with Graphic Packaging Corporation, a related party, dated March 25, 2003. Approximately $806 million relates to commitments associated with Tradeteam in the United Kingdom. The remaining amounts relate to sales and marketing, information technology services, open purchase orders and other commitments. (6)Obligations of our Brazil segment are not included because 68% of our interest in Brazil was sold to FEMSA on January 13, 2006. For additional information regarding this transaction, refer to Note 3 of our consolidated financial statements beginning on page 80. Other Commercial Commitments as of December 25, 2005 Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years (In thousands) Standby letters of credit $ 47,081 $ 45,932 $ 1,149 $ $ Total commercial commitments $ 47,081 $ 45,932 $ 1,149 $ $ Advertising and Promotions As of December 25, 2005, our aggregate commitments for advertising and promotions, including marketing at sports arenas, stadiums and other venues and events, total approximately $1.2 billion over the next five years and thereafter. Our advertising and promotions commitments are included in other long term obligations in the table above. Credit Rating As of February 28, 2006, our credit rating with Standard & Poors with regard to our long term debt was BBB. If this rating were to drop, our access to the commercial paper market for shorter term borrowings could be unfavorably impacted, resulting in either higher interest rates or an inability to borrow through commercial paper at all. Our commercial paper borrowings at December 25, 2005 were $167 million. 42 Pension Plans Our consolidated, unfunded pension position at the end of 2005 was approximately $800 million, an increase of $176 million from the end of 2004. The increase is the result of adding Canadas unfunded position totaling $321 million after the Merger, netted against improvements in the US and UK unfunded pension positions. The primary cause of the improvements was the doubling of the actual UK returns on assets during 2005, compared to 2004, and additional pension contributions in the United States of $30 million in 2005, compared to 2004. Our accumulated benefit obligation increased by $1.6 billion in 2005, primarily due to the addition of the Canadian plans after the Merger. The prior service cost component of our US pension obligations declined by approximately $35 million in 2005 due to changes in our salaried employee benefit formula in July 2005. The benefit formula is now calculated based upon a salaried employees career average compensation, instead of the last five years average compensation. The UK obligations decreased due to a plan amendment in 2005, as well. The UK plan amendment served to reduce obligations in accordance with new benefit calculations approved by pension regulators during the year. The net consolidated result of movements in pension obligations and pension assets was a net increase in minimum pension obligations of $142 million at the end of 2005. It is our practice to fund pension plans to meet the minimum requirements set forth in applicable employee benefits laws. However, management may voluntarily increase funding levels to meet expense and asset return forecasts in any given year. Pension contributions on a consolidated basis were $202 million in 2005, reflecting statutory contribution levels in Canada and the United Kindgom, and $91 million of voluntary contributions in the United States. We anticipate making approximately $167 million of both statutory and voluntary contributions to our pension plans in 2006. Consolidated pension expense was $65 million in 2005, an increase of $21 million from 2004. Canada accounted for $18 million of the increase, and change in control increases due to departing Coors executives accounted for the remaining $3 million. Primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of 2005, compared to 2004, we anticipate pension expense on a consolidated basis for 2006 of approximately $45.7 million. Contingencies Brazil Guarantees On January 13, 2006, we sold a 68% equity interest in Kaiser to FEMSA for $68 million cash, plus the assumption by FEMSA of Kaiser related debt and contingencies. Kaiser related debt at year end 2005 totaled approximately $60 million. Kaiser was our previously reported Brazil operating segment. We retained a 15% interest in Kaiser and have one seat on its board. We determined that our Brazil segment represented a discontinued operation as of December 25, 2005. As a result, we have segregated the results of operations, financial position and cash flows for the Brazil segment in our financial statements to be reflected as discontinued operations. The terms of the agreement require us to indemnify FEMSA for certain exposures related to tax, civil and labor contingencies arising prior to FEMSAs purchase of Kaiser. First, we provided a full indemnity for any losses Kaiser may incur with respect to tax claims associated with previously utilized purchased tax credits. Any potential liabilities associated with these exposures were not considered probable during 2005. The total amount of potential claims in this regard, plus estimated accumulated penalties and interest, is $205 million. Second, we provided an indemnity related to all other tax, civil and labor contingencies provided, however, that FEMSA assumed their full share of all contingent liabilities that had been recorded and disclosed by us. We may have to provide indemnity to FEMSA if those liabilities are resolved for amounts greater than those amounts recorded or disclosed by us. We will be able to offset any indemnity exposures in these circumstances with amounts that are resolved favorably to amounts previously recorded. We will record these guarantee liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value, and 43 the creation of those liabilities will reduce the expected gain on the sale of 68% of the business to be reported in the first quarter of 2006. Guarantees under Arrangements with the Montr&eacute;al Canadiens Molson Inc. sold the majority of its ownership in the Montr&eacute;al Canadiens professional hockey club (the Club) to a purchaser in 2001. Molson maintains a 19.9% common ownership interest in the Club, as well as a preferred interest, redeemable in 2009. The shareholders of the Club (the purchaser and Molson) and the National Hockey League (NHL) are parties to a consent agreement, which requires the purchaser and Molson to abide by funding requirements included in the terms of the shareholders agreement and for Molson to provide a net working capital of $5 million and funding to enable the Club to meet its operating expenses. In addition, Molson has given certain guarantees to the NHL and the lenders of the purchaser of the Club and the Bell Centre (formerly the Molson Centre), such that in the event that the Club and the purchaser are not able to meet their obligations, or in the event of a default, we shall 1) provide adequate support to the purchaser through necessary cash payments so that the purchaser would have sufficient funds to meet its debt obligations, and 2) exercise control of the entity which owns the Club and the entertainment business operated at the Bell Centre at predetermined conditions, subject to NHL approval. The obligations of the purchaser to such lenders were Cdn $92 million (approximately US $79 million) at December 25, 2005. As part of the sale transaction, Molson reaffirmed an existing guarantee of the purchasers payment obligations on a 99 year lease arrangement (which began in 1993) related to the land upon which the Bell Centre has been constructed. Annual lease payments in 2004 were Cdn $2.4 million (approximately US $2.1 million), and are adjusted annually to reflect prevailing interest rates and changes in the consumer price index. We have accrued the fair value of our guarantees under these arrangements as of December 25, 2005. Outlook for 2006 US Segment Coors Light is the key to success in the US business, and our primary sales and marketing programs revolve around this brand. In 2005, we focused on chain retail accounts, the Hispanic market, and the on premise channel. Coors Light achieved a significant turn around in 2005 by posting three consecutive growth quarters to finish 2005, following several quarters of declining sales to retail. Our plan in 2006 is to build on this momentum. The US business also will focus on capturing the identified cost savings from Merger synergies and other cost initiatives. Much of the cost improvement potential as a merged company centers on the US business, and it is important to achieve these cost savings as inflationary pressures continue to impact our cost of goods sold. We are planning to close the Memphis, Tennessee brewery in the fall of 2006. The Shenandoah, Virginia brewery is expected to be fully operational in 2007. We expect to continue to account for exit cost and other costs related to the Memphis brewery closure as special items in 2006, including accelerated depreciation, expected severance, and revisions of estimates for pension obligations. Canada Segment A main objective of 2005 was to stabilize year over year volume with renewed investment in mainstream brands. Share trends in the fourth quarter continued to show strong progress on Coors Light, and the Molson Canadian brand was flat in the quarter, the best result in more than two years. The value segment continued its growth trend to close out 2005; however, as we have begun to cycle the substantial ramp up of value brand activity in the prior year, the value segment is expected to continue to grow on a year over year basis in 2006 at a lower rate. 44 Coors Light and Molson Canadian remain critical to our success. Our top line programs are focused around these brands, while investing strategically across the entire portfolio. During 2006 we will remain focused on the objectives laid out at the beginning of the Merger, leveraging the five key priorities below and building on the strong progress to date to drive a platform for growth. First, we will continue to drive accelerated growth for Coors Light with new marketing and sales programs. Coors Light commands approximately two thirds of the light beer category in Canada and is now our largest brand in Canada, just ahead of Molson Canadian. This brand grew at a double digit rate in 2005 and is our main growth engine in Canada. Second, we are making progress in stabilizing our overall volume and share trends for our other core mainstream brands, in particular Molson Canadian. Our strategies in this area began to show results by the 4th quarter of 2005 as our supported brands experienced volume and share growth. After increasing marketing investment behind the Molson Canadian brand substantially in 2005, we intend to maintain a competitive investment level for this critical brand going forward. Third, to drive volume growth, we are leveraging the strength of our world class, partner brand import portfolio, which includes Heineken, Corona and Miller Genuine Draft. These brands grew at significant rates in 2005 and will again benefit from new, innovative programming this year. Fourth, we have adjusted our value segment strategies to regain lost volume and reduce the rate of trading down by consumers. We began to see positive results from these strategies in the second half of 2005, but we have more work to do. Stabilizing pricing will also be a key issue for Molson and the Industry in 2006. Fifth, we continue to focus on reducing costs to deliver the Canada related Merger cost synergies. Through our initiatives, we will work to offset cost of goods inflation, specifically the costs of distribution, energy, and input materials, which remain near historical high levels. Sales trade investment, in particular the Qu&eacute;bec market, is a potential area of profit pressure if trade cost escalation continues to far exceed inflation. Meanwhile, we expect to limit general and administrative increases to less than inflationary levels. Europe Segment The competitive environment in the UK beer industry continues to be challenging, driving our focus is on two main strategies. First, we are implementing cost reduction initiatives, especially related to overhead and supply chain costs. While these cost improvements were implemented in the latter part of 2005 and were not enough to offset all of the margin loss that our Europe business sustained in the past year, we believe that these aggressive improvements will help this business return to a solid earnings growth trend. Second, we will continue to invest heavily behind our core lager brands Carling, Grolsch and Coors Fine Light. The Carling brand has been consistently strong, growing market share every year for more than a decade and now represents three fourths of our Europe volume. Because there is goodwill included in the carrying value of the Europe reporting unit, its fair value was compared to its carrying value in 2005 to determine if there was a risk of goodwill impairment. The goodwill associated with the Europe reporting unit originated in the 2002 purchase of the CBL business by Coors. A reduction in the fair value of the Europe reporting unit in the future could lead to a goodwill impairment. We noted a reduction in the value of the Europe reporting unit from 2003 to 2004, but not enough of a decrease to warrant a goodwill impairment. Future reductions in fair value could occur for a number of reasons, including cost increases due to inflation, a negative beer pricing environment, and declines in industry or company specific beer volume sales. 45 Corporate We expect general and administrative costs to be lower in 2006, because we experienced significant one time costs related to the formation of the new global organization and headquarters, and significant legal fees associated with regulatory and shareholder civil actions in 2005. Higher expected costs associated with incentive compensation, including costs for stock based compensation, may offset these anticipated cost savings. Goodwill Because there is goodwill included in the carrying value of our three segments, its fair value was compared to its carrying value in 2005 to determine whether there was a risk of goodwill impairment. Most of the goodwill associated with the US and Canada segments originated in the Merger. Canadas goodwill was determined through purchase accounting, requiring the purchase consideration to be allocated to Molsons assets and liabilities based upon their fair values, with the residual to goodwill. A portion of the Merger goodwill was allocated to the US segment, based on the level of Merger synergy savings expected to accrue to the US segment over time. A reduction in the fair value of the US or Canada segment in the future could lead to a goodwill impairment. Reductions in fair value could occur for a number of reasons, including cost increases due to inflation, a negative beer pricing environment, declines in industry or company specific beer volume sales, or the inability to achieve synergies from the Merger. The goodwill associated with the Europe segment originated in the 2002 purchase of the CBL business by Coors. A reduction in the fair value of the Europe segment in the future could lead to a goodwill impairment. We noted a reduction in the value of the Europe segment from 2003 to 2004, but not enough of a decrease to warrant a goodwill impairment. Future reductions in fair value could occur for a number of reasons, including cost increases due to inflation, a negative beer pricing environment, and declines in industry or company specific beer volume sales. Interest We estimate that corporate interest expense in 2006 will be approximately $33 $34 million per quarter with the Brazil debt now removed from our balance sheet. Note that this excludes UK trade loan interest income. Stock Compensation For Molson Coors, as with many large companies, stock based long term incentive compensation will be an incremental expense starting in 2006 due to the new accounting guidelines around stock options, effective in the first quarter 2006. Combined with a re design of our long term incentive plan, we anticipate that this new accounting guidance will result in about $20 million ($25 million annualized) of increased expense in 2006 versus 2005. Less than 10% of this increased expense will be directly related to new accounting rules that will be applied to the 2006 stock option grant, expected to occur in mid March 2006, which will involve approximately 350,000 shares or about one sixth the size of the 2005 option grant. Additionally, the new restricted and performance share programs will involve only about 500,000 shares per year. Approximately 200,000 of these shares will be awarded under the restricted stock unit program. Equally important, more than 300,000 of these new incentive shares will be awarded only if the Company achieves strong profit performance during the next few years. Tax We anticipate that our full year 2006 effective tax rate will be in the range of 25% to 30%. It is important to note that the adoption of a permanent investment strategy for our UK business last year 46 pursuant to APB 23, provided a one time benefit and lowered our 2005 tax rate, which will not recur in 2006. Cash Flow and Liquidity We anticipate 2006 total Company capital spending of approximately $400 million. This is higher than 2005 due to completing our Virginia brewery build out and Merger related capital projects. After this year, in the absence of major capacity projects, we expect capital spending to drop to the low $300 millions for the total Company. One of our goals for 2006 is to generate more than $300 million of free cash flow available for debt repayments, including $68 million of cash proceeds from the Brazil business sale. It is important to note that some of the drivers of our 2005 free cash flow may not reoccur in 2006, including working capital timing, option exercises and asset monetizations which, taken together, totaled more than $100 million in 2005. Our Merger related special dividend debt balance stood at $163 million at the beginning of 2006. We plan to use our free cash to pay off the special dividend debt by some time this summer, which is well ahead of our original timeline. We anticipate increasing our free cash generation goal again in 2007 as we complete the construction of our Virginia brewery and realize more Merger cost synergies. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Variable Interest Entities FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities An Interpretation of ARB51 (FIN 46R) expands the scope of ARB51 and can require consolidation of "variable interest entities (VIEs)." Once an entity is determined to be a VIE, the party with the controlling financial interest, the primary beneficiary, is required to consolidate it. We have investments in VIEs, of which we are the primary beneficiary. These include Rocky Mountain Metal Container (RMMC), Rocky Mountain Bottle Company (RMBC), Grolsch (UK) Limited (Grolsch), and Brewers Retail Inc. (BRI). Accordingly, we have consolidated these four joint ventures in 2005, three of which were effective December 29, 2003, the first day of our 2004 fiscal year. The following summarizes the relative size of our consolidated joint ventures (including minority interests): Year Ended December 25, 2005 Year Ended December 26, 2004 Year Ended December 28, 2003 Total Assets(2) Sales(1) Pre tax Income Total Assets(2) Sales(1) Pre tax Income Total Assets(2) Sales(1) Pre tax Income (loss) (In thousands) Grolsch $ 30,724 $ 76,045 $ 12,083 $ 33,407 $ 100,657 $ 13,495 $ 16,857 $ 79,086 $ 10,607 RMBC $ 48,437 $ 90,855 $ 15,438 $ 43,441 $ 84,343 $ 19,507 $ 42,953 $ 85,307 $ 12,281 RMMC $ 68,826 $ 219,365 $ 8,925 $ 58,737 $ 209,594 $ 5,156 $ 63,676 $ 205,080 $ 223 BRI(3) $ 324,160 $ 180,562 $ $ $ $ $ $ $ (1)Substantially all such sales are made to the Company, and as such, are eliminated in consolidation.

Revenues reflect service charge revenues earned by BRI from the sale of products to the consumer; amount does not include beer sales of the Company, which are sold on a consignment basis. Total annual BRI beer sales handled by BRI approximate Cdn $2.6 billion, of which MCBC recognizes its share, or approximately 52%, as net sales in the statement of income. 47 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or US GAAP. We review our accounting policies on an on going basis. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. By their nature, estimates are subject to uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have identified the accounting estimates below as critical to our financial condition and results of operations: Allowance for Doubtful Accounts In the US segment, our allowance for doubtful accounts and credit risk is insignificant. The majority of the US segment accounts receivable balance is generated from sales to independent distributors with whom we have a predetermined collection date arranged through electronic funds transfer. Also, in the US segment, we secure substantially all of our credit risk with purchase money security interests in inventory and proceeds, personal guarantees and other letters of credit. Because the majority of CBL sales are directly to retail customers and, because of the industry practice of making trade loans to customers, our ability to manage credit risk in this business is critical. We provide allowances for trade receivables and trade loans associated with the ability to collect outstanding receivables from our customers. Generally, provisions are recorded to cover the full exposure to a specific customer (total amount of all trade accounts and loans from a specific customer less the amount of security and insurance coverage) at the point the account is considered uncollectible. We record the provision as a bad debt in general and administrative expenses. Provisions are reversed upon recoverability of the account or relieved at the point an account is written off. Canadas distribution channels are highly regulated by provincial regulation and experiences few collectibility problems. However, Canada does have direct sales to retail customers for which an allowance is recorded based upon aging analysis and historical experience. We are not able to predict changes in financial condition of our customers and, if circumstances related to our customers deteriorate, our estimates of the recoverability of our trade receivables could be adversely affected, and we may be required to record additional allowances. Pension and Postretirement Benefits We have defined benefit plans that cover the majority of our employees in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. We also have postretirement welfare plans in the United States and Canada that provide medical benefits for retirees and eligible dependents and life insurance for certain retirees. The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions" (SFAS No. 87) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions" (SFAS No. 106). Both of these statements require that management make certain assumptions relating to the long term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates used to measure future obligations and expenses, salary increases, inflation, health care cost trend rates and other assumptions. We believe that the accounting estimates related to our pension and postretirement plans are critical accounting estimates because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period based on market conditions. 48 We performed an analysis of high yield bonds at the end of 2005 and compared the results to appropriate indices and industry trends to support the discount rates used in determining our pension liabilities in the United States, Canada and in the United Kingdom for the year ended December 25, 2005. Discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets are selected at the end of a given fiscal year and impact expense in the subsequent year. A fifty basis point change in certain assumptions made at the beginning of 2005 would have had the following effects on 2005 pension expense: Impact to 2005 Pension Costs 50 basis points Description of Pension Sensitivity Item Reduction (Unfavorable) Increase (Favorable) (In millions) Expected return on US plan assets, 8.75% in 2005 $ (3.2 ) $ 3.2 Expected return on UK plan assets, 7.8% in 2005 $ (8.9 ) $ 8.9 Expected return on Canada plan assets, 7.9% in 2005 $ (3.8 ) $ 3.8 Discount rate on US projected benefit obligation, 5.875% in 2005 $ (6.2 ) $ 5.6 Discount rate on UK projected benefit obligation, 5.5% in 2005 $ (15.5 ) $ 15.0 Discount rate on Canada projected benefit obligation, 5.65% in 2005 $ (0.4 ) $ 0.4 Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the retiree health care plan. A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects: One percentage point increase (Unfavorable) One percentage point decrease (Favorable) (In millions) US Plan Effect on total of service and interest cost components $ 0.4 $ (0.4 ) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation $ 6.6 $ (5.9 ) Canada Plans Effect on total of service and interest cost components $ 2.0 $ (1.7 ) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation $ 26.4 $ (23.6 ) The US, Europe and Canada plan assets consist primarily of equity securities with smaller holdings of bonds, real estate and other investments. Equity assets are well diversified between domestic and other international investments, with additional diversification in the domestic category through allocations to large cap, small cap, and growth and value investments. Relative allocations reflect the demographics of the respective plan participants. The following compares target asset allocation percentages as of February 24, 2006, with actual asset allocations at December 25, 2005: US Plan Assets Europe Plan Assets Canada Plan Assets Target Allocations Actual Allocations Target Allocations Actual Allocations Target Allocations Actual Allocations Equities 75 % 76 % 62 % 66 % 70 % 71 % Fixed Income 15 % 19 % 28 % 25 % 30 % 29 % Real Estate 10 % 5 % 7 % 6 % 0 % 0 % Other 0 % 0 % 3 % 3 % 0 % 0 % Contingencies, Environmental and Litigation Reserves We estimate the range of liability related to environmental matters or other legal actions where the amount and range of loss can be estimated. We record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is 49 considered probable. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to any pending matter and revise our estimates. Costs that extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of Company owned assets or are incurred to mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination may be capitalized. Other environmental costs are expensed when incurred. We also expense legal costs as incurred. See Note 19 to the accompanying financial statements on page 118 for a discussion of the Companys contingencies, environmental and litigation reserves at December 25, 2005. There are large numbers of contingent tax liabilities are associated with our discontinued operations in Brazil. Our approach in estimating loss contingencies for these items generally did not contemplate or anticipate negotiated resolutions or government sponsored amnesty programs (which, when they occur, may apply to all companies in Brazil or whichever state in Brazil is assessing the tax) when setting our reserves for cases where a loss was considered probable. In effect, if a loss was considered probable, it was reserved at the assessed amount. This also applied where the nature of the challenge was constitutional; i.e., if Kaiser (and other companies) had been assessed taxes but were challenging the assessment based on the legal merits of the tax law itself, a full reserve was maintained and any successful outcome in the future would be recognized only when realized. Penalties on Brazil tax liabilities have potentially wide ranges, and we estimated the levels of penalties based on past experience and consultations with outside counsel on a case by case basis. We sold 68% of the Kaiser business in January 2006. While we greatly reduced our risk profile as a result of this transaction, we retained some level of risk by providing indemnities to the buyer for certain purchased tax credits and for other tax, labor and civil contingencies in general. These are discussed in the section called "Contingencies" above. We will account for these indemnity obligations at fair value in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. This rule requires us to carry the guarantee liability on the balance sheet at its fair value. We do not expect to amortize this liability, but rather make an annual estimate of its fair value, and record the change in the value through discontinued operations on the income statement (if it is material). If we conclude that we have to make payments on an indemnity provision and therefore the obligation converts to a monetary contingent liability, we will record the income statement charge through discontinued operations (again, if material). Goodwill and Other Intangible Asset Valuation We evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually, and we evaluate our other intangible assets when there is evidence that certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Significant judgments and assumptions are required in the evaluation of intangible assets for impairment, most significantly the estimated future cash flows to be generated by these assets and the rate used to discount those cash flows. Our projections are based on various long range plans completed by the Company and considered, when necessary, various scenarios deviating from a base case, both favorable and unfavorable. Discount rates used for enterprise value estimates for goodwill testing ranged from 7.5% for Canada to 8% for the United States and Europe. Canada represents our most profitable reporting unit, with the highest market share. Our US, Canada and UK segments operate in relatively mature beer markets, where we are reliant on a major brand for a high percentage of sales. Discount rates used for testing of indefinite lived intangibles ranged form 7.7% for Canada core brands, 8.5% for our Coors Light distribution intangible in Canada, to 9.5% for the Carling brand in the United Kingdom. These rates largely reflect the rates for the overall enterprise valuations, with some level of premium associated with the specificity of the intangibles themselves. Changes in these estimates could have an adverse impact on the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, thereby requiring us to impair the 50 assets. We have allocated approximately $1.1 billion of goodwill from the Merger to the US reporting unit. We have done this allocation to more accurately allocate the goodwill to the reporting units that are expected to realize the synergy savings that will result from the Merger. It should be noted that this allocation of goodwill puts added pressure on the US business to achieve synergy savings to avoid an impairment of goodwill. There is also some level of impairment risk in 2006 and beyond associated with goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles in the United Kingdom, given financial performance in the Europe reporting unit, and with the non amortized core brands intangible in Canada, given the potential for inconsistent growth patterns and pricing for those brands. Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments The following tables present a roll forward of the fair values of debt and derivative contracts outstanding as well as their maturity dates and how those fair values were obtained (in millions): Fair value of contracts outstanding at December 26, 2004 $ (1,179.6 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (13.9 ) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period (1,255.2 ) Other changes in fair values 134.1 Fair value of contracts outstanding at December 25, 2005 $ (2,314.6 ) Fair Value of Contracts at December 25, 2005 Source of Fair Value Maturity less than 1 year Maturity 1 3 years Maturity 4 5 years Maturity in excess of 5 years Total Fair Value Prices actively quoted $ $ $ (296.8 ) $ (1,666.3 ) $ (1,963.1 ) Prices provided by other external sources 2.6 3.4 (5.8 ) (351.7 ) (351.5 ) We use derivatives in the normal course of business to manage our exposure to fluctuations in production and packaging material prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. By policy, we do not enter into such contracts for trading purposes or for the purpose of speculation. All derivatives held by us are designated as hedges with the expectation that they will be highly effective in offsetting underlying exposures. We account for our derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as assets or liabilities at fair value in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended and interpreted, incorporating FASB Statements No. 137, 138 and 149." (SFAS No. 133), which we early adopted on December 28, 1998. Such accounting is complex, as evidenced by significant interpretations of the primary accounting standard, which continues to evolve, as well as the significant judgments and estimates involved in the estimation of fair value in the absence of quoted market values. These estimates are based upon valuation methodologies deemed appropriate in the circumstances; however, the use of different assumptions could have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. Our market sensitive derivative and other financial instruments, as defined by the SEC, are foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swaps, interest rate swaps, and cross currency swaps. See discussions also in Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" and Note 18 on page 115. We monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using two techniques Value at Risk and sensitivity analysis. We use Value at Risk to monitor the foreign exchange and interest rate risk of our cross currency swaps. The Value at Risk provides an estimate of the level of a one day loss that may be equaled or exceeded due to changes in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate and interest rate sensitive financial instruments. The type of Value at Risk model used to estimate the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value is a variance/covariance method. The Value at Risk model assumes 51 normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used to compute value at risk. The computations used to derive our values take into account various correlations between currency rates and interest rates. The correlations have been determined by observing foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the most recent one year period. We have excluded anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances, and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies from the Value at Risk calculation, some of which these instruments are intended to hedge. The Value at Risk calculation is a statistical measure of risk exposure based on probabilities and is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we may incur. The calculated Value at Risk result does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. It attempts to represent the most likely measure of potential loss that may be experienced 95 times out of 100 due to adverse market events that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated by Value at Risk because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments, hedge percentages, timing and other factors. The estimated maximum one day loss in fair value on our cross currency swaps, derived using the Value at Risk model, was $12.2 million, $10.7 million and $5.9 million at December 25, 2005, December 26, 2004, and December 28, 2003, respectively. Such a hypothetical loss in fair value is a combination of the foreign exchange and interest rate components of the cross currency swap. Value changes due to the foreign exchange component would be offset completely by increases in the value of our inter company loan, the underlying transaction being hedged. The hypothetical loss in fair value attributable to the interest rate component would be deferred until termination or maturity. We have performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk of interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. The sensitivity analysis reflects the impact of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the applicable market interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. The volatility of the applicable rates and prices are dependent on many factors that cannot be forecast with reliable accuracy. Therefore, actual changes in fair values could differ significantly from the results presented in the table below. The following table presents the results of the sensitivity analysis, which reflects the impact of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the applicable market interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices of our derivative and debt portfolio: As of Estimated Fair Value Volatility December 25, 2005 December 26, 2004 (In millions) Foreign currency risk: Forwards, swaps $ (13.4 ) $ (6.6 ) Interest rate risk: Debt, swaps $ (75.6 ) $ (30.7 ) Commodity price risk: Swaps $ (17.6 ) $ (8.4 ) Income Tax Assumptions We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS No. 109) Judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our global business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, our income tax provision is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by many different tax authorities. We adjust our income tax provision in the period it is probable that actual results will differ from our 52 estimates. Tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted. We have historically provided US deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries. During 2005, we assessed our corporate financing position with respect to all our foreign subsidiaries. As a result, we have elected to treat our portion of all foreign subsidiary earnings through December 25, 2005 as permanently reinvested. Under the accounting guidance of APB 23 and SFAS 109, we recorded a tax provision benefit in the third quarter of 2005 totaling $44 million, representing the reversal of a previously established deferred tax liability in our UK subsidiary. As of December 25, 2005, approximately $255 million of retained earnings attributable to international companies was considered to be permanently re invested. The Companys intention is to reinvest the earnings permanently or to repatriate the earnings when it is tax effective to do so. It is not practicable to determine the amount of incremental taxes that might arise were these earnings to be remitted. However, the Company believes that US foreign tax credits would largely eliminate any US taxes and offset any foreign withholding taxes due on remittance. On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "Jobs Act") provided a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities, which will be phased in from 2005 through 2010. In return, the Act also provides for a two year phase out of the existing extra territorial income exclusion (ETI) for foreign sales that was viewed to be inconsistent with international trade protocols by the European Union. The net effect of the phase out of the ETI and the phase in of this new deduction did not materially impact the Companys effective tax rate in 2005. In addition to the deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities, the Jobs Act also creates a temporary incentive for US corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. The deduction is subject to a number of limitations, which resulted in the Company not recognizing a benefit from this provision of the Jobs Act. The FASB is currently considering changes to accounting for uncertain tax positions. Because the nature and extent of the changes are not fully known we are not able to predict the impact on our tax contingency reserve, if any. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period a determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Reductions to the valuation allowance related to the Merger with Molson or the acquisitions of CBL that relate to deferred taxes arising from those events would reduce goodwill, unless the reduction was caused by a change in law, in which case the adjustment would impact earnings. During 2002, in connection with the purchase of CBL, we recorded a deferred tax liability on the books of CBL and a corresponding deferred tax asset on the books of the acquiring Company for the difference between the purchase price and historical basis of the CBL assets. Concurrently, we recorded a $40.0 million valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In 2005 the Company re evaluated the purchase accounting and determined that recording this deferred tax asset was not appropriate as it did not represent either a tax carry forward or a difference in the book and tax bases of the net assets at the time the purchase accounting adjustments were recorded. The impact of the misstatement on the Companys balance sheet was an overstatement of the long term deferred tax asset account of $157 million, with a corresponding 53 understatement of goodwill of $147 million at December 26, 2004. The impact of this misstatement was not material to the consolidated balance sheets for December 26, 2004. This error resulted in immaterial misstatements in the Companys reported income tax provision for the year ended December 26, 2004. See Item 9A on page 136. Consolidations under FIN 46R RMMC and RMBC are dedicated predominantly to our packaging and distribution activities and were formed with companies which have core competencies in the aluminum and glass container businesses. The CBL joint venture with Grolsch was formed to provide a long term relationship with that brands owner in a key segment of the UK beer market. In 2003, our share of the pre tax joint venture profits for each of these investments was offset against cost of goods sold in our Consolidated Statements of Income. In 2004, as a result of implementing FIN 46R, these entities have been consolidated into our Consolidated Financial Statements as we have determined they are variable interest entities and that we are the primary beneficiary. We also consolidate the financial position and results of Brewers Retail, Inc. (BRI), which is 52% owned by Molson, and provides all distribution and retail sales of beer in the province of Ontario in Canada. We have examined another potential business relationship during 2004 when implementing FIN 46R. This is the relationship we have with Trigen, the supplier of virtually all our energy needs at our Golden facility. Trigen purchased our power plant facilities in 1995 and signed a contract to provide our energy needs in Golden. We do not own any portion of the Trigen entity, but upon review of the supply contract, we believe that the relationship could be viewed as a variable interest, as defined by FIN 46R. However, despite exhaustive efforts to obtain financial information necessary to proceed with the analysis, we have been unable to obtain the information from Trigen, which cites privacy and competitive issues with releasing this financial information. We purchase approximately $34.0 million of energy each year from Trigen. We have determined that any risk of a material loss is remote and that our total maximum loss cannot be reasonably estimated. We do not have another readily available option to obtain the steam energy required to run our plant. We could incur operational losses should we be unable to purchase steam from Trigen, and we are unable to estimate any such losses. In addition, we have a non cancelable obligation to pay Trigen fixed costs through the remainder of the contract. The costs are adjusted annually for inflation and were approximately $17.5 million in 2005. We currently purchase some of our electricity requirements from another supplier at rates that do not significantly differ from the rates we pay Trigen. Our risk of loss relating to the difference in price from having to buy electricity from another third party rather than from Trigen is not significant. In the event that Trigen failed to perform its contractual obligations, MCBC has the right to step in and operate the power plant facilities. This circumstance would involve MCBC repurchasing the power plant assets, a cost that could be borne with MCBCs current capital resources. Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncement FASB Interpretation No. 47 "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143" In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47 "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143," ("FIN 47") which clarifies the term "conditional asset retirement obligation" as used in SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." ("SFAS No. 143") Specifically, FIN 47 provides that an asset retirement obligation is conditional when either the timing and (or) method of settling the obligation is conditioned on a future event. Accordingly, an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair market value of the liability can be 54 reasonably estimated. Uncertainty about the timing and (or) method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists. We adopted FIN 47 on December 25, 2005, which resulted in an increase to properties of $0.5 million, goodwill of $2.2 million and liabilities of $9.6 million related to asset retirement obligations. For asset retirement obligations related to the properties acquired in the acquisition of Molson Inc. as of February 9, 2005, such obligations increased the goodwill amounts recognized upon the acquisition by $2.2 million as such properties were recorded at the appraised fair market value at the acquisition date. These asset retirement obligations relate primarily to clean up, removal, or replacement activities and related costs for asbestos, coolants, waste water, oils and other contaminants contained within our manufacturing properties. The adoption of FIN 47 was reflected in our financial statements as the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle with the catch up adjustment of $3.7 million, net of tax benefit of $2.2 million, in the 2005 income statement. This adjustment represents a depreciation charge and an accretion of liability from the time the obligation originated, which is either from the time of the acquisition or the construction of related long lived assets, through December 25, 2005. Inherent in the fair value calculation of asset retirement obligations are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the fair value of the existing asset retirement obligation liability, a corresponding adjustment will be made to the asset balance. If the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability, we will recognize a gain or loss upon the settlement. The net value of the asset retirement obligation liabilities calculated on a pro forma basis as if the standard had been retrospectively applied to all periods presented are as follows: December 25, 2005 December 26, 2004 December 28, 2003 $9,628,580 $5,926,852 $5,487,826 New Accounting Pronouncements SFAS 123R, "Share Based Payment" Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123R (SFAS No. 123R) was issued in December 2004 and will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2006. SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized as compensation in the financial statements based on their fair values. Currently, under an exemption written into the guidance for qualifying stock option grants with no intrinsic value on the date of grant, we present pro forma share based compensation expense for our stock option program in the notes to our financial statements. We have elected to use the modified prospective transition method of implementing SFAS 123R. Under the modified prospective method, awards that are granted, modified, or settled after adoption of SFAS 123R are prospectively measured and accounted for in accordance with SFAS 123R. Unvested equity classified awards that were granted prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R should continue to be accounted for in accordance with SFAS 123, except that amounts must be recognized in the income statement. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 107 (SAB 107) to assist preparers by simplifying some of the implementation challenges of SFAS 123R. In particular, SAB 107 provides supplemental implementation guidance on SFAS 123R, including guidance on valuation methods, classification of compensation expense, inventory capitalization of share based compensation cost, 55 income tax effects, disclosures in Managements Discussion and Analysis and several other issues. We will apply the principles of SAB 107 in conjunction with our adoption of SFAS 123R. We have elected to use the Black Scholes option pricing model to value stock options granted in 2006 and will amortize the expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period. We expect to use lattice modeling to determine our expected term assumption. Other equity instruments issued as compensation will be valued based upon the market price of our stock on the date of grant and will be amortized on a straight line basis over their earnings periods. The pro forma disclosures in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 on page 70 illustrate the approximate impact of applying SFAS 123R to the historical periods presented. However, the 2005 historical period presented includes the effects of the accelerated vesting of all outstanding, but unvested stock options on the date of our Merger ($18 million) and the accelerated vesting of all outstanding, but unvested stock options with exercise prices above $70 approved by our Board of Directors in December 2005 ($29 million). The Board action in December, while serving to reduce future stock option amortization expense as a result of adoption of SFAS 123R, will be partially offset by new issuances of equity instruments to employees in 2006. We are finalizing our first quarter 2006 option expense calculations and do not yet know the impact to our income statement. SFAS No. 151 "Inventory Costs" SFAS No. 151 is an amendment to ARB No. 43, Chapter 4 that will be effective for us in fiscal 2006. The standard clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and spoilage to require that those costs be expensed currently, as opposed to being included in overhead costs. We do not anticipate that the adoption will have a significant impact on our financial statements. SFAS No. 154 "Accounting Changes and Corrections" SFAS No. 154 replaces APB Opinion No. 20 and FAS No. 3 and will be effective for us in fiscal 2006. The standard introduces a new requirement to retrospectively apply accounting principle changes to prior years comparative financial statements as if the Company had always applied the newly adopted accounting principle. Changes in depreciation, amortization and depletion methods previously considered a change in accounting principle are now considered a change in estimate under SFAS No. 154, requiring prospective adoption. SFAS No. 155, "Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments" SFAS No. 155 was issued in February 2006 and will be effective for us in the first quarter of our 2007 fiscal year. Among other things, SFAS No. 155 simplifies the accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments by permitting fair value accounting for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation. We are still reviewing the impact that SFAS No. 155 will have on our financial statements. FASB Staff Position ("FSP") No. FIN 45 3 "Application of FASB Interpretation No. 45 to Minimum Revenue Guarantees Granted to a Business or its Owners" FSP No. FIN 45 3 is an amendment to FIN 45 requiring the recognition and disclosure of the fair value of an obligation undertaken for minimum revenue guarantees granted to a business or its owners that the revenue of the business for a specified period of time will be at least a specified minimum amount. The FSP is effective for new minimum revenue guarantees issued or modified on or after the beginning of the first quarter 2006. We do not anticipate that the adoption will have a significant impact on our financial statements. 56 Related Party Transactions Transactions with Management and Others We employ members of the Coors and Molson families, which collectively owned 81% of the voting A share, common and exchangeable stock of the Company after the Merger and throughout 2005. Hiring and placement decisions are made based upon merit, and compensation packages offered are commensurate with policies in place for all employees of the Company. Certain Business Relationships We purchase a large portion of our paperboard packaging requirements from Graphic Packaging Corporation (GPC), a related party. As of December 25, 2005, various Coors family trusts collectively owned approximately 40% of our Class A voting common stock, approximately 13% of our Class B common stock, and approximately 30% of GPCs common stock. Our payments under the GPC packaging agreement in 2005, 2004 and 2003 totaled $75.3 million, $104.5 million and $106.4 million, respectively. Related accounts payable balances included in Affiliates Accounts Payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $2.8 million and $3.4 million at December 25, 2005, and December 26, 2004, respectively.  ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currencies and the prices of production and packaging materials. We have established policies and procedures to govern the strategic management of these exposures through a variety of financial instruments. By policy, we do not enter into any contracts for the purpose of trading or speculation. Our objective in managing our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and production and packaging materials prices is to decrease the volatility of our earnings and cash flows affected by potential changes in underlying rates and prices. To achieve this objective, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swaps, interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps, the values of which change in the opposite direction of the anticipated cash flows. We do not hedge the value of net investments in foreign currency denominated operations or translated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Our primary foreign currency exposures are Canadian dollar (Cdn $), British pound sterling (GBP or &pound;) and Japanese yen (Yen). Derivatives are either exchange traded instruments, or over the counter agreements entered into with highly rated financial institutions. No losses on over the counter agreements due to counterparty credit issues are anticipated. All over the counter agreements are entered into with counterparties rated no lower than A (S&P) or A2 (Moodys). In some instances our counterparties and we have reciprocal collateralization agreements regarding fair value positions in excess of certain thresholds. These agreements call for the posting of collateral in the form of cash, treasury securities or letters of credit if a fair value loss position to our counterparties or us exceeds a certain amount. At December 25, 2005, no collateral was posted by our counterparties or us. 57 Details of all other market sensitive derivative and other financial instruments, including their fair values, are included in the table below. These instruments include long term fixed rate debt, foreign currency forwards, commodity swaps, interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps. See related Value at Risk and sensitivity analysis on page 51.

The swaps included an initial exchange of principal in 2002 and will require final principal exchange on the settlement date of our 63/8% notes due in 2012 (see Note 13 on page 102). The swaps also call for an exchange of fixed GBP interest payments for fixed US $ interest receipts. At the initial principal exchange, we paid US $ to a counterparty and received GBP. Upon final exchange, we will provide GBP to the counterparty and receive US $. The cross currency swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges of the changes in value of the future GBP interest and principal receipts that results from changes in the US $ to GBP exchange rates on an intercompany loan between two of our subsidiaries. (2)Prior to issuing the bonds on September 22, 2005 (See Note 13 on page 102), we entered into a bond forward transaction for a portion of the Canadian offering. The bond forward transaction effectively established, in advance, the yield of the government of Canada bond rates over which the Companys private placement was priced. At the time of the private placement offering and pricing, the government of Canada bond rates was trading at a yield lower than that locked in with the Companys interest rate lock. This resulted in a loss of $4.0 million on the bond forward transaction. Per FAS 133 accounting, the loss will be amortized over the life of the Canadian issued private placement and will serve to increase the Companys effective cost of borrowing by 4.9 basis points compared to the stated coupon on the issue. Simultaneously with the US private placement we entered into a cross currency swap transaction for the entire US $300 million issue amount and for the same maturity. In this transaction we exchanged our US $300 million for a Cdn $355.5 million obligation with a third party. The terms of the transaction are such that the Company will pay interest at a rate of 4.28% to the third party on the amount of Cdn $355.5 million and will receive interest at a rate of 4.85% on the US $300 million amount. There was an exchange of principal at the inception of this transaction and there will be a subsequent exchange of principal at the termination of the transaction. We have designated this transaction as a hedge of the variability of the cash flows associated with the payment of interest and principal on the US $ securities. Consistent with FAS 133 accounting, all changes in the value of the transaction due to foreign exchange will be recorded through the Statement of Income and will be offset by a revaluation of the associated debt instrument. Changes in the value of the transaction due to interest rates will be recorded to other comprehensive income. (3)We are a party to a cross currency swap totaling Cdn $255 million (approximately US $218 million at prevailing foreign currency exchange rates in 2005, the year we entered into the swap). The swap included an initial exchange of principal in 2005 and matures in 2006. The swap also calls for an exchange of fixed Cdn $ interest payments for fixed US $ interest receipts. At the initial principal exchange, we paid US $ to a counterparty and received Cdn $. Upon final exchange, we will provide Cdn $ to the counterparty and receive US $. The cross currency swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge of the changes in value of the future Cdn $ interest and principal receipts that results from changes in the US $ to Cdn $ 58 exchange rates on an intercompany loan between two of our subsidiaries. See accounting method discussion in Note 18 on page 115 to the accompanying financial statements. (4)We are a party to interest rate swap agreements related to our 63/8% fixed rate debt. The interest rate swaps convert $201.2 million notional amount from fixed rates to floating rates and mature in 2012. We will receive fixed US $ interest payments semi annually at a rate of 63/8% per annum and pay a rate to our counterparty based on a credit spread plus the three month LIBOR rate, thereby exchanging a fixed interest obligation for a floating rate obligation. There was no exchange of principal at the inception of the swaps. We designated the interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of the changes in the fair value of $201.2 million fixed rate debt attributable to changes in the LIBOR swap rates. See accounting method discussion in Note 18 on page 115 to the accompanying financial statements. (5)The BRI joint venture is a party to interest rate swaps, converting Cdn $200 million notional amount from fixed rates to floating rates and mature in 2011. There was no exchange of principal at the inception of the swaps. These interest rate swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. See accounting method discussion in Note 18 on page 115 to the accompanying financial statements. 59
