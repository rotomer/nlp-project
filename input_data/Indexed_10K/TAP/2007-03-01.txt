ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary Our income from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 was $373.6 million compared to income from continuing operations of $230.4 million for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2005. Our net income for 2006 was $361.0 million, or $4.17 per diluted share, compared to net income for 2005 of $134.9 million, or $1.69 per diluted share. Net sales for 2006 were $5.8 billion on 42.1 million barrels of beer sold, versus $5.5 billion on 40.4 million barrels sold in 2005. The merger with Molson was completed on February 9, 2005; consequently, a portion of the growth in volume, revenue and 28 profit is due to the inclusion of the Canada segment for the full year in 2006, versus forty five and one half weeks for the year ended 2005. Also, our 2006 fiscal year included 53 weeks, compared to 52 weeks in 2005. The 53rd week in our fiscal 2006 increased total company sales volume by approximately 600 thousand barrels and pre tax profit by approximately $6 million. Our performance in 2006 our second year as a merged company demonstrated that our brand growth strategies and cost reduction efforts continue to strengthen our competitive capabilities and financial performance. We achieved revenue and profit growth, despite substantial competitive and inflationary cost challenges in each of our major markets. We achieved several critical successes in 2006: We grew volume in all of our businesses on the strength of our leading brands. We gained market share in the U.S. and U.K. and improved our Canada share trends substantially versus the pre merger trend that Molson experienced. We increased revenue per barrel in Canada and in the U.S., supported by our brand building efforts. We captured more than $104 million of cost reductions across our company, including nearly $66 million of merger synergies more than 60% above our original synergies goal for 2006. We continued to invest strategically behind our brand equities and in our sales execution capabilities in each of our businesses. We invested in capital and other projects, most significantly in the Shenandoah brewery in the U.S., that will help us to continue to reduce our fixed cost structure and grow earnings and financial flexibility. We generated $833.2 million of operating cash flow and repaid all commercial paper borrowings and all borrowings under our credit facility by the end of the year. We achieved these results with a focus on building strong brands while controlling and reducing costs across our company. Synergies and other cost savings initiatives The Company originally targeted $40 million of annual Merger related savings for 2006. During the course of the year, we increased our target to $60 million, and achieved $66 million in annual synergies during 2006. Combined with the $59 million of synergy savings achieved in 2005, we have captured a total of $125 million of synergies over the past two years. We expect to exceed the total synergies goal of $175 million during 2007. Moreover, we are developing and implementing a next generation of cost savings initiatives, which are in varying stages of development. Income taxes Our full year effective tax rate was 17.5% in 2006 and 17.0% in 2005. Our 2006 effective tax rate was significantly lower than the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following: lower income tax rates applicable to our Canadian and U.K. businesses; and one time benefits from revaluing our deferred tax assets and liabilities to give effect to reductions in foreign income tax rates. Our 2005 effective tax rate was lower than the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to lower income tax rates applicable to our Canadian and U.K. businesses and a one time benefit resulting from the reversal of a previously recognized deferred tax liability due to our election to treat our portion of all foreign subsidiary earnings through December 25, 2005, as permanently reinvested under the accounting guidance of APB 23 Accounting for Income Taxes Special Areas and SFAS 109 Accounting for Income Taxes. 29 Components of our Statement of Operations Net sales Our net sales represent almost exclusively the sale of beer and other malt beverages, the vast majority of which are brands that we own and brew ourselves. We import or brew and sell certain non owned partner brands under licensing and related arrangements. We also sell certain factored brands, as a distributor, to on premise customers in the United Kingdom (Europe segment). Cost of goods sold Our cost of goods sold include costs we incur to make and ship beer. These costs include brewing materials, such as barley, in the United States and United Kingdom where we manufacture the majority of our own malt. In Canada, we purchase malt from third parties. Hops and various grains are other key brewing materials purchased by all of our segments. Packaging materials, including costs for glass bottles, aluminum and steel cans, and cardboard and paperboard are also included in our cost of goods sold. Our cost of goods sold also include both direct and indirect labor, freight costs, utilities, maintenance costs, and other manufacturing overheads. Marketing, general and administrative These costs include media advertising (television, radio, print), tactical advertising (signs, banners, point of sale materials) and promotion costs planned and executed on both local and national levels within our operating segments. These costs also include our sales organizations, including labor and other overheads. This classification also includes general and administrative costs for functions such as finance, legal, human resources and information technology, which consist primarily of labor and outside services. Special Items These are unique, infrequent and unusual items which affect our statement of operations, and are discussed in each segments Results of Operations discussion. Interest income (expense) Interest costs associated with borrowings to finance our operations are classified here. Interest income in the Europe segment is associated with trade loans receivable from customers. Other income (expense) This classification includes primarily gains and losses associated with activities not directly related to brewing and selling beer. For instance, gains or losses on sales of non operating assets, our share of income or loss associated with our ownership in Tradeteam and the Montral Canadiens hockey club, and certain foreign exchange gains and losses are classified here. Discussions of statement of operations line items such as minority interests, discontinued operations and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle are discussed in detail elsewhere in MD&A and in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Discontinued Operations The Companys former Brazil business, Kaiser, which was acquired as part of the Merger, is reported as a discontinued operation due to the sale of a 68% controlling interest in the business on January 13, 2006. Proceeds from the sale were $68 million cash, less $4.2 million of transaction costs. We divested our remaining 15% interest in Kaiser during the fourth quarter, for which we received $15.7 million, including $0.6 million of accrued interest. The loss from discontinued operations of $12.5 million for the year ended 2006 is composed of the following components: Losses generated by Kaiser prior to the sale of $2.3 million. A loss on the January 2006 sale of 68% of the business of $2.8 million. Unfavorable adjustments to indemnity liabilities due to foreign exchange fluctuations and changes in estimates of $3.0 million. A net loss of $4.4 million as a result of the exercise of the put option on our remaining 15% common ownership interest. The net result of a gain from the proceeds from the exercise of our put 30 option was more than offset by a loss due to the increase in our indemnity liabilities as a result of purchasers increased ownership level. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. During 2005, Kaiser generated pre tax losses of $91.8 million, due to operating losses and special charges associated with increasing reserves for contingent liabilities. In conjunction with this transaction, the purchaser (FEMSA) assumed $63 million of financial debt and assumed contingent liabilities of approximately $260 million, related primarily to tax claims, subject to our indemnification. We have a level of continuing potential exposure to these contingent liabilities of Kaiser, as well as previously disclosed but less than probable unaccrued claims, due to certain indemnities provided to FEMSA pursuant to the sales and purchase agreement. While we believe that all significant contingencies were disclosed as part of the sale process and adequately reserved for on Kaisers financial statements, resolution of contingencies and claims above reserved or otherwise disclosed amounts could, under some circumstances, result in additional cash outflows for Molson Coors because of transaction related indemnity provisions. We have recorded these indemnity liabilities at fair value and have a carrying value at December 31, 2006, of $111.0 million. Due to the uncertainty involved with the ultimate outcome and timing of these contingencies, there could be significant adjustments in the future. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle Molson Coors has adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143 (FIN 47) under which companies must recognize potential long term liabilities related to the eventual retirement of assets. As a result of adopting FIN 47, we recorded a cumulative non cash expense of $3.7 million, after tax, in the 2005 fourth quarter, reported as Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle in the Companys statement of operations. As reported in our 2005 fourth quarter and full year results, these liabilities represent accumulated remediation and restoration costs expected to be incurred up to 30 years in the future for anticipated asset retirements. Costs related to FIN 47 were not significant in 2006, and following this cumulative catch up expense recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005, we do not expect FIN 47 related expense to have a significant impact on our annual operating results. Results of Operations Canada Segment Before the Merger, the Canada segment consisted of Coors Brewing Companys 50.1% interest in the Coors Canada Partnership (CCP), through which the Coors Light business in Canada was conducted. CCP contracted with Molson for the brewing, distribution and the sale of Coors Light products, while CCP managed all marketing activities in Canada. In connection with the Merger, CCP was dissolved into the Canadian business. Coors accounted for its interest in CCP using the equity method of accounting. Following the Merger, our Canada segment consists primarily of Molsons beer business including the production and sale of the Molson brands, Coors Light and other licensed brands, principally in Canada. The Canada segment also includes our joint venture arrangements related to the distribution of beer in Ontario Brewers Retail, Inc. (BRI) (consolidated under FIN 46R) and the Western provinces Brewers Distributor Ltd. (BDL). 31 The following represents the Canada segments historical results: Fiscal year ended December 31, 2006(1)(5) % change December 25, 2005(5) % change December 26, 2004 (In thousands, except percentages) Volume in barrels(2) 8,282 11.1 % 7,457 N/M Net sales(3) $ 1,793,608 17.4 % $ 1,527,306 N/M $ 60,693 Cost of goods sold (883,649 ) 11.7 % (790,859 ) N/M Gross profit 909,959 23.6 % 736,447 N/M 60,693 Marketing, general and administrative expenses (439,920 ) 16.5 % (377,545 ) N/M 969 Special items, net N/M (5,161 ) N/M Operating income 470,039 32.9 % 353,741 N/M 61,662 Other income (expense), net 13,228 N/M (2,183 ) N/M Segment earnings before income taxes(4) $ 483,267 37.5 % $ 351,558 470.1 % $ 61,662 N/M Not meaningful (1) 53 weeks included in 2006 versus 52 weeks in 2004 2005(5).

The following represents the Canada segments pro forma results, as if the Merger had occurred on December 29, 2003, the first day of Coors 2004 fiscal year: Fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 December 25, 2005 December 26, 2004 (Actual) % Change (Pro forma) % Change (Pro forma) (In thousands, except percentages) Volume in barrels 8,282 1.6 % 8,148 (1.1 )% 8,241 Net sales $ 1,793,608 10.2 % $ 1,627,721 6.5 % $ 1,528,279 Cost of goods sold (883,649 ) 8.0 % (818,297 ) 5.9 % (772,510 ) Gross profit 909,959 12.4 % 809,424 7.1 % 755,769 Marketing, general and administrative expenses (439,920 ) 3.4 % (425,468 ) 24.2 % (342,635 ) Special items, net N/M (5,161 ) N/M % (20,404 ) Operating income 470,039 24.1 % 378,795 (3.5 )% 392,730 Other income (expense), net 13,228 N/M % (1,490 ) N/M % (2,837 ) Segment earnings before income taxes $ 483,267 28.1 % $ 377,305 (3.2 )% $ 389,893 N/M Not meaningful 32 Foreign currency impact on results Our Canada segment (as stated in USD) benefited from a 6% year over year increase in the value of the CAD against the USD in 2006 versus 2005. Similarly, the Canada segment benefited from a 7% year over year increase in the value of CAD against USD in 2005 versus 2004. Net sales For the 53 weeks ended December 31, 2006, sales volume in Canada increased by 11.1% to 8.3 million barrels versus prior year volume of 7.5 million barrels for the fiscal period beginning February 9, 2005 and ended December 25, 2005. On a pro forma basis, sales volume increased 1.6% to 8.3 million barrels versus 2005 pro forma volume of 8.1 million. The 53rd week in 2006 accounted for approximately 130 thousand barrels, providing the year over year increase. On a pro forma basis, Molson strategic brands grew at mid single digit rates, lead by Coors Light, Rickards and our partner import brands, all of which grew at double digit rates on a full year basis. These increases were partially offset by declines in unsupported brands and other premium brands, reductions in contract packaging of non owned brands for export shipment and the discontinuation of Molson Kick and A Marca Bavaria. On a full year basis, 2006 net sales revenue grew $266.3 million or 17.4% versus prior year. On a comparable, pro forma basis, net sales revenue grew $165.9 million or 10.2% with approximately 1% growth in local currency on a per barrel basis. For the full year, net sales revenue was $216.57 per barrel, an increase of 8.4% over comparable 2005 net sales revenue of $199.77 per barrel. An approximate 6% appreciation in the value of CAD against USD during the year increased net sales revenue by approximately $115 million. The remainder of the increase was driven by the year over year impact of modest general price increases and improved sales mix from increased import sales, which are at higher than average retail prices. These improvements were partially offset by increased price discounting during the year, predominantly in Ontario and Qubec. For the year ended December 25, 2005, pro forma net sales were $1.6 billion, 6.5% higher than the comparable period in the prior year. Net sales revenue per barrel grew slightly in local currency for the year ended December 25, 2005, driven by modest general price increases offset by unfavorable product mix. Net unfavorable sales mix was driven by value segment growth, primarily in Ontario and Alberta, which was partially offset by improved import sales at higher than average sale prices. Canada segment net sales volume for the year ended December 25, 2005, decreased 1.1% to 8.2 million barrels on a comparable pro forma basis from 2004. The decrease was driven by volume declines in the first quarter, partially offset by strong industry volume trends and improved sales activity and market performance over the balance of 2005. Cost of goods sold and gross profit Cost of goods sold increased $92.8 million, or 11.7%, in 2006 versus prior year. On a comparable, pro forma basis, cost of goods sold increased $65.4 million or 8.0%, decreasing slightly less than 1% on a per barrel basis in local currency. Cost of goods sold was $106.7 per barrel, an increase of 6.2% over 2005s pro forma cost of goods sold of $100.43 per barrel. After adjusting for the approximate 6% appreciation in the value of CAD against USD, cost of goods sold decreased by slightly less than 1% in 2006 in local currency. Inflationary cost increases across nearly all inputs drove approximately 3% increase in cost of goods sold per barrel. These and other cost increases were completely offset by implementation of synergies and other cost savings initiatives, lower input costs related to favorable foreign currency, and lower employee related expenses in 33 2006. Finally, a 1% reduction was due to a $4 million benefit in the fourth quarter of 2006 related to a one time non cash adjustment of certain foreign currency positions to their market values. On a pro forma basis, cost of goods sold increased 5.9% to $818.3 million for the year ended December 25, 2005, from $772.5 million in the same period for 2004. For the same period, in local currency, cost of goods sold per barrel in Canada decreased as synergy and other cost savings were offset by unfavorable product mix. Marketing, general and administrative expenses Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased $62.4 million for 2006. This is an increase of $14.5 million or 3.4% on a comparable, pro forma basis. In local currency, total marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately 3.5% due to lower promotional spending and brand investments in 2006, due in part to cycling of the promotional launch of Molson Kick and A Marca Bavaria in 2005, and partly to offset price discounting. These costs were partially offset by higher employee expenses and one time costs in 2006, including incremental spending as a result of the additional week in 2006 results. On a pro forma basis, marketing, general and administrative expenses increased 24.2% to $425.5 million for 2005, from $342.6 million in the same period for 2004. Canada increased 2005 marketing and sales spending at a high single digit growth rate. In local currency general and administrative costs increased due to higher depreciation, increased employee costs and non recurring items, partially offset by Merger related synergies. Special items, net There were no special items in 2006. Special items, net of $5.2 million in 2005 were attributable primarily to restructuring the sales and marketing organizations in Canada. On a pro forma basis, special items, net in 2004 of $20.4 million were Merger related, and therefore did not recur in 2005. Other (expense) income, net In 2006, other income increased $15.4 million over the prior year. On a pro forma basis other income increased $14.7 million over the prior year or $16.8 million in local currency. Other income primarily represents equity earnings and amortization expense related to the Montral Canadiens hockey club (the Club), which improved over the prior year. During the year, the entities which control and own a majority of the Club purchased the preferred shares in the Club held by Molson. In addition, Molson was released from a direct guarantee associated with the Clubs debt financing, and as a result of the reduction in our financial risk profile, we have re evaluated our remaining guarantee liabilities, specifically under the NHL Consent Agreement and the Bell Centre land lease guarantees, resulting in an approximate $9.0 million income benefit associated with the reduction in the exposure attributable to such guarantees. Other expense in 2005 represents the equity losses in the Montral Canadiens Hockey Club. 34 United States Segment The United States (U.S.) segment produces, markets, and sells the Coors and Molson portfolios of brands in the United States and its territories and includes the results of the Rocky Mountain Metal Corporation (RMMC) and Rocky Mountain Bottle Corporation (RMBC) joint ventures consolidated under FIN 46R. The U.S. segment also includes Coors brand volume that is sold in Mexico and the Caribbean. Fiscal year ended December 31, 2006(1) % change December 25, 2005 % change December 26, 2004 (In thousands, except percentages) Volume in barrels(2) 23,471 3.6 % 22,645 2.6 % 22,068 Net sales $ 2,619,879 5.9 % $ 2,474,956 4.0 % $ 2,380,193 Cost of goods sold (1,645,598 ) 7.9 % (1,525,060 ) 4.3 % (1,462,373 ) Gross profit 974,281 2.6 % 949,896 3.5 % 917,820 Marketing, general and administrative expenses (744,795 ) 0.7 % (739,315 ) 0.5 % (735,529 ) Special items, net (73,652 ) N/M (68,081 ) N/M Operating income 155,834 9.4 % 142,500 (21.8 )% 182,291 Other income (expense), net(3) 3,238 N/M (457 ) N/M 19,924 Segment earnings before income taxes(4) $ 159,072 12.0 % $ 142,043 (29.8 )% $ 202,215 N/M Not meaningful (1) 53 weeks included in 2006 versus 52 weeks in 2004 2005. (2) Volumes represent net sales of owned brands. (3) Consists primarily of gains from sales of non operating assets, water rights, a royalty settlement and equity share of Molson USA losses in 2004. (4) Earnings before income taxes in 2006, 2005 and 2004 includes $16,262 thousand, $12,679 thousand and $13,015 thousand, respectively, of the minority owners share of income attributable to the RMBC and RMMC joint ventures. Net sales Sales volume to wholesalers grew 3.6% in 2006 compared to 2005. Without the 53rd week in 2006, volume growth would have been approximately 2.2%. The growth was driven by low single digit growth for the Coors Light brand, high single digit growth of Keystone Light, and double digit growth of the Blue Moon brand. Excluding our Caribbean business, which was impacted by a weak economy and a new sales tax enacted in Puerto Rico during the year, our 50 states sales to retail (STRs) grew 3.7% from a year ago. Coors Light achieved its seventh consecutive quarter of total channel U.S. growth and grew share in the grocery and convenience store channels (according to external retail sales data reports). This continued volume momentum was driven by building our brand equities, through our Coors Light advertising Rocky Mountain Cold Refreshment focus, as well as better alignment with our distributor network and improving our effectiveness with chain retail accounts. Net sales per barrel increased 2.1% in 2006 due to higher base pricing and reduced discounting compared to the level of price promotion activity we experienced during 2005. However, the overall industry environment continues to be challenging, as price realization for the major brewers continues to 35 lag inflation. In addition, product mix was slightly unfavorable due primarily to the volume increases in our Keystone brands in 2006. Full year U.S. sales volume increased in 2005 versus 2004, driven by volume increases in the Coors Light, Keystone Light and Blue Moon brands, and the addition of Molson brands sold in the United States that were included in U.S. results following the Merger. Net sales per barrel increased 1.3% from 2004 to 2005. We experienced favorable gross pricing in 2005, partially offset by significant price promotions and coupon activity in key markets. These pricing factors accounted for approximately one half of the increase in revenue per barrel, while the balance of the revenue per barrel growth was due primarily to collection of fuel surcharges from customers and higher sales of import brands through company owned distributorships. Cost of goods sold Cost of goods sold per barrel increased by 4.1% to $70.11 per barrel in 2006 versus $67.35 per barrel in 2005. The net increase in Cost of goods sold was driven by four primary factors: Inflationary increases across nearly all facets of our operations, including packaging materials, freight rates, fuel and various components of labor and labor related costs, resulted in an approximate 5% increase in cost of goods per barrel. Approximately three quarters of those inflationary increases are attributable to commodities, with the balance attributable to labor and labor related increases. Innovative promotional packaging initiatives that are helping to drive sales of Coors Light and other brands resulted in approximately 1% of the increase. These include our plastic bottle cooler box, cold wrap bottle, and frost brew can liner. Certain initiatives that will yield lower costs in future years resulted in temporarily higher costs in 2006 and accounted for approximately 1% of the total increase. These initiatives included costs related to temporary process changes and new contract packaging and freight arrangements related to closing our Memphis brewery in September 2006. Savings from our operations cost initiatives and Merger synergies reduced costs of goods sold per barrel by 3% and offset approximately half of the total inflation cost increases during the year. Cost of goods sold per barrel increased by 1.6% to $67.35 per barrel in 2005 from $66.27 per barrel in 2004. The increase in cost of goods sold per barrel was driven by higher freight, diesel fuel, packaging materials, and utilities costs. Inflation alone would have accounted for an increase of approximately 4% in cost of goods per barrel. However, these unfavorable factors were partially offset by favorable cost trends from supply chain cost management, labor productivity and Merger synergies. Marketing, general and administrative expenses Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased by $5.5 million, or 0.7%, in 2006 versus 2005. Our stock based long term incentive program primarily drove the year over year increase, along with modest increases in our advertising and sales expenses. The total increase was partially offset by reductions of certain overhead and personnel related costs. Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased by $3.8 million, or 0.5%, in 2005 versus 2004. Increased spending on sales capabilities were partially offset by lower general and administrative overhead costs. 36 Special items, net Special items, net in the U.S. segment in 2006 were associated primarily with the closure and sale of the Memphis brewery, completed in the third quarter of 2006. We recorded approximately $60 million in accelerated depreciation on brewery assets and impairments of fixed assets, reflecting their sales value, $12.5 million for accruals of severance and other costs associated with the plant closure, and a $3.1 million increase in the estimate of costs to withdraw from a multi employer pension plan benefiting former Memphis workers. Memphis related accelerated depreciation was higher in 2006 than in 2005 due to a lower sales price for the Memphis plant than our estimate in 2005. The 2006 special items were partially offset by the receipt of a $2.4 million cash distribution from bankruptcy proceedings of a former insurance carrier for a claim related to our environmental obligations at the Lowry Superfund site in Denver, Colorado. We recorded the cash receipt as a special benefit consistent with the classification of the charge recorded in a previous year. The estimated environmental liability associated with this site was not impacted by the proceeds received. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion. Special items, net in the U.S. segment in 2005 were associated primarily with the planned closure of the Memphis brewery in 2006. We recorded $33.3 million in accelerated depreciation on brewery assets, $3.2 million in direct impairments of assets, $1.7 million for accruals of severance and associated benefits, and $25.0 million representing an estimate of costs to withdraw from a multi employer pension plan for Memphis workers. We recorded an additional $4.9 million of restructuring charges associated with restructuring brewery operations in Golden, Colorado. Other income (expense), net Other income was higher in 2006 versus 2005 primarily due to the recognition of a portion of a previously deferred gain on the sale of real estate. This amount was recognized in the second quarter of 2006 upon the satisfaction of certain conditions pertaining to the sale contract. Other income was lower in 2005 versus 2004, primarily due to two factors in 2004: $11.7 million of gains on the sale of non operating real estate and $8.3 million of royalties in 2004 related to a coal mine previously owned by Coors. 37 Europe Segment The Europe segment consists of our production and sale of the CBL brands principally in the United Kingdom, our joint venture arrangement for the production and distribution of Grolsch in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland (consolidated under FIN 46R beginning in 2004), factored brand sales (beverage brands owned by other companies but sold and delivered to retail by us) and our joint venture arrangement with DHL for the distribution of products throughout Great Britain (Tradeteam). Our Europe segment also includes a small volume of sales in Asia and other export markets.

(4) Earnings before income taxes in 2006, 2005 and 2004 includes $5,824 thousand ($4,051 thousand, net of tax), $5,798 thousand ($4,191 thousand, net of tax) and $6,854 thousand ($4,798 thousand, net of tax), respectively, of the minority owners share of income attributable to the Grolsch joint venture. Foreign currency impact on results Our Europe segment results were positively affected by a 1% year over year increase in the value of the British Pound Sterling (GBP or ) against USD in 2006. Conversely, the Europe segment was adversely affected by a 0.5% year over year increase in the value of the GBP against USD in 2005. Net sales Net sales for the Europe segment decreased by 5.0% in 2006, while volume increased by 0.6%. The 53rd week in 2006 contributed approximately 140 thousand barrels of sales volume, providing the year over year increase. Net sales in local currency decreased by approximately 6.5%. The 52 week volume decline was driven by premium lagers, flavored alcohol beverages (FABs) and ales. This decline was partially offset by growth of the Carling brand. CBLs overall volume increase for the year drove a slight market share increase for the company versus an overall industry decline. 38 Beer volume in our on premise business, which represents approximately two thirds of our Europe volume and an even greater proportion of our margin, declined by slightly more than 2% compared to 2005. This compared to an overall industry on premise channel decline of 4.3% yielding a small market share gain for CBL. Our off premise volume for 2006 increased by approximately 2% over 2005, with Carling accounting for most of the gain. We experienced a small off premise market share decline in 2006. In addition to the volume trends mentioned above, we experienced unfavorable pricing in both the on premise and the off premise channels and a decrease in the sales value of factored brands. These reductions were compounded by unfavorable channel and brand mix. In addition, net sales were impacted by lower factored brand sales resulting from a change in our trading arrangements with one major factored brand customer requiring us to move from gross reporting of sales and cost of goods sold to a net presentation for that customer, which caused a year over year reduction in both net sales and cost of goods sold of approximately $46 million from 2005, but with no net impact on gross profit. Net sales for the Europe segment decreased 19.5% in 2005, while volume decreased 2.9% from the previous year. The volume decline was driven by the Grolsch brand, flavored alcohol beverages (FABs) and ales. This decline was partially offset by growth of the Carling brand. CBLs overall volume decline for the year was slightly worse than the overall market decline. Beer volume in our on premise business declined by 2% in 2005 compared to 2004. This compared to an overall industry on premise channel decline of nearly 4% in the year, yielding a small market share gain for us. Our off premise volume for 2005 decreased approximately 2% over 2004, resulting in a small off premise market share decline for us. As in 2006, in addition to the volume trends mentioned above, we experienced unfavorable pricing in both the on premise and the off premise channels, as well as a decrease in the sales value of factored brands. These reductions were further compounded by unfavorable channel and brand mix. The change in our trading arrangements with one major factored brand customer in 2005 caused a year over year reduction in both net sales and cost of goods sold of $243.4 million from 2004, but with no net impact on gross profit. Owned brand net sales in local currency per barrel decreased approximately 2% in 2005 when compared to 2004. Cost of goods sold Cost of goods sold per barrel in local currency decreased approximately 6% in 2006 versus 2005. The change to net reporting for certain factored brand sales (described above) accounted for approximately $46 million of the decrease in the year to date cost of goods sold. The remaining decrease was driven by cost savings from our supply chain restructuring initiatives begun in 2005 and lower distribution costs, partly offset by increased energy costs. Cost of goods sold decreased 22.6% in 2005 versus 2004. The cost of goods sold decrease in local currency was driven by the change in trading arrangements with one major factored brand customer mentioned above combined with a mix shift away from glass packaged products which have higher packaging costs. These reductions were partially offset by the de leveraging of fixed costs, higher distribution costs and increased energy costs. Marketing, general and administrative expenses Europe marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased by 6.9% with a per barrel decrease of 7.4% in 2006 versus 2005. The decrease was primarily the result of cost reduction initiatives we announced and began implementing during 2005 and rigorous cost control throughout the year. 39 In 2005, Europe marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased 3.8%, and 1.0% on a per barrel basis versus 2004. This decrease was primarily the result of lower overhead, sales and marketing and payroll related spending in response to profit challenges presented by lower revenue per barrel. Special items, net In 2006, special items, net of $9.0 million are a combination of $13.0 million employee termination costs associated with the U.K. supply chain and back office restructuring efforts and $1.3 million costs associated with exiting the Russia market, offset by a $5.3 million pension curtailment gain. The pension curtailment reflects reductions in headcount from restructuring efforts and is discussed further in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. In 2005, special items, net consisted of $14.3 million for employee termination costs and $3.0 million of income associated with disposals of long lived assets, consisting of $6.5 million from gains on sales of assets and a one time development profit on real estate formerly held by the company, offset by asset impairment charges of $3.5 million. Also included in 2005 are $2.5 million of exit costs associated with the closure of our Russia and Taiwan offices. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion. The special items in 2004 represented the profit on sale of real estate. Other (expense) income, net Other income of $4.8 million represents a $19.0 million improvement over 2005, driven by improved Tradeteam profitability, our joint venture partner for the distribution of product, profits on the sale of surplus real estate and lower non operating leasehold expenses. The decline in other income in 2005 from 2004 reflects declining Tradeteam operating performance and increased non operating leasehold expenses. Interest income Interest income is earned on trade loans to U.K. on premise customers. Interest income decreased by 9.9% and 19.0% in 2006 and 2005, respectively, as a result of lower loan balances versus the prior years. 40 Corporate Corporate includes interest and certain other general and administrative costs that are not allocated to the operating segments. The majority of these corporate costs relates to worldwide finance and administrative functions, such as corporate affairs, legal, human resources, insurance and risk management.

(4) Loss before income taxes in 2006, 2005 and 2004 includes $9,023 thousand, $7,472 thousand and $1,595 thousand, respectively, of the minority owners share of interest expense attributable to debt obligations of the RMMC and BRI joint ventures. Marketing, general and administrative expenses Corporate marketing, general and administrative expenses in 2006 were $120.2 million, up $34.5 million from 2005. This increase is a result of a number of factors, including 1) $20 million related to increased incentive pay, split equally between our stock based long term incentive plan, including the effect of adopting FAS123R accounting treatment for expensing equity based compensation, and higher incentive pay resulting from improved profit and cash performance; 2) $7 million related to investments in projects designed to deliver further cost reductions. These initiatives are designed to improve and standardize systems, processes and structure across the areas of operations, information technology, finance and human resources; 3) approximately $11 million due to the full ramp up of new and ongoing costs to build strong corporate center capabilities, which include Sarbanes Oxley compliance, corporate governance, finance, legal, commercial development and human resources, the transfer of global costs from operating segments to the Corporate center, and severance payments; and 4) approximately $1 million related to the 53rd week. These increases were partially offset by $4 million reduction in legal fees resulting from the favorable completion of several major disputes. 41 Marketing, general and administrative (MG&A) expenses were higher in 2005 versus 2004, primarily due to establishing the new global organization and headquarters, significant legal fees, information technology projects, and a reallocation of certain MG&A costs from segments to Corporate to directly support the business units long term operating efficiency programs and other strategic objectives. Special items, net The Corporate segment recognized special items, net of $5.3 million and special items, net of $58.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, and December 25, 2005, respectively. The 2006 net credit was a result of evaluating the December 31, 2006 ending MCBC stock price versus the stock option floor price on stock options held by former Coors officers who left the Company under change in control agreements following the Merger offset by associated additional payroll related taxes to be paid on behalf of a former Coors officer that exercised stock options under the change in control agreement. The 2005 charges were associated with 1) $31.8 million of severance and other benefits paid to 12 former Coors officers who exercised change in control rights, 2) $6.9 million were a result of providing an exercise price floor under stock options, including additional payroll related taxes to be paid on behalf of a former Coors officer that exercised stock options under the change in control agreement associated with these potential awards, 3) $14.6 million of severance and share based compensation and benefits paid to two former Molson officers who left the Company during the second quarter of 2005 following the Merger, and 4) $5.0 million of Merger related costs that did not qualify for capitalization under purchase accounting. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Interest expense, net Interest expense, net was $138.5 million during 2006, versus $126.6 million during 2005. Interest expense, net increased due to higher interest rates on permanent financing (as opposed to short term temporary financing in place through September 2005 following the Merger), 53rd week impact and a stronger Canadian dollar and British Pound Sterling. These increased costs were partially offset by the benefit of lower overall debt levels due to debt repayments in 2006. Interest expense, net nearly doubled in 2005, compared to 2004 due to the addition of Merger related debt including debt assumed on Molsons opening balance sheet which approximated $1.5 billion. (See related Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8). Other income (expense), net Other expense, net in 2006 includes primarily foreign exchange losses, while the other income, net in 2005 includes primarily foreign exchange gains. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities, external borrowings and asset monetizations. As of December 31, 2006 and December 25, 2005, we had working capital deficits of $341.8 million and $768.4 million, respectively. We commonly operate at working capital deficits given the relatively quick turnover of our receivables and inventory. Decreased current liabilities accounted for most of the decrease in working capital deficit for 2006 versus 2005, especially with regard to the current portion of long term debt and discontinued operations. Current portion of long term debt at December 31, 2006, and December 25, 2005 was $4.0 million and $334.1 million, respectively, balances which reflect significant repayments during 2006. We had total cash of $182.2 million at December 31, 2006, compared to $39.4 million at December 25, 2005. The higher balances at year end 2006 reflect excess cash accumulated following the repayment during 2006 of debt obligations eligible for normal, scheduled repayment. Long term debt was $2,129.8 million and $2,136.7 million at December 31, 2006, and December 25, 2005, 42 respectively. Remaining debt as of the end of 2006 consists primarily of bonds with longer term maturities. We believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by short term borrowings, when necessary, will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditures. However, our liquidity could be impacted significantly by a decrease in demand for our products, which could arise from competitive circumstances, a decline in the acceptability of alcohol beverages or any of the other factors we describe in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities of $833.2 million for the 53 weeks ended December 31, 2006, improved by $411.0 million from the 52 week period ending December 25, 2005. Net income was higher by $226.1 million in 2006 versus 2005, the reasons for which are discussed in detail in the Results of Operations discussion in this section. However, much of the improvement in operating cash flow from 2005 to 2006 was due to a number of unfavorable items in 2005. Cash paid for income taxes was lower by $162.7 million during 2006 versus 2005. During the second quarter of 2005, we made a $138 million Canadian tax payment that was driven by the Merger, a one time liquidity event that was not repeated in 2006. Our pension funding in 2006 was lower by $55.1 million primarily due to a special voluntary funding to the U.S. plan in 2005. Merger related costs of $21 million were paid out subsequent to the Merger in the first quarter of 2005 by our Molson business in Canada (costs which had been accrued on the opening balance sheet as of the merger date), representing a unique cash outflow not experienced in 2006. We also made payments to officers under change in control and severance agreements of $24 million in 2005. The remaining improvement in operating cash flow from 2005 to 2006 is due primarily to Molsons Canadian business being included in 2006 for the full 53 weeks versus 45 weeks in 2005, given the merger date of February 9, 2005. We believe that our cash flow from operating activities in 2006 is more indicative of future performance than the comparable period of 2005, given the number of unusual cash outflows occurring in 2005. Coincident with the sale of the Memphis brewery in September 2006, we have incurred a $28.1 million liability for the estimated payment required for our withdrawal from the hourly workers multi employer pension plan. We expect to pay approximately $2.4 million through 10 monthly installments in late 2006 and 2007 and then pay the remaining $25.7 million in one lump sum payment in September 2007. Our net cash provided by operating activities in 2005 was $422 million, a decrease of $78 million from 2004. The addition of Molsons Canadian beer business made a significant positive contribution to our operating cash flow. However, there were several items that offset this increase. First, in early 2005 we made a $138 million Canadian tax payment triggered by the Merger but previously deferred by Molson. Our total tax expense for the year was only $50 million, and there were additional tax payments to other governmental authorities in addition to the $138 million. Second, we funded $202 million into our defined benefit pension plans in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, compared with expense associated with these plans of $65 million. Finally, operating cash flow in 2005 also diminished because of unfavorable operating profit in the Europe segment, and severance and change in control payments to officers who departed the Company following the Merger. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities of $294.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, was lower by $17.9 million compared to the same period in 2005. Additions to properties were higher in 2006 by $40.3 million as compared to 2005, due primarily to spending in Canada and the U.S. related to the build out of the Moncton, New Brunswick and Shenandoah, Virginia breweries. In 2006, we recognized proceeds of $68.0 million on the sale of 68% of the Kaiser business in Brazil, offset by $4.2 million of transaction costs. In December 2006, we collected proceeds of $15.7 million as a result of the exercise of our put 43 option related to our remaining 15% ownership of the Kaiser business in Brazil. Proceeds from sales of properties and intangible assets were lower by $13.3 million year over year. 2005 proceeds included a significant collection of a note related to a 2004 sale of property in the U.K. causing proceeds to exceed 2006 levels, which included the sale of the Memphis plant in the U.S. and various real estate sales in the U.K. On June 30, 2006, as part of a general refinancing of the Montral Canadiens Hockey team (the Club), Molson sold its preferred equity interest in the Montral Canadiens hockey club to entities which control and own a majority interest in the Club. Total proceeds coincident with the transaction were CAD $41.6 million (USD $36.5 million). We retain a 19.9% common equity interest in the Club as well as board representation. The transaction structure is consistent with our long term commitment to the Team and its success, and helps to ensure the teams long term presence in Montral. Net cash used in investing activities in 2005 was $313 million, compared to $67 million in 2004. Capital expenditures were higher by $195 million in 2005 due to the inclusion of Molsons Canada segment capital expenditures of $107 million following the Merger, and spending in the United States related to the build out of the Shenandoah facility to a full brewery. We also spent $16.5 million in 2005 to acquire Creemore Springs, a small brewery in Canada, and spent $20.4 million on transaction costs associated with the Merger. These factors were offset by the favorable impact of acquiring $73.5 million in cash with the Merger, the collection of a $35.0 million note receivable related to a sale of real estate in the U.K. and collecting a net $17 million on trade loan activity in the U.K. Cash used in investing activities in 2004, which was prior to the merger, reflected capital expenditures of the U.S. and Europe segments only, proceeds from the sale of kegs in the U.K. and sales of real estate in both the U.S. and U.K., and a pension settlement received in 2004 from the former owners of CBL. Also, we presented as an investing activity the inclusion of the opening cash balances of the joint ventures we began consolidating during the first quarter of 2004 as a result of the implementation of FIN 46R. Financing Activities Our debt position significantly affects our financing activity. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for a summary of our debt position at December 31, 2006 and December 25, 2005. Net cash used for financing activities was $401.2 million for 2006 compared to $188.8 million of cash used in financing activities during 2005. Net repayments of debt were approximately $356.2 million for 2006, encompassing all activity in our various debt and credit facilities (including those associated with discontinued operations). Net repayments of debt during 2005 were approximately $108.9 million (including those associated with discontinued operations). The increased levels of debt repayment were due primarily to higher level of operating cash flows generated by the business in 2006 versus 2005. Proceeds from stock option exercises in 2006 were $83.3 million exceeding 2005 exercises by $28.1 million. Proceeds in 2006 were impacted by significant exercises of stock options during the fourth quarter. Net cash used in financing activities was $188.8 million in 2005, compared to $335.7 million in 2004. During 2005, we paid dividends to stockholders of $110.0 million, compared to $30.5 million in 2004, as a result of increased shares outstanding and a revised dividend policy following the Merger. The large increase in our balance sheet debt from $932 million at year end 2004 to $2,485 million at year end 2005 was largely the result of the assumption of Molsons outstanding debt as of the Merger date (February 9, 2005). This debt assumed included borrowings Molson incurred prior to the Merger to pay the special dividends on Molson stock before the Merger. Substantially all of our debt pay down occurred after the Merger date. Also, we collected approximately $11 million less cash in 2005 versus 2004 as a result of stock option exercises. 44 Capital Resources See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, for a complete discussion and presentation of all borrowings and available sources of borrowing, including lines of credit. The vast majority of our remaining debt borrowings as of December 31, 2006, consist of publicly traded notes totaling $1,918.0 million principal amount, with maturities ranging from 2010 to 2015. Our remaining debt other than the notes consists of various notes payable of $215.9 million at consolidated joint ventures, which mature in 2011 and 2013. While we will continue to use commercial paper borrowings, if necessary, to manage our liquidity through our periods of lower operating cash flow in early 2007, we expect to reach a point in mid 2007 when we will need to consider different alternatives for the use of cash generated. We expect to take a balanced approach to our alternatives in 2007 and beyond, which could include funding of defined benefit pension plans, prepayments of consolidated joint venture debt obligations, modest purchases of company stock and preserving cash flexibility for potential growth investments. Any purchases of MCBC stock on the open market would require a board approved plan, which does not currently exist. In August 2006, the available amount of the $1.4 billion revolving multicurrency bank credit facility was reduced to $750 million, and the expiration date was extended to August 2011. At December 31, 2006, there were no borrowings outstanding against the facility. There were no other significant changes in our short or long term borrowings. Credit Rating As of February 16, 2007, our credit rating with Standard & Poors and Moodys with regard to our long term debt was BBB and Baa2, respectively. If the long term debt ratings were to drop, consequently affecting our short term rating, our access to the commercial paper market for shorter term borrowings could be unfavorably impacted, resulting in either higher interest rates or an inability to borrow through commercial paper at all. We had no commercial paper borrowings at December 31, 2006. Capital Expenditures In 2006, we spent approximately $446.3 million (including approximately $29.3 million spent at consolidated joint ventures) on capital improvement projects worldwide. Of this, approximately 64% was in support of the U.S. segment, with the remainder split between the Canadian (21%), European (14%) and Corporate (1%) segments. The capital expenditure plan for 2007 is expected to be approximately $320 million, including approximately $46 million of spending by consolidated joint ventures. 2007 capital spending is expected to be lower than 2006 primarily due to the planned completion of the Shenandoah brewery in early 2007. Our CBL business uses kegs managed by a logistics provider who is responsible for providing an adequate stock of kegs as well as their upkeep. Due to greater than anticipated keg losses as well as reduced fill fees (attributable to reduced overall volume), the logistics provider has encountered financial difficulty. As a result of action taken by the logistics providers lending institution, related to perceived financial difficulties of the borrower, the logistics provider has been forced into administration (restructuring proceedings) and the bank, on February 20, 2007, exercised its option to put the keg population to CBL. As a result, we expect to purchase the existing keg population from the logistics providers lender at fair value pursuant to the terms of the agreement between CBL and the logistics providers lender. We estimate that this potential capital expenditure, which may be financed over a period of time in excess of one year, could amount to approximately $70 million to $100 million, which is not included in the capital expenditures plan of $320 million provided above. As a result of this capital requirement, we may reduce other elements of our 2007 capital expenditures plan, or offset risk posed by the potential keg purchase through increased cash generation efforts. 45 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Contractual Cash Obligations as of December 31, 2006 Payments due by period Total amounts committed Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years (In thousands) Long term debt, including current maturities(1) $ 2,134,286 $ 4,441 $ 8,020 $ 492,097 $ 1,629,728 Interest payments(2) 763,370 124,089 247,197 220,693 171,391 Derivative payments(2) 1,804,663 95,812 191,623 485,886 1,031,342 Retirement plan expenditures(3) 457,948 236,775 50,403 51,202 119,568 Operating leases 289,197 61,293 91,720 58,708 77,476 Capital leases(4) 2,083 1,162 921 Other long term obligations(5) 5,686,612 1,483,588 2,062,211 1,600,308 540,505 Total obligations $ 11,138,159 $ 2,007,160 $ 2,652,095 $ 2,908,894 $ 3,570,010 (1) Refer to debt schedule in Note 13 for long term debt discussion. (2) The interest payments line includes interest on our bonds and other borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2006, excluding the cash flow impacts of any interest rate or cross currency swaps. Current floating interest rates and currency exchange rates are assumed to be constant throughout the periods presented. The derivative payments line includes the floating rate payment obligations, which are paid to counterparties under our interest rate and cross currency swap agreements, 530 million ($1,038 million at December 31, 2006 exchange rates) payment due to the cross currency swap counterparty in 2012, and $300 million (CAD $350 million at December 31, 2006 exchange rates) payment due to the cross currency swap counterparty in 2010. Current floating interest rates and currency exchange rates are assumed to be constant throughout the periods presented. We will be receiving a total of $1,493 million in fixed and floating rate payments from our counterparties under the swap agreements, which offset the payments included in the table. As interest rates increase, payments to or receipts from our counterparties will also increase. Net interest payments, including swap receipts and payments, over the periods presented are as follows (in thousands): Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years $ 1,075,320 $ 136,576 $ 272,169 $ 261,814 $ 404,761 (3) Represents expected contributions under our defined benefit pension plans in the next twelve months and our benefits payments under retiree medical plans for all periods presented. (4) Includes a U.K. sale leaseback included in a global information services agreement signed with Electronic Data Systems (EDS) late in 2003, effective January 2004. The EDS contract includes services to our Canada, U.S. and U.K. operations and our corporate office and, unless extended, will expire in 2010. (5) Approximately $3,781 million of the total other long term obligations relate to long term supply contracts with third parties to purchase raw material and energy used in production, including our contract with Graphic Packaging Corporation, a related party, dated March 25, 2003. Approximately $662 million relates to commitments associated with Tradeteam in the United Kingdom. The remaining amounts relate to sales and marketing, information technology services, open purchase orders and other commitments. 46 Other Commercial Commitments as of December 31, 2006 Amount of commitment expiration per period Total amounts committed Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years (In thousands) Standby letters of credit $ 55,353 54,368 985 Advertising and Promotions As of December 31, 2006, our aggregate commitments for advertising and promotions, including marketing at sports arenas, stadiums and other venues and events, total approximately $951.8 million over the next five years and thereafter. Our advertising and promotions commitments are included in other long term obligations in the table above. Pension Plans Our consolidated, unfunded pension position at the end of 2006 was approximately $359 million, a decrease of $441 million from the end of 2005. The funded positions of pension plans in each of the Canada, U.S. and U.K. improved due to improved asset returns, higher interest rates (which have the effect of decreasing the discounted pension liabilities), contributions to the plans, plan changes and reductions in U.K. staffing levels. Approximately $12 million of the underfunded pension position at the end of 2006 was the responsibility of the minority owners of BRI. See discussion below regarding the adoption of SFAS No. 158 Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). We fund pension plans to meet the minimum requirements set forth in applicable employee benefits laws. Sometimes we voluntarily increase funding levels to meet expense and asset return forecasts in any given year. Pension contributions on a consolidated basis were $155 million in 2006, reflecting statutory contribution levels in Canada and the United Kingdom, and $23 million of voluntary contributions in the United States. We anticipate making approximately $185 million of both statutory and voluntary contributions to our pension plans in 2007. Consolidated pension expense was $33 million in 2006, a decrease of $32 million from 2005. Decreases in the U.S. and U.K. of $12 million and $13 million, respectively, were attributable mainly to higher expected returns on plan assets in 2006 and a pension curtailment in the U.K. As a result of employee restructuring activities associated with the Europe segment supply chain operations, a pension curtailment was recognized in the second quarter of 2006. The curtailment triggered a remeasurement of the pension assets and liabilities as of April 30, 2006. Additionally, as a result of the curtailment, a gain of $5.3 million was recognized and presented as a special item in the statement of operations in the second quarter of 2006. This gain arose from the reduction in estimated future working lifetimes of plan participants resulting in the acceleration of the recognition of a prior service benefit. This prior service benefit was generated by plan changes in previous years and was deferred on the balance sheet and amortized into earnings over the then expected working lifetime of plan participants of approximately 10 years. In addition, this curtailment event required a remeasurement of the projected benefit obligation and plan assets, which resulted in an $11.8 million reduction in the projected benefit obligation at April 30, 2006 (See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8), which was recognized in other comprehensive income in the second quarter of 2006. We anticipate pension expense on a consolidated basis for 2007 to approximate $9 million. This lower expense amount for 2007, when compared to 2006, reflects an estimated pension benefit from the U.K. pension plan of approximately $19 million for 2007. 47 Postretirement Benefit Plans Our consolidated, unfunded postretirement benefit position at the end of 2006 was approximately $402 million, an increase of $25 million from the end of 2005. Benefits paid under our postretirement benefit plans were approximately $22 million in 2006 and in 2005. Under our postretirement benefit plans we expect payments of approximately $24 million in 2007. See discussion below regarding the adoption of SFAS No. 158 Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). Consolidated postretirement benefit expense was $35 million in 2006, an increase of $10 million from 2005, attributable mainly to our Canada segment plans. We anticipate postretirement benefit expense on a consolidated basis for 2007 of approximately $31 million. Contingencies In the ordinary course of business or in the course of the sale of a business, we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify third parties from any losses or guarantees incurred relating to pre existing conditions for losses or guarantees arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract, which may include, for example, litigation or claims relating to past performance. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 under the captions Environmental, Indemnity Obligations Sale of Kaiser and Montral Canadiens. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2006, we did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements (as defined in Item 303(a) (4) (ii) of Regulation S K). Outlook for 2007 Canada Segment Consistent with our objective to be a brand led company, we have continued to build a consumer preferred portfolio. Our strategic brands grew at mid single digit rates during 2006, led by the continuation of double digit growth from Coors Light and our partner import portfolio. This represents the seventh straight quarter of volume and share growth for Coors Light across all sales regions in Canada. Rickards also has continued its solid growth trend, delivering double digit growth. We will leverage this momentum by applying a range of national and local programs to drive revenue growth in 2007. Our results for 2007 will face a challenging comparison late this year as we cycle the additional week of 2006 sales volume and corresponding profit in Canada. With regard to costs in Canada, we continue to pursue and achieve the original merger synergy targets and the development of the next phase of our cost reduction initiatives. These synergies and other cost savings successfully offset about half of our cost inflation in Canada in 2006. While we expect to continue to reduce the impact of inflation in 2007 with synergies and other cost savings, cost of goods sold is expected to increase at a low single digit rate per barrel in local currency. The increase is due to slightly higher expected labor expenses, lower foreign exchange benefits (associated with USD denominated costs of goods inputs) and the impact of cycling non recurring, non cash 2006 fourth quarter benefits. In addition to packaging materials, waste reduction, plant productivity and distribution savings, we are re organizing our selling, general and administrative functions beginning in January 2007. This reorganization initiative is focused on labor savings across all functions, along with reductions in other overhead expenses. The restructuring will cost approximately $9 million, most of which will be expensed in the first quarter of 2007, and is expected to have a payback period of slightly over one year. We expect continued competitive pressure in 2007, which calls for a balanced approach between long term strategic brand building and tactics to address short term competitive activity. In 2006, we redirected 48 some of our marketing spending to price promotion, particularly in Ontario and Qubec. In 2007, we plan to increase investment in our strategic brands, driving a low single digit increase in marketing and sales expenses. We will continue to implement initiatives to attack costs to help fund these investments and build the long term brand equities necessary to be successful in the Canada beer business. Brewing and or distribution agreements with other brewers contribute to our revenue and profitability. Miller Brewing Company has sued us to invalidate our licensing arrangement. We are contesting their claim, and currently are in discussions with Miller regarding a resolution of this dispute. However, there can be no assurances that we will arrive at such a resolution. A termination of this contract could result in an impairment of a significant portion of our intangible asset associated with the Miller arrangements, which has a carrying value of approximately $112.0 million at December 31, 2006. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we received notification from the Fosters Group (Fosters) that they intend to terminate our U.S. production arrangement with them. We contend that the termination notice is ineffective. A termination of this contract could result in an impairment of a significant portion of our distribution right intangible associated with the Fosters arrangement, which has a carrying value of approximately $25.0 million at December 31, 2006. More generally, the termination of partner brand agreements would have an unfavorable impact on the profitability of the Canada segment. Finally, the Canadian Dollar appreciated about 6% in 2006 against the U.S. dollar, providing a significant benefit to our full year earnings as measured in U.S. dollars. However, if the current trend toward weakening of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar continues, our 2007 Canada results could be negatively impacted when viewed in U.S. dollars. U.S. Segment Throughout 2006, the U.S. business built sales momentum by leveraging its key brand equities and taking a disciplined approach to market, resulting in volume growth for Coors Light, Keystone and Blue Moon. These brands will remain our primary focus in 2007, along with some additional focus on developing our regional brands. In 2007, we will continue to drive sales by building our key retail account business and furthering our alignment with our distributor network. In the first quarter of 2007, we again leveraged our Coors Light National Football League (NFL) sponsorship throughout the playoffs, and we expect our distributors to rebuild inventories of our products in preparation for peak season and the ramp up of our new Shenandoah, Virginia brewing capacity. On the other hand, we expect challenging economic conditions to continue to impact our volume trends in Puerto Rico. We expect our first quarter results in the U.S. to benefit from a greater than normal distributor inventory build from the low levels after the New Years holiday. The U.S. beer price environment improved during 2006. We have seen some progress on front line pricing in the past several months, and going forward we will continue to take a disciplined approach to both front line pricing and discounting, while building our core brand equities to drive growth. With regard to costs, we expect continued significant inflation challenges during 2007 in our U.S. business. Our first quarter cost of goods sold per barrel will increase because of higher commodity costs, including aluminum and agricultural inputs, partially offset by lower depreciation expense due to the combined effect of selling the Memphis brewery last year and not beginning to depreciate most of the Virginia brewing assets until the second quarter of this year. In response to these challenges, we are striving to maximize the benefits of our long term cost initiatives, especially merger synergy savings such as the closing of the Memphis brewery in September 2006 and the opening of our new brewery in Virginia before peak season 2007. Nonetheless, we do not currently expect the benefit of our cost initiatives to fully offset inflationary cost increases under the current outlook for commodities and other inputs. As a result, we expect U.S. cost of goods to increase at a low single digit rate in 2007, a somewhat smaller increase than in 2006. If aluminum, diesel fuel or other costs increase substantially, it could present a significant challenge to driving U.S. profit growth in 2007. 49 Europe Segment We were very successful in reducing costs and achieved total cost savings of more than $40 million in 2006, which were delivered well above our initial expectations and helped to offset the margin loss that our business sustained during the course of the year. This impressive work contributed substantially to our earnings performance in a very challenging 2006 market and is strengthening the competitive position of this business for the future. The competitive environment in the U.K. beer industry continues to be challenging with a difficult retail environment caused by pressure on consumer spending from increased taxes, interest rates and utility prices that have collectively impacted disposable incomes. Industry economics also continue to exert downward pressure on pricing, driven by retailer consolidation and supplier over capacity. The overall competitive environment in the U.K. is likely to worsen in 2007 as smoking bans are implemented in all of the country by mid year. Also, our cost savings opportunities are becoming smaller and more difficult to achieve versus the past two years. We have three main strategies to address these challenges: First, we implemented cost reduction initiatives during 2006, and will implement further initiatives during 2007. Early in 2007, we also anticipate a modest flow through of cost savings implemented in the first half of 2006. Cost savings will become less impactful as we lap the performance of 2006. Second, we will continue to invest heavily behind our core lager brands Carling, Grolsch and Coors Fine Light. We have increased advertising spending around Carling as part of our new marketing campaign and have received positive consumer feedback to our outdoor and television advertising. In 2006 we continued to expand Carling C2, including a launch into the U.K. off premise channel in the fourth quarter. C2 is a mid strength lager, that meets changing consumer preferences and lifestyles. Third, at retail we continue to roll out our new cold dispense technologies and distinctive above bar fonts. This rollout extends our cold platform beyond Carling for a broad group of our strategic brands as we aim to maintain our leadership in cold dispense. This leading retail innovation is driving sales with current retailers, along with increased distribution via new retail outlets. During 2006 we installed 14,000 cold dispense points, and have seen positive results in those outlets. We face an on premise smoking ban in three of our markets beginning in 2007: in Wales on April 2nd, in Northern Ireland on April 30th and in England on July 1st. We expect them to be detrimental to the on premise channel in the short term but potentially to increase the size of the off premise market as smokers adjust to the ban. This shift to the lower margin off premise channel likely will offset only a portion of the negative on premise volume and profit impact, so the overall impact on volume and margin will still be negative in 2007. Our experience in other markets has been that on premise sales usually recover at least partially in the years following the implementation of a local smoking ban. As a part of our ongoing cost reduction efforts across the organization, we expect to incur restructuring costs of approximately $13 million in 2007. These costs, which largely relate to employee severance, are expected to have a payback period of approximately one and a half years. Industry pricing continues to be the most important source of margin pressure in the U.K. beer business in both the on and off premise. The U.K. business is managing pricing by channel, in the context of local competition, while staying focused on our core strategy of building strong brands for the long term. Corporate We expect corporate marketing, general and administrative costs to be 15% to 20%, or $20 to $25 million, lower in 2007 partially resulting from aggressive cost reductions which began in the latter part of 2006, contributing $4 to $5 million of cost savings in 2007. In addition, we anticipate also benefiting from the elimination of approximately $17 million of costs due to 1) severance payments; 2) high legal fees 50 that are not expected to repeat in 2007 and 3) the elimination of certain incentive compensation plans and lower expected payments for ongoing plans. Approximately $8 million of costs that are in direct support of the operating segments will transfer into the respective segments in 2007, with the majority transferring to the U.S. segment. These cost reductions will be offset partially by increased spending related to investments in projects designed to deliver cost reductions across all business segments. Goodwill Because there is goodwill included in the carrying value of our three segments, the fair value of the applicable reporting unit was compared to its carrying value during the third quarter of 2006 to determine whether there was goodwill impairment. Most of the goodwill associated with the U.S. and Canada segments originated in the Merger. Similarly, we tested indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment during the third quarter of 2006, most of which relate to our Canada and Europe segments. A portion of the Merger goodwill was allocated to the U.S. segment, based on the level of Merger synergy savings expected to accrue to the U.S. segment over time. Our testing during the third quarter of 2006 indicated that the fair values of the reporting units in the U.S. and Canada exceeded their carrying values, resulting in no impairments of goodwill in 2006. However, a reduction in the fair value of the U.S. or Canada segment in the future could lead to goodwill impairment. We also have significant indefinite lived intangible assets in Canada, associated primarily with core, non core and partner beer brands, as well as distribution rights. These intangible assets were also evaluated for impairment during the third quarter of 2006, and we determined that their fair values exceeded their carrying values. A reduction in the fair values of these intangibles could lead to impairment charges in the future. Reductions in fair value could occur for a number of reasons, including cost increases due to inflation, an unfavorable beer pricing environment, declines in industry or company specific beer volume sales, termination of brewing and or distribution agreements with other brewers. The goodwill associated with the Europe segment originated in the 2002 purchase of the CBL business by Coors. Our testing during the third quarter of 2006 indicated that the fair value of the CBL reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, resulting in no impairments of goodwill. However, a slight reduction in the fair value of the CBL reporting unit in the future could lead to goodwill impairment. We also have a significant indefinite lived intangible asset in Europe, associated with the Carling brand, which was also tested in the third quarter of 2006, and no impairment was warranted. Future reductions in the fair value of the Europe business or of specific intangibles could occur for a number of reasons, including cost increases due to inflation, an unfavorable beer pricing environment, and declines in industry or company specific beer volume sales, which could result in possible impairment of these assets. Interest We estimate that corporate interest expense in 2007 will be approximately $115 to $119 million, excluding U.K. trade loan interest income. Tax Our tax rate is volatile and may fluctuate with changes in, among other things, the amount of income or loss, our ability to utilize foreign tax credits, and changes in tax laws. On February 21, 2007, the Canadian government enacted a tax technical correction bill that will result in a one time, non cash income tax benefit of approximately $90 million in the first quarter of 2007. As a result, we anticipate that our 2007 effective tax rate on income will be in the range of 6% to 11%. Absent this tax law change and resulting benefit, and with no other changes in tax laws or company tax structure, we would expect that our effective tax rate would be in the range of 25% to 30%. We note, however, that there are other pending 51 tax law changes in Canada that if enacted, would result in further reductions in the range of our 2007 effective tax rate. Other The company anticipates that expense related to depreciation and amortization of assets will decline approximately 10% in 2007 versus 2006 excluding special items, due to the net effect of five factors: Substantial existing assets will have been fully depreciated, so expense related to these assets is expected to be significantly lower in 2007 than 2006. Sale of the Memphis brewery in September 2006 eliminates depreciation expense for this facility, including approximately $60 million of accelerated depreciation in 2006 to reduce the facilitys carrying value to equal its salvage value. Adding packaging capacity in our Toronto and Virginia facilities during 2006 and brewing capacity in our Virginia facility in the first half of 2007. We are evaluating the estimated useful lives of a substantial portion of our property, plant and equipment on a global basis, in light of improvements in maintenance, new technology and changes in expected patterns of usage. We expect this evaluation to result in an adjustment of useful lives favorably and unfavorably for a wide range of existing assets. Installing cold dispense units in pubs and restaurants in the U.K. Changes to our capital spending plans or other changes in our asset base could alter this forward view of depreciation expense. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. We review our accounting policies on an on going basis. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. By their nature, estimates are subject to uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have identified the accounting estimates below as critical to our financial condition and results of operations: Pension and Postretirement Benefits We have defined benefit plans that cover the majority of our employees in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom. We also have postretirement welfare plans in Canada and the United States that provide medical benefits for retirees and eligible dependents and life insurance for certain retirees. The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS 87) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions (SFAS 106). These statements require that management make certain assumptions relating to the long term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates used to measure future obligations and expenses, salary increases, inflation, health care cost trend rates and other assumptions. We believe that the accounting estimates related to our pension and postretirement plans are critical accounting estimates because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period based on market conditions. See discussion below regarding 52 the adoption of SFAS No. 158 Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). We performed an analysis of high quality corporate bonds at the end of 2006 and compared the results to appropriate indices and industry trends to support the discount rates used in determining our pension liabilities in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom for the year ended December 31, 2006. Discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets are selected at the end of a given fiscal year and impact expense in the subsequent year. A 50 basis point change in certain assumptions made at the beginning of 2006 would have had the following effects on 2006 pension expense: Impact to 2006 pension costs 50 basis points Reduction (unfavorable) Increase (favorable) (In millions) Description of pension sensitivity item Expected return on Canada plan assets, 7.90% in 2006 $ 4.8 $ 4.8 Expected return on Canada BRI plan assets, 7.90% in 2006 $ 2.5 $ 2.5 Expected return on U.S. plan assets, 8.75% in 2006 $ 3.7 $ 3.7 Expected return on U.K. plan assets, 7.80% in 2006 $ 4.9 $ 4.9 Discount rate on Canada projected benefit obligation, 5.00% in 2006 $ 1.4 $ 0.3 Discount rate on Canada BRI projected benefit obligation, 5.00% in 2006 $ 2.2 $ 1.0 Discount rate on U.S. projected benefit obligation, 5.75% in 2006 $ 4.7 $ 5.4 Discount rate on U.K. projected benefit obligation, 4.75% in 2006 $ 7.8 $ 7.5 Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the retiree health care plan. A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects: 1% point increase (unfavorable) 1% point decrease (favorable) (In millions) Canada plans (Molson) Effect on total of service and interest cost components $ 1.7 $ 1.5 Effect on postretirement benefit obligation $ 18.4 $ 16.7 Canada plans (BRI) Effect on total of service and interest cost components $ 0.9 $ 0.8 Effect on postretirement benefit obligation $ 9.8 $ 8.2 U.S. plan Effect on total of service and interest cost components $ 0.9 $ 0.8 Effect on postretirement benefit obligation $ 6.9 $ 6.2 53 The Canada, U.S. and U.K. plan assets consist primarily of equity securities with smaller holdings of bonds, real estate and other investments. Equity assets are well diversified between domestic and other international investments, with additional diversification in the domestic category through allocations to large cap, small cap and growth and value investments. Relative allocations reflect the demographics of the respective plan participants. The following compares target asset allocation percentages with actual asset allocations at December 31, 2006: Canada plans assets U.S. plan assets U.K. plan assets Target allocations Actual allocations Target allocations Actual allocations Target allocations Actual allocations Equities 70 % 71 % 75 % 76 % 65 % 64 % Fixed income 30 % 28 % 15 % 14 % 28 % 26 % Real estate 10 % 9 % 7 % 8 % Other 1 % 1 % 2 % Contingencies, Environmental and Litigation Reserves We estimate the range of liability related to environmental matters or other legal actions where the amount and range of loss can be estimated. We record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to any pending matter and revise our estimates. Costs that extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of Company owned assets or are incurred to mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination may be capitalized. Other environmental costs are expensed when incurred. We also expense legal costs as incurred. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a discussion of our contingencies, environmental and litigation reserves at December 31, 2006. We sold 68% of the Kaiser business in January 2006 and divested our remaining 15% ownership interest by exercising a put option in November 2006. While we reduced our risk profile as a result of this transaction, we retained risk by providing indemnities to the buyer for certain purchased tax credits and for other tax, labor and civil contingencies in general. These are referenced in the section called Contingencies above and discussed in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. We account for these indemnity obligations at fair value in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. This rule requires us to carry the guarantee liability on the balance sheet at its fair value. We do not amortize these liabilities, but rather make periodic estimates of their fair values, and record material changes in the values through discontinued operations on the statement of operations. We use multiple probability weighted scenarios in determining the fair values of indemnity liabilities. As discussed in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, we have recorded a fair value liability of $77.7 million related to contingencies associated with purchased tax credits based on a total exposure of $246.8 million with regard to those liabilities. Our estimates assume equally likely scenarios (i.e., 50% 50%) of 1) no payments ever occurring and 2) a payment of the full exposure in a future year with a potential refund in a number of years following the initial payment. If our estimate were adjusted to assume a 75% probability of some payment occurring (rather than 50%), the value of the liability would increase by $36.9 million to $114.6 million. Goodwill and Other Intangible Asset Valuation We evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually, and we evaluate our other intangible assets for impairment when there is evidence that certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. We completed the evaluations of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets during the 54 third quarter of 2006. With regard to goodwill, the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values, allowing us to conclude that no impairments of goodwill have occurred. With regard to our indefinite lived intangible assets, the fair values of the assets also exceeded their carrying values. Significant judgments and assumptions were required in the evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. In 2006 we standardized our method for determining fair value, using a combination of discounted cash flows analyses and evaluations of values derived from market comparable transactions and market earnings multiples. This represents a change from cash flow analyses used in isolation in the prior year. We believe that this consistent methodology across all reporting units and the inclusion of evidence provided through market data and comparable transactions will improves the accuracy and consistency of this analysis. Our cash flow projections are based on various long range financial and operational plans of the Company and considered, when necessary, various scenarios, both favorable and unfavorable. In 2006, discount rates used for fair value estimates for reporting units ranged from 8.5% to 9.5%. These rates are driven by, among other factors, the prevailing interest rates in geographies where these businesses operate as well as the credit ratings and financing abilities and opportunities of each reporting unit. Discount rates used for testing of indefinite lived intangibles ranged from 9% to 10%. These rates largely reflect the rates for the overall enterprise valuations, with some level of premium associated with the specificity of the intangibles themselves. Our reporting units operate in relatively mature beer markets, where we are reliant on a major brand for a high percentage of sales. Changes in the factors used in the estimates, including the discount rates used, could have a significant impact on the fair values of the reporting units and, consequently, may result in goodwill impairment charges in the future. Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments The following tables present a roll forward of the fair values, which consists of the notional values and the mark to market adjustments thereto, of debt and derivative contracts outstanding as well as their maturity dates and how those fair values were obtained (in thousands): Fair value of contracts outstanding at December 25, 2005 $ (2,314,559 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (11,703 ) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period 3,606 Other changes in fair value (59,177 ) Fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2006 $ (2,381,833 ) Fair value of contracts at December 31, 2006 Maturities less than 1 year Maturities 1 3 years Maturities 4 5 years Maturities in excess of 5 years Total fair value Source of fair value Prices actively quoted $ $ $ (293,517 ) $ (1,642,866 ) $ (1,936,383 ) Prices provided by other external sources $ 12,709 $ 4,679 $ (197,631 ) $ (265,207 ) $ (445,450 ) We use derivatives in the normal course of business to manage our exposure to fluctuations in production and packaging material prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. By policy, we do not enter into such contracts for trading or speculative purposes. We record our derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as assets or liabilities at fair value in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended and interpreted, incorporating FASB Statements No. 137, 138 and 149 (SFAS 133), which we early adopted on December 28, 1998. Such accounting is complex, as evidenced by significant 55 interpretations of the primary accounting standard, which continues to evolve, as well as the significant judgments and estimates involved in the estimation of fair value in the absence of quoted market values. These estimates are based upon valuation methodologies deemed appropriate in the circumstances; however, the use of different assumptions could have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. Our market sensitive derivative and other financial instruments, as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), are foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swaps, interest rate swaps, and cross currency swaps. See discussions also in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. We monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using two techniques, value at risk and sensitivity analysis. We use value at risk to monitor the foreign exchange and interest rate risk of our cross currency swaps. The value at risk methodology provides an estimate of the level of a one day loss that may be equaled or exceeded due to changes in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate and interest rate sensitive financial instruments. The type of value at risk model used to estimate the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value is a variance/covariance method. The value at risk model assumes normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used to compute value at risk. The computations used to derive our values take into account various correlations between currency rates and interest rates. The correlations have been determined by observing foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the most recent one year period. We have excluded anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies from the value at risk calculation, some of which these instruments are intended to hedge. Value at risk is a statistical measure of risk that estimates the loss that may be experienced with a given level of confidence over a given period of time. Specifically, as reported herein, value at risk is the maximum expected one day loss at 95% confidence, that is, only 5% of the time or 1 day in 20 is the loss expected to exceed the value at risk. Value at risk is not intended to represent actual losses that may occur, nor does it represent the full extent of losses that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated by value at risk because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments, hedge percentages, timing and other factors. The one day value at risk at 95% confidence of our cross currency swaps was $10.6 million, $12.2 million and $10.7 million at December 31, 2006, December 25, 2005 and December 26, 2004, respectively. Such a hypothetical loss in fair value is a combination of the foreign exchange and interest rate components of the cross currency swap. Value changes due to the foreign exchange component would be offset completely by increases in the value of our inter company loan, the underlying transaction being hedged. The hypothetical loss in fair value attributable to the interest rate component would be deferred until termination or maturity. We have performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk of interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. The sensitivity analysis reflects the impact of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the applicable market interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. The volatility of the applicable rates and prices are dependent on many factors that cannot be forecast with reliable accuracy. Therefore, actual changes in fair values could differ significantly from the results presented in the table below. 56 The following table presents the results of the sensitivity analysis, which reflects the impact of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the applicable market interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices of our derivative and debt portfolio: As of December 31, 2006 December 25, 2005 (In thousands) Estimated fair value volatility Foreign currency risk: Forwards $ (28,411 ) $ (13,395 ) Interest rate risk: Debt, swaps $ (64,720 ) $ (75,599 ) Commodity price risk: Swaps $ (6,165 ) $ (17,600 ) Income Tax Assumptions We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). Judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our global business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, our income tax provision is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by many different tax authorities. We adjust our income tax provision in the period it is probable that actual results will differ from our estimates. Tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted. We have historically provided U.S. deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries. During 2005, we assessed our corporate financing position with respect to all our foreign subsidiaries. As a result, we have elected to treat our portion of all foreign subsidiary earnings through December 31, 2006, as permanently reinvested. Under the accounting guidance of APB 23 and SFAS 109, we recorded a tax provision benefit in the third quarter of 2005 totaling $44 million, representing the reversal of a previously established deferred tax liability in our U.K. subsidiary. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $1.0 billion of retained earnings attributable to international companies was considered to be permanently re invested. The Companys intention is to reinvest the earnings permanently or to repatriate the earnings when it is tax effective to do so. It is not practicable to determine the amount of incremental taxes that might arise were these earnings to be remitted. However, the Company believes that U.S. foreign tax credits would largely eliminate any U.S. taxes and offset any foreign withholding taxes due on remittance. In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements. FIN 48 prescribes a two step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon examination. If the tax position is deemed more likely than not to be sustained, the tax position is then valued to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 is effective as of the beginning of our 2007 fiscal year. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of adopting FIN 48 on our financial statements. While we have not concluded our analysis, we anticipate that the adoption of FIN 48 will increase tax related liabilities (or decrease tax related assets) by a minimum of $40 million, which could increase upon adoption. The cumulative effect of applying the new requirement will be reflected as an adjustment to 57 retained earnings in the period of adoption (first reflected in the first quarter of 2007). We expect that the requirements of FIN 48 may add volatility to our effective tax rate, and therefore our expected income tax expense, in future periods. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period a determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Reductions to the valuation allowance related to the Merger with Molson or the acquisitions of CBL that relate to deferred taxes arising from those events would reduce goodwill, unless the reduction was caused by a change in law, in which case the adjustment would impact earnings. Consolidations under FIN 46R RMMC and RMBC are dedicated predominantly to our packaging and distribution activities and were formed with companies which have core competencies in the aluminum and glass container businesses. The CBL joint venture with Grolsch was formed to provide a long term relationship with that brands owner in a key segment of the U.K. beer market. We also consolidate the financial position and results of Brewers Retail, Inc. (BRI), which is 52% owned by Molson, and provides all distribution and retail sales of beer in the province of Ontario in Canada. Our ownership of BRI is determined by our market share in the province of Ontario. Our market share and ownership percentage could be reduced as a result of lower trade or consolidation of certain of our competitors. During the first quarter of 2007, press reports have indicated that a certain competitor offered to purchase another competitor in the province of Ontario. If this were to occur, we may need to consider whether BRI should continue to be consolidated in our financial statements. Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements FASB Interpretation No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143 In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143 (FIN 47), which clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS 143). Specifically, FIN 47 provides that an asset retirement obligation is conditional when either the timing and (or) method of settling the obligation is conditioned on a future event. Accordingly, an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair market value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Uncertainty about the timing and (or) method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists. We adopted FIN 47 on December 25, 2005, which resulted in an increase to properties of $0.5 million, goodwill of $2.2 million, minority interest of $1.1 million, and liabilities of $9.6 million related to asset retirement obligations. For asset retirement obligations related to the properties acquired in the acquisition of Molson Inc. as of February 9, 2005, such obligations increased the goodwill amounts recognized upon the acquisition by $2.2 million as such properties were recorded at the appraised fair market value at the acquisition date. These asset retirement obligations relate primarily to clean up, removal, or replacement activities and related costs for asbestos, coolants, waste water, oils and other contaminants contained within our manufacturing properties. 58 The adoption of FIN 47 was reflected in our financial statements as the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle with the catch up adjustment of $3.7 million, net of tax benefit of $2.2 million, in the 2005 statement of operations. This adjustment represents a depreciation charge and an accretion of liability from the time the obligation originated, which is either from the time of the acquisition or the construction of related long lived assets, through December 25, 2005. Inherent in the fair value calculation of asset retirement obligations are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the fair value of the existing asset retirement obligation liability, a corresponding adjustment will be made to the asset balance. If the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability, we will recognize a gain or loss upon the settlement. The net value of the asset retirement obligation liabilities calculated on a pro forma basis as if the standard had been retrospectively applied to December 25, 2005 and December 26, 2004 were $9,628,580 and $5,926,852, respectively. SFAS No. 123R Share Based Payment Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123R (SFAS 123R) was issued in December 2004 and became effective for us in the first quarter of 2006. SFAS 123R requires all share based payments to qualified individuals, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized as compensation in the financial statements based on their grant date fair values. Prior to the adoption, under the guidance for qualifying stock option grants with no intrinsic value on the date of grant, we presented pro forma share based compensation expense for our stock option program in the notes to our financial statements. We have elected to use the modified prospective application method of implementing SFAS 123R, which does not require restatement of prior periods. Under the modified prospective application method, awards that are granted, modified, or settled after adoption of SFAS 123R are prospectively measured and accounted for in accordance with SFAS 123R. Unvested equity classified awards that were granted prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R will continue to be accounted for in accordance with SFAS 123, except that the fair value amounts are recognized in the statement of operations and are subject to the forfeiture provisions of SFAS 123R. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107) to assist preparers by simplifying some of the implementation challenges of SFAS 123R. In particular, SAB 107 provides supplemental implementation guidance on SFAS 123R, including guidance on valuation methods, classification of compensation expense, inventory capitalization of share based compensation cost, income tax effects, disclosures in Managements Discussion and Analysis and several other issues. We applied the principles of SAB 107 in conjunction with our adoption of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of 2006. SFAS 123R requires a calculation of the APIC Pool balance consisting of excess tax benefits available to absorb related share based compensation. FASB Staff Position FAS 123R 3, Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share Based Payment Awards (FSP 123R 3), which was issued on November 10, 2005, provides a practical transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards to employees. Specifically, this FSP allows a company to elect the alternative or simplified method to calculate the opening APIC Pool balance. We have adopted such alternative method provisions to calculate the beginning balance of the APIC Pool in the financial statements ended December 31, 2006. This adoption did not have any impact on our financial statements. The effect of adoption of SFAS 123R in 2006 was an additional expense of $6.1 million pretax, $4.4 million after tax, or $0.05 per diluted share. The adoption of SFAS 123R led us to evaluate different types of instruments as share based awards and we use a combination of restricted stock unit awards, performance share awards, deferred stock awards and limited stock appreciation rights. As of December 31, 2006, there was $67.9 million of total unrecognized compensation cost from share based 59 compensation arrangements granted under the plans, related to unvested shares. This compensation is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.5 years. (See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) SFAS No. 151 Inventory Costs SFAS 151 is an amendment to ARB No. 43, Chapter 4 that became effective for us in the first quarter of 2006. The standard clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage requiring immediate recognition in the period they are incurred. The adoption of this standard had no impact on our financial results. SFAS No. 154 Accounting Changes and Corrections SFAS 154 replaces APB Opinion No. 20 and SFAS 3 and became effective for us in the first quarter of 2006. The standard introduces a new requirement to retrospectively apply accounting principle changes to prior years comparative financial statements as if the Company had always applied the newly adopted accounting principle. Changes in depreciation, amortization and depletion methods previously considered a change in accounting principle are now considered a change in estimate under SFAS 154, requiring prospective adoption. New pronouncements may contain specific implementation guidance which would supersede the requirements of SFAS 154. The adoption of SFAS 154 did not have an impact on the financial statements included herein. FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FIN 45 3 Application of FASB Interpretation No. 45 to Minimum Revenue Guarantees Granted to a Business or its Owners FSP FIN 45 3 is an amendment to FIN 45 requiring the recognition and disclosure of the fair value of an obligation undertaken for minimum revenue guarantees granted to a business or its owners that the revenue of the business for a specified period of time will be at least a specified minimum amount. The FSP is effective for new minimum revenue guarantees issued or modified beginning in the first quarter of 2006. We currently do not maintain arrangements with minimum revenue guarantees that have a significant impact on our financial statements. SFAS No. 158 Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) SFAS 158 was issued in September 2006 and is effective for our annual fiscal year ending December 31, 2006. The standard, which is an amendment to SFAS 87, 88, 106 and 132R, requires an employer to recognize the funded status of any defined benefit pension and or other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position. Funded status is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the market value of plan assets for defined benefit pension plans, and is the difference between the accumulated benefit obligation and the market value of plan assets (if any) for other post retirement benefit plans. SFAS 158 also requires an employer to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through other comprehensive income. As a result of the adoption of SFAS 158, liabilities related to our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans increased by $245 million and our accumulated other comprehensive income, net of related deferred income taxes, decreased by approximately $172 million as of December 31, 2006. A portion of the change in the accumulated other comprehensive income related to the adoption of SFAS 158 will be recognized into the statement of income as a component of net period pension benefit cost. Such amount will be approximately $19.3 million before tax, in 2007. See Notes 1, 16 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a detailed discussion regarding the adoption of SFAS 158. 60 In addition, this statement requires companies to measure plan assets and obligations at the date of their year end statement of financial position, with limited exceptions. This measurement date provision will be effective for our annual 2008 year end and is unlikely to have an impact to the Companys financial statements as we currently measure plan assets and obligations as of our fiscal year end. SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.108 Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements) The SEC issued SAB 108 in September 2006 and it is effective for our fiscal 2006 year. SAB 108 requires companies to evaluate the materiality of identified unadjusted errors on each financial statement and related financial statement disclosure using both the rollover approach and the iron curtain approach. The rollover approach quantifies a misstatement based on the amount of the error originating in the current year statement of operations. Thus, this approach ignores the effects of correcting the portion of the current period balance sheet misstatement that originated in prior periods. The iron curtain approach quantifies misstatements based on the effects of correcting the misstatement existing in the balance sheet at the end of the current period, irrespective of the misstatements period(s) of origin. Financial statements would be required to be adjusted when either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that is material. Correcting prior year financial statements for immaterial errors would not require previously filed reports to be amended. Our adoption of SAB 108 did not impact the financial statements presented herein. New Accounting Pronouncements SFAS No. 155 Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments SFAS 155 was issued in February 2006 and will be effective for us in the first quarter of our 2007 fiscal year. Among other factors, SFAS 155 simplifies the accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments by permitting fair value accounting for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation. We do not expect that the adoption of SFAS 155 will have a significant impact on our financial statements. SFAS No. 156 Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140 SFAS 156 was issued in February 2006 and will be effective for us in the first quarter of our 2007 fiscal year. The new standard, which is an amendment to SFAS 140, will simplify the accounting for servicing assets and liabilities by addressing the recognition and measurement of separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities and providing an approach to simplify efforts to obtain hedge like accounting. We do not expect that the adoption of SFAS 156 will have a significant impact on our financial statements. FASBs Emerging Issue Task Force Issue No. 06 03 How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That Is, Gross Versus Net Presentation) In June 2006, the FASB ratified a consensus on the EITF Issue No. 06 03 (EITF 06 03) related to the classification of certain sales, value added and excise taxes within the income statement. This EITF would become effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2007. We do not expect that the adoption of EITF 06 03 will have a significant impact on our financial statements. FASB Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements. FIN 48 prescribes a two step 61 process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon examination. If the tax position is deemed more likely than not to be sustained, the tax position is then valued to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 is effective as of the beginning of our 2007 fiscal year. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of adopting FIN 48 on our financial statements. While we have not concluded our analysis, we anticipate that the adoption of FIN 48 will increase tax related liabilities (or decrease tax related assets) by a minimum of $40 million and could increase upon adoption. The cumulative effect of applying the new requirement will be reflected as an adjustment to retained earnings in the period of adoption (first reflected in the first quarter of 2007). We expect that the requirements of FIN 48 may add volatility to our effective tax rate, and therefore our expected income tax expense, in future periods. SFAS No. 157 Fair Value Measurements SFAS 157 was issued in September 2006 and will be effective for us in the first quarter of our 2008 fiscal year. This standard clarifies the definition of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. We are still in the process of reviewing the impact, if any, that SFAS 157 will have on our financial statements. SFAS No. 159 The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159 (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. The objective of this Statement is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities using different measurement techniques. The fair value measurement provisions are elective and can be applied to individual financial instruments. SFAS 159 requires additional disclosures related to the fair value measurements included in the entitys financial statements. This Statement is effective for us as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year. We have not yet determined if we will elect to adopt the fair value measurement provisions of this Statement and what impacts such adoption might have on our financial statements. Related Party Transactions Transactions with Management and Others We employ members of the Coors and Molson families, who collectively owned 84% of the voting A shares, common and exchangeable stock of the Company after the Merger and throughout 2006. Hiring and placement decisions are made based upon merit, and compensation packages offered are commensurate with policies in place for all employees of the Company. As of December 31, 2006, various Coors family trusts collectively owned approximately 42% of our Class A common and exchangeable stock, approximately 13% of our Class B common and exchangeable stock, and approximately 30% of Graphic Packaging Corporations (GPC) common stock. Certain Business Relationships We purchase a large portion of our paperboard packaging requirements from GPC, a related party. Our payments under the GPC packaging agreement in 2006, 2005 and 2004 totaled $73.6 million, $75.3 million and $104.5 million, respectively. Related accounts payable balances included in Affiliates Accounts Payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $0.8 million and $2.8 million at December 31, 2006, and December 25, 2005, respectively. 62 ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currencies and the prices of production and packaging materials. We have established policies and procedures to govern the strategic management of these exposures through a variety of financial instruments. By policy, we do not enter into any contracts for the purpose of trading or speculation. Our objective in managing our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and production and packaging materials prices is to decrease the volatility of our earnings and cash flows affected by potential changes in underlying rates and prices. To achieve this objective, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swaps, interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps, the values of which change in the opposite direction of the anticipated cash flows. We do not hedge the value of net investments in foreign currency denominated operations or translated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Our primary foreign currency exposures are Canadian dollar (CAD), British pound sterling (GBP or ) and Japanese yen (JPY). Derivatives are either exchange traded instruments or over the counter agreements entered into with highly rated financial institutions. No losses on over the counter agreements due to counterparty credit issues are anticipated. All over the counter agreements are entered into with counterparties rated no lower than A (Standard & Poors) or A2 (Moodys). In some instances our counterparties and we have reciprocal collateralization agreements regarding fair value positions in excess of certain thresholds. These agreements call for the posting of collateral in the form of cash, treasury securities or letters of credit if a fair value loss position to our counterparties or us exceeds a certain amount. At December 31, 2006, no collateral was posted by our counterparties or us. Details of all other market sensitive derivative and other financial instruments, including their fair values, are included in the table below. These instruments include long term fixed rate debt, foreign currency forwards, commodity swaps, interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps. See related value at risk and sensitivity analysis in the Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments section of Item 7. Expected maturity date December 31, 2006 December 25, 2005 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Fair value Fair value (In thousands) Long term debt: USD $300 million, 4.85% fixed rate, due 2010(1) $ $ $ $ (300,000 ) $ $ $ (300,000 ) $ (293,517 ) $ (296,796 ) CAD $200 million, 7.5% fixed rate, due 2011(2) (171,541 ) (171,541 ) (192,320 ) (194,801 ) USD $850 million, 6.375% fixed rate, due 2012(3)(4) (850,000 ) (850,000 ) (880,626 ) (901,026 ) CAD $900 million, 5.0% fixed rate, due 2015(1) (771,936 ) (771,936 ) (762,240 ) (765,251 ) Foreign currency management: Forwards 147,684 57,783 14,989 220,456 7,133 (2,548 ) Cross currency swaps(1)(3)(5) 73,487 300,000 1,038,217 1,411,704 (268,656 ) (174,755 ) Commodity pricing management: Swaps 46,092 3,631 49,723 7,436 9,422 Fixed price contracts 4,125 4,125 (956 ) Interest rate pricing management: Interest rate swaps(2)(4) 85,771 201,200 286,971 1,913 11,195 (1) Prior to issuing the bonds on September 22, 2005 (See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8), we entered into a bond forward transaction for a portion of the Canadian offering. The bond forward transaction effectively established, in advance, the yield of the government of Canada bond rates over which the Companys private placement was priced. At the time of the private placement offering and pricing, the government of Canada bond rates was trading at a yield lower than that locked in with the Companys interest rate lock. This resulted in a loss of $4.0 million on the bond forward transaction. Per FAS 133 accounting, the loss will be amortized over the life of the Canadian issued private placement and will serve to increase the Companys effective cost of borrowing by 4.9 basis points compared to the stated coupon on the issue. 63 Simultaneouslywith the U.S. private placement we entered into a cross currency swap transaction for the entire USD $300 million issue amount and for the same maturity. In this transaction we exchanged our $300 million for a CAD $355.5 million obligation with a third party. The terms of the transaction are such that the Company will pay interest at a rate of 4.28% to the third party on the amount of CAD $355.5 million and will receive interest at a rate of 4.85% on the $300 million amount. There was an exchange of principal at the inception of this transaction and there will be a subsequent exchange of principal at the termination of the transaction. We have designated this transaction as a hedge of the variability of the cash flows associated with the payment of interest and principal on the USD securities. Consistent with FAS 133 accounting, all changes in the value of the transaction due to foreign exchange will be recorded through the statement of operations and will be offset by a revaluation of the associated debt instrument. Changes in the value of the transaction due to interest rates will be recorded to other comprehensive income. (2) The BRI joint venture is a party to interest rate swaps, converting CAD $100 million notional amount from fixed rates to floating rates and mature in 2011. There was no exchange of principal at the inception of the swaps. These interest rate swaps qualify for hedge accounting treatment. (3) We are a party to certain cross currency swaps totaling GBP 530 million (approximately USD $774 million at prevailing foreign currency exchange rates in 2002, the year we entered into the swaps). The swaps included an initial exchange of principal in 2002 and will require final principal exchange on the settlement date of our 6 3/8% notes due in 2012 (see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8). The swaps also call for an exchange of fixed GBP interest payments for fixed USD interest receipts. At the initial principal exchange, we paid USD to a counterparty and received GBP. Upon final exchange, we will provide GBP to the counterparty and receive USD. The cross currency swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges. (4) We are a party to interest rate swap agreements related to our 6 3/8% fixed rate debt. The interest rate swaps convert $201.2 million notional amount from fixed rates to floating rates and mature in 2012. We will receive fixed USD interest payments semi annually at a rate of 6 3/8% per annum and pay a rate to our counterparty based on a credit spread plus the three month LIBOR rate, thereby exchanging a fixed interest obligation for a floating rate obligation. There was no exchange of principal at the inception of the swaps. We designated the interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of the changes in the fair value of $201.2 million fixed rate debt attributable to changes in the LIBOR swap rates. See accounting method discussion in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. (5) We are a party to a cross currency swap totaling CAD $30 million (approximately USD $25.7 million at prevailing foreign currency exchange rates in 2005, the year we entered into the swap.) The swap included an initial exchange of principal in 2005 and matures in 2006. The swap also calls for an exchange of fixed CAD interest payments for fixed USD interest receipts. At the initial principal exchange, we paid USD to a counterparty and received CAD. Upon final exchange, we will provide CAD to the counterparty and receive USD. The cross currency swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge of the changes in value of the future CAD interest and principal receipts that results from changes in the USD to CAD exchange rates on an intercompany loan between two of our subsidiaries. In addition, in September of 2006 we entered into a cross currency swap totaling GBP 24.4 million (approximately USD $47.8 million at prevailing foreign currency exchange rates in 2006). The swap included an initial exchange of principal in 2005 and matures in 2006. The swap calls for an exchange of fixed GBP interest payments for fixed CAD interest receipts. At the initial principal exchange, we paid CAD to a counterparty and received GBP. The cross currency swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge of the changes in value of the future GBP interest and principal receipts that result from changes in the CAD to GBP exchange rates on an intercompany loan between two of our subsidiaries. See accounting method discussion in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 64
