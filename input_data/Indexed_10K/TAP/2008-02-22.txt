ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary The following table highlights summarized components of our condensed consolidated summary of operations for the years ended December 30, 2007, December 31, 2006 and December 25, 2005. For the Years Ended December 30, 2007 % change December 31, 2006(1) % change December 25, 2005(1) (In thousands, except percentages and per share data) Volume in barrels 42,051 (0.2 )% 42,143 4.2 % 40,431 Net sales $ 6,190,592 5.9 % $ 5,844,985 6.1 % $ 5,506,906 Income from continuing operations $ 514,874 37.8 % $ 373,556 62.1 % $ 230,446 Diluted income per share from continuing operations $ 2.84 31.5 % $ 2.16 50.0 % $ 1.44 (1)Per share amounts have been adjusted from previously reported amounts for the effect of our 2 for 1 stock split issued in the form of a stock dividend on October 3, 2007. The 53rd week in our fiscal 2006 increased total company sales volume by approximately 600,000 barrels and increased reported pre tax profit of $472.1 million by approximately $6 million. 2007 Key Financial Highlights: Our performance in 2007 demonstrated that our brand growth strategies and cost reduction efforts continue to strengthen our competitive capabilities and financial performance. We achieved revenue and profit growth, despite substantial competitive and inflationary cost challenges in each of our major markets. We achieved several critical successes in 2007: Coors Light grew (comparable) sales to retail ("STR") nearly 4% globally for the year and more than 5% for the second half of the year. We posted total company net sales growth of nearly 6% in 2007, driven by brand strength, positive pricing and the benefit of favorable foreign currency. We grew net pricing in all three of our businesses on the strength of our brands and sales team performance. We reduced costs and improved service to our customers by closing our brewery in Edmonton, Alberta, and opening breweries in Moncton, New Brunswick, and Elkton, Virginia. We continued to invest at a high level in our brands and sales capabilities in each of our segments. We improved our financial foundation and reduced interest and other non operating expenses by more than $26 million annually by refinancing one fourth of our debt, making substantial voluntary pension contributions, and streamlining our corporate legal structure. Our U.S business stayed focused and achieved favorable STRs and market share growth from each of our four largest brands. Our U.S. portfolio also showed broad geographic strength by growing STRs in all major channels and in 45 out of 50 states. We grew market share in the U.S. in 2007. 32 Our Canadian business gained market share on a full year basis for the first time in six years and for only the second time in 17 years, driven by Coors Light and our other strategic brands. At the same time, we continued to strategically increase net pricing in a highly competitive market, based on the growing strength of our brands. An important achievement for future growth was the Canada teams success in securing each of our major partner brands in Canada for the long term. These include the three largest import brands in Canada: Corona, Heineken and Miller Genuine Draft. Synergies and other cost savings initiatives First, we exceeded our three year $175 million merger synergies target and wrapped up this program with $180 million of savings delivered, including an incremental $5 million of merger related synergies in 2007. Second, we are already ahead of schedule on our three year, $250 million Resources for Growth cost reduction initiatives. We achieved $91 million of savings during 2007, the first year of the program, which is $25 million more than the initial 2007 target. We exceeded our first year cost target by more than 37% by accelerating a number of our cost reduction programs, particularly in our North American supply chain. Combining both cost reduction programs, we captured $146 million in total 2007 savings. Components of our Statement of Operations Net sales Our net sales represent almost exclusively the sale of beer and other malt beverages, the vast majority of which are brands that we own and brew ourselves. We import or brew and sell certain non owned partner brands under licensing and related arrangements. We also sell certain "factored" brands, as a distributor, to on premise customers in the United Kingdom (Europe segment). Cost of goods sold Our cost of goods sold include costs we incur to make and ship beer. These costs include brewing materials, such as barley, in the United States and United Kingdom where we manufacture the majority of our own malt. In Canada, we purchase malt from third parties. Hops and various grains are other key brewing materials purchased by all of our segments. Packaging materials, including costs for glass bottles, aluminum and steel cans, and cardboard and paperboard are also included in our cost of goods sold. Our cost of goods sold also include both direct and indirect labor, freight costs, utilities, maintenance costs, and other manufacturing overheads, as well as the cost of "factored" brands. Marketing, general and administrative These costs include media advertising (television, radio, print), tactical advertising (signs, banners, point of sale materials) and promotion costs planned and executed on both local and national levels within our operating segments. These costs also include our sales organizations, including labor and other overheads. This classification also includes general and administrative costs for functions such as finance, legal, human resources and information technology, which consist primarily of labor and outside services. Special Items These are unique, infrequent and unusual items which affect our statement of operations, and are discussed in each segments Results of Operations discussion. Interest expense, net Interest costs associated with borrowings to finance our operations are classified here. Interest income in the Europe segment is associated with trade loans receivable from customers. Debt extinguishment costs The costs are associated with payments to settle the notes at fair value given interest rates at the time of extinguishment, incentive payments to note holders for early tendering of the notes, and a write off of the proportionate amount of unamortized discount and issuance fees associated with the extinguished debt. 33 Other income (expense) This classification includes primarily gains and losses associated with activities not directly related to brewing and selling beer. For instance, gains or losses on sales of non operating assets, our share of income or loss associated with our ownership in Tradeteam and the Montr&eacute;al Canadiens hockey club, and certain foreign exchange gains and losses are classified here. Discussions of statement of operations line items such as minority interests, discontinued operations and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle are discussed in detail elsewhere in MD&A and in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Depreciation We realized a 6% decrease related to depreciation and amortization expense of assets in 2007 versus 2006 excluding special items, due to the net effect of five factors: Substantial existing assets became fully depreciated, so expense related to these assets was significantly lower in 2007 than 2006. Adding packaging capacity in our Toronto and Virginia facilities during 2006 and brewing capacity in our Virginia facility in the first half of 2007. We evaluated the estimated useful lives of a substantial portion of our property, plant and equipment on a global basis, in light of improvements in maintenance, new technology and changes in expected patterns of usage. The lengthening of certain depreciable asset lives as a result of this evaluation resulted in a reduction of our consolidated depreciation expense for the full year 2007. Installing cold dispense units in pubs and restaurants in the U.K. resulted in a year over year increase. Purchase of the keg population in the U.K. increased depreciation in the Europe segment. Depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately 4% from 2005 to 2006 excluding special items. Income Taxes Our full year effective tax rate was approximately 1% in 2007 and 17% in both 2006 and 2005. Our 2007 and 2006 effective tax rates were significantly lower than the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following: lower effective income tax rates applicable to our Canadian and U.K. businesses, and one time benefits from revaluing our deferred tax assets and liabilities to give effect to reductions in foreign income tax rates and tax law changes. Our 2005 effective tax rate was lower than the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to lower income tax rates applicable to our Canadian and U.K. businesses and a one time benefit resulting from the reversal of a previously recognized deferred tax liability due to our election to treat our portion of all foreign subsidiary earnings through December 25, 2005, as permanently reinvested under the accounting guidance of APB 23 "Accounting for Income Taxes Special Areas" and SFAS 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes." Discontinued Operations The Companys former Brazil business, Kaiser, which was acquired as part of the Merger, is reported as a discontinued operation due to the sale of a 83% controlling interest in the business in 2006. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 34 The loss from discontinued operations of $17.7 million for the year ended 2007 is composed of the following components: A net loss of $20.4 million associated with adjustments to the indemnity liabilities due to changes in estimates, foreign exchange losses, and accretion expense on discounted amounts. A gain of $2.7 million due to an income tax adjustment related to the sale of Kaiser. The loss from discontinued operations of $12.5 million for the year ended 2006 is composed of the following components: Losses generated by Kaiser prior to the sale of $2.3 million. A loss on the 2006 sale of the business of $7.2 million. Unfavorable adjustments to indemnity liabilities due to foreign exchange fluctuations and changes in estimates of $3.0 million. During 2005, Kaiser generated pre tax losses of $91.8 million, due to operating losses and special charges associated with increasing reserves for contingent liabilities. In conjunction with this transaction, the purchaser (FEMSA) assumed $63 million of financial debt and assumed contingent liabilities of approximately $260 million, related primarily to tax claims, subject to our indemnification. We have a level of continuing potential exposure to these contingent liabilities of Kaiser, as well as previously disclosed but less than probable unaccrued claims, due to certain indemnities provided to FEMSA pursuant to the sales and purchase agreement. While we believe that all significant contingencies were disclosed as part of the sale process and adequately reserved for on Kaisers financial statements, resolution of contingencies and claims above reserved or otherwise disclosed amounts could, under some circumstances, result in additional cash outflows for Molson Coors because of transaction related indemnity provisions. We have recorded these indemnity liabilities at fair value and have a carrying value at December 30, 2007, of $155.0 million. Due to the uncertainty involved with the ultimate outcome and timing of these contingencies, there could be significant adjustments in the future. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle Molson Coors has adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143" (FIN 47) under which companies must recognize potential long term liabilities related to the eventual retirement of assets. As a result of adopting FIN 47, we recorded a cumulative non cash expense of $3.7 million, after tax, in the 2005 fourth quarter, reported as Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle in the Companys statement of operations. These liabilities represent accumulated remediation and restoration costs expected to be incurred up to 30 years in the future for anticipated asset retirements. Costs related to FIN 47 were not significant in 2007 or 2006. We do not expect FIN 47 related expense to have a significant impact on our on going annual operating results. Results of Operations Canada Segment Our Canada segment consists primarily of Molsons beer business including the production and sale of the Molson brands, Coors Light and other licensed brands, principally in Canada. The Canada segment also includes our joint venture arrangements related to the distribution of beer in Ontario, Brewers Retail, Inc. ("BRI") (consolidated under FIN 46R), and in the Western provinces, Brewers Distributor Ltd. ("BDL"). 35  Before the Merger in February 2005, the Canada segment consisted of Coors Brewing Companys 50.1% interest in the Coors Canada Partnership ("CCP"), through which the Coors Light business in Canada was conducted. CCP contracted with Molson for the brewing, distribution and the sale of Coors Light products, while CCP managed all marketing activities in Canada. In connection with the Merger, CCP was dissolved into the Canadian business. Coors accounted for its interest in CCP using the equity method of accounting. The following represents the Canada segments historical and pro forma results: Fiscal year ended December 30, 2007(1) (Actual) % change December 31, 2006(1) (Actual) % change December 25, 2005(1)(3) (Actual) % change December 25, 2005(4) (Pro forma) (In thousands, except percentages) Volume in barrels(2) 8,153 (1.6 )% 8,282 11.1 % 7,457 1.6 % 8,148 Net sales $ 1,913,175 6.7 % $ 1,793,608 17.4 % $ 1,527,306 10.2 % $ 1,627,721 Cost of goods sold (984,973 ) 11.5 % (883,649 ) 11.7 % (790,859 ) 8.0 % (818,297 ) Gross profit 928,202 2.0 % 909,959 23.6 % 736,447 12.4 % 809,424 Marketing, general and administrative expenses (447,630 ) 1.8 % (439,920 ) 16.5 % (377,545 ) 3.4 % (425,468 ) Special items, net (75,159 ) N/M N/M (5,161 ) N/M (5,161 ) Operating income 405,413 (13.7 )% 470,039 32.9 % 353,741 24.1 % 378,795 Other income (expense), net 21,526 N/M 13,228 N/M (2,183 ) N/M (1,490 ) Earnings before income taxes $ 426,939 (11.7 )% $ 483,267 37.5 % $ 351,558 28.1 % $ 377,305 N/M Not meaningful (1)52 weeks reflected in 2007 and 2005 versus 53 weeks included in 2006(4). (2)Volumes represent net sales of MCBC owned brands and partner brands. (3)Molsons results are included in the Canada segment results for the 2007, 2006 and 2005 years ended, beginning at the date of the Merger, February 9, 2005. (4)Represents the Canada segments pro forma results, as if the Merger had occurred on December 27, 2004, the first day of Coors 2005 fiscal year. Foreign currency impact on results Our Canada segment (as stated in USD) benefited from a 7% year over year increase in the value of the CAD against the USD in 2007 versus 2006. Similarly, the Canada segment benefited from a 6% year over year increase in the value of CAD against USD in 2006 versus 2005. Volume and net sales For the 52 weeks ended December 30, 2007, sales volume in Canada decreased by 1.6% to 8.2 million barrels versus prior year volume of 8.3 million barrels for the 53 weeks ended December 31, 2006. The 53rd week in 2006 delivered approximately 130,000 barrels, accounting for all of the year over year decrease. In addition, our Fosters U.S. production contract was terminated early in the fourth quarter 2007, driving a further sales volume reduction in the current fiscal year. Excluding the 36 impact of the 53rd week in 2006 and the volume reductions attributable to Fosters and other exported volume, comparable sales volume in Canada increased by approximately 1.5% or 110,000 barrels. Our Canada STRs for 2007 increased 1.0% versus the prior calendar year driven by mid single digit growth of our Molson strategic brands, lead by Coors Light, which experienced high single digit growth compared to the prior year. In addition, the Rickards, Creemore and Carling brands, and our partner import brands, all grew at double digit rates on a full year basis. These increases were partially offset by declines in non strategic brands and other premium brands. Canada industry volumes grew an estimated 0.9% in 2007 compared to the prior calendar year. As a result, Molson experienced a slight market share increase on a full year basis, fueled by share growth over the key summer selling period and the strength of our strategic brands. This represents the first time Molson has achieved share growth in the past six years. On a full year basis, 2007 net sales revenue grew $119.6 million or 6.7% versus prior year with approximately 2% growth in local currency on a per barrel basis. For the full year, net sales revenue was $234.66 per barrel, an increase of 8.4% over 2006 net sales revenue of $216.57 per barrel. An approximate 7% appreciation in the value of CAD against USD during the year increased net sales revenue by approximately $114 million or $14.00 per barrel. Net pricing contributed half of the remaining increase with the year over year impact of modest general price increases being partially offset by increased price discounting in Qu&eacute;bec and Ontario during the past year. Improved sales mix from increased import sales, which are at higher than average retail prices, and decreased export sales, which are at lower than average retail prices, accounted for the remaining net increase. The decrease in export sales can be attributed to the termination of our Fosters US production contract in the fourth quarter of 2007. For the 53 weeks ended December 31, 2006, sales volume in Canada increased by 11.1% to 8.3 million barrels versus prior year volume of 7.5 million barrels for the fiscal period beginning February 9, 2005 and ended December 25, 2005. On a pro forma basis, sales volume increased 1.6% to 8.3 million barrels versus 2005 pro forma volume of 8.1 million. The 53rd week in 2006 accounted for approximately 130,000 barrels, providing the year over year increase. On a pro forma basis, Molson strategic brands grew at mid single digit rates in 2006, lead by Coors Light, Rickards and our partner import brands, all of which grew at double digit rates on a full year basis. These increases were partially offset by declines in non strategic brands and other premium brands, reductions in contract packaging of non owned brands for export shipment and the discontinuation of Molson Kick and A Marca Bavaria. For the year ended December 31, 2006, net sales revenue was $216.57 per barrel, an increase of 8.4% over comparable 2005 net sales revenue of $199.77 per barrel. An approximate 6% appreciation in the value of CAD against USD during the year increased net sales revenue by approximately $115 million. The remainder of the increase was driven by the year over year impact of modest general price increases and improved sales mix from increased import sales, which were at higher than average retail prices. These improvements were partially offset by increased price discounting during the year, predominantly in Ontario and Qu&eacute;bec. Cost of goods sold and gross profit Cost of goods sold increased $101.3 million, or 11.5%, in 2007 versus prior year with approximately 7% growth in local currency on a per barrel basis. For the full year, cost of goods sold on a per barrel basis was $120.81 per barrel, an increase of 13.2% over 2006 cost of goods sold of $106.70 per barrel. After adjusting for the approximate 7% appreciation in the value of CAD against USD, cost of goods sold increased by slightly less than 7% in 37 2007 in local currency. Inflationary cost increases across nearly all inputs drove approximately 3% of the increase in cost of goods sold per barrel, but was completely offset by the implementation of synergies and other cost savings initiatives in the year. The impacts of increased import sales, lower export sales due to the Fosters contract termination and non cash adjustments in both the current and prior years of certain foreign currency positions to their market values account for the increase in cost of goods sold per barrel. Cost of goods sold increased 8.0% to $883.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, from $818.3 million in the same period for 2005 on a pro forma basis. For the same period, in local currency, cost of goods sold per barrel in Canada decreased approximately 1% as inflationary and other cost increases were completely offset by the implementation of synergies and other cost savings initiatives, lower input costs related to favorable foreign currency, and lower employee related expenses. Marketing, general and administrative expenses For the full year, marketing, general and administrative expenses were $447.6 million, an increase of $7.7 million or 1.8% from 2006. In local currency, total marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased by 4% driven by lower G&A costs through reduced intangible amortization expense and a focus on more efficient general and administrative spending, including lower employee costs and other cost savings. In addition, 2006 included certain nonrecurring costs including contract costs incurred to achieve longer term information technology synergies, and additional costs associated with the additional week in 2006 results. Promotional spending and brand investments were relatively flat in 2007 compared to the prior year. Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased $62.4 million for 2006. This was an increase of $14.5 million or 3.4% on a comparable, pro forma basis. In local currency, total marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately 3.5% due to lower promotional spending and brand investments in 2006, due in part to the initial promotional launch of Molson Kick and A Marca Bavaria in 2005, and partly to offset price discounting. These costs were partially offset by higher employee expenses and one time costs in 2006. Special items, net The Canada segment recognized $75.2 million of special items expense during 2007. The special items represent $46.5 million relating to the Edmonton brewery closure, in which significant charges included a $31.9 million impairment charge on the carrying value of the fixed assets and an additional $14.6 million charge for severance and other costs associated with closing the brewery. Current plans are to demolish the building and sell the land, which has a carrying value of $10.1 million at December 30, 2007. Other charges include $24.1 million relating to the Fosters intangible asset impairment and $4.5 million relating to employee termination costs associated with production and sales, general and administrative functions. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion. There were no special items in 2006. Special items of $5.2 million in 2005 were attributable primarily to restructuring the sales and marketing organizations in Canada. Other (expense) income, net Other income in 2007 was $8.3 million higher than the prior year largely due to a gain on the sale of our equity investment in the House of Blues Canada which resulted in an approximate $16.7 million benefit in the year. This was partially offset by the non recurrence of the approximate $9.0 million gain in 2006 from the reduction of guarantee liabilities related to our investment in the Montreal Canadiens hockey club in the prior year (see next paragraph). 38 In 2006, other income increased $15.4 million over the prior year on a pro forma basis which primarily represents equity earnings and amortization expense related to the Montr&eacute;al Canadiens hockey club ("the Club"), which improved over the prior year. During the year, the entities which control and own a majority of the Club purchased the preferred shares in the Club held by Molson. In addition, Molson was released from a direct guarantee associated with the Clubs debt financing, resulting in an approximate $9.0 million income benefit associated with the reduction in the exposure attributable to such guarantees. Other expense in 2005 represents the equity losses in the Montr&eacute;al Canadiens Hockey Club. United States Segment The United States segment produces, markets, and sells the Coors and Molson portfolios of brands in the United States and its territories and includes the results of the Rocky Mountain Metal Corporation ("RMMC") and Rocky Mountain Bottle Corporation ("RMBC") joint ventures consolidated under FIN 46R. The U.S. segment also includes Coors brand volume that is sold in Mexico and the Caribbean. Fiscal year ended December 30, 2007(1) % change December 31, 2006(1) % change December 25, 2005(1) (In thousands, except percentages) Volume in barrels(2) 24,247 3.3 % 23,471 3.6 % 22,645 Net sales $ 2,764,976 5.5 % $ 2,619,879 5.9 % $ 2,474,956 Cost of goods sold (1,715,058 ) 4.2 % (1,645,598 ) 7.9 % (1,525,060 ) Gross profit 1,049,918 7.8 % 974,281 2.6 % 949,896 Marketing, general and administrative expenses (754,738 ) 1.3 % (744,795 ) 0.7 % (739,315 ) Special items, net (9,492 ) N/M (73,652 ) N/M (68,081 ) Operating income 285,688 83.3 % 155,834 9.4 % 142,500 Other income (expense), net 148 N/M 3,238 N/M (457 ) Earnings before income taxes $ 285,836 79.7 % $ 159,072 12.0 % $ 142,043 N/M Not meaningful (1)52 weeks reflected in 2007 and 2005 versus 53 weeks included in 2006. (2)Volumes represent net sales of owned brands. Volume and net sales Sales volume to wholesalers grew 3.3% in 2007 compared to 2006, due to strong STR growth, partially offset by a difference in the timing of our fiscal calendar. Our 50 states U.S. distributors STRs increased 4.6% and we continued to grow market share throughout 2007. This sales increase was driven by mid single digit growth for Coors Light, along with mid double digit growth of Blue Moon and low double digit growth of Keystone Light. Also Coors Banquet grew at a mid single digit rate on a year over year basis, benefiting from redesigned packaging and advertising. In addition, our brand portfolio showed broad growth in 45 states out of 50 states in all major channels in 2007. This continued volume momentum was driven by building our brand equities, through our Coors Light "Rocky Mountain Cold Refreshment" positioning, as well as focused alignment with our distributor network and improving our effectiveness with chain retail accounts. 39 Net sales per barrel increased 2.2% in 2007 due to higher base pricing and reduced discounting compared to the level of price promotion activity we experienced during 2006 and 2005. Sales volume to wholesalers grew 3.6% in 2006 compared to 2005. Without the 53rd week in 2006, volume growth would have been approximately 2.2%. The growth was driven by volume increases in the Coors Light, Keystone Light and Blue Moon brands, and the addition of Molson brands sold in the United States. Net sales per barrel increased 2.1% from 2005 to 2006 as a result of favorable pricing. Cost of goods sold Cost of goods sold increased marginally to $70.73 per barrel in 2007 versus $70.11 per barrel in 2006. The net increase in cost of goods sold was driven by an increase in commodity, transportation and packaging costs, more than 60% offset by our merger synergies and other operations cost reduction initiatives. Cost of goods sold increased by 4.1% to $70.11 per barrel in 2006 from $67.35 per barrel in 2005. The increase in cost of goods sold per barrel was driven by higher freight, diesel fuel, packaging materials, and utilities costs. Inflation alone would have accounted for an increase of approximately 5% in cost of goods per barrel. However, these unfavorable factors were partially offset by favorable cost trends from supply chain cost management, labor productivity and merger synergies. Marketing, general and administrative expenses Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased by $9.9 million, or 1.3%, in 2007 versus 2006. Marketing investments decreased at a low single digit rate, while general and administrative expenses grew at a mid single digit rate due to higher employee incentive programs. Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased by $5.5 million, or 0.7%, in 2006 versus 2005. Our stock based long term incentive program primarily drove the year over year increase, along with modest increases in our advertising and sales expenses. The total increase was partially offset by reductions of certain overhead and personnel related costs. Special items, net We recognized $9.5 million of special charges in 2007 compared to $73.7 million of net special charges in 2006. In 2007, the special charges were related to employee retention costs in anticipation of the proposed MillerCoors joint venture and a newly initiated program focused on long term labor savings across the supply chain areas. Special items, net, in the U.S. segment in 2006 were associated primarily with the closure and sale of the Memphis brewery, completed in the third quarter of 2006. In 2006, we recorded approximately $60 million in accelerated depreciation on brewery assets and impairments of fixed assets, reflecting their sales value, $12.5 million for accruals of severance and other costs associated with the plant closure, and a $3.1 million increase in the estimate of costs to withdraw from a multi employer pension plan benefiting former Memphis workers. Memphis related accelerated depreciation was higher in 2006 than in 2005 due to a lower sales price for the Memphis plant than our original estimate in 2005. The 2006 special items were partially offset by the receipt of a $2.4 million cash distribution from bankruptcy proceedings of a former insurance carrier for a claim related to our environmental obligations at the Lowry Superfund site in Denver, Colorado. We recorded the cash receipt as a special benefit consistent with the classification of the charge recorded in a previous year. The estimated environmental liability associated with this site was not impacted by the proceeds received. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion. Special items in the U.S. segment in 2005 were associated primarily with the planned closure of the Memphis brewery in 2006. We recorded $33.3 million in accelerated depreciation on brewery assets, 40 $3.2 million in direct impairments of assets, $1.7 million for accruals of severance and associated benefits, and $25.0 million representing an estimate of costs to withdraw from a multi employer pension plan for Memphis workers. We recorded an additional $4.9 million of restructuring charges associated with restructuring brewery operations in Golden, Colorado. Other income (expense), net Other income was lower in 2007 versus 2006 primarily due to the recognition of a portion of a previously deferred gain on the sale of real estate. This amount was recognized in the second quarter of 2006 upon the satisfaction of certain conditions pertaining to the sale contract. Other income was higher in 2006 versus 2005 primarily due to the recognition of a portion of a previously deferred gain on the sale of real estate discussed above. Europe Segment The Europe segment consists of our production and sale of the CBL brands principally in the United Kingdom, our joint venture arrangement for the production and distribution of Grolsch in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland (consolidated under FIN 46R beginning in 2004), factored brand sales (beverage brands owned by other companies but sold and delivered to retail by us) and our joint venture arrangement with DHL for the distribution of products throughout Great Britain (Tradeteam). Our Europe segment also includes a small volume of sales in Asia and other export markets.

(2)Volumes represent net sales of owned brands, joint venture brands and exclude factored brand net sales volumes. (3)Interest income is earned on trade loans to U.K. on premise customers and is typically driven by note receivable balances outstanding from period to period. 41 Foreign currency impact on results Our Europe segment results were positively affected by an 8% year over year increase in the value of the British Pound Sterling (GBP or &pound;) against the USD in 2007. In 2006, the GBP strengthened versus the USD resulting in a 1% appreciation impact to USD earnings before income taxes. Volume and net sales Our Europe segment owned brand volumes decreased 7.1% on a reported 52 week versus 53 week basis. After excluding the 53rd week, volume decreased 5.8% due to an extended period of unusually rainy and cool weather conditions throughout the summer in 2007, and the impact of the enacted smoking bans on the U.K. on premise channel beer market in the second half of 2007. For the year ended 2006, beer volume in our on premise business, which represented approximately two thirds of our Europe volume and an even greater proportion of our margin, declined by slightly more than 2% compared to 2005. This compared to an overall industry on premise channel decline of 4.3% yielding a small market share gain for CBL. Our off premise volume for 2006 increased by approximately 2% over 2005, with Carling accounting for most of the gain. We experienced a small off premise market share decline in 2006. As in 2006, in addition to the volume trends mentioned above, in 2005 we experienced unfavorable pricing in both the on premise and the off premise channels, as well as a decrease in the sales value of factored brands. These reductions were further compounded by unfavorable channel and brand mix. Our Europe segment net revenue per barrel in local currency increased by 5% in 2007, with approximately 3% of this change related to non owned factored brands that we deliver to retail. In particular, we acquired the Camerons on premise distribution business early in the third quarter. The addition of this business will raise our Europe net sales per barrel and cost of goods per barrel several percentage points for the next year, due to a step up in our factored brand sales. U.K. owned brand net revenue per barrel in local currency increased nearly 3% in the year, due mainly to improved pricing predominantly in the on premise channel. Net sales for the Europe segment decreased 5% in 2006, while volume increased 0.6% from 2005. The 53rd week in 2006 contributed approximately 140,000 barrels of sales volume, providing the year over year increase. Net sales in local currency decreased by approximately 6.5%. The 52 week volume decline was driven by premium lagers, flavored alcohol beverages and ales. This decline was partially offset by growth of the Carling brand. CBLs overall volume increase for 2006 year drove a slight market share increase for the company versus an overall industry decline in 2005. Cost of goods sold Cost of goods sold per barrel in local currency increased by 5% in the year, with approximately 4% of this change related to factored brand sales, including Camerons. Cost of goods sold for our U.K. owned brands increased about 1% per barrel in local currency, driven by input cost inflation and the impact of spreading the fixed costs over lower sales volume, partly offset by cost savings. Cost of goods sold per barrel in local currency decreased approximately 6% in 2006 versus 2005. The change to net reporting for certain factored brand sales accounted for approximately $46 million of the decrease in the year to date cost of goods sold. The remaining decrease was driven by cost savings from our supply chain restructuring initiatives begun in 2005 and lower distribution costs, partly offset by increased energy costs. 42 Marketing, general and administrative expenses Europe marketing, general and administrative expenses in the U.K. decreased approximately 3% in local currency. Marketing spending increased 2% due to the continued roll out of our new advertising campaigns for Carling, C2, and re launching Coors Light. General and administrative costs decreased 6% compared to 2006 due to cost reduction programs. In 2006, Europe marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased 6.9%, and 7.4%, respectively on a per barrel basis versus 2005. This decrease was primarily the result of cost reduction initiatives we announced and began implementing during 2005 and rigorous cost control throughout the year. Special items, net We recognized $14.1 million and $9.0 million of special charges in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The 2007 items were predominately employee termination costs associated with the U.K. supply chain and back office restructuring efforts and an increased pension liability in recognition of our existing pension benefit in accordance with U.K. law. The 2006 items were also a result of charges recognized as part of restructuring the supply chain operation and back office organization, combined with costs incurred in closing our sales operation in Russia, partly offset by the pension curtailment gain. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion. Other (expense) income, net We incurred net other expense of $0.2 million in 2007 as compared to a net other income of $4.8 million for the prior year. The decrease noted is due to a non recurring gain recognized on a sale of a surplus property in 2006, partly offset by improved year over year profit performance by our distribution joint venture, Tradeteam. Other income of $4.8 million in 2006 represented a $19.0 million improvement over 2005, driven by improved Tradeteam profitability, our joint venture partner for the distribution of product, profits on the sale of surplus real estate, and lower non operating leasehold expenses. Interest income Interest income is earned on trade loans to U.K. on premise customers. Interest income decreased by 2.0% and 9.9% in 2007 and 2006, respectively, as a result of lower loan balances versus the prior years. Corporate Corporate includes interest and certain other general and administrative costs that are not allocated to the operating segments. The majority of these corporate costs relates to worldwide finance 43 and administrative functions, such as corporate affairs, legal, human resources, insurance, and risk management.

(2)The amounts shown are reflective of revenues and costs associated with the Companys intellectual property, including trademarks and brands. (3)Special items in 2006 and 2005 consist of change in control benefits (expenses) incurred as a consequence of the Merger. Marketing, general and administrative expenses Corporate marketing, general and administrative expenses in 2007 were $110.5 million, down $9.7 million from 2006. This decrease was largely attributed to transfers of allocable costs to the operating segments from the corporate center, lower legal fees and reduced severance fees partially offset by increased incentive pay resulting from improved operating performance over prior year. Marketing, general and administrative expenses were higher in 2006 versus 2005, primarily due to increased incentive pay, split equally between our stock based long term incentive plan, including the effect of adopting FAS123R accounting treatment for expensing equity based compensation, and higher incentive pay resulting from improved profit and cash performance. Additionally, increased costs resulted from the full ramp up of new and ongoing costs to build strong corporate center capabilities, which include Sarbanes Oxley compliance, corporate governance, finance, legal, commercial development, and human resources, and the transfer of global costs from operating segments to the Corporate center. Special items, net The $13.4 million of special items in 2007 were a result of costs incurred associated with the proposed MillerCoors joint venture, and consist primarily of outside professional services. The special benefit of $5.3 million for 2006 was a result of adjusting to the floor provided on the exercise price of stock options held by former Coors officers who left the Company under change in control agreements following the Merger. We did not recognize a charge related to the floor provided on the exercise price 44 of the stock options as the stock price exceeded the floor price in 2007. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Interest expense, net Corporate net interest expense totaled $111.3 million for 2007, $27.1 million lower than the prior year. The decrease was primarily a result of lower average net debt levels outstanding. We also recognized a $24.5 million charge as a result of the debt extinguishment costs during 2007. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Interest expense, net was $138.5 million during 2006, versus $126.6 million during 2005. Interest expense, net increased due to higher interest rates on permanent financing (as opposed to short term temporary financing in place through September 2005 following the Merger), 53rd week impact and a stronger Canadian dollar and British Pound Sterling. These increased costs were partially offset by the benefit of lower overall debt levels due to debt repayments in 2006. Other income (expense), net Other expense, net in 2007 increased from 2006 due to greater foreign currency exchange losses throughout the current year. 2006 includes primarily foreign exchange losses, while the other income, net in 2005 includes primarily foreign exchange gains. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities, external borrowings and asset monetizations. As of December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, we had working capital of $41.2 million and a working capital deficit of $341.8 million, respectively. We commonly operate at a low level of working capital or working capital deficits given the relatively quick turnover of our receivables and inventory. Our higher net working capital at December 30, 2007 was due to higher balances associated with cash, accounts receivable, inventories, and lower balances for accounts payable and other accrued expenses. We had total cash of $377.0 million at December 30, 2007, compared to $182.2 million at December 31, 2006. Long term debt was $2,260.6 million and $2,129.8 million at December 30, 2007, and December 31, 2006, respectively. Debt as of the end of 2007 consists primarily of bonds with longer term maturities. We believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by short term borrowings, when necessary, will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditures. However, our liquidity could be impacted significantly by a decrease in demand for our products, which could arise from competitive circumstances, a decline in the acceptability of alcohol beverages or any of the other factors we describe in Item 1A. "Risk Factors." Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities of $616.0 million for the 52 weeks ended December 30, 2007, was lower by $217.2 million from the 53 week period ending December 31, 2006. Net income was higher by $136.2 million in 2007 versus 2006, the reasons for which are discussed in detail in the Results of Operations discussion in this section. However, various non cash components of net income resulted in a lower amount of our expenses in 2007 versus 2006 by $135.4 million. Therefore, net income adjusted for its various non cash components was effectively flat year over year. These non cash components consisted of depreciation and amortization (lower in 2007 by $92.5 million), amortization of debt costs, share based compensation and related tax benefits, gains and losses on sales of assets, impairment losses on long lived assets, and deferred taxes. The lower operating cash flows in 2007 were therefore due primarily to cash movements associated with working capital and other assets and liabilities. Specifically, collections on accounts receivable were lower in 2007 due primarily to lower 45 collections in the U.K., where the 53 week year in 2006 resulted in an extra week of collections in that year. Cash paid for inventories was higher in 2007 as our Canada segment increased finished goods and packaging materials inventories in anticipation of an expansion of business in western Canada as a result of a new joint venture agreement with Modelo. Cash outflows associated with accrued expenses and other liabilities were greater in 2007 versus 2006 due to higher defined benefit pension contributions of $47.6 million, a one time payment to a non employer pension plan associated with our former Memphis, Tennessee, brewery of $27.6 million, and higher cash taxes of $39.2 million. Offsetting these items was lower cash paid for interest of $28.1 million. We expect that 2008 operating cash flows will be higher than those realized in 2007. However, integration efforts associated with the proposed MillerCoors joint venture could result in unanticipated costs in 2008. Our net cash provided by operating activities in 2006 was $833.2 million, an increase of $411.0 million from 2005. Net income was higher by $226.1 million in 2006 versus 2005. However, much of the improvement from 2005 to 2006 was due to a number of unfavorable items in 2005. First, cash paid for income taxes was lower by $162.7 million during 2006 versus 2005. Second, in early 2005 we made a $138.0 million Canadian tax payment triggered by the Merger, a one time liquidity event that was not repeated in 2006. Third, our pension funding in 2006 was lower by $55.1 million primarily due to a special voluntary funding to the U.S. plan in 2005. Finally, we paid out $21.0 million for Merger related costs and severance payments to officers under change in control and severance agreements of $24.0 million in 2005. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities of $439.1 million for the year ended December 30, 2007 was higher by $144.3 million compared to 2006. The primary reason for the variance between years was lower cash inflows associated with sales of assets and businesses. In 2007, these proceeds totaled approximately $38.1 million, with the largest proceeds associated with the sale of our investment in the House of Blues Canada business, which resulted in $30.0 million of proceeds. However, in 2006, we collected $145.1 million of proceeds, specifically, we collected $79.5 million from the sale of the Kaiser business in Brazil, $36.5 million from the sale of our preferred equity interests in the Montreal Canadiens hockey club, and $29.1 million from various other sales. In 2007, we spent $26.7 million to acquire an on premise distribution business in the U.K., while we had no business acquisitions in 2006, and invested $22.8 million in short term investments, versus no such investments in 2006. Partially offsetting these items in 2007 versus 2006, additions to properties and intangible assets were lower by $18.0 million due primarily to higher capital additions in 2006 associated with the build out of the Shenandoah brewery in the U.S., offset by CBLs large purchase of kegs in April 2007 of $90.0 million. Net cash used in investing activities of $294.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, was lower by $17.9 million compared to the same period in 2005. Additions to properties were higher in 2006 by $40.3 million as compared to 2005, due primarily to spending in Canada and the U.S. related to the build out of the Moncton, New Brunswick, and Elkton, Virginia, breweries. In 2006, we recognized proceeds of $83.7 million on the sale of the Kaiser business in Brazil, partially offset by $4.2 million of transaction costs. Proceeds from sales of properties and intangible assets were lower by $13.3 million year over year. 2005 proceeds included a significant collection of a note related to a 2004 sale of property in the U.K. causing proceeds to exceed 2006 levels, which included the sale of the Memphis plant in the U.S. and various real estate sales in the U.K. On June 30, 2006, as part of a general refinancing of the Montr&eacute;al Canadiens Hockey team (the Club), Molson sold its preferred equity interest in the Montr&eacute;al Canadiens hockey club to entities which control and own a majority interest in the Club. Total proceeds coincident with the transaction were CAD $41.6 million (USD $36.5 million). We retain a 19.9% common equity interest in the Club as well as board representation. 46 The transaction structure is consistent with our long term commitment to the Club and its success, and helps to ensure the Clubs long term presence in Montr&eacute;al. Financing Activities Our debt position significantly affects our financing activity. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for a summary of our debt position at December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $8.4 million in 2007, compared to net cash used of $401.2 million during 2006, a favorable variance of $409.7 million. We collected $126.2 million more in proceeds from employee exercises of stock options in 2007 versus 2006. During 2007, our primary activities involved refinancing a significant portion of our debt portfolio by issuing $575.0 million in convertible notes, while repaying $625.0 million of our previously existing senior notes. We also spent a net $49.7 million for the purchase of a note hedge and sale of warrants associated with the convertible notes and $10.2 million for costs directly associated with the convertible notes offering. During 2006, most of our activity associated with debt obligations was associated with repayments, which totaled $355.4 million. Net cash used for financing activities was $401.2 million for 2006 compared to $188.8 million of cash used in financing activities during 2005. Net repayments of debt were approximately $356.2 million for 2006, encompassing all activity in our various debt and credit facilities (including those associated with discontinued operations). Net repayments of debt during 2005 were approximately $108.9 million (including those associated with discontinued operations). The increased levels of debt repayment were due primarily to a higher level of operating cash flows generated by the business in 2006 versus 2005. Proceeds from stock option exercises in 2006 were $83.3 million exceeding 2005 exercises by $28.1 million. Proceeds in 2006 were impacted by significant exercises of stock options during the fourth quarter. Capital Resources See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, for a complete discussion and presentation of all borrowings and available sources of borrowing, including lines of credit. Additionally, as discussed in the Financing Activities section above, during the second quarter of 2007, we issued $575.0 million of senior convertible notes, with a coupon rate of interest of 2.5%. In the third quarter of 2007, we used the proceeds of the convertible notes issuance, combined with other sources of cash, to retire $625.0 million of 6.375% senior notes due 2012 and fund additional related charges as noted above. The vast majority of our remaining debt borrowings as of December 30, 2007, consist of publicly traded notes totaling $2.1 billion principal amount, with maturities ranging from 2010 to 2015. Our remaining debt other than the notes consists of various notes payable of $215.9 million at consolidated joint ventures, which mature in 2011 and 2013. We maintain two primary financing vehicles to manage short term liquidity requirements through periods of lower operating cash flow. First, we maintain a $500 million commercial paper program. As a back stop for our commercial paper program we maintain a $750 million revolving multi currency bank credit facility. There were no outstanding borrowings under either of these financing vehicles as of December 30, 2007. We expect to take a balanced approach to our alternatives in 2008 and beyond, which could include restructuring of consolidated joint venture debt obligations, modest repurchases of stock, dividend increases, pension plan funding elections, reinvesting cash into our existing businesses and preserving cash flexibility for potential strategic investments. Any repurchases of MCBC stock on the open market would require a board approved plan, which does not currently exist. 47 On February 7, 2008, we announced a tender for and repurchase of any and all principal amount of our remaining 6.375% $225 million Senior Notes due 2012, with the tender period running through February 14, 2008. The amount actually repurchased was $180.4 million. The net costs of $11.7 million related to this extinguishment of debt and termination of related interest rate swaps will be recorded in the first quarter of 2008. The debt extinguishment was funded by existing cash resources. Credit Rating As of February 15, 2008, our credit rating with Standard & Poors and Moodys with regard to our long term debt was BBB and Baa2, respectively. We had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 30, 2007. As a result of the announcement of the proposed MillerCoors joint venture, credit rating agencies in the U.S. and Canada (Moodys and DBRS) have placed MCBCs credit standing in developing status. Capital Expenditures In 2007, we spent $428.3 million (including approximately $16.3 million spent at consolidated joint ventures) on capital improvement projects worldwide. Of this, approximately 42% was in support of the European segment, with the remainder split between the U.S. (33%), Canada (22%) and Corporate (2%) segments. The capital expenditure plan for 2008 is expected to be approximately $315 million, including approximately $35 million of spending by consolidated joint ventures. Capital expenditures in 2008 are expected to be lower than 2007 primarily due to the completion of the Shenandoah brewery in the U.S. in early 2007 and the initial $90.0 million purchase of kegs in the U.K., also in early 2007.

(2)The "interest payments" line includes interest on our bonds and other borrowings outstanding at December 30, 2007, excluding the cash flow impacts of any interest rate or cross currency swaps. Current floating interest rates and currency exchange rates are assumed to be constant throughout the periods presented. The "derivative payments" line includes the floating rate payment obligations, which are paid to counterparties under our interest rate and cross currency swap agreements, &pound;530 million ($1,058 million at December 30, 2007 exchange rates) payment due the cross currency swap counterparty in 2012, CAD$1,201 million ($1,223 million at December 30, 48 2007 exchange rates) payment due the cross currency swap counterparty in 2012, and CAD $355 million ($362 million at December 30, 2007 exchange rates) payment due the cross currency swap counterparty in 2010. Current floating interest rates and currency exchange rates are assumed to be constant throughout the periods presented. We anticipate receiving a total of $2,685 million in fixed and floating rate payments from our counterparties under the swap arrangements, which offset the payments included in the table. As interest rates increase, payments to or receipts from our counterparties will also increase. Net interest payments, including swap receipts and payments over the periods are as follows (in thousands): Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years $ 1,132,409 $ 118,831 $ 288,027 $ 593,456 $ 132,095 (3)Represents expected contributions under our defined benefit pension plans in the next twelve months and our benefits payments under retiree medical plans for all periods presented. (4)Approximately $615 million of the total other long term obligations relate to long term supply contracts with third parties to purchase raw material and energy used in production, including our contract with Graphic Packaging Corporation, a related party, dated March 25, 2003. Approximately $457 million relates to commitments associated with Tradeteam in the United Kingdom. The remaining amounts relate to sales and marketing, information technology services, open purchase orders and other commitments. Not included in these contractual cash obligations are $285.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits and $124.8 million of indemnities provided to FEMSA for which we are unable to make estimates for timing of the related cash payments. Other Commercial Commitments as of December 30, 2007 Amount of commitment expiration per period Total amounts committed Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years (In thousands) Standby letters of credit $ 58,022 $ 57,392 $ 630 $ $ Advertising and Promotions As of December 31, 2007, our aggregate commitments for advertising and promotions, including marketing at sports arenas, stadiums and other venues and events, total approximately $1.1 billion over the next five years and thereafter. Our advertising and promotions commitments are included in other long term obligations in the table above. Pension Plans Our consolidated, unfunded pension position at the end of 2007 was approximately $175 million, a decrease of $184 million from the end of 2006. The funded positions of pension plans in each of the Canada, U.S. and U.K. businesses improved due to asset returns, higher interest rates (which have the effect of decreasing the discounted pension liabilities), contributions to the plans, plan changes and reductions in U.K. staffing levels. Approximately $49 million of the underfunded pension position at the end of 2007 was the responsibility of the minority owners of BRI. See discussion below regarding the adoption of SFAS No. 158 "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)." We fund pension plans to meet the minimum requirements set forth in applicable employee benefits laws. Sometimes we voluntarily increase funding levels to meet expense and asset return forecasts in any given year. Pension contributions on a consolidated basis were $203 million in 2007, reflecting statutory contribution levels in Canada and the United Kingdom, and $1.3 million of voluntary contributions in the United States. We anticipate making approximately $164 million of both statutory and voluntary contributions to our pension plans in 2008. 49  Consolidated pension expense was $21 million in 2007, a decrease of $12 million from 2006. Decreases in the U.S. and Canada of $10 million and $2 million, respectively, were attributable mainly to higher expected returns on plan assets in 2007. We anticipate pension expense on a consolidated basis for 2008 to approximate $23 million. Postretirement Benefit Plans Our consolidated, unfunded postretirement benefit position at the end of 2007 was approximately $470 million, an increase of $68 million from the end of 2006. Benefits paid under our postretirement benefit plans were approximately $25 million in 2007 and $22 million in 2006. Under our postretirement benefit plans we expect payments of approximately $30 million in 2008. See discussion below regarding the adoption of SFAS No. 158 "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)." Consolidated postretirement benefit expense was $39.3 million in 2007, an increase of $4.1 million from 2006, attributable mainly to our Canada segment plans. We anticipate postretirement benefit expense on a consolidated basis for 2008 of approximately $32 million. Contingencies In the ordinary course of business or in the course of the sale of a business, we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify third parties from any losses or guarantees incurred relating to pre existing conditions for losses or guarantees arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract, which may include, for example, litigation or claims relating to past performance. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 under the captions "Environmental," "Indemnity Obligations Sale of Kaiser" and "Montr&eacute;al Canadiens." Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 30, 2007, we did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements (as defined in Item 303(a) (4) (ii) of Regulation S K). Outlook for 2008 We will continue our quest to become a world class, brand led Company. We will promote our strategic brands by investing in the "front end" of our business our marketing and sales activities. We will do so with a complete commitment to corporate social responsibility. For 2008 and beyond, we will remain focused on building brands and reducing costs in each of our segments to provide additional resources for growth. The results are encouraging: In the U.S., we have strong volume and market share momentum with our four largest brands. Our strategic brands in Canada are building volume momentum and taking share. We are maintaining pricing in Europe and helping our retail customers work through the smoking bans. In all three of our segments, the strength of our brands is supporting positive pricing, and cost reductions are providing resources to offset inflation and grow our businesses. To continue our brand building progress: In Canada, we plan to build on the 2007 share momentum in our strategic brand portfolio and invest in programming with the introduction of strategic SKUs and innovation. We will build on 50 the momentum of Coors Light, including leveraging the successful launch of the "Cold Certified" can and will introduce new advertising for all of the Molson brands. Our Canada segment will continue to build our super premium owned and partner import brands through new programming and unique SKUs, leveraging the double digit growth of these brands in 2007. Effective January 1, 2008, our Canada team established a long term joint venture with Grupo Modelo to import, distribute and market the Modelo beer portfolio across Canada. The joint venture builds on the previous successful relationship we had with Modelo, as we now pick up these Super Premium brands for our portfolio in the Western provinces. The new form of our business relationship will result in our accounting for our share of the Modelo brands business in Canada under the equity method. In the U.S., our focus for 2008 is to maintain our strong volume and share momentum, while continuing to aggressively manage costs. Coors Light, Keystone and Blue Moon will remain our primary focus in 2008, along with maintaining our volume and share momentum behind Coors Banquet. We will also have initiatives to improve the trends for Killians and Molson Canandian. In 2008, we will continue to drive sales by growing our marketing and sales spending at a mid single digit rate, building our key retail account business, and furthering our alignment with our distributor network. Our U.S. segment will continue to take a disciplined approach to both front line pricing and discounting, while building our core brand equities around "Rocky Mountain Cold Refreshment" to drive sustainable and profitable growth. In Europe, in addition to strong marketing investment behind Carling, we will continue to support the re launch of Coors Light. We have recently secured distribution for Coors Light in JD Wetherspoon, a major on premise customer and a particularly attractive venue for building brand loyalty among our core consumers. In Europe, we will continue to roll out our new cold dispense technology and distinctive above bar fonts, which support our whole portfolio via "cold" positioning and modern brand representation. We completed 46,000 installations in 2007 and plan to install an additional 40,000 in 2008. In Europe, we expect that our new Carling distribution contract with Marstons, a major on premise customer, will drive market share in the important on premise channel. The contract began in the third quarter of 2007. There are a few additional considerations regarding sales volume in 2008: With the termination of our Fosters U.S. production contract in the fourth quarter of 2007, we expect Canada sales volume to be lower in the first three quarters of 2008 compared to 2007. The loss of this contract will result in lower reported sales volume, but will have no impact on our STRs. The Fosters termination will continue to increase net sales per barrel and cost of goods sold per barrel over the next three quarters due to fixed costs on lower production volumes. Based on the particularly strong volume momentum of our largest brands in the past several months, we expect our U.S. distributors to build their inventories to a higher level in the first quarter this year as they prepare for peak season. This will benefit our U.S. volume and financial results in the first quarter versus last year. Regarding costs, our management teams continue to exceed their goals for reducing costs in each segment. The current inflationary environment presents a significant challenge coupled with the seasonally small profit fourth quarter, which will compound the margin impact of inflation. 51 In Canada, we anticipate that our reported cost of goods per barrel will increase at a mid single digit rate in local currency for the full year 2008. Excluding mix impacts from increased partner import volume and lower contract brewing volume, we expect cost of goods sold per barrel to increase at a low single digit rate. In the U.S., we currently expect our 2008 cost of goods per barrel to increase at a low single digit rate. We are confident that we will meet or exceed our cost reduction goals this year via the Resources for Growth program, which continues to be a top priority because we anticipate cost challenges again in 2008 in two main areas: First, based on the current outlook for commodities and other inputs, we expect transportation and fuel costs to increase significantly in 2008, along with moderate increases in packaging materials. Second, we will have higher contract packaging fees and a full year of Shenandoah brewery depreciation expense in 2008. Our Europe team will continue to reduce costs to offset input inflation and to provide resources for our brand marketing investments. Additional cost reduction initiatives are being sought, with initiatives already underway in the supply chain and other business areas. We announced late in 2007 that we have entered into an agreement with Scottish & Newcastle to contract brew and keg selected Scottish & Newcastle lager brands. Brewing will begin around the middle of 2008 and reach full production in 2010, when we will be producing up to 2.6 million barrels (3 million hectolitres) of lager for Scottish & Newcastle annually. This will generate additional income and fixed cost leverage in our U.K. brewing footprint. Based on improved longevity projections of our retirees in the U.K., we do not expect to benefit from U.K. pension income in 2008, a departure from the past two years. MillerCoors joint venture On October 9, 2007, MCBC and SABMiller plc (the investing companies) announced that they signed a letter of intent to combine the U.S. and Puerto Rico operations of their respective subsidiaries, CBC and Miller Brewing Company, in a joint venture ("MillerCoors"). Assuming completion of the transaction, MillerCoors will have annual pro forma combined beer sales of 69 million U.S. barrels (81 million hectoliters) and net revenues of approximately $6.6 billion. MCBC and SABMiller expect the transaction to generate approximately $500 million in annual cost synergies to be delivered in full by the third full financial year of combined operations. The parties signed a definitive joint venture agreement on December 20, 2007 and expect the transaction to close in mid 2008. Additional information regarding the rationale for the transaction is provided in Item 1, Business, under the caption "Joint Ventures and Other Arrangements." Each party will contribute its business and related operating assets and certain liabilities into an operating joint venture company. The percentage interests in the profits of the joint venture will be 58% for SABMiller plc and 42% for MCBC. Voting interests will be shared 50% 50%, and each investing company will have equal board representation within the joint venture company. Each party to the joint venture has agreed not to transfer its economic or voting interests in the joint venture for a period of five years, and certain rights of first refusal will apply to any subsequent assignment of such interests. The results and financial position of our U.S. segment will, in all material respects, be de consolidated upon contribution to the joint venture. We will report our interest in the new combined operations using the equity method of accounting. 52 The proposed joint venture transaction has been submitted for antitrust review and clearance by the U.S. Department of Justice under the Hart Scott Rodino Act of 1976, as amended, and to certain other applicable governmental authorities. Corporate We forecast full year 2008 corporate general and administrative expense of approximately $110 million, plus or minus $5 million. Approximately, one fifth of this expense is related to our Resources for Growth cost reduction program. Goodwill Because there is goodwill included in the carrying value of our three segments, the fair value of the applicable reporting unit was compared to its carrying value during the third quarter of 2007 to determine whether there was any goodwill impairment. Most of the goodwill associated with the U.S. and Canada segments originated in the Merger. Similarly, we tested indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment during the third quarter of 2007, most of which relate to our Canada and Europe segments. A portion of the Merger goodwill was allocated to the U.S. segment, based on the level of Merger synergy savings expected to accrue to the U.S. segment over time. Our testing during the third quarter of 2007 indicated that the fair values of the reporting units in the U.S. and Canada exceeded their carrying values, resulting in no impairments of goodwill in 2007. However, a reduction in the fair value of the U.S. or Canada segment in the future could lead to goodwill impairment. We also have significant indefinite lived intangible assets in Canada, associated primarily with core, non core, and partner beer brands, as well as distribution rights. These intangible assets were also evaluated for impairment during the third quarter of 2007, and we determined that their fair values exceeded their carrying values. A reduction in the fair values of these intangibles could lead to impairment charges in the future. Reductions in fair value could occur for a number of reasons, including cost increases due to inflation, an unfavorable beer pricing environment, declines in industry or company specific beer volume sales, termination of brewing and or distribution agreements with other brewers. The goodwill associated with the Europe segment originated in the 2002 purchase of the CBL business by Coors. Our testing during the third quarter of 2007 indicated that the fair value of the CBL reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, resulting in no impairments of goodwill. However, a slight reduction in the fair value of the CBL reporting unit in the future could lead to goodwill impairment. We also have a significant indefinite lived intangible asset in Europe, associated with the Carling brand, which was also tested in the third quarter of 2007, and no impairment was warranted. Future reductions in the fair value of the Europe business or of specific intangibles could occur for a number of reasons, including cost increases due to inflation, an unfavorable beer pricing environment, and declines in industry or company specific beer volume sales, which could result in possible impairment of these assets. Interest We anticipate 2008 corporate net interest expense of approximately $95 million to $100 million, excluding the debt extinguishment costs and U.K. trade loan interest income. This $13 million reduction from 2007 is attributable to the debt repayments and debt restructurings we have undertaken in the past year to strengthen our financial foundation, partially offset by the interest cost as a result of the stronger CAD. 53 Tax Our tax rate is volatile and may move up or down with changes in, among other things, the amount and source of income or loss, our ability to utilize foreign tax credits, changes in tax laws, and the movement of liabilities established pursuant to FIN 48 for uncertain tax positions as statute of limitations expire or positions are otherwise effectively settled. During 2008, the Company expects to recognize a $50 to $60 million income tax benefit due to a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits. This income tax benefit is primarily due to penalties and interest associated with issues subject to audits that we believe are going to close in the next year. As a result, we anticipate that our 2008 effective tax rate on income will be in the range of 10% to 15%. We note, however, that there are other pending tax law changes in Canada that if enacted, would result in an approximate $120 million decrease to the unrecognized tax benefits. This one time, non cash income tax benefit would be recognized in the quarter in which the bill is enacted. In addition, there are other pending law changes in the U.S., U.K., and Canada that if enacted, could have an impact on our effective tax rate. Other During the first quarter of 2008, we signed a contract with a third party service provider to outsource a significant portion of our general and administrative back office functions in all of our operating segments and in our corporate office. This outsourcing initiative is a key component of our Resources for Growth cost reduction program. We expect to incur both transition costs and one time employee termination costs associated during 2008 with this outsourcing initiative. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. We review our accounting policies on an on going basis. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. By their nature, estimates are subject to uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have identified the accounting estimates below as critical to our financial condition and results of operations. Pension and Postretirement Benefits We have defined benefit plans that cover the majority of our employees in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. We also have postretirement welfare plans in Canada and the United States that provide medical benefits for retirees and eligible dependents and life insurance for certain retirees. The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions" ("SFAS 87") and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions" ("SFAS 106") and SFAS No. 158 "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R).". These statements require that management make certain assumptions relating to the long term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates used to measure future obligations and expenses, salary increases, inflation, health care cost trend rates and other assumptions. We believe that the accounting estimates related to our pension and postretirement plans are critical accounting estimates because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period based on market conditions. 54 At the end of each fiscal year, we perform an analysis of high quality corporate bonds and compare the results to appropriate indices and industry trends to support the discount rates used in determining our pension liabilities in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets are selected at the end of a given fiscal year and impact expense in the subsequent year. A 50 basis point change in certain assumptions made at the beginning of 2007 would have had the following effects on 2007 pension expense: Impact to 2007 pension costs 50 basis points (unfavorable) favorable Reduction Increase (In millions) Description of pension sensitivity item Expected return on Canada salary plan assets, 5.00% in 2007 $ (1.6 ) $ 1.6 Expected return on Canada hourly plan assets, 7.90% in 2007 $ (3.8 ) $ 3.8 Expected return on Canada BRI plan assets, 7.50% in 2007 $ (2.8 ) $ 2.8 Expected return on U.S. plan assets, 8.75% in 2007 $ (4.0 ) $ 4.0 Expected return on U.K. plan assets, 7.80% in 2007 $ (10.4 ) $ 10.4 Discount rate on Canada salary projected benefit obligation, 5.00% in 2007 $ 0.6 $ (0.5 ) Discount rate on Canada hourly projected benefit obligation, 5.00% in 2007 $ (1.0 ) $ 0.4 Discount rate on Canada BRI projected benefit obligation, 5.00% in 2007 $ (1.7 ) $ 1.2 Discount rate on U.S. projected benefit obligation, 6.10% in 2007 $ (4.4 ) $ 5.0 Discount rate on U.K. projected benefit obligation, 5.10% in 2007 $ (15.6 ) $ 5.2 Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the retiree health care plan. A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects: 1% point increase (unfavorable) 1% point decrease favorable (In millions) Canada plans (Molson) Effect on total of service and interest cost components $ (1.8 ) $ 2.0 Effect on postretirement benefit obligation $ (19.9 ) $ 21.9 Canada plans (BRI) Effect on total of service and interest cost components $ (1.0 ) $ 1.3 Effect on postretirement benefit obligation $ (9.9 ) $ 11.8 U.S. plan Effect on total of service and interest cost components $ (0.7 ) $ 0.8 Effect on postretirement benefit obligation $ (8.1 ) $ 9.0 Equity assets are well diversified between domestic and other international investments, with additional diversification in the domestic category through allocations to large cap, small cap and growth and value investments. Relative allocations reflect the demographics of the respective plan 55 participants. The following compares target asset allocation percentages with actual asset allocations at December 30, 2007: Canada plans assets U.S. plan assets U.K. plan assets Target allocations Actual allocations Target allocations Actual allocations Target allocations Actual allocations Equities 53 % 51 % 46 % 43 % 53 % 53 % Fixed income 47 % 49 % 45 % 48 % 40 % 40 % Real estate 9 % 9 % 7 % 7 % Contingencies, Environmental and Litigation Reserves We estimate the range of liability related to environmental matters or other legal actions where the amount and range of loss can be estimated. We record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to any pending matter and revise our estimates. Costs that extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of Company owned assets or are incurred to mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination may be capitalized. Other environmental costs are expensed when incurred. We also expense legal costs as incurred. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a discussion of our contingencies, environmental and litigation reserves at December 30, 2007. In 2006, we sold our interest in the Kaiser business. While we reduced our risk profile as a result of this transaction, we retained risk by providing indemnities to the buyer for certain purchased tax credits and for other tax, labor and civil contingencies in general. These are referenced in the section called "Contingencies" above and discussed in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. We account for these indemnity obligations at fair value in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 45 ("FIN 45"), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. We do not amortize these liabilities, but rather make periodic estimates of their fair values, and record changes in these values through discontinued operations on the statement of operations. We use multiple probability weighted scenarios in determining the fair values of indemnity liabilities. As discussed in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, we have recorded a fair value liability of $116.7 million related to contingencies associated with purchased tax credits based on a total exposure of $382.0 million with regard to those liabilities. Our estimates assume an 80% likelihood that the claims will progress through judicial processes, and assume equally likely scenarios (i.e., 40% 40%) of 1) no payments ever occurring and 2) payments of the full exposure in future years with potential refunds in years following the initial payment. If our estimate were adjusted to assume a full 80% probability of some payment occurring (rather than 40%), the value of the liability would increase by $67.2 million to $183.9 million. Goodwill and Other Intangible Asset Valuation We evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually, and we evaluate our other intangible assets for impairment when there is evidence that certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. We completed the evaluations of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets during the third quarter of 2007. With regard to goodwill, the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values, allowing us to conclude that no impairments of goodwill have occurred. With regard to our indefinite lived intangible assets, the fair values of the assets also exceeded their carrying values. Significant judgments and assumptions were required in the evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. 56 We use a combination of discounted cash flows analyses and evaluations of values derived from market comparable transactions and market earnings multiples to determine the fair value of reporting units. Our cash flow projections are based on various long range financial and operational plans of the Company and considered, when necessary, various scenarios, both favorable and unfavorable. In 2007, discount rates used for fair value estimates for reporting units was 9.0%. These rates are driven by, among other factors, the prevailing interest rates in geographies where these businesses operate as well as the credit ratings and financing abilities and opportunities of each reporting unit. Discount rates used for testing of indefinite lived intangibles ranged from 8.5% to 10.0%. These rates largely reflect the rates for the overall enterprise valuations, with some level of premium associated with the specificity of the intangibles themselves. Our reporting units operate in relatively mature beer markets, where we are reliant on a major brand for a high percentage of sales. Changes in the factors used in the estimates, including the discount rates used, could have a significant impact on the fair values of the reporting units and, consequently, may result in goodwill impairment charges in the future. Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments The following tables present a roll forward of the fair values of debt and derivative contracts outstanding as well as their maturity dates and how those fair values were obtained (in thousands): Fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2006 $ (2,381,833 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (13,665 ) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period (844,322 ) Other changes in fair value 400,085 Fair value of contracts outstanding at December 30, 2007 $ (2,839,735 ) Fair value of contracts at December 30, 2007 Maturities less than 1 year Maturities 1 3 years Maturities 4 5 years Maturities in excess of 5 years Total fair value Source of fair value Prices actively quoted $ $ (301,872 ) $ (236,180 ) $ (1,586,773 ) $ (2,124,825 ) Prices provided by other external sources $ (23,835 ) $ (280,133 ) $ (410,942 ) $ $ (714,910 ) We use derivatives in the normal course of business to manage our exposure to fluctuations in production and packaging material prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. By policy, we do not enter into such contracts for trading or speculative purposes. We record our derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as assets or liabilities at fair value in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended and interpreted, incorporating FASB Statements No. 137, 138 and 149" ("SFAS 133"). Such accounting is complex, as evidenced by significant interpretations of the primary accounting standard, which continues to evolve, as well as the significant judgments and estimates involved in the estimation of fair value in the absence of quoted market values. These estimates are based upon valuation methodologies deemed appropriate in the circumstances; however, the use of different assumptions could have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. Our market sensitive derivative and other financial instruments, as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), are foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swaps, interest rate swaps, and cross currency swaps. See discussions also in Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. We monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using two techniques, value at risk and sensitivity analysis. 57 We use value at risk to monitor the foreign exchange and interest rate risk of our cross currency swaps. The value at risk methodology provides an estimate of the level of a one day loss that may be equaled or exceeded due to changes in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate and interest rate sensitive financial instruments. The type of value at risk model used to estimate the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value is a variance/covariance method. The value at risk model assumes normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used to compute value at risk. The computations used to derive our values take into account various correlations between currency rates and interest rates. The correlations have been determined by observing foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the most recent one year period. We have excluded anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies from the value at risk calculation, some of which these instruments are intended to hedge. Value at risk is a statistical measure of risk that estimates the loss that may be experienced with a given level of confidence over a given period of time. Specifically, as reported herein, value at risk is the maximum expected one day loss at 95% confidence, that is, only 5% of the time or 1 day in 20 is the loss expected to exceed the value at risk. Value at risk is not intended to represent actual losses that may occur, nor does it represent the full extent of losses that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated by value at risk because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments, hedge percentages, timing and other factors. The one day value at risk at 95% confidence of our cross currency swaps was $22.7 million, $10.6 million and $12.2 million at December 30, 2007, December 31, 2006, and December 25, 2005, respectively. Such a hypothetical loss in fair value is a combination of the foreign exchange and interest rate components of the cross currency swap. Value changes due to the foreign exchange component would be offset completely by increases in the value of our inter company loan, the underlying transaction being hedged. The hypothetical loss in fair value attributable to the interest rate component would be deferred until termination or maturity. We have performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk of interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and commodity prices. The sensitivity analysis reflects the impact of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the applicable market interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. The volatility of the applicable rates and prices are dependent on many factors that cannot be forecast with reliable accuracy. Therefore, actual changes in fair values could differ significantly from the results presented in the table below. The following table presents the results of the sensitivity analysis, which reflects the impact of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the applicable market interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and commodity prices of our derivative and debt portfolio: As of December 30, 2007 December 31, 2006 (In thousands) Estimated fair value volatility Foreign currency risk: Forwards $ (45,476 ) $ (21,278 ) Interest rate risk: Debt, swaps $ (95,018 ) $ (64,720 ) Commodity price risk: Swaps $ (19,121 ) $ (6,165 ) 58 Income Tax Assumptions We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS 109"). Judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our global business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, our income tax provision is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by many different tax authorities. We adjust our income tax provision in the period it is probable that actual results will differ from our estimates. Tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted. We have elected to treat our portion of all foreign subsidiary earnings through December 30, 2007 as permanently reinvested under the accounting guidance of APB 23 and SFAS 109. As of December 30, 2007, approximately $1.1 billion of retained earnings attributable to foreign subsidiaries was considered to be indefinitely invested. Our intention is to reinvest the indefinitely invested earnings permanently or to repatriate the earnings when it is tax effective to do so. It is not practicable to determine the amount of incremental taxes that might arise were these earnings to be remitted. However, we believe that U.S. foreign tax credits would largely eliminate any U.S. taxes and offset any foreign withholding taxes due upon remittance. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period a determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Reductions to the valuation allowance related to the Merger with Molson or the acquisition of CBL that relate to deferred taxes arising from those events would reduce goodwill, unless the reduction was caused by a change in law, in which case the adjustment would impact earnings. Consolidations under FIN 46R RMMC and RMBC are dedicated predominantly to our packaging and distribution activities and were formed with companies which have core competencies in the aluminum and glass container businesses. The CBL joint venture with Grolsch was formed to provide a long term relationship with that brands owner in a key segment of the U.K. beer market. We also consolidate the financial position and results of Brewers Retail, Inc. ("BRI"), of which Molson owns just over 50%, and provides all distribution and retail sales of beer in the province of Ontario in Canada. Our ownership of BRI is determined by our market share in the province of Ontario. Our market share and ownership percentage could be reduced as a result of lower trade or consolidation of certain of our competitors. Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements FASB Interpretation No. 48 "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" On January 1, 2007, we adopted the FASBs Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" ("FIN 48"). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements. FIN 48 prescribes a two step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. However, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon examination. If the tax position is deemed "more likely than not" to be sustained, the tax position is then valued to 59 determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, we increased tax related liabilities by a total of $132.1 million and recorded $3.9 million as a current liability for unrecognized tax benefits and $128.2 million as a non current liability for unrecognized tax benefits. The cumulative effect of applying the new requirement has been recorded as a reduction to the beginning balance of retained earnings in the amount of $105.4 million, an increase to goodwill in the amount of $2.3 million and an increase to deferred tax assets of $24.4 million. The adjustment to goodwill reflects changes to liabilities for uncertain tax positions established in the opening balance sheet of the acquisition of CBL in 2002 and the Merger in 2005. As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, as of January 1, 2007, we had $297.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which approximately $257 million would, if recognized, affect our effective tax rate. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Approximately $78 million of anticipated interest and penalty payments were accrued at January 1, 2007, in unrecognized tax benefits. SFAS No. 158 "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)" SFAS 158 was issued in September 2006 and was effective for our annual fiscal year ending December 31, 2006. The standard, which is an amendment to SFAS 87, 88, 106 and 132R, requires an employer to recognize the funded status of any defined benefit pension and or other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position. Funded status is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the market value of plan assets for defined benefit pension plans, and is the difference between the accumulated benefit obligation and the market value of plan assets (if any) for other post retirement benefit plans. SFAS 158 also requires an employer to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through other comprehensive income. As a result of the adoption of SFAS 158, liabilities related to our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans increased by $245.0 million and our accumulated other comprehensive income, net of related deferred income taxes, decreased by approximately $172 million as of December 31, 2006. A portion of the change in the accumulated other comprehensive income related to the adoption of SFAS 158 will be recognized in the statement of operations as a component of net periodic pension benefit cost. See Notes 1, 16 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a detailed discussion regarding the adoption of SFAS 158. SFAS No. 123R "Share Based Payment" Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123R ("SFAS 123R") was issued in December 2004 and became effective for us in the first quarter of 2006. SFAS 123R requires all share based payments to qualified individuals, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized as compensation in the financial statements based on their grant date fair values. Prior to the adoption, under the guidance for qualifying stock option grants with no intrinsic value on the date of grant, we presented pro forma share based compensation expense for our stock option program in the notes to our financial statements. We have elected to use the modified prospective application method of implementing SFAS 123R, which does not require restatement of prior periods. Under the modified prospective application method, awards that are granted, modified, or settled after adoption of SFAS 123R are prospectively measured and accounted for in accordance with SFAS 123R. Unvested equity classified awards that were granted prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R will continue to be accounted for in accordance with SFAS 123, except that the fair value amounts are recognized in the statement of operations and are subject to the forfeiture provisions of SFAS 123R. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 ("SAB 107") to assist preparers by simplifying some of the implementation challenges of SFAS 123R. In particular, SAB 107 provides supplemental 60 implementation guidance on SFAS 123R, including guidance on valuation methods, classification of compensation expense, inventory capitalization of share based compensation cost, income tax effects, disclosures in Managements Discussion and Analysis and several other issues. We applied the principles of SAB 107 in conjunction with our adoption of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of 2006. SFAS 123R requires a calculation of the APIC Pool balance consisting of excess tax benefits available to absorb related share based compensation. FASB Staff Position FAS 123R 3, Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share Based Payment Awards ("FSP 123R 3"), which was issued on November 10, 2005, provides a practical transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards to employees. Specifically, this FSP allows a company to elect the alternative or simplified method to calculate the opening APIC Pool balance. We have adopted such alternative method provisions to calculate the beginning balance of the APIC Pool in the financial statements ended December 31, 2006. This adoption did not have any impact on our financial statements. The effect of adoption of SFAS 123R in 2006 was an additional expense of $6.1 million pretax, $4.4 million after tax, or $0.02 per diluted share. Since adoption of SFAS 123R we have evaluated different types of instruments as share based awards and we currently use a combination of restricted stock unit awards, performance share awards, deferred stock awards, and stock settled stock appreciation rights. FASB Interpretation No. 47 "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143" In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47 "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143" ("FIN 47"), which clarifies the term "conditional asset retirement obligation" as used in SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS 143"). Specifically, FIN 47 provides that an asset retirement obligation is conditional when either the timing and (or) method of settling the obligation is conditioned on a future event. Accordingly, an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair market value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Uncertainty about the timing and (or) method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists. We adopted FIN 47 on December 25, 2005, which resulted in an increase to properties of $0.5 million, goodwill of $2.2 million, minority interest of $1.1 million, and liabilities of $9.6 million related to asset retirement obligations. For asset retirement obligations related to the properties acquired in the acquisition of Molson Inc. as of February 9, 2005, such obligations increased the goodwill amounts recognized upon the acquisition by $2.2 million as such properties were recorded at the appraised fair market value at the acquisition date. These asset retirement obligations relate primarily to clean up, removal, or replacement activities and related costs for asbestos, coolants, waste water, oils and other contaminants that may be contained within our manufacturing properties. The adoption of FIN 47 was reflected in our financial statements as the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle with the catch up adjustment of $3.7 million, net of tax benefit of $2.2 million, in the 2005 statement of operations. This adjustment represents a depreciation charge and an accretion of a liability from the time the obligation originated, which is either from the time of the acquisition or the construction of related long lived assets, through December 25, 2005. Inherent in the fair value calculation of asset retirement obligations are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the fair value of the existing asset retirement obligation liability, a corresponding adjustment will be made to the asset balance. If the obligation is 61 settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability, we will recognize a gain or loss upon the settlement. The net value of the asset retirement obligation liabilities calculated on a pro forma basis as if the standard had been retrospectively applied to December 25, 2005 was $9.6 million. New Accounting Pronouncements SFAS No. 157 "Fair Value Measurements" In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements," (SFAS 157) which, in part, is effective for us beginning in fiscal year 2008. This statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands the related disclosure requirements. The statement indicates, among other things, that a fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. Subsequent to the issuance of SFAS 157, the FASB issued FASB Staff Positions (FSP) 157 1, "Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB Statement No. 13 and Other Accounting Pronouncements That Address Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease Classification or Measurement under Statement 13" and FSP 157 2 "Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157." FSP 157 1 excludes, in certain circumstances, SFAS 13 and other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements for purposes of lease classification or measurement under Statement 13 from the provision of SFAS 157. FSP 157 2 delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. For the instruments subject to the effective day delay under FSP 157 2, the effective day to adopt the fair value provisions for us will be the first quarter of 2009. While FSP 157 c has not been finalized or approved, it clarifies the principles in SFAS 157 on the fair value measurement of liabilities. Based upon our evaluation of the statements and subsequent pronouncements issued to date, we believe that the adoption of the statement for financial assets and liabilities routinely measured and recorded or disclosed at their fair values, will not have a significant impact on the determination or reporting of our financial results. The company is currently evaluating the impacts, if any, the adoption of the provisions of Statement No. 157 for non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed on a non recurring basis. SFAS No. 159 "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115" In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159 ("SFAS 159"). SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. The objective of this Statement is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities using different measurement techniques. The fair value measurement provisions are elective and can be applied to individual financial instruments. SFAS 159 requires additional disclosures related to the fair value measurements included in the entitys financial statements. This Statement is effective for us as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year. We do not intend to adopt the fair value measurement provisions of SFAS 159. SFAS No. 141R "Business Combinations" In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), "Business Combinations" (SFAS 141R), which replaces SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations." Under the provisions of SFAS 141R, acquisition costs will generally be expensed as incurred; noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date; in process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset at the acquisition date; restructuring costs associated with a business combination will generally be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date; and changes 62 in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense. SFAS 141(R) will be effective, on a prospective basis, for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is after the beginning of our fiscal year 2009, with the exception of the accounting for valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies for which the adoption is retrospective. We are currently evaluating the effects, if any, that SFAS 141R may have on our financial statements. SFAS No. 160 "Noncontrolling interests in Consolidated Financial Statements" In December 2007, the FASB issued Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51" (SFAS 160) and is effective for us beginning in fiscal year 2008. This Statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest, or minority interest, as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parents equity. The amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement. It also amends certain of ARB No. 51s consolidation procedures for consistency with the requirements of SFAS 141(R). This statement also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest. We are currently evaluating this new statement and anticipate that the statement will not have a significant impact on the reporting of our results of operations. Proposed Accounting Pronouncements Proposed FASB Staff Position APB 14 a, "Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)" The FASB in August 2007 proposed FASB staff position (FSP) APB 14 a, "Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)" ("FSP APB 14 a"). The proposed FSP specifies that issuers of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entitys nonconvertible debt borrowing rate on the instruments issuance date when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods. Our 2007 2.5% Convertible Senior Notes due July 30, 2013 are within the scope of the proposed FSP APB 14 a; therefore if the FSP APB 14 a is issued as proposed, we would be required to record the debt portions of our 2.5% Convertible Senior Notes at their fair value on the date of issuance and amortize the discount into interest expense over the life of the debt. However, there would be no effect on our cash interest payments. If the FSP is issued as proposed, we expect the increase in non cash interest expense recognized on our consolidated financial statements to be significant. As currently proposed, FSP APB 14 a would be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. FSP APB 14 a is currently in redeliberations with the FASB following the end of its comment period in October 2007. The final content and effective date of FSP APB 14 a are dependent upon future FASB action on this matter. Related Party Transactions Transactions with Management and Others We employed members of the Coors and Molson families, who collectively owned 84% of the voting A share, common and exchangeable stock of the Company throughout 2007. Hiring and placement decisions are made based upon merit, and compensation packages offered are commensurate with policies in place for all employees of the Company. As of December 30, 2007, various Coors family trusts collectively owned approximately 42% of our Class A common and exchangeable stock, approximately 13% of our Class B common and exchangeable stock, and approximately 30% of Graphic Packaging Corporations ("GPC") common stock. 63  Certain Business Relationships We purchase a large portion of our paperboard packaging requirements from GPC, a related party. Our payments under the GPC packaging agreement in 2007, 2006 and 2005 totaled $85.7 million, $74.0 million and $75.3 million, respectively. Related accounts payable balances included in Affiliates Accounts Payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $0.1 million and $0.8 million at December 30, 2007, and December 31, 2006, respectively. We obtain public relations services from National Public Relations, Inc., a related party. Our payments as a result of the services provided in 2007, 2006 and 2005 totaled $0.5 million, $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currencies, and the prices of production and packaging materials. We have established policies and procedures to govern the strategic management of these exposures through a variety of financial instruments. By policy, we do not enter into any contracts for the purpose of trading or speculation. Our objective in managing our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and production and packaging materials prices is to decrease the volatility of our earnings and cash flows affected by potential changes in underlying rates and prices. To achieve this objective, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swaps, interest rate swaps, and cross currency swaps, the values of which change in the opposite direction of the anticipated cash flows. We do not hedge the value of net investments in foreign currency denominated operations or translated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Our primary foreign currency exposures are Canadian dollar ("CAD"), British pound sterling ("GBP" or "&pound;"). Derivatives are either exchange traded instruments or over the counter agreements entered into with highly rated financial institutions. No losses on over the counter agreements due to counterparty credit issues are anticipated. All over the counter agreements are entered into with counterparties rated no lower than A (Standard & Poors) or A2 (Moodys). In some instances our counterparties and we have reciprocal collateralization agreements regarding fair value positions in excess of certain thresholds. These agreements call for the posting of collateral in the form of cash, treasury securities or letters of credit if a fair value loss position to our counterparties or us exceeds a certain amount. At December 30, 2007, no collateral was posted by our counterparties or us. Details of all other market sensitive derivative and other financial instruments, including their fair values, are included in the table below. These instruments include long term fixed rate debt, foreign 64 currency forwards, commodity swaps, interest rate swaps, and cross currency swaps. See related value at risk and sensitivity analysis in the Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments section of Item 7.

The bond forward transaction effectively established, in advance, the yield of the government of Canada bond rates over which the Companys private placement was priced. At the time of the private placement offering and pricing, the government of Canada bond rates was trading at a yield lower than that locked in with the Companys interest rate lock. This resulted in a loss of $4.0 million on the bond forward transaction. Per FAS 133 accounting, the loss will be amortized over the life of the Canadian issued private placement and will serve to increase the Companys effective cost of borrowing by 4.9 basis points compared to the stated coupon on the issue. Simultaneously with the U.S. private placement we entered into a cross currency swap transaction for the entire USD $300.0 million issue amount and for the same maturity. In this transaction we exchanged our $300.0 million for a CAD $355.5 million obligation with a third party. The terms of the transaction are such that the Company will pay interest at a rate of 4.28% to the third party on the amount of CAD $355.5 million and will receive interest at a rate of 4.85% on the $300.0 million amount. There was an exchange of principal at the inception of this transaction and there will be a subsequent exchange of principal at the termination of the transaction. We have designated this transaction as a hedge of the variability of the cash flows associated with the payment of interest and principal on the USD securities. Consistent with FAS 133 accounting, all changes in the value of the transaction due to foreign exchange will be recorded through the statement of operations and will be offset by a revaluation of the associated debt instrument. Changes in the value of the transaction due to interest rates will be recorded to other comprehensive income. (2)The BRI joint venture is a party to interest rate swaps, converting CAD $100.0 million notional amount from fixed rates to floating rates and mature in 2011. There was no exchange of principal at the inception of the swaps. These interest rate swaps qualify for hedge accounting treatment. (3)We are a party to certain cross currency swaps totaling GBP &pound;530.0 million (approximately USD $774 million at prevailing foreign currency exchange rates in 2002, the year we entered into the swaps). The swaps included an initial exchange of principal in 2002 and will require final principal exchange on the settlement date of our 63/8% notes due in 2012 (see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8). The swaps also call for an exchange of fixed GBP interest payments for fixed USD interest receipts. At the initial principal exchange, we paid USD to a counterparty and received 65 GBP. Upon final exchange, we will provide GBP to the counterparty and receive USD. The cross currency swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges. (4)We are a party to interest rate swap agreements related to our 63/8% fixed rate debt. The interest rate swaps convert $201.2 million notional amount from fixed rates to floating rates and mature in 2012. We will receive fixed USD interest payments semi annually at a rate of 63/8% per annum and pay a rate to our counterparty based on a credit spread plus the three month LIBOR rate, thereby exchanging a fixed interest obligation for a floating rate obligation. There was no exchange of principal at the inception of the swaps. We designated the interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of the changes in the fair value of $201.2 million fixed rate debt attributable to changes in the LIBOR swap rates. See accounting method discussion in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. (5)On June 15, 2007, MCBC issued $575 million of 2.5% Convertible Senior Notes in a public offering discussed further in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 66
